                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And it's one the guys have been hearing for even longer, because as soon as the end of Supernatural was announced, fans immediately started clamoring for some sort of a comeback. And because Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, and Misha Collins are the verified best, they humored us with some of their own ideas of how the show could find new life after 15 seasons. Ackles, Padalecki and Collins crack up between shots for our special issue (Damian Holbrook) As reported earlier, we hung out with the trio last month at Creation Entertainment's “The Road So Far…The Road Ahead” convention stop in New Jersey, where we held an exclusive interview and photo shoot for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special. When asked what kind of format they would want it to come back, Collins immediately and classically offered “puppet show,” while Padalecki suggested animatronics or marionettes. Jokes aside, Padalecki explained that 20 years had maybe taken the shine off of doing a full TV season. And would they want to go grittier, should the show wind up being revived on a streamer or cable? “I thought about this because we've gotten that question quite a bit,” says Ackles, who had literally flown in that morning from Toronto where he was wrapping The Boys. “What would the show have looked like had it been on a streamer, right? It would've been probably a little more R-rated, but part of me feels like because of what we did for so long and because of what the tone is, I feel like changing that now might be doing it a disservice. So I could see the benefit in keeping it like a broadcast show.” “That's where I sit,” Padalecki added, agreeing with his brother. “There's something magical about [it], it's the reason we watch sports more often than we watch the circus: There are rules in sports. So I like the rules that broadcast television, linear TV, put us within because we still played. We still had ‘son of a bitch' and we…pushed the envelope so much within those boundaries.

How many are you ready to try? Self Tests are all about you. Are you outgoing or introverted? Find out the answers to these questions and more with Psychology Today. There is a way in which psychoanalytic work is akin to an optical illusion. More properly, a psychic illusion, in which the same narratives and experiences may suddenly appear to be one thing or another and may switch about involuntarily. While psychoanalysts may use a listening metaphor—invoking Theodore Reik's concept of the "third ear" (1949), referring to the analyst (or anyone) listening to the conversation with an extra ear to hear the deeper, emotional meaning in it, seeing is an equally important metaphor or analogy in analytic work. Less obviously, there are tactile, motility, spatial, and bodily metaphors that pervade psychoanalytic understanding. Hence the role of "manipulation"—which has a concrete object-oriented quality in the sense of being able to see and shift things in one's inner psychic landscape or stage. The capacity to engage in this inner psychoanalytic functional work is something individuals can access and practice, to varying degrees based on temperament and baseline psychology. Such perceptual fluidity becomes most apparent in the process of transference, where the action of the illusion takes place and where fantasy allows for mutability. Transference is Freud's way of discussing how people can distort their perceptions of the therapist, particularly experiencing them as-if they were figures important earlier in development, such as a parent. “There is one special class of experiences of the utmost importance for which no memory can as a rule be recovered. These are experiences which occurred in very early childhood and were not understood at the time but which were subsequently understood and interpreted. One gains a knowledge of them 'through' dreams, and one is obliged to believe in them on the most compelling evidence provided by the fabric of the neurosis. Moreover, we can ascertain for ourselves that the patient, after his resistances have been overcome, no longer invokes the absence of any memory of them (any sense of familiarity with them) as a ground for refusing to accept them. This matter, however, calls for so much critical caution and introduces so much that is novel and startling that I shall reserve it for a separate discussion in connection with suitable material” (Freud, 1914). The two together experience “co-transference”, as I like to put it, which may be more or less integrated or fragmented, split or mutual. When people discuss their work within a psychoanalytic therapy frame, how they understand it, their relationship to it, and so on, a few implications stand out, as the analyst listens with the third ear for the transferential and projective elements. Per traditional psychoanalytic aesthetics and guidelines, politics generally has no place in the psychoanalytic process, at least no real place. Given that the transference-real pairing may be construed as a false dichotomy, politics certainly has a role in co-transferential processes. One of the traditional prohibitions around politics is that it can disrupt the psychotherapeutic process. The influence on the therapeutic process may be more or less covert and multifaceted; it may be implicit, largely nonverbal, and therefore more likely to be enacted outside of shared awareness. While politics should not enter the real parts of the interaction, the therapist may take on as-if roles, essentially taking a position as though they held a particular political belief, explicitly as a form of communication and therapeutic approach. There are many different psychotherapeutic schools that employ some form of role play—psychodrama, work with parts, speaking to non-present individuals, and more—all of which entail a degree of what might appear to be a thespian enterprise. However, the role play takes place within the therapeutic frame, and not as a form of entertainment or performance art. Further, it should be open that this is role play and not an actual debate and should be approached with caution in an exploratory spirit, the play embraced as critical to learning and a core experience more generally. The as-if dynamic and implicit communication demonstrate how the same content exists simultaneously on multiple levels of meaning and interpretation, whether it concerns political material enacted outside awareness, work discussions that parallel internal dynamics, or any other content that emerges within the therapeutic frame. They all participate in the larger psychic illusion that allows for therapeutic transformation. The illusory nature of inner experience is inherently part of the creative process of mental life, where things are protean, distorted, and may be experienced in many different ways, with varying degrees of reality, but are taken as real in the process of playing with fantasy. Psychoanalytic approaches leverage the interpretability of experience, but must not misuse such a powerful tool.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president has long exploited useful fictions embraced by his supporters. Donald Trump's followers, and the conspiracist influencers turned-government officials through whom he persuades them, have turned on the president and US attorney general after they declared an end to federal inquiries into Jeffrey Epstein's death. But it would be a mistake to think that the investigation scandal is sui generis. A pedophile ring at the center of power is a recurring theme in rightwing conspiracy theories of the Trump era. Online, far-right trolls and members of the population now called “low trust voters”– people who believe that something nefarious and conspiratorial is going on in the halls of American power, even if they don't know exactly what – speculated that Clinton was at the head of a massive human trafficking and pedophilic abuse ring based inside Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in Washington DC. Pizzagate, as it was called, gave way to QAnon, the elaborate mass delirium in which Trump supporters believed that they were receiving secret messages from Q, a fictitious but supposedly highly placed security official. QAnon, too, centered around the notion that powerful people – Democrats, mostly, but also some Hollywood celebrities – were secretly running a massive pedophile network. In his dispatches, Q detailed Trump's efforts to dismantle a deep state ring of child sex trafficking. Trump exploited these fictions, nodding to them deliberately with varying degrees of enthusiasm and plausible deniability. They were useful to him, stories in which he was a hero, and his political opponents were maximally morally repulsive. And the content of the stories – dealing as they did in secrecy, power, helpless innocents and forbidden sex – made them potent tools, igniting the fiercest passions and darkest imaginations of his fans. Over the past 10 years, through the force of his personality and with mounting attacks on universities, journalists, and other outlets for knowledge building, fact-finding, and expertise, he has helped to accelerate a total epistemic collapse in national politics. Policy and public opinion alike are now unmoored from factual reality. A billionaire investor with ties to a shocking number of prominent people across the political spectrum – prominently including Trump himself – Epstein carried out his abuse of dozens of teenage girls over the course of years, allegedly trafficking them for abuse on his private island and aboard his private plane, and, according to some of the girls, now women, who have testified about their experiences with him, pawning them off for abuse by his rich friends. He was a man who lived in tremendous luxury, who mingled with the rich and famous, and who treated human beings – girls – as objects to be consumed, with a kind of casual indifference to their will or wellbeing. He was evil – and, to those on the right who seem to understand both conspicuous consumption and the sexual abuse of women as markers of status, he was also darkly aspirational. It's unclear why Trump is now trying to wrap up a conspiracy theory that has paid such dividends. Perhaps, as some are suggesting, Trump worries that sustained attention on Epstein's case will draw more attention to his own abuse of women, though such revelations about Trump have been many, and have not hurt him before. Perhaps he just thinks that he cannot deliver, from his perch atop the federal bureaucracy that is so implicated in crimes and cover-ups in the imaginations of his supporters, the kind of earth-shattering revelations that the conspiracy theory's narrative structures demand. Either way, Trump has turned abruptly and dramatically against the Epstein theory. He's trying to reassert control over reality, trying to dictate which fantasies his movement adopts, and which they leave behind. There's a grim irony in the fact that it is a case of sexual violence that has underscored the dangers of epistemic collapse for Trump himself, because sexual violence represents an arena where a post-truth reality long predates him. No one knows better than sexual violence victims, who are routinely disbelieved, dismissed, or punished for telling the truth, what it means for the facts of your own life not to matter as much as the passions and prior commitments of your audience. What people tend to forget about Epstein's life – clouded as it has been by all the speculation about his death – is that much of what he was doing to those women and girls was out in the open. Epstein had already been convicted and served prison time on charges pertaining to his sexual abuse; when he'd gotten out, he'd resumed his place among the rich and famous: his status was undiminished by the revelation of his violence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The New England Society for Psychic Research is lamenting the death of paranormal investigator Dan Rivera earlier this week, and friends are condemning certain members of the public for linking his death to a “haunted” Annabelle doll with which he was on tour. Rivera died of natural causes, according to the Pennsylvania State Police. The Annabelle doll has a long history of paranormal activity, but Rhode Island native, paranormal investigator and co-founder of The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS) Jason Hawes had a message for people linking the doll to Rivera's death. Dan Rivera was an Army veteran, a father of four, a husband, and someone who truly cared about people," Hawes wrote on Facebook. "What's even harder to see right now are the posts blaming his death on things like the Annabelle doll and attacking places like Ghostly Images of Gettysburg Tours and other locations for having events. His family shouldn't have to read that kind of nonsense while they're grieving." "Some people are using his passing to push an agenda for profit, and it's just disgusting. “Jersey Shore” cast member Angelina Pivarnick is also mourning the passing of Rivera. “I am at loss for words that you left sooo suddenly,” said Pivarnick Wednesday, July 16, on her social media. I pray for your family at this very sad time.” "We believe with all our hearts that Dan would have wanted the work to continue - bringing people together, sharing knowledge, and honoring the memory of Ed and Lorraine Warren," NESPR said in a written statement this week. The statement added, "Above all, he was a father, a devoted husband, and loyal friend, someone who meant the world to those closest to him...Out of respect for his family, we kindly ask for privacy as they mourn this tremendous loss." In a press release on Wednesday morning, Pennsylvania State Police said that Rivera had passed away from natural causes. The Pennsylvania-based Evening Sun, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported that firefighters and medical personnel had been called to a hotel in Gettysburg after 8 p.m. on Sunday, July 13 for a report of CPR in progress on a male patient of Rivera's age. In additional statements, coroner's office personnel said that the death did not appear suspicious, and that Rivera was found alone in his hotel room. A GoFundMe account has been started by Rivera's family. It was started by one of Rivera's four children, David Rivera, who said the fundraiser would go towards the funeral and memorial expenses for his father and support his family. The fundraiser, which had raised over $3,000 as of Friday morning, can be found at www.tinyurl.com/dan-rivera-gofundme.</p>

Systematic government collection and analysis of data about mysterious sightings in the sky could help Canada better prepare for incidents like the sudden appearance of several high-altitude balloons over North America two years ago, says a report from the federal science adviser. One of the balloons, which wafted above western Canada in early 2023 before being shot down off the U.S. coast, apparently originated from China and carried sophisticated equipment. The report, released this week, says Ottawa should assign a federal department or agency to manage public data on celestial sightings and set up a service to collect testimonies, investigate cases and release analyses. The report explores the public's decades-long fascination with unidentified flying objects and their association with extraterrestrial life, noting a recent shift to the more nuanced concept of unidentified aerial (or anomalous) phenomena, known as UAPs. “Stigmatization can have significant consequences, such as discouraging witnesses from coming forward and hindering scientific inquiry,” the report says. The report says while many sightings can be attributed to optical illusions, atmospheric phenomena or human activity, a minority remain unexplained for a myriad of reasons, including a lack of reliable data that prevents rigorous scientific analysis. Unexplained sightings generate interest and can be the source of misinformation or disinformation, diminishing public trust, the report adds. “When people are repeatedly exposed to false narratives, they may become skeptical of credible sources, including scientists, journalists and government institutions.” In addition, police forces sometimes hear from witnesses, and civil society organizations, such as Ufology Research of Manitoba and MUFON Canada, compile and analyze data from citizens, the report notes. The report points to the United States, France and Chile as interesting examples of co-ordinated, transparent and scientifically driven approaches to UAP reporting. It says the federal government should choose a trusted and recognized scientific organization, such as the Canadian Space Agency, to manage public data about sightings. The space agency did not respond to a query about the report in time for publication, and the Innovation, Science and Economic Development Department said UAPs fall outside its mandate. The report says adopting robust scientific methods and communicating more transparently about sightings would amount to “a significant step forward in promoting public understanding and combating misinformation.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How the human brain generates self-awareness, thoughts, and consciousness is one of science's biggest mysteries, with no clear explanation despite decades of research. More than 80% of the ocean remains unexplored, concealing unknown species, geological formations, and potentially even entire ecosystems. The Earth's magnetic poles flip irregularly — sometimes every 200,000 years, other times millions of years apart — but scientists still don't fully understand why these reversals occur or what exactly triggers them. Plate tectonics shape Earth's surface, but when and how they first began remains a geological mystery. Some theories suggest they started over 3 billion years ago, but the evidence is sparse and debated. Strange signals and inexplicable low-frequency underwater sounds have been recorded here, fueling speculation about unknown sea phenomena or remnants of ancient civilizations. It is also the point where most satellites are crashed. The “Gates of Hell” refers to the Darvaza gas crater in Turkmenistan's Karakum Desert, a fiery pit that has been burning continuously since 1971. While Earth is covered in water, scientists still debate where it came from. The source of Earth's vast oceans remains uncertain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In January, three days after President Donald Trump began his second term, he issued an executive order to declassify files related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert, and Martin Luther King, Jr. A fact sheet accompanying the order said that it was “PROVIDING AMERICANS THE TRUTH AFTER SIX DECADES OF SECRECY.” But many Trump fans are far more concerned with what they see as six years of secrecy around Jeffrey Epstein, the incarcerated pedophile who, in 2019, depending on what you believe, either killed himself or was murdered to protect the sprawling network of sex offenders who had participated in his crimes. In February, Pam Bondi, the Attorney General, was asked on Fox News whether she might release a supposed list of Epstein's “clients.” Bondi said that it was sitting on her desk for review. The following week, she shared a tranche of documents related to Epstein, and gave right-wing influencers an advance look. The files, however, were a bust, consisting mostly of uninteresting or already public information. Bondi suggested that there was more to come, but a few months later Kash Patel, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Dan Bongino, his deputy—both of whom stoked suspicions about Epstein's death in past lives as right-wing pundits—went on Fox and awkwardly insisted that Epstein did kill himself after all. had signed off on a memo that not only concluded there was no evidence that Epstein was murdered but also stated that federal investigators had found no support for the claims that he blackmailed powerful people or maintained a list of clients; the memo also said that further disclosure would not be “appropriate or warranted.” Bondi, seated next to Trump at an event last week, sought to clarify the remarks she had made on Fox, insisting that she had been talking not about a “client list” but about the Epstein case as a whole. For his part, Trump—who indicated on the campaign trail last year that he would be open to releasing Epstein-related files—sounded incredulous that people were still talking about them. In a subsequent post on Truth Social, he dismissed the story as a waste of time, calling it something “nobody cares about.” And yet, by this point, many of Trump's supporters had established that they still care very much about Epstein, and were not willing to move along. After that, it looked like the story might finally be losing momentum; Charlie Kirk, Turning Point's founder, whom Trump had reportedly called after the conference, suggested that he was willing to trust the Administration and that he would stop talking about Epstein for the time being. On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, normally about as Trump-sycophantic as one can be, said that the Administration “should put everything out there.” Recently, in this column, I've explored other apparent cracks in the MAGA coalition, over whether to strike Iran and what to do about federal spending; last month, I described the Iran debate as the “apex” of media chatter about a MAGA civil war. The disputes about Iran and spending were nuanced, but they revolved around legible ideological distinctions: Iran hawkery vs. America First; deficit hawkery vs. Whatever Trump Wants First. When it comes to Epstein, the dividing lines are murkier. Journalists at The Bulwark and Politico attempted to delineate the Epstein factions within MAGA and came up, respectively, with five and eight distinct groupings, the names of which—“Israel Skeptics,” “Show-Trial Compromisers,” “Cabal Accommodationists”—will make little sense to those not steeped in Epstein lore. On Iran, I argued that the most troubling division for Trump might not have been between different MAGA diehards but between people who pay close attention to politics and the casuals who lent him support last year, and who generally seemed skeptical of the strikes. This time, all of the above seem to be furious. But, strikingly, he hasn't been spared it, either. If the Epstein blowup is revealing of Trump's base—indicating that its worship of him is not unconditional but predicated on the idea that he's a tribune of the people seeking to expose nefarious élites—it is also revealing of Trump himself, and his relationship to conspiracy theories, in particular. Since he returned to power, these trends have, in some ways, only become more visible. But, as Trump's reaction to the Epstein files suggests, it's an oversimplification to say that the President has never heard a conspiracy theory that he didn't embrace, or that he has invented a cohesive post-truth movement. Figuring out why requires some theorizing of our own. In 1964, the historian Richard Hofstadter wrote a famous essay for Harper's Magazine about what he called the “paranoid style” in American politics. Earlier this week, a poll commissioned by CNN found that just three per cent of Americans are satisfied with what the Administration has shared about Epstein—and that more Democrats than Republicans are dissatisfied. Whether they are true skeptics or merely spy an opening to troll Trump is open to debate, but some of their rhetoric has sounded pretty paranoid either way. Still, Hofstadter's diagnosis of the paranoid style, as performed by right-wingers of his time—rooted in the feeling that “America has been largely taken away from them and their kind”—clearly applies most closely, in today's terms, to the MAGA movement. And Hofstadter's description of “the paranoid spokesman,” who “traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values,” would seem to have foreshadowed Trump himself. But, it turns out, Trump does not always fit that description. “I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is, I really don't,” he said, this week. (Conspiracy theorists generally don't like hearing people in power tell them that there's “nothing to see here,” even when it comes from supposed allies.) Trump's Truth Social post telling people to move on from Epstein seemed to invent a different conspiracy theory—that a cabal of his political opponents dreamed up the Epstein files—and he has continued to beat that drum ever since. He also urged Bondi to focus on what really matters: investigating how the 2020 election was stolen. You don't have to believe that the Epstein files are hiding some new dark secret about Trump to apply that logic here: it's common knowledge that he knew Epstein, and he is on the record talking about Epstein's preference for women “on the younger side”; any news cycle that dredges that back up is unlikely to make Trump happy. (On Thursday night, the Wall Street Journal reported that in 2003, Trump contributed a “bawdy” message to an album for Epstein's fiftieth birthday; Trump angrily denied this and threatened to sue the Journal.) And, though it's true Trump said before taking office that he would be inclined to release files related to Epstein, he didn't sound that enthusiastic about the idea. (“You don't want to affect people's lives if there's phony stuff in there,” he told Fox, evincing uncharacteristic concern for other people's lives. “There's a lot of phony stuff in that whole world.”) Yet this theory doesn't explain why Trump routinely endorses lies that don't seem to have much to do with him, such as the idea that white South African farmers need refugee status to escape a genocide, for example. (This is fitting, given that conspiracy theories are often inconsistent and make little sense.) This theory is compatible with aspects of the others—it is harder to convincingly peddle conspiracy theories when you're in power, and Trump certainly is self-interested—but it holds that Trump's attitude toward any given theory is likely guided by a mix not only of these factors but by whom he last spoke with, what information he has consumed on a given day, and so on. Musk, Tucker Carlson, and the golfer Gary Player all seem to have influenced his South Africa fixation; earlier this year, Trump appears to have become convinced that a wrongfully deported migrant had a gang tattoo when he didn't. Maybe Trump doesn't want the Epstein files out because he's covering them up. But maybe, as the Times suggested this week, he was slow to grasp his base's fury because Epstein conspiracism is a Very Online phenomenon, and he is an old man who principally consumes newspapers and TV. Trump's views are idiosyncratic, and his attention is prone to wander. Sometimes he looks less like the leader of some programmatic conspiracy cult—or the “paranoid spokesman” of Hofstadter's essay—and more like an ignorant blowhard. Before writing his essay on the “paranoid style,” Hofstadter gave a similar lecture at Oxford University, in November, 1963. While running for President in 2016, he falsely insinuated that the father of his primary rival, Ted Cruz, was an associate of Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin. After taking office for the first time, Trump allowed a trove of J.F.K. But Trump's attack on Cruz's father seemed driven less by the zeal of the skeptic than by a petty desire to settle scores. And, if he made it a priority to declassify the J.F.K. files, he didn't—at least not explicitly—use their disclosure as a wedge to fuel further distrust of the government, as a full-bore conspiracy entrepreneur might have done. But he is playing with older forces beyond his control. The hottest restaurant in France is an all-you-can-eat buffet. A heat shield for the most important ice on Earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cast: Sonakshi Sinha, Arjun Rampal, Paresh Rawal, Suhail Nayyar Sonakshi Sinha's Nikita Roy can be best described as a hybrid of Creature 3D and The Buckingham Murders. Add PK to it and all these films can have beer at a pub. And Nikita Roy will have to tolerate all the burden. Sinha plays an author called Nikita Roy who has written a book about suspicions in modern India. She has lost her brother Arjun Rampal in an accident that creeps the hell out of everyone. The film has an interesting idea trapped in inane execution. It's unable to decide whether it wants to be whodunit, a horror, an emotional thriller, a drama about fake godmen, or everything or absolutely nothing. The leading lady has said this in a couple of her interviews how she used to play subservient characters in the beginning of her career. What happened with Sinha is something this veteran battled too. One barely mentions the likes of Mumbai Meri Jaan or Road To Sangam or Sardar when it comes to his marvelling oeuvre, but Nikita Roy is nowhere close to anything that he will be remembered for. If his character here had a conversation with Kanji Bhai from Oh My God, all hell would break loose. Nikita Roy reeks of pretence from beginning to end. Any potential in the story is further marred by fake accents and faulty dubbing. Two brutal murders have happened, but all the investigations are being done by Sinha and her BFF Jolly (an over the top Suhail Nayyar). We barely get to see any effort from the police. Debutant director Kussh Sinha gives his sister a delicious opportunity to shine in every frame. But he definitely knows a thing or two about creating palpable tension.
