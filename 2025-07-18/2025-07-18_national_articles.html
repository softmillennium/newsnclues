President Donald Trump signed into law the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act Friday — a landmark piece of legislation that establishes federal regulations surrounding digital currency. Ahead of signing the bill, Trump recalled how he previously vowed to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the planet" during a keynote address during a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, in July 2024, where he said that regulations his administration would implement would be "written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry." And under the Trump administration, this is only going further." Stablecoins are a form of digital currency tied to a stable asset like gold or the U.S. dollar, which aims to keep their prices more consistent. "Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoin," Trump said Friday. Included in the GENIUS Act are provisions requiring monthly public disclosure of reserve competition, as well as annual audited financial statements for issuers with more than $50 billion in market capitalization, according to the Senate Banking Committee, which spearheaded the legislation. President Donald Trump arrives for a signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act in the East Room of the White House in Washington on Friday, July 18, 2025. "For far too long, America's digital assets industry has been stifled by ambiguous rules, confusing enforcement and the Biden administration's anti-crypto crusade,"  Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said during a press conference on Thursday. "But President Trump and this Congress are correcting course and unleashing America's digital asset potential with historic, transformative legislation." Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) speaks at a rally featuring U.S. Republican Presidential nominee former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) at Herb Brooks National Hockey Center on July 27, 2024, in St. Twelve Republicans voted against the measure, which has attracted scrutiny from lawmakers like House Financial Services Committee ranking member Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., due to conflict-of-interest concerns as Trump has promoted a digital currency called $TRUMP. "By passing this bill, Congress will be telling the world that Congress is OK with corruption, OK with foreign companies buying influence, and OK with criminals buying Trump coins to seek pardons and beneficial treatment," Waters said on the House floor Thursday. In addition to the GENIUS Act, the House passed two other measures related to cryptocurrency Thursday: Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act) to install some additional regulatory framework for digital assets, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which aims to stop the Federal Reserve from central bank digital currency (CBDC) directly to individuals and jeopardize their privacy.

Maxine Waters (D-CA) questions Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as he appears before the House Financial Services Committee on May 7, 2025, in Washington.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Epstein files: President Donald Trump said he ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of “pertinent” records from grand jury testimony in the case of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's doctor said the condition is common in older adults and there are no signs of heart failure or arterial disease. President Donald Trump spoke at a White House signing ceremony for the bipartisan GENIUS Act today. But this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up, because a lot of people would have given up two, three years ago. After his remarks, Trump sat at a desk to sign the bill into law, surrounded by members of Congress and administration officials. What's in the bill: It is a first-of-its kind legislation that aims to regulate a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins. “Now, your country calls upon you to serve once more.” Deemed “Operation Return to Mission,” ICE leadership issued the “urgent call” to former agency employees, indicating “you can serve in your current location and previous job series.” As CNN reported, while the administration has touted its immigration crackdown publicly, privately officials have come under fire for failing to meet White House arrest quotas, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions. Trump border czar Tom Homan said today that no final decision has been made about reopening Alcatraz, when asked about reports that returning the former prison to operation could cost $2 billion. Homan did say the administration is looking “for any available bed space.” I don't think any decision has been made yet,” Homan told CNN's Alayna Treene, adding that he hasn't been briefed on how much rebuilding and reopening Alcatraz would cost. Pressed again by reporters on whether he'd be comfortable with the $2 billion figure, Homan said, “I'd have to see how many beds come out of that number and what's the length of stay that facility is going to do — we've got short-term bed facilities and long-term bed facilities, so unless I have that information, I can't even give you a guess.” He repeatedly stressed the need for more bed space. (Ron) DeSantis came up with some beds pretty quickly,” Homan said, referring to the Florida detention facility the administration has called “Alligator Alcatraz.” The border czar said states have a responsibility to help. Federal grand juries are investigative bodies that hear testimony from witnesses and issue subpoenas, but it's unclear if the material gathered during this secretive panel would advance the public's understanding of the Jeffrey Epstein case — as it's not a complete record of the investigation, just enough to get an indictment. The Department of Justice is expected to ask a judge to release additional material, which is typically kept secret — but it's unclear what they will argue that will convince a judge to release additional material that has been held back to protect victims and accusers. A Justice Department official confirmed the government is expected to file the request in federal court in Manhattan at some point today. CNN's Elie Honig explains what documents could get released. What's been made public already: Some transcripts related to the 2006 Florida grand jury investigation into Epstein have already been released. The public also received information throughout the course of the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison in 2022 for carrying out a years-long scheme with Epstein to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi did not address what might become of FBI notes or interviews conducted outside of the grand jury process. Those are often much more voluminous, and — even if they don't ultimately become relevant to the criminal case — could enhance public understanding of a matter. President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after being examined for swelling in his legs, the White House announced yesterday. It's a condition in which valves inside certain veins don't work the way they should, which can allow blood to pool or collect in the veins. CNN's Sanjay Gupta analyzes the news that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency following leg swelling. Steve Bannon said Friday that the Wall Street Journal story about a Jeffrey Epstein birthday letter bearing Donald Trump's name has united the president's supporters behind him once again on an issue that, up until last evening, had put him at odds with many members of his base. “We are finally on offense,” Bannon, Trump's former aide and a leader of the MAGA movement, said via text to CNN. “President Trump has had enough and is fighting back – against his real enemies.” Bannon was one of several of Trump's high-profile supporters who had chastised his administration's handling of the Epstein case and helped keep the issue alive despite Trump's repeated attempts to dismiss the backlash. Bannon also praised Trump's move asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to unseal pertinent grand jury testimony related to Epstein, calling it a “good start.” “Good start but stay on offense—it's when Trump is @ his best –attack, attack, attack,” Bannon wrote when asked whether such a move will be enough to quell the pressure for more of the so-called Epstein files to be released. Bannon is a longtime critic of Wall Street Journal owner Rupert Murdoch, whom Trump has vowed to sue — along with the newspaper — over the story about the birthday letter, which he denies is from him. “Murdoch showed how much he loathes Trump,” Bannon said, arguing that Murdoch will further serve as a uniting force for the president's base. “Murdoch tried to destroy the President and failed – now Trump strikes back.” President Donald Trump said he would want Rupert Murdoch to testify after vowing to sue the Wall Street Journal and its owner over the outlet's story detailing a 2003 birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein bearing Trump's name. “I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his ‘pile of garbage' newspaper, the WSJ. It concluded with the line: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” “I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn't print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I'm going to sue his ass off, and that of his third-rate newspaper,” Trump posted on Truth Social last night after the story posted. Here's what the president's day looks like so far today: We're in line with the White House, there's no daylight between us,” he said in the early hours of Friday morning. Johnson added: “The resolution that was advanced tonight in the Rules Committee was for them to go on record and say, ‘No, of course, we're for transparency. We'll determine what happens with all that, there's a lot developing.” Johnson emphasized that House Republicans support President Donald Trump's handling of the Epstein case. Effect on public broadcasting and international aid: Roughly $8 billion will be taken from congressionally approved foreign aid programs as part of the White House's efforts to dismantle the US Agency for International Development. Another $1.1 billion comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund NPR and PBS. Public television stations will be “forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,” PBS CEO Paula Kerger said yesterday. Advocates say the entire system of noncommercial media will become weaker without the foundational support from taxpayers, resulting in fewer original shows and less local news coverage. Government funding: Passage of the bill, however, now raises questions about how and whether Democrats and Republicans will be able to work together to keep the government funded past the September 30 deadline. Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer argued the process has cast doubt on whether Democrats can work in good faith with Republican lawmakers who could agree to a spending deal now and pull future funding later. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said he'd ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “any and all pertinent” grand jury testimony in the case of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Congress passed the package — which is part of Trump's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency efforts — under an obscure presidential budget law used to circumvent the Senate filibuster. There is nothing that would compel this to the floor, however. It concluded with the line: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Bondi quickly reposted Trump's comments on X and wrote: “President Trump—we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.” Her department could ask judges to make such material public, but the process could be lengthy as the courts weigh privacy and other concerns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three veteran Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department members assigned to the agency's arson and explosives detail were killed Friday morning by an explosion at a department training facility, according to Sheriff Robert Luna. The three sworn members had collectively served for 74 years and authorities are not releasing their names at this time, the sheriff said. Luna added he's met with several family members of the deputies, but some have not yet been notified. “The individuals who work our arson explosives detail, they have years of training,” Luna said, adding the members respond to an average of 1,100 calls per year, which include “dealing with some very dangerous situations or items.” They are fantastic experts, and unfortunately, I lost three of them today,” the sheriff continued. The facility is located about 6 miles east of downtown LA. The incident is believed to have been an accident, but remains under investigation. It's unclear whether the incident was related to a training session or whether officers were handling evidence, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the incident told CNN. “At this time, we do not know the cause of the explosion … I can tell you, there is no threat to this community. US Attorney General Pam Bondi and the LASD said earlier Friday the three members died in a “critical workplace incident.” “I just spoke to (US Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli) about what appears to be a horrific incident that killed at least three at a law enforcement training facility in Los Angeles,” Bondi said in a post on X. “Sheriff's homicide detectives are on scene,” the LASD said. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also on scene, according to Bondi. LASD homicide detectives are also on scene investigating the deaths, Luna said. Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigators and members of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad are assisting at the training facility, LA Mayor Karen Bass said in a post on X. “I am heartbroken to hear of the terrible tragedy that has unfolded today at an L.A. County Sheriff's Department facility,” Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger said in a statement. My heart is heavy, and my thoughts are with the brave men and women of the Sheriff's Department during this difficult time. This story has been updated with additional information.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least three people have died in an explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's training facility on Friday morning, according to US Attorney General Pam Bondi. “I just spoke to (US Attorney Bill Essayli) about what appears to be a horrific incident that killed at least three at a law enforcement training facility in Los Angeles,” Bondi said in a post on X.

Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigators and members of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad are assisting at the training facility, LA Mayor Karen Bass said in a post on X. The work of the bomb squad is complicated by the fact officers have to ensure no other explosive material that could be stored there is vulnerable to detonation, the senior law enforcement source told CNN. “I am heartbroken to hear of the terrible tragedy that has unfolded today at an L.A. County Sheriff's Department facility,” Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger said in a statement. “I am closely tracking the situation as we learn more about what occurred and the condition of those affected. My heart is heavy, and my thoughts are with the brave men and women of the Sheriff's Department during this difficult time. We stand with them and their families as they navigate the hours and days ahead,” Barger said. This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce and Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst discusses the Israeli airstrikes on the Syrian capital, Damascus, on ‘America Reports.' EXCLUSIVE: In a rare public rebuke of Israeli military action, Rep. Joe Wilson, R‑S.C., issued a harsh warning that recent airstrikes on Syria are "suicidal" for Tel Aviv. "I'm the co‑chair of the Israel caucus and a lifelong supporter of the State of Israel," Wilson told Fox News Digital in an emotional phone call, "I am heartsick." He said the strikes on Syria's military headquarters were "insulting and mocking to President [Donald] Trump," who just recently lifted sanctions on Syria after meeting with leader Ahmed al-Sharaa to give Damascus a "chance" at economic prosperity after the fall of Bashar al-Assad. Wilson said he had a tense phone call with Ambassador Yechiel Leiter, urging him to share his warning back home that Israel must stop the strikes. Rep. Joe Wilson, R‑S.C., issued a harsh warning that recent airstrikes on Syria are "suicidal" for Tel Aviv. Only weeks ago, there were back-channel talks between Israel and Syria on a possible normalization deal. Now, not only are those talks out the window, but the strikes will complicate work on a U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords-style deal to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, Wilson said. He warned that fractures in Syria could ripple across the region — undermining emerging ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, straining NATO relations with Turkey, fracturing Druze unity in Jordan and increasing instability among Kurdish populations across Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran. He added that such fragmentation would open the door for an ISIS resurgence, targeting Israel first. Wilson also pointed to broader geopolitical consequences, noting the strikes empower Iran and bolster Russia's presence in Syria. "Efforts should be made to expel [Vladimir Putin's forces], not to create destabilization," he said, asserting that Moscow uses its Syrian bases to project naval power across Africa and the Mediterranean. Israel struck Syria's military headquarters in defense of the Druze community. The more destabilization, the greater opportunity Iran has to destabilize other countries, whether it be further destabilization of Iraq, and then also it plays into the hands of war criminal Putin." The last Israeli strike on Syria was Wednesday, but they have not agreed to a ceasefire. On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the nation struck to defend Druze minority communities in Syria, fearing the Syrian leadership would soon strike Israelis. "I did not trust Assad the father, nor Assad the son, and I certainly do not trust a leader like Julani," he said, referring to al-Sharaa by his former name. He claimed al-Sharaa "relies on jihadist groups that he operates against minorities in Syria, and tomorrow he will operate them against Israeli communities in the Golan Heights. The Druze community also has a sizable population in Israel. Wilson called the assertion "totally contrived and misunderstood." Syrian army's General Staff Complex was targeted three times on Wednesday. If you can't figure out who your enemy is, then you're opening the door for massive loss of life within Israel itself." Syria's leader accused Israel of sowing discord by striking in defense of the Druze, who were involved in deadly sectarian clashes that threaten the nation's fragile unity. Washington is also intensifying pressure for de-escalation. The Trump administration has formally urged Israel to halt its strikes and pursue direct talks with Damascus. Special U.S. envoy Tom Barrack reportedly made several calls to Prime Minister Netanyahu's adviser, Ron Dermer, pressing for restraint. The Israeli defense ministry could not be reached for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After days of fierce fighting, the Syrian government withdrew from the Druze stronghold of Suwayda after announcing a ceasefire. The Druze Suwayda Military Council was successful in the first round of fighting, backed by heavy Israeli airstrikes that devastated government convoys and hit government buildings in Damascus. The fighting in southern Syria began on Sunday after tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between Druze and local Bedouins. Druze sources suspect that the mobilization was ordered or carried out with the tacit blessing of Damascus, with some suggesting that the Bedouin forces include some government troops. Pro-government sources accused Druze militants of carrying out massacres and other atrocities against Bedouin civilians. Bedouin commanders argued that they were not bound by the Wednesday ceasefire, which was only agreed upon by the government. Bedouin militants launched a major offensive beginning Thursday evening, pushing Druze forces back. Reports suggested that Israel launched airstrikes in support of its Druze allies, though the Israeli military did not confirm. In a marked turnaround from Thursday, Israel said it agreed to allow Syrian government forces into the Suwayda region for the next two days to quell the renewed fighting. “In light of the ongoing instability in southwest Syria, Israel has agreed to allow limited entry of the [Syrian] internal security forces into Suwayda district for the next 48 hours,” an Israeli official who declined to be named told reporters, according to the Times of Israel. As of Friday afternoon, local time, geolocated videos showed Bedouin forces fighting with the SMC in towns north of Suwayda city. Videos showed gunmen traveling to fighting areas in buses and being loaded into the back of a semi-trailer truck. Syrian tribes are literally transporting fighters by truck to Suwayda. WATCH: Syrian Akidat tribe members from Deir ez-Zor region rushing to battle with a bus, on their way to Suwayda. Videos showed dozens of militants taking part in assaults on Druze positions. “We have not left our homeland,” he said. “As Christians, we stand with our Druze brothers and sisters against these terrorist attacks.” 🇸🇾 Father Toni Butros, Greek Catholic leader in Sweida, stands firm in solidarity with the Druze community amid sectarian violence. As Christians, we stand with our Druze brothers and sisters against these terrorist attacks." The Druze have been able to hold their own so far, boosted by support from Israel, which has a large, loyal Druze community. Israel's intervention saw a rare rift between Jerusalem and Washington, with the United States denouncing Israel's airstrikes on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump holds his signed signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House, July 4, 2025, in Washington, surrounded by members of Congress. WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, but a new survey shows that Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy. Most — about 6 in 10 — think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people. Republicans have already begun airing advertisements framing the legislation as a tax cut for all Americans, highlighting new deductions on tips and overtime income. The new poll indicates that Republicans still have persuading to do. The high price tag may also be turning off some Americans. Most people have heard at least something about the new law, according to the poll, which found that about two-thirds of U.S. adults have heard or read “a lot” or “some” about it. Those who know something about the legislation are more likely to believe it favors the wealthy, compared with people who have heard “only a little” or “nothing at all.” Anaiah Barrow, a 25-year-old single mom from North Carolina who doesn't identify with a political party, said she's concerned that the new law will hurt caregivers like her. Barrow -- who's juggling a job, taking care of two young children and pursuing a degree -- is concerned about losing access to day care and food stamps. “It has a really big effect,” Barrow said of the recently passed legislation, which she has learned about on TikTok. A similar percentage say this about middle-class people, while about 4 in 10 Republicans think it will do more to help than hurt low-income people. Lori Nichols, a 51-year-old caregiver for her elderly mother in Illinois, said the legislation has “very little for the older people and people that are on disability.” Although Nichols is a Republican, she said she didn't vote in the 2024 presidential election and voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. “As far as the tax part goes, it seems to me like (Trump's) just making the rich richer,” Nichols said. Nathan Hay, a shift service manager at an international dealership that repairs trucks, said he thinks lower-income people might see a “slight increase” in taxes but still supports the bill. “Personally, it's not helping me a ton,” Hay said, but he believes it will help small businesses, which have been a staple in his own life and his family's. About half of Republicans expect the legislation to do more to help “people like you,” compared with about 2 in 10 independents and just 6% of Democrats. “I'm not a tax accountant, but it sounds as if it would be more beneficial to (people) in the higher tax level,” said Republican Geraldine Putnam, 87, a Trump voter who lives in the rural south. “It's not that I would want to take away the incentive to become more wealthy — that's the American dream,” Putnam said. “It's just the extreme method that he's using.” Just 38% of Americans approve of how Donald Trump is handling government spending, compared with 46% in an AP-NORC poll conducted in March. President Donald Trump holds his signed signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House, July 4, 2025, in Washington, surrounded by members of Congress. Republicans are less likely to say the government is spending “too much” than they were in March 2023, when Joe Biden was president, but about 6 in 10 still think the government is overspending. A similar share of Democrats say the same thing. Putnam, now a retiree, took issue with Trump's cuts in federal workers, even though she says she approves of being able to “trim off people who aren't really doing their jobs.” The AP-NORC poll of 1,437 adults was conducted July 10-14, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve Board Building is seen as it undergoes renovations, June 10, 2025, in Washington, DC. The sculpture of an eagle looks out from behind protective construction wrapping on the facade as the Federal Reserve Board Building undergoes both interior and exterior renovations, in Washington, Monday, Oct. 23, 2023. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell listens during a Senate Committee on Banking hearing, June 25, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has looked to the marble finishes and hefty price tag of the Federal Reserve headquarters to claim grounds to fire Chair Jerome Powell, with whom he has tussled for years over interest rates. As the Fed moved forward with plans to renovate its Great Depression-era headquarters in Washington during Trump's first term, it faced concerns in 2020 during a vetting process involving Trump appointees, who called for more “white Georgia marble” for the facade of building. The Fed's architects said the central bank had wanted glass walls to reflect the Fed as a transparent institution, but three Trump appointees to a local commission felt marble best fit the building's historic character. “I wouldn't be surprised if the result costs more” because of the added marble, said Alex Krieger, a Harvard University emeritus professor who was a member of the commission and participated in hearings on the Fed's proposal. Russ Vought, Trump's top budget adviser, cited “premium marble” in a letter to Powell last week as an example of the “ostentatious overhaul.” In a response late Thursday, Powell wrote that the project would “use new domestic marble” for several reasons, including “to address concerns raised by external review agencies.” “The Federal Reserve's extravagant multi-billion dollar renovation happened on the watch of the Fed's leadership, and the Fed's leadership needs to own up for this mismanagement of taxpayer dollars – as well as its botched coverup job,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. There is an uncomfortable possibility that the fate of the U.S. central bank and its foundational role in the economy hinges on a dispute about renovation costs and architecture, one that could lead a broader legal battle as to whether Trump can dismiss a Fed chair he dislikes after the Supreme Court in May described the institution as having protections against an abrupt firing. Trump, who has redecorated the Oval Office in gold leaf, has argued that inflation is not a concern, so the Fed can dramatically slash its rate to encourage more borrowing. But Powell and other Fed committee members are waiting to see whether Trump's tariffs lift inflation, which higher interest rates could help blunt. The Fed chair pushed back against criticism during a June congressional hearing that the renovation was lavish by saying some features were removed due to cost, leading the White House to speculate as to whether Powell deceived lawmakers or made changes to the renovation plans without getting additional approvals. At that hearing, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., also cited “white marble” as an example of extravagance. James Blair, a White House deputy chief of staff who was recently added to the planning commission, said Wednesday that he would send a letter to the Fed requesting any revisions to the project. “If he's telling the truth, he can prove it by just submitting all the plans and revisions.” Trump said Wednesday that he's “highly unlikely” to try to fire Powell unless there was what he deemed as “fraud.” The attempt to remove Powell before his May 2026 term as chair ends could unleash a devastating financial blowback, as financial markets expect the Fed, with its mission of stabilizing prices and maximizing employment, to be free of White House politicking. The architects presented new plans in May 2020, though those didn't appear to satisfy Trump's appointees. Some commissioners “continued to object to the addition as a glass box that is reminiscent of a commercial office building, glowing at night, that would present an unacceptable contrast to the solid masonry architecture of the historic building in its monumental context,” the commission wrote in a May 2020 letter to a Fed official. By July 2020, however, the Fed's architects came back with a new proposal, which included “panels of white Georgia marble” which would be used for the “base, cornice, and other details, consistent with the historic building,” the commission's minutes said. Stroik, now a professor of architecture at the University of Notre Dame, said in an interview that “stone buildings don't necessarily have to cost a fortune.” But he acknowledged that the commission had not discussed expenses, which has not been part of its mission. “If they wanted to play the cost game, you do a marble facade and you do the glass facade and you compare the cost,” Stroik said. “And you know, they never did that.” Krieger, the former commission member, noted that the body's discussions became much more contentious after the Trump administration removed several members and replaced them with Stroik and James McCrery, a professor at Catholic University, whom he said often echoed the sentiments in a then- draft executive order from Trump that extolled classical architecture. Trump issued the executive order in December 2020, which criticized modernist architecture and expressed a preference for “beautiful” classical buildings with more traditional designs. The commission did not fully approve the Fed's project until September 2021, after McCrery and another Trump appointee, Justin Shubow, had been removed by then President Joe Biden.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last night, the department agreed to give up fighting a lawsuit filed by one of those 20 million and the Second Amendment advocacy group, Firearms Policy Center, in a major win for plinkers and hunters. “The government is finally retreating from the Biden Administration's patently unlawful effort to turn millions of peaceable people into felons by decree,” said FPC Action Foundation President Cody J. Wisniewski, an attorney for the challengers. At issue was the Biden administration's order to repeal a decadelong allowance of pistol braces on short-barreled AR-style firearms. While it waived the tax for those who complied, the rest — and it was a majority — would face criminal charges. There are some 40 million pistol braces in use. The order has been hung up in several courts, and the Justice Department's move appears to have ended that, making them OK to own and use. “Today is a great day for freedom and the American people,” said Firearms Policy Coalition President Brandon Combs. As we explained in the case filings, braced pistols are not ‘short-barreled rifles.' But either way, they are unquestionably arms protected under the Second Amendment. We are thrilled to have secured this important win for liberty and excited to take on even more unconstitutional laws so you can exercise your rights when, where, and how you choose.”</p>

Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin has exclusive insights into I.C.E. agents chaotic chase in Sacramento on Special Report. Despite pushback from California officials to federal immigration enforcement, Border Patrol in Sacramento arrested 11 illegal migrants during a tense raid at a Home Depot parking lot on Thursday — including one man with 67 prior jail bookings in California since 1986 and a prior fentanyl trafficking conviction. In one foot pursuit, agents chased a man who they say slashed the tire of a law enforcement vehicle. The man claimed to be a U.S. citizen. Agents eventually maced the man in the face before arresting him and taking him into custody. His wife shouted at agents throughout the incident, insisting he is a U.S. citizen. Border Patrol agents were forced to drive the damaged vehicle away on its rims. Gregory Bovino, U.S. Border Patrol chief for the El Centro Sector, said his agency will continue prioritizing the removal of criminal illegal immigrants. An illegal migrant was arrested in a Home Depot parking lot on Thursday. "We'll be here, you'll probably see us in many other locations as well. We're going to effect this mission and secure the homeland." The migrant with 67 prior jail bookings is Mexican national Javier Dimas-Alcantara, who is an aggravated felon with convictions and charges spanning decades. His criminal history includes multiple instances of transporting and selling narcotics or controlled substances, felony burglary, possession of a controlled narcotic with intent to sell, carrying a loaded firearm in public and multiple felony-level marijuana possession charges for sale. He's also been arrested for illegal entry, revocation of probation due to reoffending, multiple instances of providing false identification to law enforcement, multiple cases of narcotic possession and being under the influence of a controlled substance. Mexican national Javier Dimas-Alcantar has 67 prior jail bookings. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin slammed the defenders of sanctuary policies. "Dimas has been convicted of a myriad of offenses — you would not want this man to be your neighbor and yet politicians like [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom defend criminals who terrorize American communities and demonize law enforcement who defend those same communities," McLaughlin said. "He and every other sanctuary politician should be thanking CBP for getting this scum out of American communities instead of obstructing federal law enforcement at every possible turn." Another detainee is a Guatemalan migrant who had a voluntary return removal in 2009 with prior arrests for trespassing and failure to provide ID. Their names have not been released yet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The health care consequences of Trump's budget bill are already here. We just got a preview of the likely consequences of the “big, beautiful bill” passed by Republicans in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump: Premiums on the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces are on track to increase 15 percent on average next year — a record-setting pace. This comes from a new analysis of more than 100 health insurers selling plans to individuals on the ACA marketplaces that additionally found that plan premiums increases are twice that in 2025 and the highest single-year increase since 2018. According to the experts from KFF, a health policy think tank, one out of every four plans is raising its rates by 20 percent or more. These rates are preliminary and will be finalized later this summer. Though the new rates were actually filed before the Republican “big, beautiful bill” passed in Congress earlier this month, KFF experts explain that the GOP's agenda is playing a role in these cost increases — and it may drive prices up even more in the future. Here's what all of this means for you: If you buy insurance on your own through the ACA's marketplaces, your coverage may be a lot more expensive as soon as you sign up for coverage next year. If you're on Medicaid, the GOP's bill creates new work requirements that will take effect next year and could put your benefits at risk. And if you get insurance through your employer, your premiums are going to grow too if other people lose coverage, which is more likely to happen because of all of these changes. As Republicans were pulling together their budget bill, there was the clear question of what to do about enhanced ACA subsidies that have been in place since 2021, first authorized by the Democrats as part of their own budget reconciliation legislation. Marketplace enrollment nearly doubled from 2021 to 21 million in 2024 as a result. But the enhanced subsidies were only authorized through 2025. It is possible that these subsidies could be saved if Democrats and some Republican lawmakers can band together to craft a bipartisan deal to maintain the subsidies later this year, but DC insiders are dubious that one can be struck. These combine to an estimated 5.1 million people who could become uninsured. These consequences will have ripple effects: The people who drop coverage are projected to be healthier, because they are more likely to think they could live without health coverage, which leaves a sicker and costlier pool of patients in the marketplace. The threat of tariffs from Trump has been cited for another 3 percent increase by some plans. The Republican bill's changes to Medicaid don't take effect until the end of 2026, but they could also push premiums higher if millions of people lose coverage as expected. When people lose Medicaid, they are more likely to end up in the emergency room. Those increased costs to hospitals are passed on to insured patients when providers negotiate their payment rates with health insurance plans. Whether patients will blame the GOP for these cost increases remains to be seen. Why a good night's rest is so hard to come by. The internet hates Botox and fillers — but only when they don't look good Despite what your social media feed might say, microwaves are safe. ﻿The future of the internet is a slop-filled infinite scroll.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>July is a terrifying month for the Chinese Communist Party. Anniversaries in Hong Kong and Tibet highlight the weakness of authoritarian Chinese communism. It's worth reviewing why Beijing annexes buffer states like Tibet and Hong Kong. Authoritarians can't afford to share borders with free and democratic neighbors. Rather, the undemocratic People's Republic needs to keep bad ideas and influences out, while at the same time keeping its people in. Similarly, it maintains geographic buffers with contiguous countries to insulate itself. Buffer zones create defense in depth, eliminating the need to patrol distant, inhospitable frontiers. A large part of the border between North Korea and Northeast China is the Yalu River: It is difficult to patrol and easily crossed in the winter when it's frozen. China's buffer zones are made up of annexed, non-Han majority territories, which the CCP automatically treats as suspect. In these regions, the CCP uses subversion and favors to create a class of minority collaborators who do the patrolling and monitoring for it. Nowhere is this more visible than in Xinjiang, where a cadre of Vichy Uyghurs identify targets for monitoring, arrest, incarceration, and worse. On the occasion of the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday, it's worth a look at an important and tenuous buffer region: Tibet, once an independent state before the Chinese People's Liberation Army invaded and annexed it in 1950. Beijing hopes to name a more malleable Tibetan leader who lives under its direct control inside China to help pacify Tibetan “separatists.” A similar strategy was employed in restive Hong Kong. Prior to annexation on July 1, 2020, Beijing bribed and threatened an entire class of Hong Kong residents (pro-establishment, as opposed to pan-democrats) to cede control of the territory slowly in the name of preventing even worse outcomes. Many freedom-loving Hong Kong citizens have been arrested retroactively in groups since annexation (the “Hong Kong 47” is a good example) for activities that were legal prior to annexation. Might-makes-right rule is the lowest form of governance (contrary to the four volumes of President Xi Jinping's The Governance of China) — authoritarian rule is far less advanced than systems confident and stable enough to cede control to the governed through elections. Unlike the first Cold War, in today's connected world, nonsensical authoritarian diktats are readily accessed and mocked outside information firewalls, undermining CCP claims of legitimacy. A survey of China's periphery demonstrates the authoritarian's need to isolate itself cognitively through the Great Firewall, pacify reluctant citizens through constant propaganda and indoctrination, and create geographic buffer zones by developing armies of willing minority collaborators. The CCP needs to justify its rule continuously through state-run organs cranking out cringe pro-CCP propaganda, much of it aimed at minority populations in border regions. Chinese television (“government” is redundant) begins each day with a recitation of the general secretary's triumphs. Schools teaching regional minority languages other than Chinese have been under great pressure to close. A recent story detailed how Tibetan preschoolers are taken from their homes and placed in Han Chinese boarding schools. Chinese friends tell me, “If the government says it's black, you know it's white.” However, if a lie is told often enough, early enough, it becomes true no matter how bizarre: People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the CCP, published a serious article titled “Kim Jong-un Named Sexiest Man Alive,” a story lifted from the satirical media outlet The Onion. Or recall that the soundtrack chosen for China's first Tiangong space station launch was “America the Beautiful.” Ensconced in their hermetically sealed information cocoon, the editors of People's Daily and CCTV were unable to understand The Onion's satire or recognize their poor choice of music because asking critical questions is dangerous. Information buffers may work, but they have an enormous downside. Authoritarian Russia's reckless invasions of Ukraine sought to preserve physical separation from both democratic Ukraine and NATO, for the same reasons the Soviet Union annexed Eastern Europe: to keep its incarcerated people ignorant of a better life in free countries. A survey of Chinese border buffer regions — Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, North Korea, and Hong Kong/Taiwan — demonstrates how Beijing seeks to maintain stability and prevent embarrassing mass exodus. Maintaining stability in Tibet requires collaborators backed up by an enormous security presence. Turkic Uyghurs share more with Central Asian and even Middle Eastern cultures than with Han Chinese culture, making the occupation difficult. Beijing goes to extreme lengths to anticipate and eliminate “Uyghur separatists,” even before they've done anything, by deploying loyal Han colonizers to recruit Uyghur collaborators, forcibly live with noncollaborator Uyghur families in their homes to prevent secessionist activities, destroy Muslim Uyghur culture by prohibiting the celebration of Ramadan, forcing Muslims to smoke and drink alcohol, and for those suspected of future terrorist leanings, lock them down in massive “Vocational Training Camps.” Once in these camps, women are given drugs that effectively sterilize them. Uyghur language and culture are being eliminated in what the U.S. government determined to be a literal and cultural genocide, all to create self-policing buffers that insulate core China from adverse outside influence. Tibetan Buddhism is also practiced in Mongolia, which the CCP considers a threat. Her firsthand reporting critical of the CCP's treatment of ethnic Mongolians led to her harassment by PRC security services and eventual deportation. Buffer regions are designed to keep dangerous ideas out and bad news in. As an aside, the buffer concept doesn't seem to apply to the shared border with authoritarian Russia, and Beijing doesn't mind seeing its people settling in Russia's eastern province, which annoys its “no limits” friends in Moscow. Sparsely populated farmland in Russian Siberia attracts Chinese emigres, relieving population pressures in China and leading to the staking of territorial claims for the eventual reincorporation of territory taken from China by Russia following the Opium Wars. With this territory comes the strategic port of Vladivostok, which, until 1860, was known as Haishenwei. Next in the survey of Beijing's periphery comes North Korea. Although it is not currently a democratic state, reunification would see a free, democratic, and unified Korea on China's border. Many tabletop exercises on North Korean instability conclude that Beijing would actively oppose unification of the peninsula under democratic South Korean rule, preferring to prop up a failed North Korean buffer state, as Beijing could not tolerate a burgeoning South Korean economy and vibrant democracy on its border. North Korea provides a convenient and cooperative, although troublesome, buffer. Open hostility between North Korea and China is not unusual — Beijing exerted every bit of its diplomatic muscle, engaging the U.S. to help, to stop North Korea's third nuclear test in March 2013, to no avail. And yet the PRC continues to prop up the Kim regime because it considers the threat of a contiguous free market democracy to be even greater than a nuclear North Korea. In the same way, Kim is not eager to reunite and face crimes against humanity charges as the International Criminal Court threatened in 2014. And so Beijing has a willing collaborator in the North Korea buffer zone. For 75 years, refugees from North Korea have escaped into Northeast China, where human rights groups work to resettle them in South Korea. Beijing often prevents this and forces refugees back into North Korea, where they face certain inhumane punishment. Those who live in free countries have trouble understanding why a government would prevent its people from leaving. Based on experiences following the Bolshevik Revolution, UDHR Article 13 recognizes the harm caused by Soviet policy that prevented its people from fleeing oppression. China is a signatory to the UDHR and, in fact, sent a representative to help draft it, yet Beijing violates it routinely. China exerts greater effort to keep them from leaving. In 2020, Beijing abrogated the Joint Declaration, a U.N.-held treaty with the United Kingdom guaranteeing Hong Kong 50 years of autonomy, after only 23 years. Hong Kong collaborators, the pro-establishment camp, could not stop grassroots protests against increasing PRC infiltration and subversion. The Chinese people watched with interest and envy as Hong Kong soccer fans booed the Chinese national anthem and openly protested Beijing's failure to abide by the Joint Declaration's guarantees of autonomy. Beijing could not allow this open defiance to continue. Hong Kong's shared border with Guangzhou contrasted a free, democratic society with authoritarianism in a way that made Hong Kongers exercising their right to free speech a significant threat to CCP rule. Even if Beijing could use the Great Firewall to block news from Hong Kong, Chinese visitors to Hong Kong could observe democratic freedom firsthand. Following annexation, in August 2020, Beijing no longer tried to maintain the façade of autonomy. even though they were clearly trying to leave. After Beijing abrogated the Joint Declaration, vocal critics like Joshua Wong, Jimmy Lai, and many others have been prevented from leaving and were eventually arrested. The survey of China's troubled periphery ends with Taiwan, which will continue to beckon freedom-loving Chinese people. Sitting 100 miles off the PRC's eastern coast, Taiwan demonstrates that contrary to CCP denials, the Chinese people thrive under democratic rule. PRC citizens watch Taiwan's elections with great interest and quietly wonder why they can't have a voice and a choice in their own governance. As in other border areas, the CCP actively seeks to subvert Taiwan's democratic governance by cultivating collaborators. Certain elements of the Kuomintang party are clearly doing Beijing's bidding. CCP agents take advantage of human greed to get elected representatives and business leaders to put personal financial interests ahead of national interests. Disaffected groups inside China, and diaspora who fled annexation, like the Dalai Lama, and now sit just outside the western border, are looking for rhetorical and material support from the outside. The Soviet experience in Afghanistan during the 1980s is illustrative — an unpopular occupying force had a difficult time operating where it wasn't welcome. In October 2013, a vehicle with three Uyghurs crashed into the rostrum at Tiananmen Square — the three occupants and two bystanders were killed, and the CCP learned that its pacification campaign wouldn't be allowed to focus only on former East Turkistan (Xinjiang). Authoritarian rule sows the seeds of its own demise. Gen. David Stilwell is the Fox fellow for future pacing threats at the Institute for Future Conflict and was a defense attache to Beijing and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's assistant secretary of state for Pacific affairs. He is “wanted” under an active arrest warrant in China.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate has passed about $9 billion in federal spending cuts requested by President Donald Trump, including deep reductions to public broadcasting and foreign aid, moving forward on one of the president's top priorities despite concerns from several Republican senators. ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio — to Adams' station. This photo provided by Kanesia McGlashan-Price shows Lauren Adams, general manager of public radio station KUCB in Unalaska, Alaska, in the broadcast studio Thursday, July 17, 2025. At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS — a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line. Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task — texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. “I thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,” Adams said. The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said. “Many of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,” said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting. Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like “Caillou” and “Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood” to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer. Maine's public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. Maine's rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a “lifeline” to her growing up off the grid. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected. NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. “That is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,” she said. NPR received support Thursday from the heavy metal band Gwar, whose lead singer Blothar the Berserker posted a call on social media for fans to pay attention to what is going on with public media. Already, public media is seeing an increase in donations from reader and viewers to support its mission, and stations are actively sounding the alarm. In a plea to listeners on its website Thursday, Philadelphia's WXPN radio pointed to its legacy in helping people discover new music. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close. Public media isn't getting any help from states, either. At least five states have reduced their own outlays for public media this year, either for budget or political reasons. Ron DeSantis, for example, vetoed nearly $6 million that Florida lawmakers had set aside for public broadcasters the day before the state's budget took effect on July 1. “Done in Florida,” DeSantis responded on social media to a Trump post calling public broadcasting a “monstrosity” that should be defunded. This photo provided by Brian Venua shows Venua, a reporter at the public radio station KMXT, on air, Thursday, July 17, 2025, in Kodiak, Alaska. Back in Alaska, KMXT public radio station's general manager, Jared Griffin, called the Senate vote a “devastating gut punch.” He estimated that the cuts would amount to 22% of KMXT's budget. “We have to dip into our savings while we figure out what KMXT is going to look like over the next six months, Griffin said. Unalaska resident Nikki Whittern said KUCB plays a vital role in the community during emergencies like the tsunami warning. She spoke while preparing to open the Norwegian Rat Saloon — known to local fishermen simply as “the Rat” — on Thursday morning.</p>
