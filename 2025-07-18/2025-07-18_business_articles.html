                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics plunged more than 30% on Friday as the future of its approved gene therapy treatment appeared at risk. Sarepta told CNBC it had not heard from the FDA. Separately, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an interview with Bloomberg News that the agency is considering whether the company's gene therapy should stay on the market. The FDA has been investigating two patient deaths tied to Elevidys, which accounts for more than half of Sarepta's total net product revenue. Elevidys has been mired in controversy even since before it was approved. The gene therapy has yet to clearly prove it can benefit people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a condition that erodes muscle function over time. People with the disease eventually lose the ability to walk, and most die by their early 20s, meaning there's a huge unmet need for treatment. The following year, the agency granted the treatment full approval for patients 4 and older who could still walk and accelerated approval for patients 4 and up who could no longer walk. The latter decision was especially contentious because there was less evidence that Elevidys could help people whose disease had already progressed so much. Then head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Peter Marks, agreed with Sarepta's assessment and overruled FDA staff to expand approval of Elevidys. Earlier this year, Sarepta disclosed that two teenage boys died from liver failure after receiving Elevidys. Then this week, reports emerged that another person died during a Phase 1 trial investigating another one of Sarepta's gene therapies for a different disease. The safety risks of Elevidys are especially important given the uncertain benefit, said BMO analyst Kostas Biliouris. For example, Novartis' gene therapy Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy has also caused liver toxicity and death, but the benefit of that treatment is clear. "That's why deaths here matter so much versus Zolgensma, for example," Biliouris said. And Zolgensma is just one drug of many for a large company like Novartis. Executives this week tried to reassure investors that even if it can only treat patients who can still walk, where deaths haven't been reported, the therapy should bring in at least $500 million a year. Sarepta last month stopped shipping Elevidys to patients who can no longer walk while it explores a safer way to administer the treatment. The company's stock has now fallen more than 87% this year. Jennifer Handt, whose son was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in late 2020, said it was "heartbreaking" that other patients won't have a treatment option to turn to if shipments of Elevidys are paused. Her son, Charlie, was dosed with Elevidys in 2022 as part of Sarepta's late-stage trial and noticed improvements in six to 12 months, including increased stamina and more fluid motions. The drug also eased a telltale symptom of the condition called Gowers' sign, which causes children difficulty when getting up from a sitting or lying position. She said her son is "completely stable" three years out from his dose. "There are families that dealt with this disease before that would have done anything to have an option, even if there are risks." "Every family should have the choice to take this leap with this drug and potentially see benefits," she added. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Friday that he and House Republicans want "maximum transparency" on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and called for more information to be made public. "Everybody wants the Epstein files, which is the real documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and anybody associated with that. We want the American people to see it," Johnson said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." The speaker also insisted that President Donald Trump shares this view. "What I believe in is maximum transparency, and so does President Trump," said Johnson. The comments came after the Wall Street Journal revealed the existence on Thursday of an album of what it called "bawdy" letters compiled for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. "The president and I talked about that ridiculous allegation this morning. "He's so frustrated by it, and he's going to wind up, I think, suing some of the media outlets that have put all this out there because [the White House] informed them that it was totally contrived," Johnson added. Yet just as the White House mounted a full-scale messaging campaign to discredit the Journal's reporting, Trump also bowed to some of the pressure he is under from Republicans to reveal more about the case against Epstein. Late Thursday evening, Trump announced that he has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to release "any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval" on Epstein. Grand jury transcripts are generally kept tightly sealed under federal judicial rules, however, raising questions about why Trump's order to Bondi was limited to these records and not evidence uncovered during the investigation. Johnson told CNBC the rules about grand jury testimony are intended to protect the identities of innocent victims, and to guard against the airing of "bogus allegations that would be made against people that can't be authenticated." Aside from records that would be "held back from a court of law," said Johnson, "I say put it out there, and I think the president believes the same." The remarks underscore the dilemma that Johnson and Republicans in Congress face as they seek to satisfy their base's demands and suspicions about Epstein, without crossing a president who insists the theories are a hoax perpetuated by Democrats. The wealthy financier died by suicide in 2019, shortly after he was arrested on federal charges of child sex trafficking. The circumstances of Epstein's death and his connections in life to wealthy and powerful men — some of whom allegedly abused young women on Epstein's properties — have fueled conspiracy theories about what the Justice Department might have uncovered during their years long investigation of him. Some Republicans in Congress have sided with those efforts. The Republican-led House Rules Committee voted Thursday night to advance a resolution calling on the DOJ to release Epstein-related information. On Friday morning, Trump wrote, "If there was a 'smoking gun' on Epstein, why didn't the Dems, who controlled the 'files' for four years, and had Garland and Comey in charge, use it?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI agents assigned earlier this year to review investigative files in the criminal case against notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were instructed to "flag" any documents that mentioned President Donald Trump, Sen. Richard Durbin said Friday. Durbin's claim came as the Illinois Democrat sent the Justice Department and FBI letters asking them to explain what his office called "apparent discrepancies regarding the handling of the Epstein files and findings from a July 7 Department of Justice (DOJ) memorandum and instructions reportedly received by FBI personnel." Durbin's letters, which were addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, added to pressure on the Trump administration over Bondi's decision to withhold from the public evidence about Epstein despite past promises that it would be released. The senator's description of instructions given to FBI agents regarding mentions of Trump's name was made in the letter to Patel. Trump is a former friend of Epstein, who died from suicide in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on child sex trafficking charges. On Thursday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that a "bawdy" letter bearing Trump's signature was sent to Epstein in 2003 for this 50th birthday. Trump has angrily denied writing such a letter and said he will sue the Journal. "According to information my office received, the FBI was pressured to put approximately 1,000 personnel in its Information Management Division (IMD) … on 24-hour shifts to review approximately 100,000 Epstein-related records in order to produce more documents that could then be released on an arbitrarily short deadline," Durbin wrote to Patel. "This effort, which reportedly took place from March 14 through the end of March, was haphazardly supplemented by hundreds of FBI New York Field Office personnel, many of whom lacked the expertise to identify statutorily-protected information regarding child victims and child witnesses or properly handle FOIA requests," the letter said. "My office was told that these personnel were instructed to 'flag' any records in which President Trump was mentioned." We want to hear from you.

"This code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act." Last week, the European Commission published a final iteration of its code for general-purpose AI models, leaving it up to companies to decide if they want to sign. The rules, which go into effect next month, create a framework for complying with the AI Act passed by European lawmakers last year. It aims to improve transparency and safety surrounding the technology. Meta isn't the first company to stand up against Europe's new AI rulebook. Last week, OpenAI committed to signing the code of practice. "We share concerns raised by these businesses that this over-reach will throttle the development and deployment of frontier AI models in Europe, and stunt European companies looking to build businesses on top of them," Kaplan wrote. Kaplan replaced former global affairs chief Nick Clegg earlier this year. He previously served as vice president of U.S. policy at Facebook and was a staffer in President George W.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Consumers' worst fears about tariff-induced inflation have receded, though they are still wary of price increases to come, according to a University of Michigan survey Friday. The university's closely watched Survey of Consumers for July showed overall sentiment increased slightly, rising 1.8% from June to 61.8, exactly in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate and at its highest level since February. Questions on current conditions and future expectations produced monthly gains as well. On inflation, the outlook at the one- and five-year horizons both tumbled, falling to their lowest levels since February, before President Donald Trump made his "liberation day" tariff announcement on April 2. The one-year forecast plunged to 4.4%, down from 5% in June and well off the 6.6% level in May, which was the highest reading since late 1981. "Both readings are the lowest since February 2025 but remain above December 2024, indicating that consumers still perceive substantial risk that inflation will increase in the future," Joanne Hsu, survey director, said in a statement. "Despite risks of rising consumer inflation in the next few months, consumers have well-anchored expectations that tariff inflation will be temporary, and that conditions should improve by the time we enter 2026," said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. "Inflation expectation is an important factor for the Fed and according to this report, the trajectory looks encouraging." However, in recent days he has announced tariffs on individual products such as copper, raising the specter of future price increases. The readings are below their long-term averages, with the headline sentiment index down 6.9% from a year ago and 16% from December. We want to hear from you.

The government finally disclosed to me the auction price for Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, the seventh studio album by renowned hip-hop group, Wu-Tang Clan. The Justice Department seized the album in 2018 from Martin Shkreli, the notorious pharmaceutical executive and hedge fund manager who was convicted of securities fraud. After spending more than four years trying to pry loose that detail, I just got it! If you're not already getting FOIA Files in your inbox, sign up here. I assume most people know the story by now. Wu-Tang Clan sold the only copy of their 31-track album, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, at auction in 2015 to Shkreli for about $2 million. The album, conceived as a work of art, was pressed onto two compact discs and stored in a vault in Casablanca before it was sold. The buyer had to agree that they would not duplicate it or play it commercially for 88 years—until 2103.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is reassessing its flagship $500 billion futuristic city called The Line. The public investment fund has tapped consulting firms to conduct a strategic review into the feasibility of the 105-mile linear city, located at Neom — itself a huge new development in Saudi Arabia. Neom confirmed the news, first reported by Bloomberg, saying that strategic checks are "common practice" on long-term megaprojects. But the move comes amid global scrutiny of Saudi Arabia's ambitious infrastructure agenda, as well as growing pressure on public finances. Neom did not detail what the review would be focused on, but "it's likely that it's going to look at technical feasibility, financing and also economic impact," according to Tim Callen, a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute. "I think these are all areas where people have had questions in the past; is the technology there to actually achieve what Neom wants to do? Is the cost of development too high? That's clearly become an even more pressing issue as oil prices have headed down the last couple of years," Callen told CNBC's Access Middle East on Friday. The site of The Line, in Saudi Arabia's northwestern desert, is currently a sprawling construction site replete with cranes and pile drivers, and a recently built road. Long parallel tracks cut through the sand, comprising the spine of what planners say will be a high-speed rail system. It's designed to be a high-tech city sandwiched between two glass skyscrapers — each more than 1,600 feet high — which the Saudi government says will eventually house 9 million people. It's a core pillar of Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil revenues and create new jobs and industries for its burgeoning young population. After many years of seemingly unlimited spending, 2024 began to see an abrupt shift as the Saudi budget deficit grew and the price of a barrel of oil fell well below what the kingdom needs to balance its budget. "It's clear that if oil prices, as you were saying earlier, are around $70 a barrel, that's a very different environment than if they are $100 a barrel, where they were on average in 2022," the Arab Gulf States Institute's Callen said. Does that mean Neon is not going to happen? No, I think Neom will definitely continue in some form. But whether it's on a smaller scale and over a longer duration than originally envisaged, is quite likely, I think." There has also been a fair amount of criticism for what some in the kingdom describe as a "yes-man" mentality at Neom, where consultants and advisors are said to provide highly optimistic forecasts and cost-revenue projections in an effort to stay in their employers' favor. "I don't think expectations were managed well from a leadership perspective at the project level," Tarik Solomon, chairman emeritus at the American Chamber of Commerce in Saudi Arabia, told CNBC. Solomon praised Neom and The Line as being "one of the boldest ideas I've seen that has actually gone into execution," but added that "the architectural and consulting firms involved have an important role here and they should have more of a sense of ownership and responsibility to carry."

The AI Race:

BrightAI raised $51 million to sell sensors and software that monitor infrastructure.

While many artificial intelligence tools are aimed at software developers and office workers, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla and former Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker's Inspired Capital are investing in a startup deploying the technology for dirty, time-consuming infrastructure maintenance tasks like pest control and inspecting power poles and air-conditioning systems. 

San Francisco-based BrightAI has raised a $51 million Series A round led by Khosla Ventures  and Inspired Capital, along with BoxGroup, Marlinspike and VSC Ventures. The round valued the company at around $300 million, according to a person familiar with the company who didn't want to be named discussing financial details. Upfront Ventures led a previous round, and the company has raised a total of $78 million. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He's in the early stages of talking to potential investors and hedge fund service providers, according to five people who've been briefed on the plans. Zhang intends to call his firm Hippocampus Capital Management, the sources said, and is targeting a launch date in early 2026, one of the people said. It's not clear how much capital he's looking to raise. Industry sources expect the launch to generate significant interest from investors, given Zhang's reputation and track record. His alpha research has been responsible for billions in trading profits for Two Sigma over the course of his career, the people said. Two Sigma, which has 1,700 employees today, was a comparatively small firm when it hired Zhang in 2007, operating in what was then the secretive hedge fund niche of quant trading. The fund was on the vanguard of machine learning, an early artificial intelligence method that helps computers make decisions and predictions, and recognize patterns. Zhang, with his specializations in both stats and computer science, early on developed lucrative trading models focused on machine-learning non-linear techniques — uncovering complex, non-obvious patterns in market data — people familiar with Zhang said. While Two Sigma would pursue other machine-learning initiatives, techniques became the crown jewel and a closely guarded secret. The small footprint Zhang does have online comes from university press stories connected to his donations — which have ramped up in recent years — to the California Institute of Technology and the University of California at Berkeley. "That training and education has been a cornerstone in my life," Zhang said in the 2024 announcement of his endowment of a Berkeley professorship. While studying at Berkeley, Zhang lived with another math and stats whiz named Peng Zhao, according to several people who know them. Zhang joined Two Sigma after completing his doctorate; Zhao helped build Citadel Securities, where he was named CEO in 2017. Two Sigma has historically maintained a low profile, as is common with quant investment firms. But its last two years have been uncharacteristically tumultuous, highlighted by the long-simmering cold war between founders John Overdeck and David Siegel that burst into public view in 2023. The firm grappled with another scandal that year when a rogue researcher from the techniques unit was accused of unilaterally tampering with trading models, resulting in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and $90 million in civil penalties earlier this year (Two Sigma denied wrongdoing). Zhang's techniques unit hasn't been immune to the leadership shakeups. Ken Baron stepped down in 2024, and Kan Huang left for Cubist Systematic Strategies last fall. Zhang went on sabbatical last year and departed in late 2024, the people said. Quant fund startups are notoriously expensive to get off the ground — costing millions for the necessary data and technology — and can take years to yield returns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even Google's head of Android, Sameer Samat thinks the computer science major needs a rebrand. "It is the science, in my opinion, of solving problems." While coding is a skill taught as part of the major, the discipline is more about breaking down problems, learning how to design a system, and collaborating on those tasks, Samat said. AI is increasingly handling fundamental tasks like coding, making it harder for some computer science graduates to secure full-time positions and internships. The head of Android said that when he learned to code, people had just stopped learning Assembly, a low-level programming language, and started coding in other languages. "Maybe someday it'll be natural language, where we're just talking about what we want, and something is building the underlying software for you," Samat said. But he doesn't think that time will come for "a while." Students shouldn't become computer science majors just because they think others will find it valuable, Samat said. The Android executive said that mindset won't necessarily be shared by their prospective employer, and job seekers should have "passion" outside of computer science. "I don't think that the degree enough is enough to make yourself relevant for some of the most important companies," Samat said, adding that you need to take it "to the next level." Samat draws from personal experience, having launched two startups in his early twenties, one of which led to an introduction to Sergey Brin. He said that building a startup early in his career ultimately made him a more effective contributor when he later joined Google. Whatever other interest you have, said Samat, "I think it's really important that it be something that you're really excited about going deep in and really becoming a 5% top expert in the field."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix used generative AI to save money on a recent production — and the company's co-CEO said he was "thrilled" with the results. Sarandos said the show is the first Netflix title to use fully AI-generated shots in its final footage, with a sequence that shows the collapse of a building in Buenos Aires. Without AI, Sarandos said, such an effect would not have been cost-effective for a production the size of "The Eternaut." "In fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with visual, traditional VFX tools and workflows," Sarandos told analysts during Netflix's quarterly earnings call. Sarandos said everyone was "thrilled" with the final product. We were thrilled with the result," he said. So, I think these tools are helping creators expand the possibilities of storytelling on screen, and that is endlessly exciting." Sarandos has previously spoken about the use of AI on Rodrigo Prieto's film "Pedro Paramo" and how much money was saved using AI for deaging effects as opposed to what it cost for Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman." Demands over AI usage were at the center of the historic dual actors and writers' strikes that shut down production in 2023. Fans expressed frustration at Disney in 2023 over Marvel Studios' choice to use AI for credit art in "Secret Invasion," a Disney+ series. Visual effects is one area of Hollywood that could be drastically changed by AI, as audiences demand explosive climaxes and superhero features that strain production budgets. As Netflix's news illustrates, it won't just be summer blockbusters that are changed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla and Waymo seem to be duking it out over who has the bigger size — and size in this case refers to the companies' respective robotaxi boundaries in Austin. Waymo has been offering self-driving rides to the general public for a few months, and Tesla has been testing out rides to a limited number of invitees last month. Three days after Tesla showed off an expanded, phallic-shaped geofence in Austin, Waymo on Thursday said that it has more than doubled its service area in the city from about 37 square miles to 90 square miles. The coverage area includes new neighborhoods such as Crestview, Windsor Park, Sunset Valley, Franklin Park, and more, according to Waymo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has pledged that the robotaxi service will ramp up quickly. Waymo said that the service area expansion will allow more people in Austin to experience a fully autonomous ride. Users can only opt in for the option. This means the app will decide to pair users up with a human driver or a robotaxi, depending on what's available first or what's more time-efficient. When trying to hail a Waymo in Downtown Austin on Thursday, Business Insider found in repeated tests that Uber will pair users with a human driver when the destination calls for going on the 35 highway or MoPac Expressway. Waymo currently doesn't take public passengers on the highway. Chris Bonelli, a spokesperson for Waymo, told BI in an email that a rider will likely be matched with an Uber driver if a more optimal route requires going on the freeway. Waymo employees are currently taking fully autonomous freeway rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, Bonelli said.</p>
