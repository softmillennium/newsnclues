                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cuproptosis represents a novel mechanism of cell death characterized by intracellular copper ion accumulation. Unlike other cell death pathways, its unique process has garnered significant interest due to its promising applications in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Emerging evidence suggests that copper metabolism and cuproptosis may play a dual regulatory role in pathological cellular environments, particularly in modulating oxidative stress responses, metabolic reprogramming, and immunotherapeutic efficacy. Appropriate copper levels can promote disease progression and exert synergistic effects, but beyond a certain threshold, copper may suppress disease development by inducing cuproptosis in pathological cells. This makes dysregulated copper levels a potential novel therapeutic target for IBD and CRC. This provides new research directions for the future development of cuproptosis inducers. As an essential trace element, copper homeostasis imbalance can lead to cell death, with cuproptosis representing a newly identified copper-dependent cell death mechanism. In IBD, copper affects intestinal barrier function by regulating oxidative stress and immune responses. For example, excessive copper exacerbates oxidative stress and damages intestinal epithelial cells, while copper chelators can alleviate inflammation by inhibiting the NF-ÎºB pathway. These findings reveal the complex role of copper metabolism and cuproptosis in intestinal diseases. Interaction between cuproptosis and the tumor immune microenvironment Studies have found that copper complex nanoparticles (Cu(I)NPs) can induce cuproptosis and release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation and CD8+ T cell infiltration. In addition, copper ionophores (e.g., disulfiram/copper complexes) enhance anti-tumor immune responses by promoting M1 macrophage polarization and suppressing PD-L1 expression. These findings demonstrate that cuproptosis can potentiate existing immunotherapies through immune modulation, offering novel strategies to overcome tumor resistance. Copper metabolism-related proteins (including ATP7A/B and FDX1) have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for CRC. Furthermore, copper-based nanomedicines (e.g., E-C@DOX NPs) combined with chemotherapy or photothermal therapy have significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy. Synergistic Effects Between Cuproptosis and Other Cell Death Pathways Cuproptosis exhibits crosstalk with other cell death mechanisms such as apoptosis and ferroptosis. Additionally, cuproptosis-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. These synergistic effects provide new insights for developing combination therapies, though precise regulation of copper homeostasis remains a challenge. As a newly identified mechanism of cellular demise, cuproptosis is undergoing rigorous investigation across diverse disciplines, including chemotherapy, TME regulation, immune-based therapies, and outcome prediction, to develop more effective cancer management strategies. However, the study of cuproptosis is still a nascent field, with current studies primarily focused on its correlation with IBD and CRC. Numerous underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated, necessitating additional fundamental investigations. Future investigations should focus on deciphering the precise molecular pathways that govern Cu metabolism and cuproptosis in the context of IBD and CRC, as well as explore strategies to modulate Cu levels to maximize therapeutic efficacy. Despite its potential, several challenges remain in cuproptosis research, which also pose obstacles for clinical applications. First, the potential clinical applications and safety concerns related to cuproptosis modulation remain to be fully explored, posing significant challenges for the clinical translation of cuproptosis inducers. Both copper deficiency and excess can induce systemic toxicity, necessitating additional clinical studies to evaluate how copper level modulation affects prognosis in IBD and CRC patients. Such investigations are crucial for improving the targeting efficiency and in vivo stability of these therapeutic agents. Second, Cu's potential as a therapeutic target needs further exploration. This includes developing therapies based on Cu metabolism and cuproptosis, such as gene knockouts and cell-based approaches, while research efforts are shifting toward novel copper inducers, including plant-derived compounds, synthetic molecules, and nanotechnology-based carriers, to improve targeted drug delivery to affected cells. Combining cuproptosis with immunotherapy could offer a promising strategy to combat IBD and CRC, significantly improving treatment outcomes and extending patient survival. Comprehending the interplay between cuproptosis and alternative forms of cellular demise constitutes another pivotal research domain. Investigating the connections between cuproptosis and other kind of pathways, including apoptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, may deepen our comprehension of Cu-related diseases and accelerate the progression of targeted therapies to induce tumor cell death more effectively. Looking forward, the discovery of specific biomarkers and personalized antitumor strategies will likely enable the clinical translation of therapies based on Cu metabolism and cuproptosis. In summary, cuproptosis represents a potential novel therapeutic avenue for IBD and CRC. Advancing understanding of cuproptosis regulation and enhancing its induction efficiency position this pathway as a novel therapeutic strategy for disease intervention. This strategy has the potential not only to suppress disease onset and progression effectively but also to improve patient survival and quality of life through precision therapies. Therefore, understanding the involvement of cuproptosis in pathological processes and developing related treatment strategies holds substantial scientific and medical importance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last year in Massachusetts, after finding lumps in her breast, Jessica Chen went to Lowell General Hospital-Saints Campus, part of Tufts Medicine, for a mammogram and sonogram. She was more than a little surprised weeks later to receive a bill asking her to pay an additional $1,677.51. "I was already trying to stomach $359, and this was many times higher," Chen, a physician assistant, told me. The No Surprises Act, which took effect in 2022, was rightly heralded as a landmark piece of legislation, which "protects people covered under group and individual health plans from receiving surprise medical bills," according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. And yet bills that take patients like Chen by surprise just keep coming. With the help of her software-wise boyfriend, she found the complicated "machine-readable" master price list that hospitals are required to post online and looked up the negotiated rate between Lowell General and her insurer. It was $302.56 â less than she had paid out-of-pocket. She received a terse email in return: "We have reviewed your complaint and have determined that the rights and protections of the No Surprises Act do not apply." When I asked the health system to explain how such a surprising off-estimate bill could be generated, Tufts Medicine spokesperson Jeremy Lechan responded by email: "Healthcare billing is complex and includes various factors and data points, so actual charges for care provided may differ from initial estimates. We understand the frustration these discrepancies can cause." Here's the problem: While the No Surprises Act has been a phenomenal success in taking on some unfair practices in the wild West of medical billing, it was hardly a panacea.In fact, the measure protected patients primarily from only one particularly egregious type of surprise bill that had become increasingly common before the law's enactment: When patients unknowingly got out-of-network care at an in-network facility, or when they had no choice but to get out-of-network care in an emergency. In either case, before President Donald Trump signed the law late in his first term, patients could be hit with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in out-of-network bills that their insurance wouldn't pay. The No Surprises Act also provided some protection from above-estimate bills, but at the moment, the protection is only for uninsured and self-pay patients, so it wouldn't apply in Chen's case since she was using health insurance. But patients who do qualify generally are entitled to an up-front, good-faith estimate for treatment they schedule at least three business days in advance or if they request one. Patients can dispute a bill if it is more than $400 over the estimate. (The No Surprises Act also required what amounted to a good-faith estimate of out-of-pocket costs for patients with insurance, but that provision has not been implemented, since, nearly five years later, the government still has not issued rules about exactly what form it should take.) So, surprising medical bills â bills that the patient could not have anticipated and never consented to â are still stunning countless Americans. Jessica Robbins, who works in product development in Chicago, was certainly surprised when, out of the blue, she was recently billed $3,300 by Endeavor Health for a breast MRI she had received two years earlier, with prior authorization from her then-insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois. In trying to resolve the problem, she found herself caught in a Kafkaesque circle involving dozens of calls and emails. "We are actively working with the patient and their insurer to resolve this matter," Endeavor spokesperson Allie Burke said in an emailed response to my questions. When her doctor from Kaiser Permanente didn't answer requests to order the test for several days, Bonita went to an emergency room and paid $595 up front for the X-ray, which showed no TB. So she and her husband were surprised to receive another bill, for $1,039, a month later, "with no explanation of what it was for," said Joel Pickford, Bonita's husband. In the cases above, each patient questioned an expensive, unexpected medical charge that came as a shock â only to find that the No Surprises Act didn't apply. The No Surprises Act fixed a specific kind of charge, he said, "and that's great. But, of course, we need to address others." Cooper's research has found that before the No Surprises Act was passed, more than 25% of emergency room visits yielded a surprise out-of-network bill. CMS' official No Surprises Help Desk has received tens of thousands of complaints, which it investigates, said Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson. "While some billing practices, such as delayed bills, are not currently regulated" by the No Surprises Act, Howden said, complaint trends nonetheless help "inform potential areas for future improvements." She went to Cleveland Clinic's Lakewood Family Health Center for an examination. As was her nasal swab â except for the stunning $2,700 bill it generated. And in any case, Rodio was not legally entitled to a binding estimate, since the part of the No Surprises Act that grants patients with insurance that right has not been implemented yet. So she was stuck with a bill of $471 (the patient responsibility portion of the $2,700 charge) that she couldn't have consented to (or rejected) in advance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two junior research groups at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, have developed a drug complex that kills cancer cells in such a clever manner that they raise a red flag as they die. They signal to the immune system that something is seriously wrong with this type of cell. This could remove metastases that develop at distant sites in the body. Dr. Johannes Karges from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Dr. Carlos Plaza-Sirvent from the Department of Medicine present their findings in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry on July 17, 2025. 90 percent of all deaths from cancer are due to metastases. This is why Karges and his team are looking for ways to train the immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells. "The gallium complex we developed penetrates the cells and, because of its special properties, causes oxidative stress in a certain cell organelle known as the endoplasmic reticulum," he explains. The cells then undergo immunogenic cell death, which only very few drugs can achieve." Dr. Johannes Karges, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr-Universitaet-Bochum Through this type of cell death, proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell nucleus are released to the outside and act as a strong warning signal to the immune system: Something is wrong here, these cells are harmful. The two teams led by Johannes Karges and Carlos Plaza-Sirvent have successfully tested the active ingredient on cervical cancer cell lines. The next step is to package it in such a way that it accumulates specifically in cancer cells and is effective only there, and not in all cells of the body. Karges' research group has already developed various methods for this, for example, which active ingredients are activated by an external signal such as ultrasound or light. Papadopoulos, Z., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Complex processes are going on in the brain when we sleep," says Dr Karolina ArmonaitÄ, a neuroscientist from Kaunas University of Technology, Lithuania. According to her, a more precise understanding of what happens in different areas of the cerebral cortex during sleep can help diagnose sleep disorders and neurological diseases more accurately. "Schizophrenia, for example, is characterised by disrupted synchronisation between different areas, while Alzheimer's disease often starts with very subtle functional changes in one area of the cortex, even before symptoms become apparent," says ArmonaitÄ, explaining the importance of research aimed at differentiating the functional areas of the cortex. Functional cortex parcelling was the subject of ArmonaitÄ's research during her PhD studies at the University of Uninettuno in Italy. "The cerebral cortex is not homogeneous, and different areas can behave differently depending on whether a person is awake, asleep or in a state of transition between these stages. My study was aimed at determining whether we can identify cortical areas based solely on their electrical activity, not only in the absence of external stimuli, but also during different stages of sleep," explains the researcher from the KTU Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. A deeper understanding of how the brain works even when resting is important for the diagnosis and prevention of both neurological and sleep disorders, she says. This map of the cerebral cortex is still widely used in both clinical practice and neuroscience research. According to Dr ArmonaitÄ, distinguishing between the cortex and other structures in the brain allows specific areas to be linked to specific functions, such as vision, language, motor skills or long-term memory storage. Knowing which areas are responsible for certain behavioural or sensory aspects can help to better understand how different neurological disorders affect these functions. "For example, Parkinson's disease is often associated with degeneration of the substantia nigra, a structure in a deep area of the brain that is responsible for controlling movement. Damage to this area leads to typical symptoms of the disease, such as tremors or slowness of movement," says the researcher. She explains that the distinction between brain regions is also important for building models of brain activity, for studying the effects of psychiatric diseases on different brain regions, or for understanding why certain symptoms occur in the presence of specific lesions. "In addition, brain-computer interfaces also rely on precise localisation of neural activity," says ArmonaitÄ. The KTU researcher's study analysed intracranial electroencephalogram (sEEG) recordings from 55 patients. Such data is extremely rare because it is only collected when patients undergo neurosurgical intervention, typically for drug-resistant epilepsy," explains Dr ArmonaitÄ. To understand whether different cortical areas transmit information differently and why, she started by analysing the neurophysiological signals from the most clearly defined areas - sensory, motor and auditory - whose functions have been studied most. "We often hear about neurodegenerative disorders and the search for their biomarkers to make an early diagnosis. And can we detect its activity markers while at rest? It's not just chaotic noise, but rather a lot of encoded information in the electrical signals transmitted between neurons," says ArmonaitÄ. "Now it would be interesting to go even further - for example, to create models of brain activity based on certain features of these areas and apply them to detect very early abnormalities, such as incipient neurodegenerative processes. Also, the markers of healthy cortical areas of the brain, observed during sleep, could be compared with data from patients with sleep disorders," says ArmonaitÄ. Knowing the cell structure, interactions and electrical parameters, it would be possible to simulate how such an area would react to, for example, electrical stimulation. "This could eventually contribute to the development of personalised neurological therapies," says ArmonaitÄ. One practical application of research on the human brain at rest could be the diagnosis of sleep disorders, she said. While most methods assess sleep in a rather generalised way, a detailed study of the activity of cortical areas could help to identify more precisely which areas of the brain function differently and why. "This is relevant because sleep, although it may seem like a passive state, is a very dynamic process, involving consolidation of information, metabolic cleaning, and reorganisation of synapses," explains the researcher. "Subtle changes in neural activity during sleep may also indicate the onset of neurodegenerative processes." If we know how a healthy cerebral cortex should behave in different states or functional tasks, she says, we can look for deviations from this normal pattern, which can help us detect the disease before it shows clear symptoms. In addition to early diagnosis and prevention, this would also contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of the diseases themselves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by researchers from the University of Eastern Finland and a team of international collaborators shows that dengue outbreaks in MedellÃ­n, Colombia, are strongly linked to patterns of urban development and socioeconomic status. The findings highlight the potential of leveraging land-use planning and targeted public health strategies to more effectively control dengue in hyperendemic areas. By analyzing more than 40,000 georeferenced dengue cases recorded between 2010 and 2020, the study found that just 26% of the city's neighbourhoods accounted for 50% of all infections. These "hotspot" areas were predominantly located in low- and middle-income communities with built-up land cover. In contrast, neighborhoods with higher socioeconomic status and more green space experienced far fewer outbreaks. What's striking is that many of these hotspots are not isolated incidents. Juliana PÃ©rez-PÃ©rez, Doctoral Researcher, study's lead author, University of Eastern Finland Using spatial statistics across 249 barrios in MedellÃ­n, the research team identified both single-year and recurrent hotspots. These patterns varied depending on whether the year was classified as epidemic, non-epidemic or severe epidemic, but certain areas consistently appeared as high-risk zones. Traditional dengue control programmes tend to apply the same measures across entire cities, but the findings suggest a more strategic approach is needed. By combining epidemiological surveillance with insights from land use and urban planning, public health interventions can be more targeted and effective. "Dengue is often seen as a challenge for the Global South, but the conditions that favour its spread - urbanisation, social inequality and warming climate - are now increasingly present elsewhere too," PÃ©rez-PÃ©rez adds. "This study shows that the spatial and social dynamics of dengue are not random. Recognizing how land use and socioeconomic status shape disease risk can help us not only target local responses in places like MedellÃ­n, but also prepare other regions, including parts of Europe, for what may soon become a growing public health challenge."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A newly released study from Duke University's Pontzer Lab, housed in the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology in Trinity College of Arts & Sciences, looks at the correlations between economic development, daily energy expenditure and the rise in a country's obesity level. While many experts have offered that rising obesity rates are due to declining physical activity as societies become more industrialized, the findings show that people in wealthier countries expend just as much - or even more - energy daily. In an article recently published in PNAS, Duke researchers point instead to higher caloric intake as the primary driver, suggesting that diet rather than idleness plays the bigger role in the global obesity crisis. Despite decades of trying to understand the root causes of the obesity crisis in economically developed countries, public health guidance remains stuck with uncertainty as to the relative importance of diet and physical activity. This large, international, collaborative effort allows us to test these competing ideas. It's clear that changes in diet, not reduced activity, are the main cause of obesity in the U.S. and other developed countries." Herman Pontzer, Principal Investigator and Professor, Department of Evolutionary Anthropology, Duke University The researchers analyzed thousands of measurements of daily energy expenditure, body fat percentage and body mass index (BMI) from adults aged 18 to 60 across 34 populations spanning six continents. The more than 4,200 adults included in the study came from a wide range of lifestyles and economies, including hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, farming and industrialized populations. To further categorize the level of industrialization, they also integrated data from the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) to incorporate measures of lifespan, prosperity and education. "While we saw a marginal decrease in total energy expenditure with economic development, differences in total energy expenditure explained only a fraction of the increase in body fat that accompanied development. This suggests that other factors, such as dietary changes, are driving the increases in body fat that we see with increasing economic development," says Amanda McGrosky, a Duke postdoctoral alumna and lead investigator for the study who is now an assistant professor of biology at Elon University. Instead, the data support an emerging consensus that both diet and exercise should be prioritized. They will next work to identify which aspects of diet in developed countries are most responsible for the rise in obesity. McGrosky, A., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soft tissue cytopathology plays a vital role in the diagnosis and management of soft tissue neoplasms, necessitating a standardized classification system to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide clinical decision-making. This article provides a concise review of the World Health Organization (WHO) Reporting System for Soft Tissue Cytopathology and presents a practical diagnostic approach to soft tissue cytopathology. The WHO Reporting System is reviewed in conjunction with relevant literature. The reporting system employs a six-category framework: non-diagnostic, benign, atypical, soft tissue neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential, suspicious for malignancy, and malignant. Each category is associated with a corresponding risk of malignancy and recommended clinical management guidelines. The system supports a probabilistic approach to risk stratification, enabling more consistent diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This structured reporting system aligns with the WHO Classification of Soft Tissue and Bone Tumours (5th edition), ensuring that cytopathological findings are reproducible, clinically actionable, and globally applicable. The approach integrates cytomorphological features, ancillary testing, and clinical correlation, emphasizing a probabilistic framework for risk stratification and decision-making. Furthermore, advancements in molecular diagnostics, ICC, and NGS are expected to enhance the accuracy and specificity of FNAB-based diagnoses, reinforcing the role of cytopathology in the evaluation of soft tissue tumors. Given the increasing trend of obtaining CNBs of soft tissue lesions with rapid on-site evaluation for cellularity via touch imprint cytology, it would be valuable to determine whether this approach is also applicable in this context. Additionally, it is important to assess whether the clinical team supports this reporting system, as they are the primary end users with whom communication is intended. The hope is that by following this structured reporting format, the WHO Reporting System for Soft Tissue Cytopathology will ensure FNAB diagnoses are clear, reproducible, and clinically actionable. The integration of cytomorphological features, ROM assessment, ancillary testing, and clinical correlation will enhance the diagnostic accuracy of soft tissue FNAB and facilitate appropriate patient management. It is important that the readers of this article refer to the exact wording and specific details related to the definition for each diagnostic category, risk of malignancy (ROM), and management recommendations as provided in the WHO Reporting System for Soft Tissue Cytopathology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The use of social media is contributing to declining attention spans, emotional volatility, and compulsive behaviors among young people, reveals a new report by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) and Singapore-based research agency Research Network, in collaboration with US-based AI platform ListenLabs.ai. It found that prolonged social media use is associated with difficulties in sustaining focus, increased emotional fatigue, and behaviors resembling addiction. This research comes at a time when policymakers across the United States and Europe are scrutinising the broader effects of social media on public health and national security, especially in relation to platforms such as TikTok. Lead investigator of the study, Professor Gemma Calvert, a neuroscientist from the Nanyang Centre for Marketing Technologies (NCMT) at NTU Singapore's Nanyang Business School said: "With global discussions about the impact of platforms like TikTok happening now, our findings provide crucial evidence of the real-world effects on young minds. "The challenges revealed in our study are not just individual issues but societal concerns that warrant attention from everyone, including policymakers, educators and tech companies". The study found that 68 per cent of youth participants reported difficulty focusing, while many described struggling to complete schoolwork or engage with content lasting more than a minute. One teen said: "TikTok has made my attention span so low that I can't even watch a one-minute video." "The brain is being trained to seek constant novelty and instant rewards through dopamine-driven feedback loops," explained Prof Calvert. "Over time, this reduces our ability to focus or engage in deep thinking. It mirrors patterns seen in addiction, where more stimulation is needed to feel satisfied." The findings provide crucial subjective experience data, complementing earlier brain imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which shows that social media triggers the brain's dopamine reward system in ways that mimic addiction. Comparative results between Singapore and Australia also revealed distinct differences in opinions: Singaporean youth credited in-school phone restrictions by the Ministry of Education for curbing compulsive use, while many Australian teens expressed concern over the lack of similar boundaries or guidance. We must move beyond cosmetic features like screen-time limits that are easily bypassed and stop designing to monetise attention. "We need default-on safeguards embedded in social platforms, such as scroll breaks, time-use cues, social comparison prompts, and attention-aware interface design, to help young users pause, reflect, and choose more intentionally. We must design for awareness, not dependence, so young people can reclaim their focus in a system that profits from distraction," added Mr. Breeze, who is also an educator and behavioural researcher. Ranked 1st in Asia and 5th globally for Data Science & AI by QS, NTU adopts an interdisciplinary approach to applying AI across education, research, and innovation to develop solutions for the complex challenges facing society today. The study was conducted using ListenLabs.ai, an AI-powered interviewing platform backed by Sequoia Capital, the venture firm behind companies such as Apple and Google. Unlike traditional surveys, this approach enabled natural, voice-recorded responses to text-based prompts, resulting in richer and more authentic insights. In just two days, the research team gathered and analysed anonymized, open-ended responses from a diverse participant base. Using AI to detect emotional tone and behavioral patterns, the platform generated deep insights into emerging social trends, turning the usual six months of manual analysis into just two days. The research was inspired by Miss Ella Carnegie-Brown, a 19-year-old intern at Research Network, who observed growing concern among her peers about their compulsive social media habits, which were increasingly affecting their studies and real-life social connections. "As a Gen Z-er myself, I believe it's vital to raise awareness and deepen our understanding of how social media is not only shaping our daily lives, but also influencing our futures," said Miss Carnegie-Brown, who added that the study gave her generation "a voice to express the emotional toll" and "the uncertainty" they feel. The full study will be made available soon to education policymakers, schools, and technology stakeholders in both Singapore and Australia, with plans underway for follow-up research to track attention and emotional health trends across a longer period.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, the findings show that newly introduced long-lasting vaccines can help to mitigate these gaps. Malaria, already a persistent global health challenge, poses new threats from climate change, not only through rising temperatures that shift mosquito dynamics but also via extreme weather events like tropical cyclones. Such disasters can severely disrupt public health infrastructure, limit access to malaria prevention and treatment, and increase infection risk, especially in high-burden regions where continuity of care and malaria control is critical. However, despite concerns, data on how climate-related disruptions affect malaria control remain scarce. Madagascar â a country with a high malaria burden â is increasingly exposed to the effects of climate change, particularly through the growing frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, which have repeatedly triggered severe damage to healthcare infrastructure. Using a longitudinal cohort study of 500 households in Madagascar's Mananjary district, Benjamin Rice and colleagues analyzed 20,718 observations of malaria infection before and after cyclones Batsirai (2022) and Freddy (2023). This allowed the authors to evaluate how well various malaria interventions performed given the strain of extreme weather events. According to the findings, tropical cyclones in Madagascar significantly elevate the risk of malaria infection and reinfection by disrupting essential public health interventions, including malaria prevention and treatment programs. In the months following cyclones, malaria infection surged, particularly in children: up to half of school-age children and over a third of younger children were infected in high-transmission areas. By modeling various control strategies, the authors found that the recently introduced malaria vaccines, which offer up to 10 months of protection, could significantly reduce symptomatic infections and help sustain malaria infection control during climate-related intervention gaps. Despite this, Rice et al. note that malaria vaccines alone are insufficient to stop transmission, adding that layered strategies combining vaccines, drug-based prevention, and traditional tools like bed nets are essential, especially in high-transmission areas where malaria remains persistent.
