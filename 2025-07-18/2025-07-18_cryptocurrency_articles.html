                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump, who has made hundreds of millions of dollars in the White House from his recent dive into crypto, has now signed the first major piece of crypto legislation into law. During a July 18 White House ceremony, Trump signed legislation backed by the crypto industry known as the Genius Act, which creates a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a popular type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of stable assets like the U.S. dollar. A lot of people are saying that," Trump said. Trump signed the legislation while surrounded by Republican lawmakers who sponsored the bill and crypto executives. "Nobody's gained the respect in such a short period of time," Trump said. Crypto advocates have argued the law will protect consumers and set industry standards that could allow stablecoins to become mainstream for digital payments and other financial instruments. They named it after me," said Trump, drawing laughs from supporters. Trump campaigned in the 2024 election on supporting crypto-friendly policies in a departure from the Biden administration. And that's why I backed you at an early stage," Trump said. "And I also did it for the votes ‒ because you did come out and vote, I will say." In short time, Trump has built a cozy relationship with the lucrative crypto industry and embraced the digital currency to boost his own personal wealth since returning to the White House in January. Trump has made $620 million from his crypto ventures during his second White House, a Bloomberg analysis found. That includes about $460 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized financial company and platform that sells its own branded tokens. Trump's meme coin, called $TRUMP, has also earned an estimated $320 million in fees, according to Reuters, but it is unclear how much has gone toward a Trump-controlled entity and its partners. In May, Trump hosted a dinner at his Virginia golf club for 220 investors who plowed a combined $148 million into his crypto venture, the $TRUMP meme coin, raising ethics concerns from Democrats and other critics. "And, for the first time in American history, this bill will make our President, Donald Trump, the regulator of his own financial product." The Republican-controlled House this week also approved two other crypto bills that still require sign off from the Senate. One measure, which cleared by a 219-210 vote with only Republican support, would bar the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank for cryptocurrency. It passed by a 294-134 vote, with 78 House Democrats joining Republicans. "We're going to be growing it even more," Trump said of the crypto industry, "more than anyone ever thought."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Institutional capital brings Bitcoin stability and status, but also systemic risk, regulatory pressure, and a creeping erosion of its core ethos. Bitcoin is now a macro asset, with behavior increasingly tied to traditional risk markets and vulnerable to the same systemic pressures as TradFi assets. Custodial concentration is reshaping Bitcoin's market structure, increasing systemic risk and weakening self-custody norms. As institutional capital flows in, Bitcoin (BTC) is shedding its outsider status. This evolution brings new credibility and new capital, but also binds Bitcoin to the rhythms of global finance—macroeconomic factors, quarterly rotations, and regulatory compromise. However, its entrance into Big Finance means it is now as dependent on macroeconomic conditions and business cycles as any globally traded asset. This means Bitcoin traders must now, more than ever, pay close attention to global—especially US—economic conditions and policy shifts. Analyzing Bitcoin's correlation with traditional assets and credit indicators reveals a structural shift in the asset market since 2018, when institutions first started to take an interest in Bitcoin. HY OAS measures the extra yield investors demand to hold risky bonds over safe Treasurys. Wider spreads signal stress in credit markets; narrower ones reflect risk appetite. Related: Bitcoin hits new highs, gains stability and scale in its institutional era — Will it last? Bitcoin's deepening negative correlation with HY spreads means it underperforms when credit risk rises. In other words, Bitcoin has become high-beta to market sentiment: it thrives in optimism, and suffers disproportionately when fear creeps into financial markets. This is the price of its growing institutionalization—higher legitimacy, but also higher sensitivity to systemic risk. On the bright side, this also means Bitcoin is poised to benefit disproportionately from accommodative financial conditions and rising liquidity. Traders can use these correlations to anticipate Bitcoin's moves as part of a broader macro portfolio. One institutional behavior that deserves more attention is the quarterly performance rotation. Unlike retail holders driven by conviction or speculation, institutions often sell simply to lock in profits for reporting periods. This introduces artificial sell pressure, especially around quarter and year-end closings, which can create false signals in price action. This appears to be what happened in the final 10 days of 2024, when spot BTC ETFs saw $1.4 billion in outflows, signaling year-end profit-taking by shareholders. Beyond trading dynamics, Bitcoin's growing institutionalization brings deeper structural and philosophical risks, chief among them, the creeping threat of centralization. Bitcoin was built as a decentralized peer-to-peer system, but custodial ETFs and funds now hold over 1.4 million BTC—more than 6.6% of the total supply. For many investors, managing wallets and seed phrases feels like unnecessary friction. Related: Bitcoin Mayer Multiple shows $108K BTC price undervalued: Analysis As regulation tightens, we may see the emergence of two types of Bitcoin: a “clean,” regulated version held by institutions, and a “wild” version stigmatized and marginalized, perhaps even censored at the mining or wallet level. The bifurcation might not affect price in the short term, but it corrodes Bitcoin's core mission: to offer a neutral, permissionless money system. But it may also burn the very foundations on which Bitcoin was built. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updated on:  July 18, 2025 / 3:49 PM EDT / CBS News Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. This is a hell of an act." The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill. "The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' "Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people." David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president "stepped in and saved this bill." Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through. "Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins," Mr. Trump said. A lot of people are saying that." The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed "one-for-one" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, "strengthening the dollar" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a "21st-century upgrade." Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed "Crypto Week" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. "Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out," the president said. But this signing is a massive validation." The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year. The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015. The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week. Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon. "REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED….BUT NO MORE," Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence. "Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval," the president wrote on Truth Social. "This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto rally cooled off on Friday as the "crypto week" optimism over Congress passing landmark crypto legislation and President Trump potentially opening up retirement accounts for digital asset investments turned into a profit-taking opportunity. Ether (ETH) earlier Friday surged to near its 2025 high around $3,700 before turning lower, changing hands around $3,550 recently, still up 4.5% over the last day and more than 20% over the past week. XRP broke above its 2018 record late Thursday and hit a fresh all-time high of $3.60 early Friday, then retraced below $3.4 retaining 4% daily gain and 35% weekly advance. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broad-market benchmark tracking major cryptos, also hit a record high of 4,133 overnight before declining 3.7% from that peak.

ETH and XRP advanced 20%-25% over the past, with other large-caps including dogecoin DOGE$0.2136, SUI SUI$4.0126, and natIve tokens of Cardano ADA$0.8034, Avalanche AVAX$22.84, Uniswap UNI$8.9695 all booking double-digit gains versus flat BTC. Coinbase analysts, led by head of research David Duong, said in a Friday report that the current rally is "powered by structural strength and steady accumulation, not runaway speculation." Derivatives markets are not showing excessive froth, global liquidity conditions are supporting risk assets and ETFs, treasury companies show continuous demand, they argued, forecasting that bitcoin has more room to run. "Pullbacks may occur, but we think current on-chain and market signals argue that bitcoin's advance stands on solid ground rather than late-cycle euphoria," the authors said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>

The House of Representatives yesterday passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act alongside legislation for stablecoins (GENIUS Act) and crypto market infrastructure (Clarity Act). While the GENIUS Act has already passed the Senate, the Anti-CBDC bill still requires a Senate vote.

The current version of the Anti-CBDC bill has refined its language to block only retail central bank digital currencies. Earlier drafts could potentially have prevented the Federal Reserve from using distributed ledger technology (DLT) for a wholesale CBDC only usable by institutional users.

The legislation defines a central bank digital currency as “a form of digital money or monetary value that is—    (i) denominated in the national unit of account;    (ii) a direct liability of the Federal Reserve System; and    (iii) widely available to the general public.”

This distinction matters because wholesale CBDCs are not “widely available to the general public.” A Financial Times opinion piece published today suggested the legislation could isolate “the dollar from the rapid expansion of wholesale CBDCs, which allow faster and cheaper settlements among commercial banks and between central banks themselves.” However, this interpretation appears to misunderstand the current bill's scope.

The Federal Reserve began exploring the classification of wholesale CBDCs a couple of years ago in response to Republican opposition to government digital currencies. The central bank distinguishes between tokenized reserves, which represent existing central bank balances using different technology, and wholesale CBDCs, which create separate legal liabilities. Even if the Anti-CBDC legislation had failed to exclude wholesale CBDC, the Federal Reserve could have argued that a tokenized reserve is no different to current reserves. This is one of the reasons why central banks now prefer to use the term tokenized reserves instead of wholesale CBDCs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(KNSI) — The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, authored and led by Congressman and Majority Whip Tom Emmer (MN-06). In a vote of 219-210, the bill prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency and codifies President Donald Trump's Executive Order to forbid federal agencies from exploring its development. In a press release, Emmer explained, “For years, we have worked to educate our colleagues on the dangers of this insidious technology, which would undermine our values and destroy Americans' right to privacy. President Trump understands this threat and has already issued an Executive Order preventing the development of a CBDC. Now, we must codify it to ensure that the United States' digital currency policy remains in the hands of the American people so that any future development of digital cash reflects our American values of privacy, individual sovereignty, and free market competitiveness. We are proud to have led this years-long effort, and thank our colleagues for their support.” Emmer says a CBDC “is government-controlled, programmable money that, if developed without the privacy protections of cash, could give the federal government the ability to surveil Americans' financial transactions and suppress politically unpopular activity.” In January, President Trump issued an Executive Order entitled Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology which prohibits federal agencies from establishing, issuing, or promoting CBDCs.

BitMine Immersion Technologies focuses on accumulating cryptocurrencies, notably Ethereum and bitcoin. It has rapidly evolved its operations to embrace this high-stakes market. Despite impressive growth, technical indicators suggest inflated valuation metrics, with price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios significantly exceeding industry norms. In the cryptocurrency market, BitMine is navigating competition from established players like Coinbase and Binance, which dominate with exchange services. Additionally, companies like MicroStrategy and Square have adopted similar strategies by accumulating bitcoin, which poses a challenge in attracting mainstream investment amidst growing volatility. Investors should watch upcoming regulatory changes and market trends strongly influencing cryptocurrency prices. Monitoring institutional buying and market sentiment will be critical for assessing near-term trading opportunities. Retail investors need to approach BitMine with a balanced perspective. With its aggressive strategy towards cryptocurrency hoarding, it might appeal to those looking for high-reward investments. Given the stock's rapid ascent, adopting a well-planned entry and exit strategy can help manage exposure while capitalizing on momentum. This sector has shown the potential for high returns, albeit with increased volatility. Large funds, like Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, help attract retail investors and can stabilize stock prices during periods of volatility. The company's pivot to cryptocurrency is ambitious, but its unprofitable status and market volatility necessitate caution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The hope is to create an AI ecosystem driven not by statistical guesswork, but by logic, rules, and transparency, says David de Hilster, a professor in Northeastern's College of Engineering. This fall, students at Northeastern University's Miami campus will have the opportunity to join a new club with an ambitious mission: to design and build decentralized AI systems using the blockchain and a programming language called NLP++. The club — open to all students — is being launched by David de Hilster, an engineering professor and longtime computer language  developer. It will serve as a collaborative hub for students interested in AI, language, and distributed systems, and will be tasked with creating the foundational framework to integrate de Hilster's logic-based programming language into the blockchain. The hope is to create an AI ecosystem driven not by statistical guesswork, but by logic, rules, and transparency, he says. “The goal is to create an open, decentralized ecosystem for developing, maintaining and using linguistic resources — for every human language and topic domain,” de Hilster says. With the blockchain, NLP++ becomes replete with dictionaries, knowledge and algorithms that perform at human level and in a trustworthy manner.” Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum are built on the blockchain. Twenty-five years ago, de Hilster set out to develop a method for computers to analyze and interpret text the same way that humans think. He says it could one day be used to create digital assistants that use logic and rule-based thinking to answer questions — a notable departure from the probability-based technologies that power today's popular chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. But high-quality data collection can be hard, especially if done manually, collaboratively and transparently — which is where the blockchain comes in. One of the blockchain's primary advantages, de Hilster says, is that it is not operated or owned by any one private entity. “The idea will be that when we have people writing algorithms to do something — let's say an intelligent agent for sports — and then write that in NLP++ as part of the blockchain, people can use it,” he says. But de Hilster believes the payoff could be transformative. Unlike ChatGPT and similar tools, a digital assistant built with NLP++ would not rely on vast datasets and probabilistic models to generate responses. Instead, it would tap into structured, blockchain-hosted rules and logic — functioning more like a reasoning human than a predictive machine, de Hilster says. If I give you 100 sentences in English, every person who speaks English could tell me which ones are and which ones aren't.”</p>

Eric Trump's post came after ETH had retreated below the $3,000 price point following President Donald Trump‘s initial announcement of tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico days before. At last look, ETH is back above $3,000, over 3% higher than when he said to buy. Meanwhile, ETH is also experiencing a positive vibe shift as the tokenization narrative has taken off in recent weeks. Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase. In the past few days alone, Sharplink (NASDAQ:SBET), the Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin-backed gaming company turned treasury firm, has acquired over $100 million worth of ETH, bringing its total to nearly $700 million worth of ETH. Meanwhile, BitMine (NYSE:BMNR), the Tom Lee-backed Bitcoin miner turned ETH treasury, has announced that it now holds about $500 million worth of ETH, exceeding its initial private placement raise by 100%. Amid all these, inflows to spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds have also spiked. Last week, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded their second-largest day of inflows ever. Amid ETH's recent bounce, $10,000 price predictions have again flooded the timeline. “Arise Chikun, it's time,” BitMEX founder and Maelstrom investment chief Arthur Hayes said last week, adding, “ETH = $10,000.” See Also: A must-have for all crypto enthusiasts: Sign up for the Gemini Credit Card today and earn rewards on Bitcoin Ether, or 60+ other tokens, with every purchase. “Most people think the ETH ETF approval is already priced in and it's been a big bust vs. BTC (in terms of assets for ETHA vs. IBIT),” he said. Because the real catalyst is still ahead: staking approval, expected before October. Once that hits, ETH becomes the first yield-bearing crypto ETF in U.S. history.” These predictions suggest an over 3x price potential for ETH in the current market cycle.

By staking the majority of its ETH holdings, Bit Digital generates yield while simultaneously contributing to Ethereum's security infrastructure. What makes this approach particularly noteworthy is how it transforms Bit Digital's business model. Rather than focusing solely on cryptocurrency mining, the company is positioning itself as an Ethereum infrastructure operator and institutional holder. The timing aligns with Ethereum's evolution as a settlement layer for stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized applications. Bit Digital's treasury strategy suggests confidence in Ethereum's long-term utility beyond speculative value, focusing instead on its functionality as programmable financial infrastructure with native yield generation capabilities. NEW YORK, July 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bit Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq: BTBT) ("Bit Digital" or the "Company"), today announced that it has purchased approximately 19,683 Ethereum ("ETH") using the net proceeds from its recently completed $67.3 million registered direct offering to institutional investors. "With approximately 120,000 ETH, Bit Digital is positioned among the largest institutional Ethereum treasuries in the public markets," said Sam Tabar, Chief Executive Officer of Bit Digital. "We view Ethereum as foundational to the next phase of digital financial infrastructure. We believe Ethereum's programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets, and we remain committed to scaling our ETH holdings as part of that long-term strategy." ETH is increasingly utilized across real economic activity, serving as the core collateral layer for stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized applications. ETH's ability to generate native yield and support programmable financial systems positions it as more than a digital asset. Bit Digital sees Ethereum as an integral part of how value will move and settle in modern markets, as a global coordination layer for the emerging onchain economy, and an essential component of future-facing treasury strategy. Bit Digital operates Ethereum infrastructure as part of its broader strategy to participate directly in the network's long-term growth. By combining this operational involvement with the compliance standards and oversight of a public company, Bit Digital offers investors regulated exposure to Ethereum's underlying economics through a traditional equity vehicle. Bit Digital's platform includes advanced validator operations, institutional-grade custody, active protocol governance, and yield optimization.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto Market Cap Tops $4 Trillion as Bitcoin, Ethereum Drive Institutional Inflows For the first time ever, the total value of all cryptocurrencies surpassed $4 trillion Friday before pulling back slightly, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) accounting for over 70% of total market value, driven by surging investor demand and a string of regulatory victories in the U.S. "The $4 trillion crypto market milestone underscores the industry's rise as a mainstream asset class," Devere Bryan, group general manager of stablecoin issuer First Digital, told Decrypt. It extends a two-week streak of heavy inflows totaling over $4 billion, the second consecutive week above $2 billion, according to U.K.-based asset manager Farside Investors. “I believe the momentum will be sustained in the short-term,” Charmaine Tam, head of OTC sales and trading at Hex Trust, told Decrypt. She expects the momentum to continue as "other countries will likely follow the US in setting clear crypto rules, leading to even more global adoption" and institutional capital deployment. Ethereum's market dominance jumped from 9% to 11% while Bitcoin's share dropped 4 percentage points, signaling the start of "altcoin season," according to analysts as investors rotate into higher-risk assets. "Institutional capital is finding its footing, with Ethereum's surge past $3,600 backed by a whopping $726m in single-day ETF inflows signalling systematic adoption," Sohan Sen, head of Structured Products at Mantle, told Decrypt. "Beyond the charts, sustained value will premise on live activity at the infrastructure level," Sen said, pointing to Ethereum's role hosting over half of global stablecoin supply as validation that "programmable money is inevitable as table stakes in the future of finance." Bitcoin's climb to $120,336 comes after completing its strongest weekly performance since May, though analysts are watching for consolidation signals. Meanwhile, on Myriad, a prediction markets platform developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, just 7.4% of users believe Bitcoin will close above $122,000 by 11:59 p.m. UTC on Friday. An overwhelming 94% majority have voted No, suggesting that traders are positioning for a near-term pullback or consolidation. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The PUMP token from memecoin launchpad Pump.fun has experienced steep declines following its record-breaking initial coin offering in July 2025. The token launched after a presale that raised $500-600 million in just 12 minutes. This represents a decline of over 56% from its peak price. The token's initial success was short-lived as profit-taking began almost immediately. According to BitMEX data, 6,042 wallets out of 10,145 ICO participants (59.6%) had already sold or transferred their tokens to centralized exchanges within the first week. Our quant reveals traders are still BULLISH on $PUMP. A small group of 312 wallets (3%) actually increased their holdings during this period. The widespread selling activity has created downward pressure on PUMP's price. BitMEX analysts noted that such conditions typically lead to aggressive hedging and strong negative funding rates in derivatives markets. This action temporarily boosted the price by 20%, though these gains proved short-lived. Beyond the token's price struggles, Pump.fun itself faces challenges with declining platform activity. This decline in platform usage raises questions about the sustainability of PUMP's current valuation. BitMEX analysts warned that if volume trends continue, the token's price may be difficult to justify. The platform also faces increased competition from new rivals like LetsBonk. This competition threatens Pump.fun's dominant position in Solana memecoin launches. Security concerns have also emerged since the token's launch. Over 2,400 fake PUMP tokens and 6,700 scam attempts have been detected, including wallet-draining malicious applications. The PUMP token lacks inherent utility features such as governance rights, staking options, or platform fee-sharing mechanisms. This has drawn criticism given the high concentration of tokens among large holders. Roughly 60% of the total supply is held by approximately 340 wallets, creating concerns about market manipulation. On-chain data shows recent smart money inflows of about $3.7 million into PUMP. OKX exchange listed PUMP/USDT trading pairs on July 18, potentially increasing the token's exposure to more traders. However, this listing has not reversed the overall downward price trend amid continued selling pressure. 📈 Futures & Crypto Trader 🔍 Sharing charts, strategies, & mindset tips to help you level up 🚨 Not Financial Advice Follow on X @Pro_Trader_Edge As the crypto market fluctuates drastically, many investors are slowing down and rethinking their asset…</p>
