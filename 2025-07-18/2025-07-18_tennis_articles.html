                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We've already seen plenty of American success at majors in 2025, especially on the WTA Tour. In Melbourne, Madison Keys defeated Aryna Sabalenka to win her first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open. Now a two-time Grand Slam champion following her victory in Paris, the American star knows exactly what to do at the major tournaments. Determined and more dangerous than ever, it wouldn't come as much of a surprise to see Gauff lift the trophy once more in 2025. Enjoying his career-best Grand Slam result in 2024, Taylor Fritz reached the final of the US Open, where he fell short against Jannik Sinner. Just as Fritz did, Jessica Pegula contested her first Grand Slam final at the US Open in 2024, as she lost to world number one Sabalenka in straight sets. The 31-year-old continues to impress on the WTA Tour, and whilst her major performances haven't quite been up to scratch in 2025, winning three tour-level titles proves just how dangerous she can be. There aren't many players in tennis today who rise to the occasion quite like Ben Shelton. The 22-year-old consistently finds his best tennis at the Grand Slam tournaments and has yet to lose to anyone but Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz at majors in 2025. If Shelton can avoid the world number one and two during the first week in New York, you wouldn't want to bet against him reaching another Grand Slam semifinal. Twice a semifinalist at Flushing Meadows, Tiafoe steps into another gear whenever he plays on Arthur Ashe Stadium. There's no doubt he will be looking to go one better this time around and reach his first final, something he is more than capable of doing. Fritz, Pegula, and Tiafoe may all be in with a shout of winning the US Open in September, but which American players have actually won the tournament? Since 2000, there have been 11 American winners at Flushing Meadows, as one player in particular enjoyed a spell of dominance on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Only time will tell if anyone can begin to replicate the success of Serena Williams at the US Open in 2025, but it will certainly be something to look out for. The 2025 US Open is scheduled to begin on Sunday, August 24.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz were one of the eye-catching pairings announced for an event that is also due to see new Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner team up with America's Emma Navarro and Novak Djokovic play with Olga Danilovic. Emma Raducanu makes a big breakthrough in alternative tennis rankings Emma Raducanu gets some candid encouragement from a former British No 1 Players like Cash and his Wimbledon doubles partner Lloyd Glasspool have not been invited to play in the event, with doubles players missing out on a payday in New York as the star names have been invited to take part instead. ‚ÄúMy own personal view, it is all just posturing at the moment and I will be fascinated to see how many of those 16 pairings that were announced a few weeks ago will turn up and play. ‚ÄúI'd be very, very surprised if a lot of those pairs end up taking to the court and the only reason they would release that list is to get everyone talking about it. ‚ÄúIt's almost like they have put their names down, but there is no obligation to play. ‚ÄúFor me, the best doubles pairing on that list they released is Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori and it will be interesting to see if some doubles players who end up playing if the singles players drop out. ‚ÄúI'm a fan of innovation and trying to bring new things into tennis, but I don't agree with calling it a Grand Slam event.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was the best moment of my coaching career so far,‚Äù added Fulcher. ‚ÄúSo many start out with ambitions to win a title at Wimbledon. ‚ÄúWhen I first met Julian, he was 14 and he duffed me up in a practice set before I coached him, so to see him fulfil his ambition is so rewarding. He has good solid values, a great family around him. I've looked back on the replays of it since and you can just see what that moment meant to him.‚Äù Fulcher is preparing to stage his latest tennis event, with the Trilogy Rackets Festival bringing a week-long celebration of racket sports at Hove Beach Park By Game4Padel. Emma Raducanu has been given a huge vote of confidence by Tim Henman. ‚ÄúIt's hard for me to say, maybe because I am getting older too."</p>

The World No.1 announced her withdrawal in a statement released by Tennis Canada, calling it her ‚Äúbest chance‚Äù for hard court success this year. With no Grand Slam titles yet in 2025, Sabalenka is looking to peak at Flushing Meadows once again. ‚ÄúI'm looking forward to kicking off the North American hard-court swing, but to give myself the best chance for success this season, I've decided it's in my best interest to skip Montreal,‚Äù Sabalenka said. Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals in Montreal last year, where she lost to Amanda Anisimova. Kyrgios hints at possible Novak Djokovic retirement date, reveals private talks with Serbian star Sabalenka's next appearance is expected to be at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, where she is the defending champion. The decision to skip Montreal came after a semifinal exit at Wimbledon, where she fell short of reaching her first final at the All England Club. With the Australian Open, Roland Garros, and Wimbledon now behind her, New York remains her final opportunity to secure a major title this season.

Clay tests patience, power, precision, and pure grit. These five names carved their legacy in Paris, sliding, grinding, and conquering the most demanding Grand Slam of them all. A pioneer from the pre-Open era, Vacherot ruled Roland Garros at the turn of the 20th century. His four titles remain a historic benchmark in French tennis lore. Cochet was elegance on clay. With soft hands and sharp instincts, he captured five Roland Garros titles in the 1920s and ‚Äò30s, becoming a national icon. Borg glided across clay like no one else in his era, winning six titles with a relentless baseline game and steely calm. With eight French titles, he set a gold standard that stood untouched for decades. The ‚ÄúKing of Clay‚Äù isn't just a nickname‚Äîit's a fact etched in red dirt. Get all the news in your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Sebastian Korda snapped a 17-year drought for home champions at the Mubadala Citi DC Open last year, the red, white and blue tide is in full force for this year's edition. Nobody owned the capital quite like Andre Agassi. Across 10 visits in the ‚Äò90s, he racked up as many titles as losses ‚Äî five of each ‚Äî cementing his dominance in the sweltering summer heat with a record haul, including a victory as World No. Michael Chang enjoyed a reign in the winner's circle sandwiched in between Agassi's ‚Äò95 and ‚Äò98 titles. That season alone, Roddick claimed an American tri-fecta of sorts, capturing his first tour-level title in Atlanta, then adding to that count in Houston and in Washington, D.C, where in the championship match the teenager beat Sjeng Schalken ‚Äî the Dutchman whom Roddick helped escape a hotel fire three years later in Rome. In ‚Äò05, Roddick spoiled countryman Blake's quest for a second D.C. title. James Blake and Andy Roddick (champion) at the 2005 Washington, D.C. trophy ceremony. Blake won his first tour-level trophy there in 2002 and upon clinching championship point, the-then 22-year-old dropped his racquet in relief and leaped with ecstatic joy. Blake's pure enthusiasm spilled over as he celebrated with his team, and the New York native said post match that he almost knocked over his mom in a joyful courtside hug. The fourth-longest running professional tennis event in the United States, the Mubadala Citi DC Open celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018 and has continued to thrive at the original location Fitzgerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park. The venue, nestled in one of D.C.'s most inclusive neighborhoods, was chosen at the request of Arthur Ashe, who partnered Donald Dell and John A. Harris to launch the tournament in 1969. Held on clay courts until 1986, the event's deep roots and rich history have made it a favourite stop for some of the sport's biggest names. American icon Jimmy Connors brought his signature fire and flair to Washington, delivering his own brand of summer entertainment. He captured three titles in the capital, including two while holding No. A decade separated his second and third title run, with Connors returning to the winner's circle once more in 1988. It was during that era when another star made his mark in Washington. Staying on the theme of Czech-American success, last year featured a full-circle moment for Florida-native Korda and his father Petr Korda. 32 in the PIF ATP Rankings, ‚ÄòSebi' Korda, captured his biggest career title at the ATP 500, matching his father's 1992 triumph. Now, a strong squad of home hopes look to build on the American legacy in D.C. this year. Perhaps nobody wants to win this tournament more than DMV's own Tiafoe, who has lost to the eventual champion the past three years. Fritz is aiming for his first ATP 500 crown since 2022. Shelton is seeking his first title of the year.

And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur has announced she is taking a ‚Äústep back‚Äù from professional tennis. The 30-year-old Tunisian, who is the first African and Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam singles final, was in tears as she retired from her first-round match at Wimbledon this year. After a difficult spell with injuries and form, the former world No 2 has dropped to 71 in the world rankings and on Thursday announced she will take a step away from the court for an indefinite period. "For the past two years, I've been pushing myself so hard, fighting through injuries and facing many other challenges," she said, in a statement on social media. "But deep down, I haven't truly felt happy on the court for some time now. "Thank you to all my fans for understanding. Your support and love mean the world to me. "Even while I'm away from the court, I'll continue to stay close and connected in different ways, and share this journey with you all. Jabeur is a three-time Grand Slam finalist, having lost in the 2022 and 2023 Wimbledon final, as well as the 2022 US Open final. "I'm pretty sad,‚Äù she said after her Wimbledon exit. ‚ÄúIt really doesn't really help with my confidence and what I keep pushing myself to do, even though it has been a very tough season for me."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka has withdrawn from the U.S. Open preparation tournament in Montreal after her devastating Wimbledon disappointment. 1 suffered elimination in the Wimbledon semi-finals at the hands of Amanda Anisimova, who claimed a 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 triumph two years after stepping away from tennis indefinitely. Despite accepting her defeat graciously and even showing compassion toward a fan experiencing a medical crisis, Sabalenka did criticize her rival for violating Wimbledon protocol. The Belarusian star has endured recent Grand Slam final frustrations. She lost to Madison Keys at the Australian Open final, where she destroyed her racket in anger, before falling to Coco Gauff at the French Open; Gauff became the first American to claim Roland Garros since Serena Williams in 2015. "I'm looking forward to kicking off the North American hard-court swing, but to give myself the best chance for success this season, I've decided it's in my best interest to skip Montreal," a statement from Sabalenka read. The 27-year-old has reached seven finals during 2025, capturing titles in Brisbane, Miami, and Madrid - explaining her exhaustion following Wimbledon. "This experience shows that next year I'm only hungrier and angrier. These tough defeats help me to come back much stronger. I have huge hopes for the next year." Sabalenka's compatriot Paula Badosa has withdrawn from Montreal. Earlier in the week, she disclosed that she is dealing with a tear in her psoas, adding to the back issues that have been troubling the Spaniard since Wimbledon 2023. Looking forward, Sabalenka aims to recuperate and prepare for her upcoming U.S. Open title defense. Speaking after her Wimbledon disappointment, Sabalenka said: "‚ÄúLosing sucks, you know.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Roger Federer to Pete Sampras, meet the five greatest players of all times in men's tennis. These five legends have 92 grand slam titles combined. Djoker Nole has 24 grand slam singles titles to his name. 1 and is the only man to win every slam at least three times. Rafael Nadal has 22 grand slam titles, including a record of 14 French Open wins. He's one of the few players to complete the golden slam, winning all four majors plus Olympic gold. Nadal was nicknamed the 'King of Clay' as it was close to impossible to defeat him during his prime at the Roland Garros. Roger Federer won 20 grand slam titles and held the No. Federer also has an Olympic gold medal; however, that feat was in a doubles game during the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in China. Pete Sampras retired with a total of 14 grand slam titles. However, Sampras couldn't establish his dominance over the clay court in Paris. In a span of eight years from 1993 to 2000, Pete won seven Wimbledon trophies. Roy Emerson won 12 grand slam singles titles and 16 doubles trophies, totaling 28 before the Open Era. He also held the record of six Australian Open men's singles titles until 2019, when Novak Djokovic won his seventh title.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was a special visitor to the Rafa Nadal Academy this week as two all-time tennis greats reunited. Two months after they last came face-to-face at Roland Garros, Nadal and great rival Roger Federer spent time together at the complex in Mallorca. The campus in Mallorca has more than 50 tennis courts, padel and squash courts, a football pitch, and two swimming pools. However, the two icons weren't there for a training session. Federer, 43, was joined by his wife Mirka as he strolled across the area in discussions with Nadal. It isn't clear why the pair were meeting up on the Spanish island, with speculation already swirling over a future partnership. Nadal took to X to acknowledge the visit, posting a picture of the pair and writing: ‚Äú@rogerfederer! Really enjoyed our morning together at the @rnadalacademy!‚Äù In May, he was honoured with a special ceremony at the French Open to mark his 14 wins at the Grand Slam event. He said: "I think farewells are important when you have his level. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Darren Cahill has delivered his first post since he and Jannik Sinner conspired to win this year's Wimbledon title. However, such is his unrelenting quality, he brushed both aside with relative ease, showcasing the furious, powerful hitting and a work rate that nobody on tour can compete with when at its best. He has now won two of this year's three Grand Slam titles, and is the overwhelming favourite to win the fourth in New York later this year too. And, the two are clearly loving life together despite all the turmoil suffered in recent years, including a three-month suspension from tennis for a doping-related incident. However, that enforced absence from tennis has arguably added to just how impressive Sinner's seamless return has been, easily slotting back in and proving why he is very much still the world's best player. Although it has already been confirmed that Cahill will leave Sinner's team at the end of 2025, there have been murmurs suggesting otherwise since the Italian has returned from his three-month ban. This physical and technical freak of nature was just one point away from completing the French Open and Wimbledon double, a feat very few have ever accomplished, all whilst the earlier event marked just his second tournament back after that spell away from the sport. This has clearly sparked great debate within Cahill, as some are now suggesting he's not done completely with Sinner. In fact, there are some suggestions that he would be willing to continue but in a reduced capacity, only flying out to specific tournaments when really needed. He's been so influential, and the two are on track to create a legendary dynasty together in tennis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week's tournament in Los Cabos didn't exactly feature a star-studded field, as one might expect from an ATP 250 event played in Mexico the week after Wimbledon. However, arguably the two biggest names in the draw, Andrey Rublev and Denis Shapovalov, are still hunting for a title. But first, they have to get through some tricky semifinal matchups. But who will advance to the ATP Los Cabos final? However, he's also highly inconsistent and prone to awful performances and losses on any given day, so Walton definitely has a chance here if he can stay solid. With that said, there is no doubt that if Shapovalov plays anywhere close to what he is capable of, he will reach the final here and have the chance to regain some momentum in a season that has been extremely disappointing following his title in Dallas. He tends to be very consistent in best-of-three events and takes advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. Kovacevic will have a chance if he can play his best, but Rublev should ultimately be too strong and prevail.
