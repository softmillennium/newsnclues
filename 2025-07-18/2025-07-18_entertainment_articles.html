                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jon Stewart, who hosts The Daily Show, isn't sure whether the long-running late-night series will survive as Paramount continues its attempt at merging with Skydance Media. “Unfortunately, we haven't heard anything from them,” Stewart said in response to a listener question on his The Weekly Show With Jon Stewart podcast — released on Thursday — about whether Skydance would scrap Daily Show once the merger is complete. But let me tell you something, I've been kicked out of shittier establishments than that. Stewart considered that without Daily Show, it's uncertain that Comedy Central could continue to hold up on its own with just the remaining shows on its roster. “I think we're the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park,” he said. “But I'd like to think we bring enough value to the property, like if they're looking at it as purely a real estate transaction, I think we bring a lot of value,” he said. I don't know, they may sell the whole fucking place for parts.” Trump Claims He ‘Never Wrote a Picture in My Life.' Jimmy Kimmel, Ben Stiller, Elizabeth Warren Question CBS' Decision to End 'The Late Show' Steward is taking things day by day and said that “we'll deal with it when we do,” should it come to that point. He doesn't want to make any assumptions regarding Skydance Media CEO David Ellison's plans for the company post-merger, adding: “We've all got a surmisal about who actually is owning it and what his ideology is, but ideology may not play a part.” When news of The Late Show‘s cancellation broke, CBS was adamant about stressing that the decision was wholly unrelated to any “other matters” regarding Paramount. Senator Elizabeth Warren questioned the motives behind CBS' decision, writing on X: “CBS canceled Colbert's show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery. America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new Jason Voorhees has joined the Friday the 13th universe, as Callum Vinson (Chucky, Long Bright River) boards Peacock‘s prequel series Crystal Lake from A24. Brad Caleb Kane serves as creator, writer, showrunner and executive producer of the series. Voorhees drowned in the lake as a child, which led to his mother's killing spree at the camp to avenge his “death.” Jason witnessed his mother's decapitation by a camp counselor, which sets him off on a murder spree of his own that haunts the area across 12 films. Wes Anderson's 'The Phoenician Scheme' Plots Peacock Premiere Date Jason, created by Victor Miller, has been played by multiple actors, including Ari Lehman, who brought the character to life in the original film. Additional actors include Warrington Gillette, Steve Dash, Richard Brooker, Ted White, Tom Morga, C.J. Graham, Kane Hodder, Ken Kirzinger and Derek Mears. In addition to Vinson, Nick Cordileone (Warrior), Joy Suprano (Fleishman is in Trouble, Best Foot Forward), Danielle Kotch (Director's Cut), and Phoenix Parnevik (Bel-Air, Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter Is Dead) have joined the cast. He is a longtime Crystal Lake resident who drunkenly rambles about the curse of Camp Crystal Lake. Potentially, if this is the same Ralph Cordileone plays, it could be revealed what he saw or knew that caused this lifelong trauma. It's worth noting that the above characters could differ from those portrayed in the prequel, and even if they are the same, their stories could evolve into something different. Crystal Lake also stars William Catlett, Devin Kessler, Cameron Scoggins, and Gwendolyn Sundstrom. The prequel is executive produced by A24, Kane, Marc Toberoff, Victor Miller, Robert M. Barsamian, Robert P. Barsamian and Stuart Manashil. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Legendary lyricist Alan Bergman died on Thursday (July 17) at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 99, it was announced Friday by family spokesman Ken Sunshine. Bergman suffered from respiratory issues in recent months, but continued to write songs till the end. Bergman and his wife, Marilyn Bergman (who died in 2022 at age 93), are probably best known for writing exquisite ballads such as “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life,” “Pieces of Dreams” and “How Do You Keep the Music Playing?,” but they refused to be typecast. They also wrote the witty theme songs for such TV series as Maude, Good Times and Alice. The Bergmans received 15 Oscar nominations for best original song, a total equaled or bettered by only four songwriters in history – Sammy Cahn (26), Johnny Mercer (18), Diane Warren (16) and Paul Francis Webster (16). The Bergmans collaborated on their Oscar-nominated songs with seven different composers – Michel Legrand, Henry Mancini, Maurice Jarre, Marvin Hamlisch, David Shire, John Williams and Dave Grusin. In 1983 they became the first (and still only) songwriters to be nominated for three Oscars for best original song in one year for “How Do You Keep the Music Playing” from Best Friends, “It Might Be You” from Tootsie and “If We Were in Love” from Yes, Giorgio. They received a trustees award from the Recording Academy in 2013. Alan Bergman's alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recognized him with its Distinguished Alumnus Award. The Bergmans had a long and close relationship with Barbra Streisand, who paid tribute to them on her Grammy-nominated 2011 album What Matters Most – Barbra Streisand Sings the Lyrics of Alan & Marilyn Bergman. In the years since his wife's death, Alan Bergman continued to write, record and perform. His final collaboration was with guitarist and composer Pat Metheny, who is set to record an album of nine Bergman/Metheny songs later this year. Bergman died just eight days after the announcement of a celebration in his honor on what would have been his 100th birthday on Sept. 11. Many of his friends and admirers were set to perform at a concert in his honor that night at The Broad Stage in Santa Monica, Calif. Five-time Grammy nominee Michael Feinstein said, “The songs Alan and Marilyn have written are part of a pantheon of enduring music that will live long beyond Alan's Centenary, for they are timeless expressions of the human condition, and will never grow old. Actor, comedian and writer Paul Reiser commented, “My goal in life is to try to be even a small fraction of the man — and artist — that my dear friend Alan Bergman is. (I may need more than 100 years to get there, but … working on it. In addition, Ruth Price, founder of the Jazz Bakery, said, “100 years on this planet is no small achievement, but to have graced those years with such love, beauty and art speaks to a life extraordinarily well lived. Alan is incomparable, and I love him for all kinds of reasons.” Survivors include his daughter Julie Bergman, a writer and film producer, and granddaughter Emily Sender, who just completed her masters in global food studies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As fans were leaving Beyoncé‘s concert in Atlanta on Tuesday (July 15), a stampede broke out on an escalator at a local transit station that left 11 people injured — and according to reports, one little bug was what started it all. As captured in videos on social media, chaos broke out when a line of people using an escalator at the station started to rush down the steps after hearing screaming, resulting in a dangerous crowd crush. In a statement shared with Billboard on Friday (July 18), MARTA communications director Stephany Fisher confirmed that the incident took place just after midnight on Tuesday, with 11 people reporting injuries. “One person suffered a broken ankle, seven people were transported to the hospital with cuts and scrapes, and one person declined transport,” she said. MARTA Police on scene reported that a person began screaming and running, causing a stampede on the escalator that caused it to temporarily speed up and then stop suddenly.” Billboard has reached out to Beyoncé's rep and MARTA police for comment. People on social media have been posting their accounts of the accident, with one witness sharing footage and writing on TikTok, “After the Beyonce concert last night, the escalator flew down and we all flew down and piled on top of each other … I managed to break free but I was very shaken up.” The video shows people in cowboy hats and other Beyoncé-coded outfits crying out in fear, while some people still on the escalator urge others to move back. Others have shared photos of their injuries, including one person with a bloody, lacerated ankle. Also in Atlanta, Beyoncé's choreographer and dancer were robbed on July 8. The next and final stop on Bey's trek will be in Las Vegas, where the musician will perform shows on July 25 and 26 at Allegiant Stadium.

Aster will be in attendance for two out of the five films that will screen; the program ranges from Robert Altman's iconic “Nashville” to Lars von Trier's beloved “Dogville.” The series is co-programmed by Aster and MoMI Senior Curator of Film Michael Koresky, and will take place from August 15 to 31. As the description for the film series states, “Eddington City Limits” will include “movies that both directly inspired or echo the escalating madness of ‘Eddington,' depicting powder-keg communities ready to spill over into violence or enclosed worlds so given to conspiracy and obsession that there's no longer any sense of coherent reality.” Related Stories ‘Billy Joel: And So It Goes' Review: Smart, Sprawling Documentary Makes a Case, Even for Non-Fans, of the Piano Man's Greatness How ‘I Know What You Did Last Summer' Found Its 2025 Ensemble: Aging Up for Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, and More Aster will appear for a conversation with Koresky around two films: Robert Altman's “Nashville” on August 17 and the August 23 screening of Oliver Stone's “JFK.” Aster's “Eddington” is led by Pedro Pascal, who plays a small-town mayor who goes against the local sheriff (Joaquin Phoenix) in New Mexico amid the political turmoil of 2020. Emma Stone, Austin Butler, Luke Grimes, Deirdre O'Connell, Micheal Ward, Clifton Collins Jr., William Belleau, Cameron Mann, Matt Gomez Hidaka, and Amélie Hoeferle also star in Aster's fourth feature. “Eddington City Limits” will opens with Lars von Trier's “Dogville,” also about small-town American life. Steven Spielberg's paranoid pandemonium dramedy “1941,” as well as classic Western “The Wild Bunch,” will both screen, with “1941” in DCP and “The Wild Bunch” in 35mm. “We're so pleased to work with Ari on this series,” co-programmer Koresky said in an official statement. “These selections elucidate and expand on the themes of his brilliant and rattling 2020-set American western, which, like all his films, puts its viewers in a productively uncomfortable position. Aster knows that great movies don't have to be easy on us, and the movies in this lineup all provoke their audiences in ways that expertly balance pain and pleasure. As audiences discover ‘Eddington' in the coming weeks, we hope they'll come experience some of these films at the Museum to further discuss the ideas — about the breakdown of community, about conspiracy, about cult mentality — that it puts forth.” Check out the full program, with language provided by MoMI, below. With Nicole Kidman, Stellan Skarsgård, Paul Bettany, Lauren Bacall, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan, Jeremy Davies, Ben Gazzara, Philip Baker Hall, Chloë Sevigny, Udo Kier. The pinnacle of Lars von Trier's cinematic moral confrontations remains a work of controversy and contemplation more than twenty years after its release. Yet von Trier's bitter pill is dramatically engaging from first frame to shocking last, as it follows a mystery woman named Grace (Kidman) who seeks refuge from violence in a quaint Rocky Mountain town, only to find herself in a different kind of nightmare. “Nashville“With Ari Aster in personSunday, August 17, 1:00 p.m.Dir. With Lily Tomlin, Ronee Blakely, Gwen Welles, Shelley Duvall, Keith Carradine, Ned Beatty, Barbara Harris, Jeff Goldblum. The peak of Altman's prolific career was this panoramic view of American life circa 1975, set in the nation's country-music capital. Cramming his wide screen with the comings and goings of a 24-character ensemble, Altman creates an incredible, cacophonous entertainment, equal parts comedy and tragedy, featuring terrific original songs and an unforgettable ending. Perhaps never has another film captured the simultaneous horror and hilarity of modern American living than this singular masterpiece, which remains as galvanizing and astute—and irresolvable—as ever, a rollicking kaleidoscope that gradually becomes a depiction of encroaching political violence. With Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland. At the height of his cinematic powers, Oliver Stone got this miraculously personal studio film green-lit—a feat that now feels all but unthinkable. JFK follows the true story of the indefatigable, increasingly obsessive New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Costner, a steadfast marvel), who tried to convict local high society dandy Clay Shaw (Jones) as a conspirator in the murder of President John F. Kennedy Jr, and in so doing prove the Warren Report was wrong in certifying that Lee Harvey Oswald (Oldman) acted alone. Stone's free-wheeling, brilliantly constructed head-trip feels awfully prescient in its “there is no bottom” perspective on American history and conspiracy. With William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien, Warren Oates. As the western dried up around him, Sam Peckinpah assembled a group of grizzled veterans for one last trip into the breach. A cadre of aging outlaws, fleeing the authorities, attempts to make a final score for a Mexican general, but when things go awry, the gang finds itself in one of the wildest and bloodiest of screen shoot-outs. Peckinpah's masterpiece is at once classical and revisionist, an exemplar of the very genre it so brilliantly subverts, building towards a famously violent climax that seemed to all but put a fork in the genre. Critically dismissed at the time of its release, Spielberg's grand folly is a lavish spectacle that has attracted a major cult following. A slapstick behemoth on a massive, budget-busting scale, 1941 charts the fictional pandemonium that ensues among a group of frenzied Los Angelenos after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Featuring Oscar-nominated cinematography, sound design, and visual effects, Spielberg's wildest ride is a chance for Spielberg to play with and demolish a really big toy set—but it's also a delirious portrait of Americans under duress that serves as a comic critique of wartime paranoia.

And deserves better.” Though stopping short of suggesting a political motivation, fellow late night host Jimmy Kimmel also showed support on Instagram, writing, “Fuck you and all your Sheldons CBS.” If nothing else, it seems like Colbert will have no shortage of willing and vocal guests during his last few months on air.

The stand-up community knew Janelle James before she landed “Abbott Elementary.” She had opened for Chris Rock, was featured on late-night talk shows, and was even a staff writer on BET's “The Rundown with Robin Thede” and Showtime's “Black Monday.” But with only a smattering of acting parts (including a recurring “Black Monday” role), James had not experienced the cachet that comes with becoming a star before she portrayed Principal Ava Coleman on Quinta Brunson's ABC series — a character that just landed James her fourth Emmy nomination in a row. For the video series “What No One Tells You,” part of IndieWire's Future of Filmmaking, James related how no one told her “having money for the first time in your life can be traumatic.” Related Stories ‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' Ending in 2026 — Et Tu, Skydance?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The news broke on July 18 that CBS had decided to cancel “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” This comes after he took over hosting duties for the long-running late-night show in 2015 following David Letterman's exit. Now, Jimmy Kimmel has come to the support of his friend and colleague. CBS executives haven't given specifics about why they canceled “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Instead, the word is that it was due to financial reasons. This is despite reports that the ratings have steadily increased lately and that it's the top show in viewership for its hour. According to Deadline, Jimmy Kimmel, who hosts “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on ABC, was on vacation when he received the news that CBS had canceled “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Despite this, he took to his Instagram stories and shared a message. [Forget] you and all your Sheldons, CBS.” Notably, Jimmy used a word other than forget in his message to CBS. Additionally, the mention of “all your Sheldons” has to do with “The Big Bang Theory” and its three spin-offs. They include “Young Sheldon,” “Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage,” and an upcoming one focusing on another character from the original series. Regarding Jimmy, he's been hosting his late-night show since 2003. He said, “Before we start the show, I want to let you know something that I found out just last night. Naturally, the studio audience expressed dismay, with which Stephen Colbert agreed. He went on, “It is a fantastic job. I wish somebody else was getting it, and it's a job that I'm looking forward to doing with this usual gang of idiots for another 10 months.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>$ilk raps with a growling sneer, stuffing syllables into every available space. He issues screeds about the cycles of history and Black radical thought in a commanding boom, raspy from a never-ending chain of baseball-bat-sized spliffs. On that album, $ilk rapped with a devil-may-care urgency, excoriating the myriad methods of exploitation wielded by our corporate overlords. He cannonballed into Khalil Blu's subwoofer-crushing beats, crafting an acid tab masterpiece of esoteric philosophy, biting social commentary, and pure, capital-R rapping. He hasn't lost a step: WHO WATERS THE WILTING GIVING TREE keeps his signature storminess intact while seeking new contours to his breathless style. $ilk's calling card is his verbal pyrotechnics, landing tongue-twisting haymakers like E. Honda's Hundred Hand Slap. “I was supposed to get some pussy tonight/Put your mouth on a check you couldn't cash and ended up booking a flight/And TSA let me by with the tool cooked in a pie,” he raps on “Pneumonoultramicroscpopic(nobody)silicovolcanoniosis,” eking out the last words like a dying gasp. He's fascinated by the malleability of language, stretching rhyme schemes to their breaking point. On “A Whale Is Only as Blue as You Say It Is, So, It's 2,” he pirouettes through the couplet, “Hello, beloved, you've uncovered what's under the rubble/Discovered what once was covered in covers but couldn't get out of your own way because of your own stubborn.” You could press play on any song and be bowled over by at least three similarly vertiginous passages. He's constantly interrogating existence—on “First I Give Up, Then I Give In, Then I Give All,” he laments how “things are moving fast/Some days feel like years, others just pass/Some days I ain't here.” The album's recurring theme of solitude makes $ilk's regular use of non-sequiturs and shifting points of view feel more like the stuff of anxious internal ruminations. On “The $400 Cheeseburger From the Window Shopper Video Was Just a Big Mac -______-,” he sits alone in his room, rubbing his eyes and chewing on shrooms, trying to figure out why he “woke up today feeling less valuable than [he] did the day before yesterday.” A pack of loud beats, a blank notebook, and a pound of weed may not be the cure for loneliness, but they at least offer a release valve. Private reflections spiral into thoughts about systems and how he fits within them. $ilk is dubious of it all: monogamy, major labels, generative AI—twice he recalls the digital minstrelsy of fictional rapper FN Meka, and at one point he vows to “single-handedly take down the singularity.” As WHO WATERS THE WILTING GIVING TREE stares unblinkingly at a bleak present and unknown future, $ilk proposes a kind of acceptance: Learn who you are amid all this chaos, and you might figure out how to fight back. This isn't an optimistic or pessimistic record; it's realistic. The album's production mirrors $ilk's more nuanced approach, though it'd be a stretch to call WHO WATERS THE WILTING GIVING TREE quiet or forgiving. Drums occupy space even when they're minimal, just enough to tether $ilk's rhythmic meanderings. Much of the blown-out '80s soul and Weather Channel jazz soundscapes come from frequent collaborator Khalil Blu, who's credited on 10 of 15 tracks, including five co-productions with $ilk himself. Mutant Academy's Sycho Sid provides the beats for “Fuuuuck, Baby. You're Just So Sexy When You're Terrified” and “There Are Hills and Mountains Between Us, Always Something to Get Over,” both of which bend that group's bubbly, soul-sample psychedelia toward the more intense, candy-flipping style $ilk prefers. The mixes are loud but cogent; each frequency pushes to the ceiling, always threatening to bury $ilk's voice but somehow leaving a decent margin around it. The album takes a while to unpack; its song titles are riddles posed by an especially online bridge troll, and each cryptic verse seems to twist through a hundred different ideas. There's a strange mysticism to this music, with $ilk playing the part of psychotropic philosopher, carrying knowledge retrieved from the depths of consciousness. His densely layered thoughts perpetually shift from macro to micro, touching on everything from theoretical physics to his skincare routine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The couple recently welcomed their first child, a baby girl, via surrogate, according to Page Six. The “Blue Crush” star and the “He's Just Not That Into You” actor have largely kept their relationship low-key since it began, but fans have followed their journey from setmates to soulmates. “One day our kids might ask me, ‘Dad, why did you write sappy things about Mom on that old Instagram app? “Because she completed all of your Dad's favorite love songs.” Bosworth responded in the comments, saying his tribute “overwhelmed my cellular makeup” and added, “Wherever we are, with you, I am home.” Bosworth and Long's relationship has quietly blossomed in recent years. That same year, they went Instagram official, sharing heartfelt tributes and travel snaps. By early 2023, engagement buzz picked up when Bosworth was seen wearing a diamond ring at the Vanity Fair Oscars party. They got married just a few months later in what they described as an “impromptu and casual” ceremony in New York. Since then, the pair have continued sharing loving messages, birthday tributes and glimpses of their travels to destinations like the Galápagos and Ireland. In January 2024, Long's birthday tribute to Bosworth sparked speculation that they were ready to start a family — and now, that moment has arrived. In March 2025, Bosworth and Long opened up about embracing aging as a couple during an interview at the Clarins Beauty Icons event in Los Angeles. Long, 46, added, “It's easy to love when somebody's aging so beautifully. The pair also credited their bond to trust, open communication and shared self-care rituals — including an LED light mask Long originally gifted to Bosworth, but now enjoys himself. “She helps me calm down and take the stress away from life,” he said. They recently celebrated their second wedding anniversary on May 4 which Long once described as “our love day” with personal significance, unrelated to “Star Wars,” despite what many fans assume.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hey, did Michael Douglas somehow summon this up by announcing he was retiring? The Wrap is reporting that Amazon MGM and United Artists are chucking $2 million—which will be upped to $4 million if the movie actually gets made—at screenwriting sleaze legend Joe Eszterhas, reportedly to write a reboot of his massively successful 1992 money-maker Basic Instinct. This is fairly wild, in so far as Eszterhas has been absent from any real Hollywood conversation—absent the occasional Showgirls nostalgia/irony confluence—for nearly 30 years, having been dropped out of the business around the time his 1997 comedy Burn Hollywood Burn bombed massively. (He did get some nice press from his 2004 memoir Hollywood Animal, but since then it's mostly been occasional headlines about feuding with Mel Gibson, and a little light coverage of his post-flop pivot to Jesus.) But apparently he's spent at least some of that intervening time writing a new Basic Instinct on spec. “But,” we hear you asking, “How will this film, a cinematic return to a movie that collided with the sexual politics of the 1990s with absolutely zero subtlety, respond to the updated mores of our modern era?” Well, The Wrap reports that Eszterhas' script is apparently—per an insider source—for an “anti-woke” version of a story that was already about how those dang bisexuals are always just waiting to seduce you and then stick an icepick in your head, so let that little shudder of horror you felt during the first half of this sentence serve as a reminder that Eszterhas has still got the juice, fright-wise. Amazon MGM has apparently drawn a lesson from this, although god only knows if it'll be the right one.
