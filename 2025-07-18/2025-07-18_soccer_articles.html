                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least, that's what American soccer legend and former USMNT striker Clint Dempsey had to say to The Associated Press after the recent 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, where the USMNT played in front of packed buildings of Guatemalan and Mexican fans, on American soil. There were more fans for the opposing team. So it's up to the national team players to put a product on the field that makes people want to go spend their hard-earned money,” Dempsey said, tipping the team was also missing some key players, including Christian Pulisic, who opted for rest over national team duty. “I want to see a team that is playing in an exciting style, whether it's defending well, building out of the back, getting forward, creating chances, getting goals...I just want to see the fight and the grit that we saw in the Gold Cup, just with more quality. While the U.S. made a run to the final with wins against Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, Guatemala and Costa Rica, few of their games came with ample home support. Yet, they did get intense American-favoring crowds in Connecticut at two pre-tournament friendlies, where they fell to Switzerland and Türkiye. Despite the missing pieces, the USMNT showed a grit and desire unparalleled in recent months, with the play and effort of Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna drawing comparisons to Dempsey's days. "Sometimes it's one of those situations where you need someone to shake things up, right? So I think after Copa América, after Nations League, there definitely needed to be some things shook up.” The USMNT will not have the chance to play a competitive game before next year's World Cup, but could play up to 10 friendlies, with four scheduled in September and October against South Korea, Japan, Colombia and Ecuador. While the USMNT's opponents have often drawn on strong expat communities to create hostile atmospheres at home games, the prices of tickets from U.S. Soccer, Concacaf, and other match organizers have also priced out many casual supporters, sometimes leaving empty stands as well.. “We've always believed soccer should be for everyone,” said Justin Brunken, co-founder of American Outlaws. “This partnership with U.S. Soccer helps eliminate one of the biggest barriers - cost - and makes it possible for more passionate fans to stand, sing, and support together.” Ben Steiner is an American-Canadian journalist who brings in-depth experience, having covered the North American national teams, MLS, CPL, NWSL, NSL and Liga MX for prominent outlets, including MLSsoccer.com, CBC Sports, and OneSoccer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a former college mathematics major, Pellegrino Matarazzo could tell you a thing or two about chaos theory — the unpredictable nature of things. Or he could just refer to his last 18 months in football. During that time, the 47-year-old was sacked as manager of Bundesliga side Hoffenheim despite saving them from relegation and then guiding them into the Europa League. So, instead, he spent time observing Claudio Ranieri's work at close quarters as the veteran Italian became Roma's third manager of a turbulent campaign, steering them to a fifth-place finish. That's why, of all his attributes, Matarazzo thinks one in particular makes him especially suited to a job in the dugout. It's not speaking four languages, or the resilience which helped him break barriers as an American coach in Europe at Stuttgart and then fellow Germans Hoffenheim. “I've always been someone who's able to deal with chaos very well,” he says. “Because I have the ability to focus on what's important. Matarazzo has just returned to his home in Germany, having spent the last month working as an analyst for host broadcaster DAZN at the Club World Cup. It was the first time he had taken on such a role. “It really pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me valuable insights into the entertainment side of the game, which I hadn't been exposed to in the same way during my career.” But, while watching games at FIFA's revamped and greatly expanded club tournament from a television studio, Matarazzo was also expanding his knowledge of the game beyond Europe, where he has coached since retiring as a player at German side Nurnberg in 2010. As Brazilian teams reached the quarter-finals (Palmeiras) and semis (Fluminense), he was impressed. But the Brazilian teams in particular, they played with a complete brand of football which I value highly: very pragmatic, disciplined, organised. “It's completely contrary to the old stereotype of Brazilian football, which was usually about flair, technical ability and creativity. For a coach who admits he would love to work in the Premier League, Matarazzo also noted how eventual winners Chelsea are quickly developing from big-spending also-rans into a potentially dominant force in the game once again. “I was watching them in the first couple of games, and there was still a lot of sand in their engine. I'm a fan of (another new option for Chelsea up front Liam) Delap, don't get me wrong, but he's a different profile. I think Palmer becomes more creative with Joao Pedro in there, too. “It's just a great team and when I see (Moises) Caicedo, how he plays… oh man. They conceded very few chances (in the final) against Paris Saint-Germain. “One of the critical things I was seeing in the first few games is that they can now break down low blocks. That's why, with this extra element of Joao Pedro coming in, plus the other players that they already had in their roster, I think it's going to be fun to watch in the upcoming season. Matarazzo's enthusiasm for the club game is so palpable you suspect it will not be long before he returns to management. For now, he prefers to stay in Europe, having turned down offers from MLS sides, but in different circumstances he could have spent this summer guiding the USMNT through their Concacaf Gold Cup participation. As a candidate under consideration, he held talks with U.S. Soccer in 2024 before the federation ultimately opted for Pochettino's greater star-factor. “I did truly appreciate the great conversations we had,” he says. He's an established coach with tremendous international experience at club level. And if you're just two years short of a run-up to a home World Cup, then it's important to energise the U.S. soccer landscape emotionally. So that's something a big name like Pochettino can absolutely do.” But what does he think of the task facing the Argentine after a summer when key senior players, most notably Christian Pulisic, withdrew from the roster to prioritise rest after busy seasons with their clubs. Reaching the final of the Gold Cup with several key players missing was a significant achievement for Pochettino, that's my opinion. It's a result that will earn him both respect and credibility within the U.S. soccer landscape moving forward. I felt like, in this tournament, it was the first time you felt real progress was made in establishing a culture, an identity, which built around what we in Germany call the basics of football; when you speak about work ethic, intensity, a team-first mindset and when you get those basics down, then you can grow a programme.” The loss to Mexico in the final was not a question of mentality; it was a question of quality. So if there's growth happening in this next coming year and if the players feel it and you take that momentum into the tournament, then it can be successful.” Matarazzo feels that new Bayer Leverkusen signing Malik Tillman and Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna took their chances to impress at the Gold Cup: “They were given a platform, and they performed. And that not only gives Pochettino more options going forward, but it creates healthy competition. Matarazzo will be watching Tillman's progress back at club level in Germany with interest. The midfielder came through Greuther Furth's academy before moving to Bayern Munich, and later PSV of the Netherlands, before joining Leverkusen earlier this month in a €35million (£30m; $41m) move. “Malik sees slots opening to play the ball deep. So with Tillman and Luna in mind, how does Pochettino go about reintegrating players such as Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Folarin Balogun while retaining the emphasis on that ‘team-first' idea? “Like I said before, if you have something in place that you want to see, and the players coming into that culture already feel the energy in the group, it's easier for them to adapt. Matarazzo is still smarting from the nature of his sacking by Hoffenheim in November. He had to contend with a total overhaul of the club's management structure after he had saved them from relegation after being appointed in February 2023 and then delivered qualification for the Europa League a year later, with the CEO and sporting director who had hired him both being fired during the following pre-season. “So I was not looked favourably upon — there were people within the club who were very happy to see me go. So it was just a difficult situation; keeping the players in balance, protecting myself from invisible attacks and just a lot of volatility and chaos in the club. “And listen, I coached at Stuttgart for almost three years. So I've been part of emotional clubs and we also had a change of leadership at Stuttgart when Thomas Hitzlsperger stopped in 2022 (the former Germany midfielder left his role as CEO). I was working there, and then Alex Wehrle came in, so I knew what that feels like but that situation felt natural — this was not natural.” “But I don't have to get into details anymore because it's in the past and I've already reflected on my time there. He has no shortage of learnings to reflect on before that next step from his time observing Ranieri and more recently successor Gian Piero Gasperini at Roma. He can turn, too, to a room-mate from his coaching-course days — former Hoffenheim, RB Leipzig and Bayern manager and current German national team boss Julian Nagelsmann. “I've known Julian for a long time,” he says. We completed our pro licence together and he brought me onto his coaching staff midway through the season (at Hoffenheim in 2017). I took a lot from our experiences together, not just tactically but in terms of leadership, communication. He admits also to admiring Roberto De Zerbi's tactics in the Premier League at Brighton in recent seasons but his ultimate inspiration, when it comes to hard work and perseverance, is familial. “My mom and dad came to the United States with nothing,” says Matarazzo. “They were from a long line of Italian farmers. “They put four kids through college (Matarazzo graduated from New York City's Columbia University). They gave us the tools we needed to be successful in this life. Matarazzo's accent is identifiably American but he can just as easily lapse into a German-English inflection. Still, he has had to deal with flickers of European prejudice against American coaches in the sport. “A foreign coach is more readily accepted into any football culture if they come with a proven track record and if they can speak the native language,” he says. “I often ask myself, why do most (football) commentators and analysts in the U.S. still have English or Spanish accents? It tells you something about perception, and there's certainly been a shift in a positive direction since I first arrived in Europe 25 years ago. “But when it comes to American coaches and experts, I'd say we're still in the process of earning credibility, both abroad and within our own country. But even that, it's still a completely cut-throat business and there are so many highly qualified coaches out of work all competing for the same opportunity. There's still a curiosity within me, ‘How high can I go? Matarazzo is ready to embrace the chaos once again. He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

They gave us the tools we needed to be successful in this life. Matarazzo's accent is identifiably American but he can just as easily lapse into a German-English inflection. Still, he has had to deal with flickers of European prejudice against American coaches in the sport. “A foreign coach is more readily accepted into any football culture if they come with a proven track record and if they can speak the native language,” he says. “I often ask myself, why do most (football) commentators and analysts in the U.S. still have English or Spanish accents? It tells you something about perception, and there's certainly been a shift in a positive direction since I first arrived in Europe 25 years ago. “But when it comes to American coaches and experts, I'd say we're still in the process of earning credibility, both abroad and within our own country. But even that, it's still a completely cut-throat business and there are so many highly qualified coaches out of work all competing for the same opportunity. There's still a curiosity within me, ‘How high can I go? Matarazzo is ready to embrace the chaos once again. He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino is the kind of coach that USMNT supporters have been claiming the team deserved for a decade. He was also the kind of coach that people like me said they would never get. He managed the most dysfunctional collection of superstar attackers ever assembled with Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar at PSG. And overall, his teams have mostly done what all well-coached teams do: perform at a higher level than their collective talent suggests they should. They played poorly in the we're-not-sure-how-much-this-matters third-place game against Canada. They got whupped by Turkey and Switzerland in a pair of pre-Gold Cup friendlies. Italy won Euro 2020 and then missed the 2022 men's World Cup. So, for things to get better for the USMNT before they co-host the World Cup next summer, what needs to happen? When asked about re-integrating all of the European players after the loss to Mexico, Pochettino was vague and a little irritated in his answer. Now, it was fun to see a bunch of new faces get significant playing time this summer. And I don't deny that there was a different vibe with the team when it was filled with guys who felt like their USMNT futures were on the line with every match. But vibes can only get you so far. • Non-penalty expected goals: 3.39 • Non-penalty expected goals allowed: 3.18 • Final-third possession: 44.4% • Touches in the penalty area: 50 • Opponent touches in the penalty area: 72 Granted, the USMNT are ranked 45th, so perhaps it makes sense that they ended up about even on chances created and conceded. But the expectations are obviously way higher than that for next summer. The so-called "Golden Generation" of American soccer hasn't worked out as expected. Pulisic had superstar potential and he's settled into more like a "Champions League starter" level at AC Milan. Same went for Gio Reyna and he's been a non-factor at any professional level for the past three years. Tyler Adams seemed like a potential Champions League-level holding midfielder and has become more like an average Premier League player. Tim Weah probably met expectations by becoming an off-the-bench contributor at Juventus. Weston McKennie met expectations by becoming something closer to a starter at Juve. The only guy who significantly exceeded expectations was Antonee Robinson, who is genuinely one of the best left backs in the Premier League and would probably be moving to a much bigger club this summer if he were a couple years younger. The main reason the USMNT isn't better is because most of these guys landed somewhere around their 50th-percentile career outcomes, or worse. There's a reality where Dest stays at Barcelona, Adams is killing it for Atlético Madrid, Reyna made a move to Bayern Munich, and Pulisic is starring opposite Mohamed Salah at Liverpool. Unfortunately, that's not the reality in which we live. Stewart Robson believes the USMNT might struggle at next year's World Cup after its poor performance in the Gold Cup final. Nine outfield players featured in at least 270 minutes of game time in 2022: two of them were 35-year-old Tim Ream and 29-year-old Walker Zimmerman, while the other seven were Pulisic, Weah, Adams, McKennie, Musah, Robinson and Dest. Given how many games these guys are playing in Europe and the general fallibility of the human body, I don't know if I'd count on as many of the stars being healthy enough to play next summer. But so long as everyone is back in the fold, this question is going to have the biggest bearing on how well the team performs next summer: Who is healthy enough to play? Forget dads using ChatGPT to defend their sons. And depending on your body shape, you feel comfortable or not, depending where is the line, what is the goal, what is your position when you receive the ball... Given that Weah is right-footed, this might seem like Pochettino opting for another winger who can cut in and shoot, as most top teams do these days. But he claims it's because of Weah's eyed-ness (? He's scored eight goals in the last four domestic seasons combined. He's not really a player you want playing in front of the opposition defensive line. Instead, he stretches the field by staying wide and running behind a defense. That's what he did under Berhalter when he played on the right, most notably against Wales in the opening match in Qatar. Under Berhalter, Weah received 0.27 through balls per 90 minutes -- by far the most of any player who featured in at least 20 matches. Under Pochettino, the USMNT has completed 14 through balls -- and none of them have been to Weah. And that helps explain why Pochettino likes the new Derby County striker so much. Agyemang's ability to run behind and battle for long balls does allow the U.S. to move the ball up the field, but he's still so below-par in front of goal and in possession that I really don't think it's worth it. You can't work more intricate buildup patterns or interchanging movements; you have to play long to Agyemang to move the ball up the field, which I think then makes his role in the team seem more important than it actually is. Pochettino needs to figure out how to arrange his attackers in a way that lets the Americans stress opposition defenses horizontally and vertically while also allowing him to play a striker like Folarin Balogun, who will actually get shots and score goals against tougher opposition. I have no clue how good Matt Turner is at stopping shots right now. What I do know is that when he was in MLS, he was one of the best shot-stoppers the league had ever seen. What I also know is that none of the USMNT's other potential goalkeepers in MLS have come anywhere close to Turner's performance level in MLS. So, based on all of that, my outside assumption is that if Turner starts playing professional soccer again, he will be the team's clear best option in goal. Matt Freese was fine at the Gold Cup. But in regular play, he looked quite shaky at times, even if it didn't result in too many extra goals being scored against the USMNT. As for the other options -- Zack Steffen, Patrick Schulte -- we really just have no idea how well they'd perform in a jump up in level from MLS to the World Cup. Given how much of a role goalkeepers play in whether or not shots turn into goals, there's an argument that they really are among the most valuable players on the field. They don't touch the ball much, but pretty much every time they do, it's a high-leverage moment. That's especially true in a limited-game tournament like the World Cup. It's just ... is Turner actually going to get playing time? He's expected to sign with Lyon -- if their financial situation gets sorted out -- and that's a massive, neon "if" that's visible from outer space. Unless Perri is going to move to a new team, then I don't see how Turner signing with Lyon solves any of the problems Turner has had in England. McKennie, Adams and Musah made up a complimentary trio that could outrun basically any other team in the tournament. McKennie and Musah didn't play in this summer's Gold Cup, of course, but Adams did and I can't remember him ever looking worse in a USMNT shirt. Instead, they hung on for dear life in both, and then they just couldn't hang against El Tri. Sebastian Berhalter's set-piece delivery led to a couple important goals for the Americans this summer, but he just doesn't impact the game enough otherwise. Luca de la Torre can be a nice complimentary player -- making the right runs, keeping possession, occupying the necessary spaces -- but he's more someone who will help you once you've controlled the game, rather than help you take control of it. But Adams, really, was straight-up awful in possession. Per Stats Perform's expected-possession-value model, he actually decreased the USMNT's chances of scoring with his passing. No one else who played significant minutes was below 0.07. On top of all that, Atlético Madrid-bound Johnny Cardoso barely played at the Gold Cup and really struggled against Turkey and Switzerland. Some other Europe-based players who have featured under Pochettino in the past -- Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris, Gianluca Busio -- weren't on the roster. Perhaps there's a world where Reyna becomes a viable pro again, but he too missed the Gold Cup so he could play 12 total minutes at the Club World Cup. Malik Tillman emerged as an option -- both with his play this summer and his massive move to Bayer Leverkusen -- but he's more of a floating-between-the-lines tweener rather than a true midfielder. And after all, these are the "problems" Pochettino is getting paid to figure out.</p>

It's been a while, but Mike DeCourcy of The Sporting News, fresh off covering FIFA Club World Cup at Met Life Stadium earlier in the week, joins Pittsburgh Soccer Now‘s John Krysinsky on a new episode of Sounding Off on Soccer Podcast.

With the FIFA World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico less than one year away, Mike and John discuss the state of USMNT along with more on FIFA's Club World Cup while also looking forward to the World Cup being played at Met Life Stadium and nearby venues to Pittsburgh.

Then, somewhat shifting gears, John also tackles another column that Mike, a member of US Basketball Writers Hall of Fame, wrote about this week, which is one of the greatest debates that extends to all sports fans, Michael Jordan vs LeBron James.  Tying it into soccer — they discuss what is the equivalent debate of who's the greatest soccer player of our lifetime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was seen as a strong contender to host the 2030 World Cup final but a new report suggests the soon-to-be-historic Grand Stade Hassan II de Casablanca stadium will not stage the showpiece event. For the first time ever, three countries from two continents – Spain, Portugal and Morocco – will host the World Cup, while cities like Barcelona, Lisbon, Las Palmas, Madrid, Agadir, and Zaragoza are set to host matches. Last year, Morocco launched plans to build the world's largest stadium, the Grand Stade Hassan II – a 115,000-capacity arena that will include 32 stairways, botanical gardens at ground level and a 100-hectare sports and leisure district. The stadium will also feature three steep, compact tiers, accommodating 29,500 spectators at each end of the bowl. Additionally, five tiers of hospitality seats are also planned, including VIP and hospitality boxes that will cater up to 12,000 spectators. "It's a generous space, open to the world and respectful to the nature it protects. Work on the stadium is already underway in the Benslimane province just east of Casablanca, and back in May, it was reported that the stadium could host the World Cup final following its competition in late 2027. But a report from Spanish publication Marca suggests the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabeu stadium is now expected to host the final after an agreement was reached between FIFA and Real Madrid. FIFA will open an office in Rabat after the summer, once Moroccan authorities have already approved the launch of a World Cup office in the capital."

That's according to a clause in the Host City Agreement, recently obtained and published by independent journalist Bob Mackin of The Breaker News after a three-year battle. That's potentially bad news for business owners like Ismet Yetisen, who runs the Boston Pizza on Beaty Street, right next door to BC Place. Yetisen told Global News he'd been banking on the World Cup as a big opportunity for his restaurant. “My business is right next to one of the biggest stadiums in Canada. And obviously it brings a lot of income to me, but at the same time it brings lots of friends, and it brings out the people that eventually want to come back.” But options will likely be limited in Vancouver's case, given the fact that BC Place is nestled in the heart of downtown Vancouver, rather than surrounded by large parking lots like some other North American venues. “It makes sense to have an exclusionary zone, we are talking about a high-profile event. We have even learned in the City of Vancouver recently why security really matters, so that is really a no-brainer,” said Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim, referring to the recent Lapu Lapu Day festival vehicle ramming attack. “We are very attuned to the fact that it will have some impact on businesses, and we get the opportunity to look ahead and work with the local businesses to turn this into an opportunity for them as well, but those conversations are going to be ongoing, and we are going to work through it.” Yetisen, meanwhile, remains hopeful the city can come to an agreement with FIFA that won't see him and other nearby businesses shut out of what could be a golden opportunity.</p>
