Please make this work possible with a quick donation. President Donald Trump is threatening to sue The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, over a bombshell report detailing a cryptic birthday message he sent to disgraced financier and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein two decades ago. Trump lashed out at the conservative publication on Thursday, describing its reporting as “fake” and claiming that the letter to Epstein wasn't his. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. “No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life,” Trump said in a 2002 interview. The letter The Wall Street Journal asserts is from Trump is part of a larger collection of messages from Epstein's friends that were compiled into a book by his former girlfriend and confidante, Ghislaine Maxwell, who helped him recruit girls into his sex trafficking ring (including one Maxwell discovered at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate). “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,” Trump reportedly concluded the message. On his Truth Social account, Trump blasted The Wall Street Journal, threatening legal repercussions for their publication of the report. “The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein. He added that the letter in question couldn't be his because he doesn't “draw pictures” — a defense that is questionable, at best, as Trump has drawn and sold at least five pictures at auction over the years, and has stated in a book he authored in 2010 that he draws yearly to support charities. “Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?” Vance wrote on social media. In response to Vance's comments, HuffPost noted that the vice president was defending the integrity of “a man who was famously caught on camera saying stars as big as him could grab women ‘by the pussy. Several commentators suggested that The Wall Street Journal wouldn't have published the letter without vigorously fact-checking the letter's origins with Epstein, given that Trump frequently threatens lawsuits against media. “The president of the United States sues people for lots of money all the time — if you publish this, you know he's likely to sue you,” MSNBC's Chris Hayes said on his Thursday evening program. “People should just consider the amount of thought that went into whether they were going to publish this, on behalf of The Wall Street Journal, given…[Trump] explicitly threatening them, in their interview that he's going to sue, and they're assessing how believable this is.” But The Wall Street Journal clearly believes it is — and given the legal risk of publishing something that could be defamatory, it's safe to assume the paper verified its contents to a high standard,” Goddard wrote, adding: If the letter were forged — never reviewed by prosecutors or dismissed as fake by the Justice Department — Trump allies like Pam Bondi or Kash Patel would almost certainly have said so by now. Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser for the Harris campaign, said on CNN Thursday night that there were larger questions prompted by the explosive story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police in Brazil swooped on the home and political headquarters of Jair Bolsonaro early Friday, searching the properties, ordering the former president to wear an electronic ankle tag, barring him from speaking to foreign officials or approaching embassies and prohibiting him from using social media. Federal police also accused Bolsonaro and his son, Eduardo, of conspiring with the US government to impose sanctions against Brazilian officials, according to court documents. That action, the court said, “would directly benefit his father and financier, Jair Messias Bolsonaro.” Federal police also seized an unspecified amount of US dollars in cash. Bolsonaro added that police seized “about 14,000 US dollars” and claimed the money was for personal use, adding he had the receipts to prove it. Trump last week threatened Brazil with tariffs of 50% starting August 1, according to a letter posted to his social media platform, Truth Social. The court documents highlighted a confidential meeting Bolsonaro had with a US State Department official and highlighted Trump's letter as an “offensive” and “clear threat” to Brazilian sovereignty. Speaking exclusively to CNN Thursday, da Silva, who is widely known as Lula, said that Trump's threats had broken away from “protocol” and argued that his predecessor's fate cannot be part of trade negotiations. Related article Brazil's President Lula says Trump was ‘not elected to be emperor of the world,' as US-Brazil spat escalates Lula added that Trump would be standing trial in his country if the actions he took during the January 6 insurrection had been committed in Brazil. On Friday, Trump posted a letter to Bolsonaro on Truth Social, in which he suggested the former Brazilian leader was the victim of an “unjust system” and said that he would be “watching closely.” Bolsonaro could face more than four decades behind bars if found guilty of masterminding the coup. He is among 34 people charged with five crimes, including attempting the coup. Part of the coup plot, prosecutors allege, involved a plan to potentially assassinate Lula, his vice president and a minister of the Supreme Court. Brian Winter, executive vice president of Americas Society and Council of the Americas, told CNN that, for Brazil, the US is not as significant a trading partner as say, China. “Brazil only sends about 11% of its exports to the United States,” Winter said. “That's half what Brazil sends to China, and for some of Brazil's exports – not all, but for some of them – they can find other markets besides the United States.” “The question is, if this keeps escalating, could President Trump use measures that are even more painful, such as financial sanctions against large groups of people?” Winter asked, noting that Trump previously threatened, among other things, a travel ban on Colombian citizens during a disagreement with the Colombian government over migrant flights. “It's possible that President Trump could continue to escalate this in a way that could eventually produce considerably more pain for the Brazilian government and for the Brazilian people,” Winter said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly two in five Democratic-leaning voters would consider joining a non-Musk-led third party. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. New polling this week indicates that there is a strong desire among U.S. voters for a third political party, to counter both the Republican and Democratic parties. However, when asked if they'd join a party created by billionaire Elon Musk, voters overwhelmingly rejected the idea. After hinting for several weeks that he'd start a new party after he and President Donald Trump had a public falling out, Musk created an unscientific poll on his X profile earlier this month, asking his followers if they supported his idea for an “America Party.” The poll, which undoubtedly oversampled fans of Musk, showed support for the idea. After the survey's conclusion, Musk vowed to establish his own political party. According to the poll, one in two voters, 49 percent, signaled that they would join or consider joining a third party. Only 17 percent of voters overall said they'd join or consider joining that party, with more than three in four voters, 77 percent, saying they wouldn't. The poll demonstrates that voters are indeed supportive of the idea of a third party — but not one created or endorsed by Musk, whose far right views and support for neo-fascist politics have been on full display over the past year. A higher rate of Democratic-leaning voters (39 percent) said they'd consider a third party option than Republican-leaning voters (28 percent), the Quinnipiac University poll found. When Musk's name is added into the mix, support for a third party drops among both groups, with Republican voters more likely to support the idea (18 percent) than Democratic voters (6 percent). Notably, Democratic voters gave congressional lawmakers from their own party low approval ratings — only 39 percent of those voters approve of the way they're handling their jobs, while 52 percent disapprove, the poll showed. The dismal numbers from Democrats may indicate that Democratic voters are upset with their party's approach to disrupting or opposing the Trump administration. Indeed, when voters overall are polled on Trump, only 40 percent say they're happy with the job he's performed in his second term so far, while 54 percent say they disapprove. Trump is underwater on a number of issues in the poll, too. Voters are also indicating that they're more likely to support Democrats than Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections — though only barely so. According to an average of polling data collected by RealClearPolling, Democrats are ahead of Republicans by around 3 points in a generic congressional ballot question. While the midterms are still year and a half out, such polling demonstrates that control of Congress (particularly the House of Representatives) could come down to just a few races next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Celebrities have expressed disappointment and anger at the controversial decision to end the long-running Late Show, bringing an end to host Stephen Colbert's award-winning tenure. Paramount is seeking approval for a $8.4bn merger with Skydance, a company ran by David Ellison, son of close Trump ally Larry Ellison. Colbert called it a “big fat bribe” earlier this week and later announced to his audience that the show would be ending next year. “Let me tell you, it is a fantastic job,” he said. And it is a job I am looking forward to doing with this usual gang of idiots for another 10 months.” The Late Show received an Emmy nomination earlier this week for talk series. “Sorry to hear @CBS is canceling one of the best shows they have,” the actor and director Ben Stiller wrote on X. “This is absolute bullshit and I for one am looking forward to the next 10 months of shows.” Excited to see what other brilliance you put into the world.” Broadcast journalist Katie Couric added: “I am so upset about this. The West Side Story and Evita actor Rachel Zegler wrote: “i am extremely sad. The author Stephen King, known for being politically outspoken online, posted: “Colbert canceled? The actor John Cusack shared a clip of Colbert on social media and wrote: “He's not groveling enough to American fascism – Larry Ellison needs his tax cuts – doesn't need comedians reminding people they are not cattle.” Andy Cohen, the TV personality who hosts late-night show Watch What Happens Live, called it “a sad day” both for late-night television and for CBS. “He's one of three late-night shows deemed worthy enough for an Emmy nomination. Colbert's late-night rival Jimmy Kimmel also weighed in, sharing his frustration with the decision. In an Instagram story poking fun at the network's much-ridiculed comedy shows, he wrote: “Love you, Stephen. Trump has already taken a victory lap on Truth Social, writing: “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justice Collins Rice says it is for politicians and not courts to change rules around two-child benefit cap Two women who conceived their eldest children while they were in violent and controlling relationships have lost a legal challenge to the rules around the two-child benefit cap. But in a judgment delivered on Friday, Justice Collins Rice said it was for politicians to settle the matter, not the courts. The women, and campaigners who support them, said they were disappointed but would fight on to have universal credit rules changed. The two-child cap for universal credit claims has exceptions to cover a limited number of circumstances, including if a child is conceived nonconsensually. But the court heard how this only applies to third or subsequent children, leaving some women unable to utilise this exception if, for example, their first two children are conceived after rape but they have further children in consensual relationships. “They are chilling accounts of appalling domestic abuse,” she said. “Vulnerable girls barely out of childhood themselves caught in toxic relationships, or repeating cycles of such relationships, in which their personal, reproductive and family autonomy is acutely compromised by the physical, sexual and emotional violence of controlling perpetrators.” She said the women were “among the most harmed and vulnerable” members of society while as mothers they were “making an important and valuable” contribution to it. She said she had reached the same place as the supreme court did before, saying it was “a policy question dealing in social, economic, moral and ethical subject matter” and a “political law-reform question”. In a statement after the ruling, the mother named EFG said: “All of my choices were taken away from me for years by my abuser before I fled. The other mother, LMN, said: “I want to keep going with the case as I feel like it's against my human rights. When my oldest came back to live with me from care and before I got the exception for my youngest, we had to survive on less money. That stopped me doing things with the children – I never planned on having the children but that's not their fault.” “This court decision is about whether a policy – designed by the previous government – was being implemented lawfully. This policy will be considered along with all other levers including social security reform by the child poverty taskforce.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks to reporters as President Donald Trump listens, Friday, June 27, 2025, in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. Trump denied writing the letter, calling it “false, malicious, and defamatory.” With Epstein conspiracy theories, Trump faces a crisis of his own making Trump has also shielded his attorney-general from being questioned about the case after she walked back claims of the existence of a “client list” of elites who participated in Epstein's crimes, and has even taken to claiming without evidence that files were doctored by Democrats. In an administration that prides itself on changing the narrative on negative storylines, the Epstein saga has had remarkable staying power, thanks in part to infighting at high levels of government, Trump's blistering criticism of his own base and the head-scratching mystery of why documents his own administration promised to unlock will remain buried – seemingly for good. U.S. President Donald Trump tries to clamp down on criticism over records in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking investigation. Bondi said she would seek court permission Friday to release grand jury information, but it would require a judge's approval, and she and Trump were silent on the additional evidence collected by federal law enforcement in the sprawling investigation that Bondi last week announced she would not release. Trump orders release of grand jury testimony in Epstein case The letter revealed by The Wall Street Journal was reportedly collected by disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell as part of a birthday album for Epstein years before the wealthy financier was first arrested in 2006 and subsequently had a falling-out with Trump. The letter bearing Trump's name includes text framed by the outline of what appears to be a hand-drawn naked woman and ends with, “Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret,” according to the newspaper. Maxwell was arrested in 2020 and convicted a year later on charges that she helped Epstein lure girls to be sexually abused. Vice President JD Vance said The Wall Street Journal “should be ashamed” for publishing it. Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?” he wrote on X. U.S. President Donald Trump praised his Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the Epstein files Tuesday, telling reporters she "has handled it very well" and saying it's up to her whether to release any more records related to the sex trafficking investigation. The Justice Department's reversal on the Epstein files not only angered Trump supporters but touched off a testy exchange at the White House last week between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino that neither official has publicly addressed. Even though his administration for months had hyped the expected release of more documents, Trump slammed his own supporters earlier this week for their furor over the Epstein files saga. Trump called it a “hoax” and tried to place blame on Democrats, accusing former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, as well as former FBI Director James Comey – without evidence – of making up such documents. That frustrated House Republicans, who tried to forge a solution that could include a resolution supporting the release of “credible” files pertaining to Epstein and his activities. Trump himself has faced years of scrutiny over his own private life. Last year, for instance, he was convicted of felony charges in New York in connection with hush money payments meant to silence an adult film star's sex claims ahead of the 2016 presidential election. And Trump's ties to Epstein have been well-documented, though the president has not been accused of misconduct in connection with their social relationship. Video footage unearthed by NBC News following Epstein's federal indictment in 2019 showed the two chatting at a party at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in 1992. The video, recorded at a time when Trump was newly divorced, shows him surrounded by young women, whom NBC identified as cheerleaders for the Buffalo Bills. Previously released files included a 2016 deposition in which an accuser recounted spending several hours with Epstein at Trump's Atlantic City casino but didn't say if she actually met Trump and did not accuse him of any wrongdoing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadian Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne speaks at the G20 meeting in Durban, South Africa on Thursday.RAJESH JANTILAL/AFP/Getty Images Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 countries stressed the importance of central bank independence and pledged to boost cooperation in a communique they issued on Friday after a two-day meeting in South Africa. In their first communique since last October, a month before U.S. President Donald Trump's election victory and subsequent tariff war, the ministers and central bankers highlighted the uncertainty in the global economy caused by conflicts, trade tensions and frequent extreme weather events. The issue of central bank independence hung heavily over the meeting in South Africa's coastal city of Durban following Trump's repeated berating of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates, attacks that have roiled global financial markets. “Central banks are strongly committed to ensuring price stability, consistent with their respective mandates, and will continue to adjust their policies in a data-dependent manner. Central bank independence is crucial to achieving this goal,” the communique said. Trump says firing U.S. Federal Reserve's Powell is ‘highly unlikely' South Africa's deputy finance minister David Masondo told reporters that the meeting outcomes contained in the communique were “consented to by all members” and centred on “strategic macroeconomic issues.” “The biggest news is that they issued a communique instead of just a chair's statement,” said Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council. G20 finance chiefs meet under tariff cloud in South Africa While it referred to “extreme weather events and natural disasters” as economic challenges, the communique did not explicitly address climate change. German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said earlier on Friday that he made clear to his counterparts from the Group of Seven major economies that the global trade conflict must be ended quickly. Instead, it mentioned “ongoing wars and conflicts” without elaborating. South Africa, under its presidency's motto “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability,” has aimed to promote an African agenda, with topics including the high cost of capital and funding for climate change action.

MOSCOW, July 18. /TASS/. A Challenging process is currently underway to bring relations between Russia and the United States out of their deteriorated state, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.

His statement comes in the wake of US Army Europe and Africa commander, Gen. Christopher Donahue, who told Defense News that Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad is roughly 47 miles wide and surrounded by NATO on all sides, so the US and its allies now have the capability to "take that down from the ground in a timeframe that is unheard of and faster than we've ever been able to do."

"A dialogue is still a dialogue, but there is a complicated process currently underway of bringing our relations [between Russia and the United States] out of a rather deplorable state," Peskov said at a news briefing.

"The process itself is very complicated and time-consuming," he added.

On July 17, Leonid Slutsky, the chairman of the international affairs committee of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament), said in response to Donahue's statement that a possible NATO attack on Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad will trigger an adequate response from Russia, including measures stipulated by its nuclear doctrine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cyber specialists from Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) have carried out a large-scale cyberattack against the network infrastructure of Russian energy giant Gazprom, causing significant disruptions, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on July 18. The alleged operation took place on July 17 and targeted systems used by Gazprom and its subsidiaries, which Ukraine's intelligence claims are directly involved in supporting Russia's war effort. Gazprom is Russia's state-owned energy company, one of the world's largest gas producers and exporters. The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems. According to the source, access to Gazprom's internal systems was disabled for nearly 20,000 system administrators, and backup copies of key databases were wiped. The sources said the attackers managed to destroy clusters of "extremely powerful" servers running 1C, a software widely used for managing documents and contracts, analytics data for pipelines, valves, pumps, and SCADA systems — key elements in operating Gazprom's technical infrastructure. Multiple servers reportedly had operating systems removed or disabled, and the BIOS (basic firmware) of many devices was damaged, making them inoperable without physical repairs. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Gazprom and Russian authorities have not publicly commented on the reported incident. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. Anna holds a Bachelor's degree in International Communications from Taras Shevchenko National University and is currently an MA candidate in International Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). Civic watchdogs argue that Tsyvinsky's candidacy was rejected because the President's Office sees him as too independent. The project would involve Romanian investment in a local factory, likely in Brasov, where Ukrainian and Romanian teams would collaborate on manufacturing drones based on Ukrainian designs developed through wartime experience. France has agreed to expand pilot training for Mirage fighter jets, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. The head of Ukraine's Poltava Mining faces criminal charges for allegedly evading over Hr 1.7 billion ($41 million) in corporate taxes through fraudulent export pricing, the Ukraine Economic Security Bureau announced in a press release on July 18. The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems. All of the 11 injured victims have been hospitalized, one of whom — a 29-year-old woman — is in serious condition, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Rustem Umerov previously served as Ukraine's defense minister, a post he had held since September 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) Deputy Speaker Pyotr Tolstoy predicts that NATO will have to face major problems because of the potential costs of Ukraine's rearmament. On July 14, US President Donald Trump made a previously announced statement on the Ukraine issue. He said in NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte's presence that he was disappointed in Russia and its president, and announced plans to continue sending weapons and military equipment to Kiev as long as the EU pays for arms shipments in coordination with NATO. We will destroy these weapons along with those who operate them," Tolstoy said in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica. When speaking about Trump's promise to provide Kiev with Patriot air defense systems, the senior Russian lawmaker pointed out that Russia also possessed long-range weapons. "Western weapons will be a legitimate target for us wherever they are," he stressed. Tolstoy said, however, that Russia would not use the weapons to provoke the EU and NATO. "We will use long-range weapons, but not against Western countries. Our priority is to destroy Ukraine's energy and military infrastructure. We have enough forces and equipment to carry this out," the State Duma deputy speaker concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president's Medicaid shake-up through his ‘big, beautiful bill' could have dire consequences for poverty-riddled Jackson, Kentucky It is the latest in umpteen procedures, check-ups and tests he has been forced to ensure since being diagnosed with colon cancer. “I don't know what we would do without this hospital,” she says, standing in the 33C heat outside the Kentucky River Medical Centre. The bill will slash trillions of dollars from the Medicaid budget – dollars that pay for healthcare for those who cannot otherwise afford it. Without those patients and that money, some 300 hospitals across the country may struggle to survive, according to a study by the University of North Carolina, including 35 in Kentucky alone. It is the place where JD Vance rose to prominence with a memoir detailing the poverty and hopelessness of Breathitt County, a book that became a cipher for understanding the forgotten parts of America that elected Donald Trump. On Wednesday, he was in a blue-collar corner of Pennsylvania, describing how it would give $1,000 to every newborn and banish taxes on overtime pay. They believe Mr Trump has miscalculated, giving them a chance to win back blue collar and working-class voters. The lawyer, who practises an hour away in Prestonsburg, is running for Congress as a Democrat in a district that covers south-eastern Kentucky and where the incumbent Republican won more than 82 per cent of the vote last time around. But he said voters will see through the Republican bill and mercenary calculations that its worst impacts will be in deep red districts that are unwinnable for Democrats. “They have made the cynical calculation, which has some truth to it, that if you're on Medicaid, you're probably not voting, and you're certainly not contributing money to campaigns,” he said, leaning back at a conference table at his law offices. By coincidence, his next meeting was with a cousin of Mr Vance. That is how things go in this part of Appalachian Kentucky. His difficult childhood – his mother was a drug addict and alcoholic – was brightened by summers spent running wild in the hills around the town of Jackson. But shopping is limited to a handful of hardware or ramshackle second-hand stores, standing beside shopfronts that have been turned into makeshift homes. After the success of his book, Mr Vance returned with Ron Howard, the director, as they scouted locations and worked on turning it into a movie starring Glenn Close. They stayed at Paul's Motel, as most visitors do, a neat complex of rooms and parking spaces just past the Breathitt County High School, home of the Bobcats football, baseball and basketball teams. Ask anyone and they open up, even at the motel. “Even as a family with two working people in the house, if you don't get the benefits, you literally, pretty much have to scrape to get by.” Earnings of $300 a week each do not go far when the month's electricity bill can top $400, she explained. Supporting three children and keeping a car would make health insurance a luxury were it not for the “medical card,” as she knows it. Like in many states, it is issued by a private medical insurer and often beneficiaries do not even realise that they are being helped by Medicaid. The bill, signed into law by Mr Trump on July 4, requires most users to prove 80 hours of work a month and increases eligibility checks. Most residents are still trying to work out what it all means, as they dissect the headlines, said Mark Wireman, an old family friend of Mr Vance's. He wears a handgun on his hip, loaded with anti-snake shot, for any copperheads or rattlesnakes spotted when he mows the lawn in front of his house. But he and his wife were sceptical of the doom-mongers claiming it would shut. The hospital study lists 15 facilities that are under threat in this one congressional district alone. But its findings are disputed by White House officials, who say it was conducted on an earlier draft of the bill and does not take account of an extra $50 billion directed to rural facilities. “They struggle because they are low volume, and what we are doing through this bill is taking some of the savings and providing a once in a generation investment into these types of facilities that is not dependent upon an inflow of patients that they're never going to see,” said a senior White House official. “It's totally political propaganda,” said Bobby Deaton, a conservative columnist who joins retired friends to talk current affairs each morning at Jackson's Hardee's fast food restaurant. “Right now we are paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants. And taxpayers are footing the bill for the healthcare of hill country people who have been raised to live off handouts, according to Gabrielle Hensley, 36. “Some of them are still just stuck on old habits and the way that they were raised by previous parents who teach them that government living is okay.” Scott Jennings, who is best known as a conservative pugilist on CNN and whose own roots lie in Kentucky, said the bill was popular in places like Breathitt County, where residents knew the value of hard work. “I've heard so many lies about this bill my head is spinning,” he said, explaining that the bill would redirect money to struggling hospitals. For its part, the Kentucky River Medical Centre played down the threat, saying any impact would not be felt for another five years, if that. Susie Morgan, the chief executive, said rural hospitals also had access to federal and state support programmes. “Fortunately, we are part of a larger network that provides shared resources, operational support, and strategic guidance—especially valuable when navigating industry changes like this one,” she said. Even a Vance loyalist, in the form of his fifth cousin (twice removed) is worried about what it might mean politically. “It'll be negative for Trump, and it'll be negative for me too,” said Joe Profitt, whose mother was a Bowman (the vice-president's family name). “You get this wherever you go here,” he said, as an “It's Time for Trump” clock ticked on the wall of his front room.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Across Africa, and in the tiny nation of Eswatini, fury has erupted over the arrival of foreign deportees from the United States, after its government confirmed that migrants described by a Department of Homeland security spokesperson as “depraved monsters” had been sent to its prisons. Roughly the size of New Jersey, Eswatini — formerly known as Swaziland — is governed by a monarch who has absolute power. The five men are being kept in solitary confinement, acting government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli told CNN Friday, but stopped short of disclosing the prisons they were held in, citing security risks. Critics of the move say it is unacceptable for Eswatini to be treated as a “dumping ground” for people considered unfit to live in the US. President Donald Trump's aggressive clampdown on immigration has run into logistical hurdles, with some countries refusing to take back their nationals, or doing so only on a limited basis. Some of those approached by the US, such as Nigeria, have decried being pressured to take in foreign deportees. “The US is mounting considerable pressure on African countries to accept Venezuelans to be deported from the US, some straight out of prison,” Nigeria's foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said in a televised interview last week, citing Washington's announcement of increased tariffs and recent reductions in the validity of visas. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X Wednesday that the five detainees flown to Eswatini were nationals from Jamaica, Laos, Cuba, Yemen and Vietnam. “This flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,” she wrote. The prisoners were convicted of various crimes, including child rape, murder and robbery, she said. She told CNN Thursday, however, that “there are no timelines at present” for their repatriation. The landlocked country of just over one million people is already beleaguered by poverty, unemployment, high crime rates and congested prisons. Opposition party PUDEMO said accepting foreign deportees from the US “poses a serious risk to our already vulnerable communities” which it said are “battling a severe scourge” of crime, including rape and murder. Lucky Lukhele, of the Swaziland Solidarity Network, an exiled civil society group based in South Africa, told CNN it was “clear racism to think Africa is a dumping ground for Donald Trump.” Lukhele said he was informed by unnamed sources that more US deportees would be sent to Eswatini, warning that “Swazi prisons are (already) overcrowded” with prisoners who “get one meal a day.” The Multi Stakeholder Forum (MSF), a coalition of Eswatini's civil society groups, said in a statement that the country's “sovereignty and dignity must not be traded off for unclear deals or political expediency.” It's not clear how Eswatini stands to benefit from housing US deportees. Asked whether more foreign US deportees would arrive in Eswatini, she said there was currently no information to that effect. Eswatini's trade privileges with the US came under threat in April after it was included in Trump's list of tariffs, facing a rate of 10% on its exports. A South African government source told CNN, “There is a feeling that some inside the Trump administration could be using this (the deportation of prisoners to Eswatini) to destabilize South Africa,” given its porous borders and Eswatini's struggling economy. Ken Opalo, an associate professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Washington, DC, said African nations are being pushed by the Trump administration “into doing egregious things such as accepting migrants from random countries or giving them (the US) their mineral wealth in ambiguous deals that don't make much sense.” He cautioned: “It's foolhardy for African countries to think that they can make deals and expect a credible commitment from the White House, given their transactional nature, which means everything is subject to change.”</p>

The intelligence source did not provide further details about how Nesterov was killed. The Russian promotion company World of Boxing confirmed his death on July 16, saying Nesterov was killed in combat. Povetkin, an Olympic boxing champion, has echoed Russian propaganda justifying the war against Ukraine in the past, framing Moscow's actions as a fight against "Nazism." The intelligence source noted that the Wagner company continues to suffer losses in Mali despite claims it is leaving the West African country, where it fought alongside Malian government forces to fend off Islamist insurgents. The Wagner company, known for its deployment in Ukraine and short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin in 2023, has a strong presence across the African continent, backing Russian business interests and Moscow-friendly regimes. The mercenary group was accused of numerous atrocities during its deployment across Africa. A recent media investigation said that since 2021, Wagner mercenaries have detained, tortured, and forcibly disappeared hundreds of civilians in secret prisons across Mali.
