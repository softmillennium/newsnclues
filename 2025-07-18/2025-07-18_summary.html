For decades, Trump had a strong friendship with Epstein, a disgraced financier and child sex trafficker.

President Donald Trump is threatening to sue The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, over a bombshell report detailing a cryptic birthday message he sent to disgraced financier and child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein two decades ago. 

Trump lashed out at the conservative publication on Thursday, describing its reporting as “fake” and claiming that the letter to Epstein wasn't his.

Epstein and Trump were friends in the 1980s and 1990s. The two had a public falling out in 2004 over a property dispute. Trump previously described Epstein as liking “beautiful women as much as I do,” noting that “many of them are on the younger side.”

“No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life,” Trump said in a 2002 interview. 

The letter The Wall Street Journal asserts is from Trump is part of a larger collection of messages from Epstein's friends that were compiled into a book by his former girlfriend and confidante, Ghislaine Maxwell, who helped him recruit girls into his sex trafficking ring (including one Maxwell discovered at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate). 

According to the report, Trump's letter “contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman.” The president's trademark signature appears below the woman's waist, “mimicking pubic hair,” the publication noted. 

“Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,” Trump reportedly concluded the message.

The report from The Wall Street Journal, published on Thursday, comes as the Trump administration faces deep scrutiny — including from Trump's MAGA base — over its lack of transparency regarding the federal case against Epstein. Trump had implied on the campaign trail in 2024 that he would release the Epstein case files as president.

On his Truth Social account, Trump blasted The Wall Street Journal, threatening legal repercussions for their publication of the report.

“The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein. These are not my words, not the way I talk,” Trump wrote.

He added that the letter in question couldn't be his because he doesn't “draw pictures” — a defense that is questionable, at best, as Trump has drawn and sold at least five pictures at auction over the years, and has stated in a book he authored in 2010 that he draws yearly to support charities. 

Referencing Murdoch, Trump said, “I'm going to sue his ass off, and that of his third-rate newspaper.”

Vice President J.D. Vance also doubted the validity of the letter, calling it “utter bullshit.” 

“Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?” Vance wrote on social media.

In response to Vance's comments, HuffPost noted that the vice president was defending the integrity of “a man who was famously caught on camera saying stars as big as him could grab women ‘by the pussy.'”

When The Wall Street Journal asked Trump for a comment on the letter prior to the article's publication, Trump told them he would sue if they published it.

Several commentators suggested that The Wall Street Journal wouldn't have published the letter without vigorously fact-checking the letter's origins with Epstein, given that Trump frequently threatens lawsuits against media.

“The president of the United States sues people for lots of money all the time — if you publish this, you know he's likely to sue you,” MSNBC's Chris Hayes said on his Thursday evening program. “People should just consider the amount of thought that went into whether they were going to publish this, on behalf of The Wall Street Journal, given…[Trump] explicitly threatening them, in their interview that he's going to sue, and they're assessing how believable this is.”

Political Wire's Taegan Goddard also said that it was highly unlikely the letter was inauthentic.

“Very few people on the planet can say with absolute certainty that the lewd birthday letter is authentic. But The Wall Street Journal clearly believes it is — and given the legal risk of publishing something that could be defamatory, it's safe to assume the paper verified its contents to a high standard,” Goddard wrote, adding:

If the letter were forged — never reviewed by prosecutors or dismissed as fake by the Justice Department — Trump allies like Pam Bondi or Kash Patel would almost certainly have said so by now. Neither has.

Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser for the Harris campaign, said on CNN Thursday night that there were larger questions prompted by the explosive story. 

The case “has caused the MAGA base to lose its mind. The question is, is the MAGA base going to come back together?” Elrod said.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

            Police in Brazil swooped on the home and political headquarters of Jair Bolsonaro early Friday, searching the properties, ordering the former president to wear an electronic ankle tag, barring him from speaking to foreign officials or approaching embassies and prohibiting him from using social media.
    


            The restrictions, ordered by Brazil's Supreme Court, were motivated by concerns that Bolsonaro would flee the country, amid his trial over an alleged plot to overturn the results of the 2022 presidential election to remain in power. Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing.
    


            Federal police also accused Bolsonaro and his son, Eduardo, of conspiring with the US government to impose sanctions against Brazilian officials, according to court documents. That action, the court said, “would directly benefit his father and financier, Jair Messias Bolsonaro.”
    


            Federal police also seized an unspecified amount of US dollars in cash.
    


            Speaking outside the police station Friday, Bolsonaro called the ankle tag “supreme humiliation” and said that he “never thought of leaving Brazil.”
    


            “The suspicions (of me leaving the country) are an exaggeration… damn it, I'm a former president of the republic – I'm 70 years old,” he said.
    


            Bolsonaro added that police seized “about 14,000 US dollars” and claimed the money was for personal use, adding he had the receipts to prove it.
    


            The raid came as US President Donald Trump tried to force his current Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to end the criminal trial against his predecessor by threatening crippling tariffs on the country.
    


            Trump last week threatened Brazil with tariffs of 50% starting August 1, according to a letter posted to his social media platform, Truth Social.
    


            In the letter, Trump linked the tariff threat to what he described as a “witch hunt” trial against Bolsonaro, a close ally.
    


            Brazil's Supreme Court on Friday accused Bolsonaro and his son Eduardo of working with the US to impose the tariffs.
    


            The court documents highlighted a confidential meeting Bolsonaro had with a US State Department official and highlighted Trump's letter as an “offensive” and “clear threat” to Brazilian sovereignty.
    


Speaking exclusively to CNN Thursday, da Silva, who is widely known as Lula, said that Trump's threats had broken away from “protocol” and argued that his predecessor's fate cannot be part of trade negotiations.
    


            “The judiciary branch of power in Brazil is independent. The president of the Republic has no influence whatsoever,” he said, adding that Bolsonaro “is not being judged personally. He is being judged by the acts he tried to organize a coup d'etat.”

            Lula added that Trump would be standing trial in his country if the actions he took during the January 6 insurrection had been committed in Brazil.
    


            On Friday, Trump posted a letter to Bolsonaro on Truth Social, in which he suggested the former Brazilian leader was the victim of an “unjust system” and said that he would be “watching closely.”
    


            Bolsonaro posted Trump's letter on his official X account and thanked Trump for his support with “eternal gratitude,” in a subsequent video.
    


            Bolsonaro had previously appeared to be preparing for the outcome of his trial and dismissed the idea that he might be considered a flight risk, saying: “I'll face the process.”
    


            “I'm not considering doing anything, I'm not considering anything, nothing at all,” he said, adding: “I'm not a criminal, the criminal is the one persecuting me.”
    


            Bolsonaro could face more than four decades behind bars if found guilty of masterminding the coup.
    


            He is among 34 people charged with five crimes, including attempting the coup. Part of the coup plot, prosecutors allege, involved a plan to potentially assassinate Lula, his vice president and a minister of the Supreme Court.
    


            Brian Winter, executive vice president of Americas Society and Council of the Americas, told CNN that, for Brazil, the US is not as significant a trading partner as say, China.
    


            “Brazil only sends about 11% of its exports to the United States,” Winter said. “That's half what Brazil sends to China, and for some of Brazil's exports – not all, but for some of them – they can find other markets besides the United States.”
    


            “The question is, if this keeps escalating, could President Trump use measures that are even more painful, such as financial sanctions against large groups of people?” Winter asked, noting that Trump previously threatened, among other things, a travel ban on Colombian citizens during a disagreement with the Colombian government over migrant flights.
    


            “It's possible that President Trump could continue to escalate this in a way that could eventually produce considerably more pain for the Brazilian government and for the Brazilian people,” Winter said.

Nearly two in five Democratic-leaning voters would consider joining a non-Musk-led third party.

New polling this week indicates that there is a strong desire among U.S. voters for a third political party, to counter both the Republican and Democratic parties. However, when asked if they'd join a party created by billionaire Elon Musk, voters overwhelmingly rejected the idea.

After hinting for several weeks that he'd start a new party after he and President Donald Trump had a public falling out, Musk created an unscientific poll on his X profile earlier this month, asking his followers if they supported his idea for an “America Party.” The poll, which undoubtedly oversampled fans of Musk, showed support for the idea. After the survey's conclusion, Musk vowed to establish his own political party.

“By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!” he wrote.

A Quinnipiac University poll published earlier this week indeed shows that many Americans would like there to be a third political party. 

According to the poll, one in two voters, 49 percent, signaled that they would join or consider joining a third party. The question did not ask voters about the ideology of such a party.

In a separate question, however, respondents were asked if they'd join a third party created by Musk. Only 17 percent of voters overall said they'd join or consider joining that party, with more than three in four voters, 77 percent, saying they wouldn't.

The poll demonstrates that voters are indeed supportive of the idea of a third party — but not one created or endorsed by Musk, whose far right views and support for neo-fascist politics have been on full display over the past year.

A higher rate of Democratic-leaning voters (39 percent) said they'd consider a third party option than Republican-leaning voters (28 percent), the Quinnipiac University poll found. When Musk's name is added into the mix, support for a third party drops among both groups, with Republican voters more likely to support the idea (18 percent) than Democratic voters (6 percent). 

Notably, Democratic voters gave congressional lawmakers from their own party low approval ratings — only 39 percent of those voters approve of the way they're handling their jobs, while 52 percent disapprove, the poll showed.

Republican voters, meanwhile, are supportive of their lawmakers' actions, with 77 percent expressing approval and only 20 percent disapproval. 

The dismal numbers from Democrats may indicate that Democratic voters are upset with their party's approach to disrupting or opposing the Trump administration. Indeed, when voters overall are polled on Trump, only 40 percent say they're happy with the job he's performed in his second term so far, while 54 percent say they disapprove.

Trump is underwater on a number of issues in the poll, too. On trade, he nets a -16-point approval rating. On his handling of deportations, it's -21 points. And on foreign policy, it's -13 points.

Voters are also indicating that they're more likely to support Democrats than Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections — though only barely so.

According to an average of polling data collected by RealClearPolling, Democrats are ahead of Republicans by around 3 points in a generic congressional ballot question. While the midterms are still year and a half out, such polling demonstrates that control of Congress (particularly the House of Representatives) could come down to just a few races next year. 

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

“We pretty much have no idea if they are in CECOT or someplace else,” said one immigrant rights advocate.

“These were disappearances,” said one immigrant rights expert of the revelation that dozens of people who have never been acknowledged by the Trump administration were listed on flight manifests for three deportation flights from Texas to El Salvador in March.

404 Media reported Thursday that in May, a hacker targeted the airline that operated the flights, which have been challenged in court by groups including the ACLU and Democracy Forward.

The data retrieved by the hacker showed that in addition to people whose names had been previously included on a list of deported migrants deported to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), published by CBS News, more than 40 men and women were listed on flight manifests for planes that the Trump administration sent on March 15

The CBS News story reported on 238 people who had been sent to CECOT without due process, under a $6 million deal with far-right President Nayib Bukele, but the list compiled from the flight manifests puts the total number at at least 281.

The flights landed in El Salvador despite a federal judge blocking them, and now, Michelle Brané of the immigrant rights group Together and Free told 404 Media, “we have this list of people that the U.S. government has not formally acknowledged in any real way and we pretty much have no idea if they are in CECOT or someplace else, or whether they received due process.”

“I think this further demonstrates the callousness and lack of due process involved and is further evidence that the U.S. government is disappearing people,” said Brané. “For almost all of these people, there's no records whatsoever. No court records, nothing.”

It is unclear whether all the people on the flight manifests were actually on the planes, but if “they were indeed on the flights, it is unknown where they currently are,” 404 Media reported.

The outlet reported that the family of one of the men who is listed on the flight manifests but whose name has never been reported or acknowledged by the Trump administration, has been protesting his disappearance in his home country of Venezuela.

Keider Alexander Flores Navas' mother, Ana Navas, said in a TikTok video in March that she suddenly stopped hearing from him the day the deportation flights took off—and then saw him in a photo of prisoners at CECOT.

🔵 Ana Navas: Mi hijo no figura en la lista de secuestrados, sé que está en El Salvador por una foto. 🔵 Keider Flores Navas es uno de los venezolanos trasladados a El Salvador. Su madre sabe que está allá por una fotografía en la que lo reconoció. 🔵 Señaló que tiene más de dos semanas y media sin poder hablar con su hijo. #elsalvador #eeuu #venezuela #migrantes #fyp 

“He was not on any list. But this photo is from El Salvador,” Navas told the Venezuelan outlet Diario VEA.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, called the news of the flight manifests “a horror story.”

404 Media's story “provides the first public confirmation of the identity of some of the people who were disappeared by the Trump administration on March 15,” said Reichlin-Melnick.

“Many of the people we sent to CECOT entered the U.S. legally at ports of entry after fully identifying themselves to the government,” he added. “But if they did enter illegally, nothing justifies disappearing people to life imprisonment without trial. It's un-American.”

The news of the flight manifests comes days after a court filing revealed that Salvadoran officials said the U.S. has jurisdiction over the people being held in CECOT, in response to a United Nations Human Rights Office inquiry about the “involuntary disappearances” of four Venezuelans.

The Trump administration has denied having the power to return CECOT detainees to the United States, as has Bukele.

Lee Gelernt, lead counsel in the ACLU's case regarding the deportation flights, told 404 Media that it is “critical” for the public to know who was on the March 15 flights.

“These individuals were sent to a gulag-type prison without any due process, possibly for the remainder of their lives, yet the government has provided no meaningful information about them, much less the evidence against them,” said Gelernt. “Transparency at a time like this is essential.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Ben Stiller, Rachel Zegler and Judd Apatow and others disappointment at decision to axe long-running show

The end of Stephen Colbert's Late Show is a concerning nail in the coffin for comedy

Celebrities have expressed disappointment and anger at the controversial decision to end the long-running Late Show, bringing an end to host Stephen Colbert's award-winning tenure.

The late-night comedy show has been on CBS for 33 years and the news arrived just days after Colbert called out the network's parent company Paramount for settling a “frivolous” lawsuit with Donald Trump for $16m. Paramount is seeking approval for a $8.4bn merger with Skydance, a company ran by David Ellison, son of close Trump ally Larry Ellison.

Colbert called it a “big fat bribe” earlier this week and later announced to his audience that the show would be ending next year. “Let me tell you, it is a fantastic job,” he said. “I wish someone else was getting it. And it is a job I am looking forward to doing with this usual gang of idiots for another 10 months.”

The Late Show received an Emmy nomination earlier this week for talk series.

“Sorry to hear @CBS is canceling one of the best shows they have,” the actor and director Ben Stiller wrote on X. “Wishing all the people who work so hard on that show all the best.”

His Severance colleague Adam Scott also shared his sentiment. “Love you Stephen,” he wrote. “This is absolute bullshit and I for one am looking forward to the next 10 months of shows.”

The writer and director Judd Apatow also wrote in response to Colbert's Instagram post: “My admiration and appreciation for you is bottomless. Excited to see what other brilliance you put into the world.”

Broadcast journalist Katie Couric added: “I am so upset about this. I need more information.”

The West Side Story and Evita actor Rachel Zegler wrote: “i am extremely sad. i adore you, stephen.”

Jon Batiste, the Grammy-winning musician who used to lead Colbert's band on the show, called him “the greatest to ever do it” on Instagram.

The author Stephen King, known for being politically outspoken online, posted: “Colbert canceled? Please tell me it's a joke.”

The actor John Cusack shared a clip of Colbert on social media and wrote: “He's not groveling enough to American fascism – Larry Ellison needs his tax cuts – doesn't need comedians reminding people they are not cattle.”

Senator Bernie Sanders also expressed similar ire. “CBS's billionaire owners pay Trump $16 million to settle a bogus lawsuit while trying to sell the network to Skydance,” he wrote. “Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal. Days later, he's fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.”

Andy Cohen, the TV personality who hosts late-night show Watch What Happens Live, called it “a sad day” both for late-night television and for CBS. “I'm stunned,” he said to Deadline. “He's one of three late-night shows deemed worthy enough for an Emmy nomination. He produces a brilliant show.”

Colbert's late-night rival Jimmy Kimmel also weighed in, sharing his frustration with the decision. In an Instagram story poking fun at the network's much-ridiculed comedy shows, he wrote: “Love you, Stephen. Fuck you and all your Sheldons, CBS.”

Trump has already taken a victory lap on Truth Social, writing: “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”

Justice Collins Rice says it is for politicians and not courts to change rules around two-child benefit cap 

Two women who conceived their eldest children while they were in violent and controlling relationships have lost a legal challenge to the rules around the two-child benefit cap.

A high court judge said the accounts of the abuse the women faced when they were “vulnerable girls barely out of childhood” were “chilling”.

But in a judgment delivered on Friday, Justice Collins Rice said it was for politicians to settle the matter, not the courts.

The women, and campaigners who support them, said they were disappointed but would fight on to have universal credit rules changed.

The two mothers, identified only as LMN and EFG, launched a challenge to the rules around the so-called rape clause in universal credit claims at a court in Leeds in June.

The two-child cap for universal credit claims has exceptions to cover a limited number of circumstances, including if a child is conceived nonconsensually. But the court heard how this only applies to third or subsequent children, leaving some women unable to utilise this exception if, for example, their first two children are conceived after rape but they have further children in consensual relationships.

The women, whose claim was against the Department for Work and Pensions, were supported by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), which describes the benefit rules as “inhumane”.

The judge said the two women endured abusive relationships that included rape. “They are chilling accounts of appalling domestic abuse,” she said. “Vulnerable girls barely out of childhood themselves caught in toxic relationships, or repeating cycles of such relationships, in which their personal, reproductive and family autonomy is acutely compromised by the physical, sexual and emotional violence of controlling perpetrators.”

She said the women were “among the most harmed and vulnerable” members of society while as mothers they were “making an important and valuable” contribution to it.

The judge said CPAG had brought a legal challenge to the two-child cap before. “That made its way to the supreme court, which, in 2021, firmly returned the matter to the political realm.”

She said she had reached the same place as the supreme court did before, saying it was “a policy question dealing in social, economic, moral and ethical subject matter” and a “political law-reform question”.

The judge added: “The law does not compel a government, or a parliament, to provide the answer the claimants seek. This claim is dismissed accordingly.”

In a statement after the ruling, the mother named EFG said: “All of my choices were taken away from me for years by my abuser before I fled. I've fought hard to get on with my life for me and my kids. But the two-child limit makes it more difficult.

“The government says that the exceptions are to protect people who – like me – didn't have a choice about the number of kids in their family, but the rape clause doesn't do that. The rules need to change to protect families like mine. The result today is disappointing but I will keep going and fight this to the end.”

The other mother, LMN, said: “I want to keep going with the case as I feel like it's against my human rights. When my oldest came back to live with me from care and before I got the exception for my youngest, we had to survive on less money. That stopped me doing things with the children – I never planned on having the children but that's not their fault.”

Claire Hall, a solicitor at CPAG who represented the women, said they would look at appealing against the decision, but in the meantime, “all eyes are on the government which has the chance to do the right thing and abolish the inhumane two-child limit in the autumn child poverty strategy”.

Hall added: “Our clients have provided their children with safe and loving home environments but the rules have failed to protect them and their children from the impacts of the two-child limit.”

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “Violence against women and girls is a national emergency – and our mission is to halve it within a decade. Victims of rape and coercion should be treated with dignity and respect.

“This court decision is about whether a policy – designed by the previous government – was being implemented lawfully. This policy will be considered along with all other levers including social security reform by the child poverty taskforce. The group will publish the child poverty strategy in the autumn.”

The controversy over U.S. President Donald Trump's handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation entered a new dimension Thursday as his administration struggles to make good on its promises to release details on the sex trafficking case involving a one-time friend of the now-president.

Trump promised a lawsuit after The Wall Street Journal described a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump's name and was included in a 2003 album for Epstein's 50th birthday. Trump denied writing the letter, calling it “false, malicious, and defamatory.”

It came after Trump in recent days has berated as “weaklings” supporters vying for more records from the Epstein probe, after years of courting political support from those who have stoked claims of a cover-up in the case to protect wealthy friends of Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 awaiting trial on federal charges of trafficking of underage girls.

Trump has also shielded his attorney-general from being questioned about the case after she walked back claims of the existence of a “client list” of elites who participated in Epstein's crimes, and has even taken to claiming without evidence that files were doctored by Democrats.

In an administration that prides itself on changing the narrative on negative storylines, the Epstein saga has had remarkable staying power, thanks in part to infighting at high levels of government, Trump's blistering criticism of his own base and the head-scratching mystery of why documents his own administration promised to unlock will remain buried – seemingly for good.

Thursday's disclosure – coupled with frustration from Trump-allied lawmakers on Capitol Hill – pushed Trump to abruptly reverse course and direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to try to make some of the documents in the case public.

Bondi said she would seek court permission Friday to release grand jury information, but it would require a judge's approval, and she and Trump were silent on the additional evidence collected by federal law enforcement in the sprawling investigation that Bondi last week announced she would not release.

The letter revealed by The Wall Street Journal was reportedly collected by disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell as part of a birthday album for Epstein years before the wealthy financier was first arrested in 2006 and subsequently had a falling-out with Trump. 

The letter bearing Trump's name includes text framed by the outline of what appears to be a hand-drawn naked woman and ends with, “Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret,” according to the newspaper. The outlet described the contents of the letter but did not publish a photo showing it entirely.

Maxwell was arrested in 2020 and convicted a year later on charges that she helped Epstein lure girls to be sexually abused.

Trump slammed the story in a lengthy social media post Thursday night, saying he spoke to both to the paper's owner, Rupert Murdoch, and its top editor, Emma Tucker, and told them the letter was “fake.” Trump promised to sue the paper over the story, saying: “These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures.”

Vice President JD Vance said The Wall Street Journal “should be ashamed” for publishing it.

“Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it? Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?” he wrote on X.

U.S. President Donald Trump praised his Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the Epstein files Tuesday, telling reporters she "has handled it very well" and saying it's up to her whether to release any more records related to the sex trafficking investigation.

The Associated Press

The Trump administration has been struggling for nearly two weeks to contain the fallout of the Justice Department's announcement that no more Epstein evidence in the government's possession would be released to the public despite promises of transparency from Bondi. The Justice Department's reversal on the Epstein files not only angered Trump supporters but touched off a testy exchange at the White House last week between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino that neither official has publicly addressed.

The Justice Department has yet to provide a full accounting of its reversal months after Bondi handed out binders to conservative influencers at the White House that read the “Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “the most transparent administration.” Bondi earlier this week refused to answer questions from reporters about the Epstein files and her relationship with Bongino.

The White House on Thursday closed the door on calls for a further inquiry into the Epstein investigation, saying the president would not be recommending the appointment of a special counsel.

Even though his administration for months had hyped the expected release of more documents, Trump slammed his own supporters earlier this week for their furor over the Epstein files saga. Trump called it a “hoax” and tried to place blame on Democrats, accusing former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, as well as former FBI Director James Comey – without evidence – of making up such documents.

Earlier Thursday, the controversy over the Epstein files had snarled the House's efforts to pass a bill that claws back $9.4 billion in federal spending, as Democrats used procedural moves to force votes on releasing the documents in tandem with the package.

That frustrated House Republicans, who tried to forge a solution that could include a resolution supporting the release of “credible” files pertaining to Epstein and his activities.

Trump himself has faced years of scrutiny over his own private life. Last year, for instance, he was convicted of felony charges in New York in connection with hush money payments meant to silence an adult film star's sex claims ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied the relationship.

And Trump's ties to Epstein have been well-documented, though the president has not been accused of misconduct in connection with their social relationship.

Video footage unearthed by NBC News following Epstein's federal indictment in 2019 showed the two chatting at a party at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in 1992. The video, recorded at a time when Trump was newly divorced, shows him surrounded by young women, whom NBC identified as cheerleaders for the Buffalo Bills.

It also depicts the two men standing and gesturing at the women on the dance floor.

“I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him,” Trump said when the video emerged. “He was a fixture in Palm Beach. I had a falling-out with him a long time ago. I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years.”

Previously released files included a 2016 deposition in which an accuser recounted spending several hours with Epstein at Trump's Atlantic City casino but didn't say if she actually met Trump and did not accuse him of any wrongdoing.

PepsiCo's top executive indicated on July 17 that the company may switch Pepsi's sweetener from high-fructose corn syrup to sugar, one day after President Donald Trump said Coca-Cola would soon be making the change.

“Same journey that we have in foods, we're following in beverages. This is a consumer-centric strategy. We're following the consumer,” Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo's CEO, told investors on a call after being asked about Trump's announcement.

The office says Israeli forces have destroyed 720 water wells, depriving more than 1.25 million people of clean water.

Hungry, thirsty, and desperate for some relief, Sha'da Abu Jabal, 36, and her six-year-old son Ahmad headed to a water distribution point in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on Sunday, July 13. Each carried a jerrycan, hoping to return to their displacement center with clean drinking water. 

The mother and young son joined a long line of people waiting their turn, when suddenly the Israeli army bombed the distribution point, killing twelve people, including eight children, and injuring more than twenty others. Most of them were women and children, due to the fact that in Gaza, survival now divides families: men go out seeking food under bullets, and women and children go out seeking water. 

Sha'da and her son miraculously survived the strike and quickly made their way back to the displacement center. They were spared from death, but were still without water. Like thousands of other families in Gaza, their struggle with intense thirst continued, due to severe water shortages as a result of Israel's siege on the strip. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“We don't know what exactly we're supposed to face in this war,” Sha'da says. “Are we up against warplanes and death? Or hunger and starvation? Or thirst and the lack of water?”

“Israel has provided us with every possible path to death. We can no longer bear it. And if we adults can endure, how do we look at our children, watching them cry out in thirst when we can't even give them a sip of water? What are we supposed to do to survive this war?” she asked. 

Sunday's attack on people lining up for water was not the first attack by the Israeli army on hungry and thirsty civilians in Gaza. Following the massacre, Gaza's Government Media Office issued a detailed statement indicating that the Israeli military has targeted 112 sites distributing fresh water since the Israeli genocide began in 2023, resulting in massacres of hundreds of civilians — mostly children — who were trying to get drinking water.The Gaza Strip's water supply depends on three primary sources: groundwater, water supplied directly from Israel through the national water company (Mekorot), and central desalination plants that belong to the Coastal Municipality Water Utility in Gaza.

According to the statement, Israeli forces have deliberately destroyed 720 water wells, putting them out of service and depriving more than 1.25 million people of access to clean water. Israel has also blocked the entry of 12 million liters of fuel each month — fuel needed to run even the minimum number of water wells, sewage treatment plants, garbage collection vehicles, and other critical sectors related to water and sanitation. 

Since January 23, 2025, Israel has also cut off Mekorot water, Gaza's last main supply, deepening the daily thirst and misery for people in the strip. On March 9, 2025, Israel severed the last power line feeding the central desalination plant south of Deir al-Balah, halting the production of large amounts of drinking water and worsening the suffocating water crisis.

The Government Media Office concluded its statement by asserting that Gaza is now witnessing a “major crime of thirst,” which it says is being deliberately and systematically carried out by the Israeli occupation. It described the policy as a “full-fledged war crime” under the Geneva Conventions and a grave violation of international humanitarian and human rights law.

As a result of the policies pursued by Israel to target sources of food and water in the Gaza Strip, the available quantities of water are no longer sufficient for the population, with water sources becoming extremely scarce.

Muhammad Duweima, a father of six living in Gaza City, describes how he secures water for his family. “A man in our neighborhood owns a water well and has a solar power source. He operates the well for just one hour daily and distributes water to nearby residents,” he says. However, this water drawn from the well is unsuitable for drinking and is used only for washing and general domestic purposes.

Drinking water sources are extremely limited, mainly restricted to the water trucks sent in by charitable organizations operating in Gaza. 

Duweima explains that “two trucks carrying fresh water come daily to the displacement center in the Tel Al-Hawa area, where residents fill their jerrycans. These trucks come every day. If they don't show up, we have no drinking water until the following day.”

“Sometimes these trucks can't come for two or three days, and during that time we suffer greatly from extreme thirst and cannot secure any water,” he said.

He adds that in some cases, they are forced to drink non-potable water drawn from wells. “This water is salty, not fresh, and causes us health problems like kidney stones, in addition to other issues related to bacteria and microbes in water that has not been properly treated or purified.”

Even those trucks dedicated to transporting fresh drinking water have become direct targets. On Monday, in central Gaza, Israeli drones targeted a large water tanker that was meant to distribute water to civilians. The drone strike destroyed the vehicle and killed its driver, indicating that these attacks are directed not only at water sources themselves but also at those working to deliver water to the people.

Throughout Israel's 22-month long genocide in Gaza, it has consistently attacked food and water supplies in Gaza, in addition to tightening its siege and preventing the entry of aid. Reporting and eyewitness accounts from the ground in Gaza have documented how the Israeli army has waged a clear, systematic starvation campaign against Gaza, blocking food from entering, targeting food distribution points, and even facilitating looting by groups that steal aid coming through the crossings.

On April 7, 2025, the Israeli army bombed a tent near Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza that housed volunteers and people in need waiting for food, killing at least six people and injuring ten others. Just days earlier, on April 1, Israeli forces targeted a convoy belonging to World Central Kitchen in Deir al-Balah, striking three vehicles as they transported food and relief supplies, killing seven of the organization's volunteers.

According to previous reports from Gaza's Government Media Office, the Israeli army has bombed more than 60 food distribution points and aid centers, forcing them to shut down entirely as part of this starvation policy. On November 30, 2025, the Israeli army targeted the founder of Gaza's Soup Kitchen, killing him in his car as he was transporting food to a hospital for distribution. Around 170 community kitchens across Gaza also ceased operations in May and June 2025 due to food shortages caused by the ongoing blockade and continued prevention of food entry into the strip.

Regarding water sources, roughly three months ago, Israeli forces bombed a water desalination plant east of Gaza City, cutting off about 70% of the water supplied by Israel's Mekorot company and triggering a severe thirst crisis among civilians. The army also targeted water and sewage infrastructure, including tanks, wells, and desalination facilities, leaving more than two million Palestinians in Gaza suffering daily thirst.

Alongside these scattered and relentless attacks across the Strip, more than 800 people in Gaza have been killed since late May while trying to collect food aid from distribution centers run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 countries stressed the importance of central bank independence and pledged to boost cooperation in a communique they issued on Friday after a two-day meeting in South Africa. 

In their first communique since last October, a month before U.S. President Donald Trump's election victory and subsequent tariff war, the ministers and central bankers highlighted the uncertainty in the global economy caused by conflicts, trade tensions and frequent extreme weather events. 

The issue of central bank independence hung heavily over the meeting in South Africa's coastal city of Durban following Trump's repeated berating of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates, attacks that have roiled global financial markets. 

The communique was reached in the absence of U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent from the two-day meeting, though Washington was represented by Michael Kaplan, acting under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs. Bessent also skipped the previous G20 finance chiefs' gathering in Cape Town in February, even though Washington is due to assume the G20's rotating presidency in December.

“Central banks are strongly committed to ensuring price stability, consistent with their respective mandates, and will continue to adjust their policies in a data-dependent manner. Central bank independence is crucial to achieving this goal,” the communique said.

Trump says firing U.S. Federal Reserve's Powell is ‘highly unlikely'

Opinion: Trump has already crossed Fed independence Rubicon

South Africa's deputy finance minister David Masondo told reporters that the meeting outcomes contained in the communique were “consented to by all members” and centred on “strategic macroeconomic issues.”

The United States has yet to issue any statement on the outcome. The communique also recognised “the importance of the World Trade Organisation to advance trade issues,” while adding the body needed reform.

The agreement is seen as an achievement even though communiques issued by the G20, which emerged as a forum for cooperation to combat the 2008 global financial crisis, are non-binding.

“The biggest news is that they issued a communique instead of just a chair's statement,” said Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council. “This is a positive sign going into the year of the U.S. presidency. It shows some kind of momentum.”

G20 finance chiefs meet under tariff cloud in South Africa

While it referred to “extreme weather events and natural disasters” as economic challenges, the communique did not explicitly address climate change. The word “tariff” was notable by its absence from the document, which instead referred to “trade tensions.”

Trump's tariff policies have torn up the global trade rule book and clouded the economic outlook almost everywhere. With baseline levies of 10% on all U.S. imports and targeted rates as high as 50% on steel and aluminium, 25% on autos and potential levies on pharmaceuticals, extra tariffs on more than 20 countries are slated to take effect on August 1. 

German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said earlier on Friday that he made clear to his counterparts from the Group of Seven major economies that the global trade conflict must be ended quickly. The G7 discussions were on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Durban.

The G20 communique also contained no mentions of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a divisive point for the group, nor the conflicts involving Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Instead, it mentioned “ongoing wars and conflicts” without elaborating.

At just over 2,000 words, the communique was less than half the around 5,000 words in the October 2024 document.

South Africa, under its presidency's motto “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability,” has aimed to promote an African agenda, with topics including the high cost of capital and funding for climate change action.

The finance ministers and central bank governors said in Friday's communique that they were committed to addressing debt vulnerabilities in low- and middle-income countries in an effective, comprehensive and systematic manner.

MOSCOW, July 18. /TASS/. A Challenging process is currently underway to bring relations between Russia and the United States out of their deteriorated state, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.

His statement comes in the wake of US Army Europe and Africa commander, Gen. Christopher Donahue, who told Defense News that Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad is roughly 47 miles wide and surrounded by NATO on all sides, so the US and its allies now have the capability to "take that down from the ground in a timeframe that is unheard of and faster than we've ever been able to do."

"A dialogue is still a dialogue, but there is a complicated process currently underway of bringing our relations [between Russia and the United States] out of a rather deplorable state," Peskov said at a news briefing.

"The process itself is very complicated and time-consuming," he added.

On July 17, Leonid Slutsky, the chairman of the international affairs committee of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament), said in response to Donahue's statement that a possible NATO attack on Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad will trigger an adequate response from Russia, including measures stipulated by its nuclear doctrine.

Cyber specialists from Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) have carried out a large-scale cyberattack against the network infrastructure of Russian energy giant Gazprom, causing significant disruptions, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on July 18.

The alleged operation took place on July 17 and targeted systems used by Gazprom and its subsidiaries, which Ukraine's intelligence claims are directly involved in supporting Russia's war effort. 

Gazprom is Russia's state-owned energy company, one of the world's largest gas producers and exporters.

The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems.

"The degradation of Russian information systems to the technological Middle Ages continues," the source within the HUR told the Kyiv Independent. 

"We congratulate Russian 'cyber specialists' on this new achievement and recommend they gradually replace their mice and keyboards with hammers and pincers."

According to the source, access to Gazprom's internal systems was disabled for nearly 20,000 system administrators, and backup copies of key databases were wiped. The attack reportedly affected approximately 390 subsidiary companies and branches, including Gazprom Teplo Energo, Gazprom Obl Energo, and Gazprom Energozbyt.

The sources said the attackers managed to destroy clusters of "extremely powerful" servers running 1C, a software widely used for managing documents and contracts, analytics data for pipelines, valves, pumps, and SCADA systems — key elements in operating Gazprom's technical infrastructure. 

Multiple servers reportedly had operating systems removed or disabled, and the BIOS (basic firmware) of many devices was damaged, making them inoperable without physical repairs.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Gazprom and Russian authorities have not publicly commented on the reported incident.

"We're striking at the heart of the Russian energy sector alongside the EU," British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said.

According to the case file, he was struck in the face and torso by an enlistment officer. After he collapsed, the officer hit the man with a stun gun at least three to four times and struck his head against the floor multiple times, the records show. 

Civic watchdogs argue that Tsyvinsky's candidacy was rejected because the President's Office sees him as too independent. 



The sanctions target operatives of Russia's military intelligence (GRU), responsible for widespread malicious cyber activity in the U.K. and Europe, the Foreign Office said.



The project would involve Romanian investment in a local factory, likely in Brasov, where Ukrainian and Romanian teams would collaborate on manufacturing drones based on Ukrainian designs developed through wartime experience. 

Ukraine's Air Force said it shot down 11 Shahed-type drones overnight as Russia launched a wave of 35 attack drones, including decoy drones, primarily targeting eastern frontline regions. Six additional decoys were jammed or lost. 

The package targets 105 vessels of Russia's shadow fleet, the Russian banking system, Nord Stream pipelines, and lowers the price cap on Russian crude oil.

France has agreed to expand pilot training for Mirage fighter jets, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The head of Ukraine's Poltava Mining faces criminal charges for allegedly evading over Hr 1.7 billion ($41 million) in corporate taxes through fraudulent export pricing, the Ukraine Economic Security Bureau announced in a press release on July 18.

The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems.

The fatalities included a man and a woman. All of the 11 injured victims have been hospitalized, one of whom — a 29-year-old woman — is in serious condition, Governor Serhii Lysak reported.

Rustem Umerov previously served as Ukraine's defense minister, a post he had held since September 2023.

President's latest effort to contain fallout comes after he directs Pam Bondi to request release of grand jury transcripts and threatens to sue Wall Street Journal

Trump launches fresh defense of inaction in Epstein case following report he sent birthday letter

Donald Trump has been posting on Truth Social early this morning, repeating his accusations about the Democrats regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case.

If there was a “smoking gun” on Epstein, why didn't the Dems, who controlled the “files” for four years, and had Garland and Comey in charge, use it? BECAUSE THEY HAD NOTHING!!!

Trump's frustration that the story hasn't gone away has been apparent all week, as he and others in his administration have tried to dismiss the whole affair by framing it as a Democratic-led conspiracy – as opposed to one that Trump and his allies have long fuelled.

Indeed much of the fury and calls for release of the documents has come from his own increasingly fractured Maga base – who Trump attacked as “weaklings” and “stupid people” – and even key allies in Congress such as House speaker Mike Johnson.

Finally last night, in a bid to tamp down further controversy over a story that he allegedly contributed a sketch of a naked woman to Epstein's 50th birthday album, Trump – who was close friends with Epstein for 15 years – last night directed his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Epstein's sex-trafficking case.

The president has said the letter is a fake, and that he will sue the Wall Street Journal over the story.

The head of Israel's Mossad spy agency visited Washington this week as Israel seeks the Trump administration's help in moving Palestinian people out of Gaza, Axios is reporting, citing two sources with knowledge of the matter.

Per Axios's report, the spy chief, David Barnea, told White House envoy Steve Witkoff that Israel has been speaking in particular with Ethiopia, Indonesia and Libya.

The Israeli government stands accused of ethnic cleansing in Gaza, with its stated goal of capturing the entire strip, deporting Palestinian people from the land, and remaining there indefinitely.

While Benjamin Netanyahu's government claims such “relocation” would be “voluntary”, legal experts describe it as “a blueprint for crimes against humanity”.

Israel's scheme to move the entire population of Gaza into a so-called “humanitarian city” on the ruins of Rafah before implementing its forced emigration plan breaks international law, Michael Sfard, one of Israel's leading human rights lawyers, told my colleague Emma Graham-Harrison earlier this month.

[Israeli defense minister Israel Katz] laid out an operational plan for a crime against humanity. It is nothing less than that. It is all about population transfer to the southern tip of the Gaza Strip in preparation for deportation outside the strip.

While the government still calls the deportation ‘voluntary', people in Gaza are under so many coercive measures that no departure from the strip can be seen in legal terms as consensual.

When you drive someone out of their homeland that would be a war crime, in the context of a war. If it's done on a massive scale like he plans, it becomes a crime against humanity.

Donald Trump is pushing for a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% in any deal with the European Union, the Financial Times is reporting, and the administration is now looking at a reciprocal tariff rate that exceeds 10%, even if a deal is reached.

Trump has also been unmoved by the latest EU offer to reduce car tariffs, and would keep duties on the sector at 25% as planned, the report said, citing sources.

Here is my colleague Edward Helmore's story on Trump this morning launching a fresh defense of his conduct in the Jeffrey Epstein case after the scandal deepened last night following a Wall Street Journal report that he'd written the convicted sex offender a bawdy note with a sketch of a naked woman.

According to Trump's schedule, the “big signing” at 2.30pm will be the Genius Act, the first major legislative overhaul of cryptocurrency regulations which the House passed overwhelmingly yesterday.

Upon receiving his signature, the legislation will create new rules for stablecoins, delivering crypto companies a historic lobbying victory.

Donald Trump has said there will be a “big signing” at the White House at 2.30pm ET.

He wrote on Truth Social:

Big signing at 2:30 in the White House. Congratulations to our GREAT REPUBLICANS for being able to accomplish so much, a record, in so short a period of time. All the Democrats do is complain and criticize, AND GET NOTHING DONE. They are a “Party of the Past!”

Donald Trump has said he would want Rupert Murdoch to testify after vowing to sue the Wall Street Journal and its owner over the outlet's story detailing a 2003 birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein bearing Trump's name.

He wrote on Truth Social this morning:

I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his “pile of garbage” newspaper, the WSJ. That will be an interesting experience!!!

The WSJ report alleged that Trump had contributed a “bawdy” letter and featuring a drawing of a naked woman's silhouette around a typewritten personal message to Epstein – to an album compiled by Ghislane Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday.

Trump denied to the Journal that he was the author of the tribute and, hours after the story was published, announced he intended to file a lawsuit against the publication.

“I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn't print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I'm going to sue his ass off, and that of his third-rate newspaper,” Trump wrote last night.

Steve Bannon has said that the Wall Street Journal story about a Jeffrey Epstein birthday letter bearing Donald Trump's name has united the president's supporters behind him once again on an issue that, up until last night, had put him on a collision course with many members of his base.

“We are finally on offense,” Bannon, Trump's former aide and a leader of the Maga movement, told CNN. “President Trump has had enough and is fighting back – against his real enemies.”

Bannon was one of several of Trump's high-profile supporters who had blasted his administration's handling of the Epstein case and helped keep the story going all week despite Trump's repeated – and increasingly frustrated – attempts to dismiss the furore.

Bannon also praised Trump's move asking attorney general Pam Bondi to unseal pertinent grand jury testimony related to Epstein, calling it a “good start”.

“Good start but stay on offense—it's when Trump is @ his best –attack, attack, attack,” Bannon texted CNN when asked whether such a move will be enough to quell the pressure for more documents related to Epstein to be released.

Bannon is a longtime critic of Wall Street Journal owner Rupert Murdoch, who Trump has vowed to sue – along with the newspaper – over the story about the birthday letter, which he says is fake.

“Murdoch showed how much he loathes Trump,” Bannon said, arguing that Murdoch will further serve as a uniting force for the president's base. “Murdoch tried to destroy the President and failed – now Trump strikes back.”

Donald Trump has also been posting about CBS's cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which will end in May after a 33-year run, saying he “loves that Colbert got fired”.

I absolutely love that Colbert' got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.

The show's cancellation comes just a few days after Colbert criticised the network's parent company, Paramount, for settling a lawsuit with Trump for $16m (£12m) over the US president's claim that CBS News deceptively edited an interview with then presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

The settlement coincided with Paramount seeking approval from the US Federal Communications Commission for an $8.4bn merger with Skydance Media. Colbert called the settlement “a big fat bribe”.

Five immigrants deported by the United States to Eswatini under the Trump administration's third-country program are being held in solitary confinement in various prisons for an undetermined time, a government spokesperson said.

Thabile Mdluli, the Eswatini government spokesperson, declined to identify the correctional facilities where the five men are, citing security concerns. She said they were being held in solitary confinement away from other inmates.

She added that Eswatini planned to ultimately repatriate the five to their home countries with the help of a United Nations agency. Mdluli told The Associated Press it wasn't clear how long that would take.

The men, who the US says were convicted of serious crimes and were in the country illegally, are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos.

Their deportations were announced by US homeland security on Tuesday and mark the continuation of Donald Trump's plan to send deportees to third countries they have no ties with after it was stalled by a legal challenge in the US.

The Eswatini government said the men are considered to be “in transit” and will eventually be sent to their home countries. The US and Eswatini governments would work with the UN migration agency to do that, it said.

The UN agency – the International Organization for Migration or IOM – said it was not involved in the operation and has not been approached to assist in the matter but would be willing to help “in line with its humanitarian mandate”.

Eswatini's statement that the men would be sent home was in contrast to US claims they were sent there because their home countries refused to take them back.

It's unclear how sending the men to Eswatini would make it easier for them to be deported home. There was also no timeframe for that as it depends on several factors, including engagements with the IOM, Mdluli said.

“We are not yet in a position to determine the timelines for the repatriation,” she wrote.

There have been no details on why Eswatini agreed to take the men and Mdluli, the government spokesperson, said “the terms of the agreement between the US and Eswatini remain classified”.

The US's Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed president Donald Trump's $9bn funding cut to public media and foreign aid early this morning, sending it to the White House to be signed into law.

The chamber voted 216 to 213 in favor of the funding cut package, altered by the Senate this week to exclude cuts of about $400m in funds for the global PEPFAR HIV/Aids prevention program.

Only two House Republicans voted against the cut – representatives Brian Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania and Mike Turner from Ohio – along with Democrats.

“We are taking one small step to cut wasteful spending, but one giant leap towards fiscal sanity,” said Aaron Bean, a Florida Republican representative.

House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries countered that the funding cut “undermines our ability to keep our people safe here and to project America's soft power all over the globe”, and argued rural Americans' access to emergency information on public radio will be diminished.

The funding vote was delayed for hours amid Republican disagreements about other legislation, and calls from some members of the party for more government transparency about the deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Related: Tensions over Epstein files complicate Republican plan to vote on cuts bill

To satisfy the Epstein-related concerns without holding up the funding cut bill any longer, Republicans on the House rules committee introduced a resolution that calls for the release of Epstein documents by the US attorney general within 30 days.

“It's a sound, good-faith resolution that ensures protections for victims and innocent witnesses,” said representative Virginia Foxx from North Carolina, the Republican leader of the rules committee.

But the top Democrat on the rules panel, representative Jim McGovern from Massachusetts, blasted the resolution as a “glorified press release” because it lacks an enforcement mechanism to make the justice department comply.

When the chamber finally voted on the funding cut, it was the second close House vote on Trump's request to claw back the funds previously approved by Democrats and his fellow Republicans in Congress.

In June, four Republicans joined Democrats to vote against an earlier version of the rescissions package, which passed 214-212.

House Republicans felt extra pressure to pass the Senate version as the administration would have been forced to spend the money if Congress didn't approve it by Friday.

Public broadcast station leaders are condemning Donald Trump's latest victory after the Senate approved a bill on Wednesday that will cancel all federal funding for public broadcasting programs including PBS and NPR.

Following the Senate's decision to pass $9bn in spending cuts to public broadcasting as well as foreign aid, PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger saying that the Senate's approval of the package “goes against the will of the American people”.

“These cuts will significantly impact all of our stations, but will be especially devastating to smaller stations and those serving large rural areas. Many of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,” Kerger said.

“Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.”

Similarly, NPR's CEO, Katherine Maher, said: “Nearly three in four Americans say they rely on their public radio stations for alerts and news for their public safety.

“We call on the House of Representatives to reject this elimination of public media funding, which directly harms their communities and constituents, and could very well place lives at risk.”

Since that statement, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed Trump's $9bn funding cut to public media and foreign aid early this morning, sending it to the White House to be signed into law.

MOSCOW, July 18. /TASS/. Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) Deputy Speaker Pyotr Tolstoy predicts that NATO will have to face major problems because of the potential costs of Ukraine's rearmament.

On July 14, US President Donald Trump made a previously announced statement on the Ukraine issue. He said in NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte's presence that he was disappointed in Russia and its president, and announced plans to continue sending weapons and military equipment to Kiev as long as the EU pays for arms shipments in coordination with NATO.

"This will result in the destruction of the North Atlantic Alliance's member states. They will have to pay the US for weapons to send them to Ukraine at the expense of their own prosperity. We will destroy these weapons along with those who operate them," Tolstoy said in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.

When speaking about Trump's promise to provide Kiev with Patriot air defense systems, the senior Russian lawmaker pointed out that Russia also possessed long-range weapons. "Western weapons will be a legitimate target for us wherever they are," he stressed.

Tolstoy said, however, that Russia would not use the weapons to provoke the EU and NATO. "We will use long-range weapons, but not against Western countries. Our priority is to destroy Ukraine's energy and military infrastructure. We have enough forces and equipment to carry this out," the State Duma deputy speaker concluded.

Beatrice Hall is waiting for word that her husband is out of surgery and his colostomy has gone well. It is the latest in umpteen procedures, check-ups and tests he has been forced to ensure since being diagnosed with colon cancer.

“I don't know what we would do without this hospital,” she says, standing in the 33C heat outside the Kentucky River Medical Centre.

Yet that is a very real prospect facing this poverty-riddled corner of Kentucky as a consequence of the passage of Donald Trump's “one, big, beautiful bill”.

The bill will slash trillions of dollars from the Medicaid budget – dollars that pay for healthcare for those who cannot otherwise afford it. Without those patients and that money, some 300 hospitals across the country may struggle to survive, according to a study by the University of North Carolina, including 35 in Kentucky alone.

The hospital outside which Mrs Hall, 60, is waiting in the shade is “Hillbilly Elegy” territory.

It is the place where JD Vance rose to prominence with a memoir detailing the poverty and hopelessness of Breathitt County, a book that became a cipher for understanding the forgotten parts of America that elected Donald Trump.

And Mr Vance has been tasked with selling the legislation to the country. On Wednesday, he was in a blue-collar corner of Pennsylvania, describing how it would give $1,000 to every newborn and banish taxes on overtime pay.

“So what I ask every single person to do is take what I've said… go and talk to your neighbours, go and talk to your friends about what this bill does for American citizens,” he said.

But he made no mention of the Medicaid shake-up.

Democrats are salivating. They believe Mr Trump has miscalculated, giving them a chance to win back blue collar and working-class voters.

“How could the second poorest district in the country not revolt against what happened?” asked Ned Pillersdorf.

The lawyer, who practises an hour away in Prestonsburg, is running for Congress as a Democrat in a district that covers south-eastern Kentucky and where the incumbent Republican won more than 82 per cent of the vote last time around.

He admitted that made for an uphill battle. But he said voters will see through the Republican bill and mercenary calculations that its worst impacts will be in deep red districts that are unwinnable for Democrats.

“They have made the cynical calculation, which has some truth to it, that if you're on Medicaid, you're probably not voting, and you're certainly not contributing money to campaigns,” he said, leaning back at a conference table at his law offices.

By coincidence, his next meeting was with a cousin of Mr Vance. That is how things go in this part of Appalachian Kentucky.

The future vice-president may have been born in neighbouring Ohio, but his family has its roots in Breathitt County. His difficult childhood – his mother was a drug addict and alcoholic – was brightened by summers spent running wild in the hills around the town of Jackson.

His 2016 memoir described the poverty then and the opioid addiction he saw when he returned as an adult.

“At Mamaw Blanton's, we'd eat scrambled eggs, ham, fried potatoes, and biscuits for breakfast; fried bologna sandwiches for lunch; and soup beans and cornbread for dinner,” he wrote. “Many Jackson families couldn't say the same, and I knew this because, as I grew older, I overheard the adults speak about the pitiful children in the neighbourhood who were starving and how the town could help them.”

Today the town has the quaint charm of a place where time stood still. But shopping is limited to a handful of hardware or ramshackle second-hand stores, standing beside shopfronts that have been turned into makeshift homes.

They are a reminder of how the money was sucked away when coal mines closed in the 1980s and 1990s.

After the success of his book, Mr Vance returned with Ron Howard, the director, as they scouted locations and worked on turning it into a movie starring Glenn Close.

They stayed at Paul's Motel, as most visitors do, a neat complex of rooms and parking spaces just past the Breathitt County High School, home of the Bobcats football, baseball and basketball teams.

The Medicaid cuts are everywhere. Ask anyone and they open up, even at the motel.

“I'm worried about losing my medical coverage. I'm worried about losing my benefits,” said Anita, a member of staff, who asked that her real name not be used because of fear of running into trouble with Trump supporters. “Even as a family with two working people in the house, if you don't get the benefits, you literally, pretty much have to scrape to get by.”

Earnings of $300 a week each do not go far when the month's electricity bill can top $400, she explained. Supporting three children and keeping a car would make health insurance a luxury were it not for the “medical card,” as she knows it.

Like in many states, it is issued by a private medical insurer and often beneficiaries do not even realise that they are being helped by Medicaid.

“Appalachia can't afford to lose this,” she added, close to tears as she described the weekly struggle to pay the bills.

“I can't sleep at night now.”

Eastern Kentucky has some of the highest Medicaid enrollment rates in the country.

The bill, signed into law by Mr Trump on July 4, requires most users to prove 80 hours of work a month and increases eligibility checks.

In Kentucky, that is forecast to reduce Medicaid spending by $21bn over a decade, and end health coverage for up to 346,000 people, according to the non-partisan KFF health policy organisation.

Most residents are still trying to work out what it all means, as they dissect the headlines, said Mark Wireman, an old family friend of Mr Vance's. His farm stands on 130 acres of a reclaimed strip mine above a “holler” outside town. He wears a handgun on his hip, loaded with anti-snake shot, for any copperheads or rattlesnakes spotted when he mows the lawn in front of his house.

“We'd hate to see the hospital close,” he said. “There's no doubt it's saving people's lives over there.”

But he and his wife were sceptical of the doom-mongers claiming it would shut.

“I think some people will think that's just what the other side is saying,” said April, 54.

“I mean, I think in general, rural hospitals are struggling.”

The hospital study lists 15 facilities that are under threat in this one congressional district alone. But its findings are disputed by White House officials, who say it was conducted on an earlier draft of the bill and does not take account of an extra $50 billion directed to rural facilities.

“They struggle because they are low volume, and what we are doing through this bill is taking some of the savings and providing a once in a generation investment into these types of facilities that is not dependent upon an inflow of patients that they're never going to see,” said a senior White House official.

Plenty of people in Breathitt County see the benefits of tightening Medicaid requirements and say opponents are spreading lies.

“It's totally political propaganda,” said Bobby Deaton, a conservative columnist who joins retired friends to talk current affairs each morning at Jackson's Hardee's fast food restaurant.

“Right now we are paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants. That has to stop.”

And taxpayers are footing the bill for the healthcare of hill country people who have been raised to live off handouts, according to Gabrielle Hensley, 36.

“You have some people that live so far out, still up these little roads that are still set in their old ways. They don't travel, they don't have vehicles,” she said, waving her hand beyond the DG Market car park, where she was loading groceries into her car to feed her three children.

“Some of them are still just stuck on old habits and the way that they were raised by previous parents who teach them that government living is okay.”

Scott Jennings, who is best known as a conservative pugilist on CNN and whose own roots lie in Kentucky, said the bill was popular in places like Breathitt County, where residents knew the value of hard work.

“I've heard so many lies about this bill my head is spinning,” he said, explaining that the bill would redirect money to struggling hospitals. “There's no political downside to encouraging work.”

For its part, the Kentucky River Medical Centre played down the threat, saying any impact would not be felt for another five years, if that.

Susie Morgan, the chief executive, said rural hospitals also had access to federal and state support programmes.

“Fortunately, we are part of a larger network that provides shared resources, operational support, and strategic guidance—especially valuable when navigating industry changes like this one,” she said.

For now, however, local headlines have focused on the danger to her hospital and the uncertainty around Medicaid. Even a Vance loyalist, in the form of his fifth cousin (twice removed) is worried about what it might mean politically.

“It'll be negative for Trump, and it'll be negative for me too,” said Joe Profitt, whose mother was a Bowman (the vice-president's family name). “The people back here, if they believe in something or somebody and you betray him, you don't get any more chances.”

Mr Profitt lives just outside Jackson, in a bungalow set above a neatly tended garden. He described how Appalachian hospitality – illustrated with copious offers of the local soft drink Ale-8-One – came with a barb.

“You get this wherever you go here,” he said, as an “It's Time for Trump” clock ticked on the wall of his front room. “We love people. We're friendly, but don't cross us.”

            Across Africa, and in the tiny nation of Eswatini, fury has erupted over the arrival of foreign deportees from the United States, after its government confirmed that migrants described by a Department of Homeland security spokesperson as “depraved monsters” had been sent to its prisons.
    


            Roughly the size of New Jersey, Eswatini — formerly known as Swaziland — is governed by a monarch who has absolute power. On Wednesday, officials said that five deportees from the US were being held in isolated units in its jails, acknowledging “widespread concern” but insisting the deported men “pose no threat to the country or its citizens.”
    


            The five men are being kept in solitary confinement, acting government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli told CNN Friday, but stopped short of disclosing the prisons they were held in, citing security risks.
    


            Mdluli did not reveal how long the men would stay in Eswatini, but said: “Critical engagements between stakeholders are still ongoing.” She had earlier stated that the deportation was the “result of months of robust high-level engagements” between the US and the southern African nation.
    


            Critics of the move say it is unacceptable for Eswatini to be treated as a “dumping ground” for people considered unfit to live in the US.
    


            While the Trump administration's mass deportations to the prisons of El Salvador have made headlines around the world, the White House has also been quietly attempting to strike agreements with a number of African countries to accept deportees originally from other nations.
    


            President Donald Trump's aggressive clampdown on immigration has run into logistical hurdles, with some countries refusing to take back their nationals, or doing so only on a limited basis.
    


            Some of those approached by the US, such as Nigeria, have decried being pressured to take in foreign deportees.
    


            “The US is mounting considerable pressure on African countries to accept Venezuelans to be deported from the US, some straight out of prison,” Nigeria's foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, said in a televised interview last week, citing Washington's announcement of increased tariffs and recent reductions in the validity of visas.
    


            The US Mission in Nigeria insisted visa changes were “not the result of any nation's stance on third-country deportees” but rather “to safeguard US immigration systems.”
    


            “The Trump Administration is committed to removing criminal illegal aliens from the United States,” a White House official told CNN in a statement. “The Administration frequently engages in conversations with foreign nations on a variety of topics, but we do not share information on private discussions.”
    


            Earlier this month, the US Supreme Court paved the way for the Trump administration to deport certain migrants to countries other than their homeland with little notice. Soon after, eight third-country deportees said by the US to have criminal records landed in South Sudan, a nation on the cusp of civil war.
    


            DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X Wednesday that the five detainees flown to Eswatini were nationals from Jamaica, Laos, Cuba, Yemen and Vietnam.
    


            “This flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,” she wrote. “These depraved monsters have been terrorizing American communities but thanks to @POTUS Trump @Sec_Noem they are off of American soil,” McLaughlin added.
    


            The prisoners were convicted of various crimes, including child rape, murder and robbery, she said.
    


            Eswatini government spokesperson Mdluli said the nation would now collaborate with the US and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) “to facilitate the transit of these inmates to their countries of origin.”
    


            She told CNN Thursday, however, that “there are no timelines at present” for their repatriation.
    


            Eswatini's decision to accommodate America's deportees has met with widespread public disapproval, both due to the perceived risk around their presence and the US portrayal of the nation as a “safe third country.”
    


            The landlocked country of just over one million people is already beleaguered by poverty, unemployment, high crime rates and congested prisons. Human rights are also deteriorating, according to Human Rights Watch, following a wave of crackdowns on pro-democracy movements. More than half its population lives on less than $4 a day, according to the World Bank.

            Opposition party PUDEMO said accepting foreign deportees from the US “poses a serious risk to our already vulnerable communities” which it said are “battling a severe scourge” of crime, including rape and murder.
    


            “Our country must not be treated as a dumping ground for those deemed unfit to live elsewhere,” the group said in a statement sent to CNN.
    


            Lucky Lukhele, of the Swaziland Solidarity Network, an exiled civil society group based in South Africa, told CNN it was “clear racism to think Africa is a dumping ground for Donald Trump.”
    


            Lukhele said he was informed by unnamed sources that more US deportees would be sent to Eswatini, warning that “Swazi prisons are (already) overcrowded” with prisoners who “get one meal a day.”
    


            The Multi Stakeholder Forum (MSF), a coalition of Eswatini's civil society groups, said in a statement that the country's “sovereignty and dignity must not be traded off for unclear deals or political expediency.”
    


            It's not clear how Eswatini stands to benefit from housing US deportees. Government spokesperson Mdluli told CNN that “the terms of the agreement (with the US) remain classified information.”
    


            Asked whether more foreign US deportees would arrive in Eswatini, she said there was currently no information to that effect.
    


            Eswatini's trade privileges with the US came under threat in April after it was included in Trump's list of tariffs, facing a rate of 10% on its exports. Its neighbor and biggest trading partner, South Africa, was also slapped with a 30% tariff, triggering panic from Eswatini's central bank on the “implications” for its economy. The tariffs are due to come into effect on August 1.

            Its intake of US deportees has similarly generated uproar in South Africa, whose relations with the US have deteriorated under Trump.
    


            A South African government source told CNN, “There is a feeling that some inside the Trump administration could be using this (the deportation of prisoners to Eswatini) to destabilize South Africa,” given its porous borders and Eswatini's struggling economy.
    


            “Everyone knows that these fellows (the deported convicts) will want to move to South Africa” another diplomatic source said, adding that the US “did (ask South Africa to accept migrants) and we refused.”
    


            The source said the deportations to Eswatini were a provocation by the US and a direct national security threat.
    


            Ken Opalo, an associate professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Washington, DC, said African nations are being pushed by the Trump administration “into doing egregious things such as accepting migrants from random countries or giving them (the US) their mineral wealth in ambiguous deals that don't make much sense.”
    


            He cautioned: “It's foolhardy for African countries to think that they can make deals and expect a credible commitment from the White House, given their transactional nature, which means everything is subject to change.”

Russian mercenary Igor Nesterov, who previously fought in Ukraine and coached boxing champion Alexander Povetkin, was killed in combat in Mali, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent.

The source called Nesterov a war criminal and a member of Russia's infamous Wagner company, a mercenary group that was deployed in some of the most brutal battles in Ukraine. 

Nesterov took part in Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine from its beginning and was seen in pictures with other Russian soldiers, the source added.

The intelligence source did not provide further details about how Nesterov was killed. The Russian promotion company World of Boxing confirmed his death on July 16, saying Nesterov was killed in combat.

Nesterov had been part of Povetkin's team since the late 1990s and headed the boxing federation in Chekhov, Moscow Oblast.

Povetkin, an Olympic boxing champion, has echoed Russian propaganda justifying the war against Ukraine in the past, framing Moscow's actions as a fight against "Nazism."

The intelligence source noted that the Wagner company continues to suffer losses in Mali despite claims it is leaving the West African country, where it fought alongside Malian government forces to fend off Islamist insurgents.

The Wagner company, known for its deployment in Ukraine and short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin in 2023, has a strong presence across the African continent, backing Russian business interests and Moscow-friendly regimes.

The mercenary group was accused of numerous atrocities during its deployment across Africa. A recent media investigation said that since 2021, Wagner mercenaries have detained, tortured, and forcibly disappeared hundreds of civilians in secret prisons across Mali.

"We're striking at the heart of the Russian energy sector alongside the EU," British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said.

According to the case file, he was struck in the face and torso by an enlistment officer. After he collapsed, the officer hit the man with a stun gun at least three to four times and struck his head against the floor multiple times, the records show.

The project would involve Romanian investment in a local factory, likely in Brasov, where Ukrainian and Romanian teams would collaborate on manufacturing drones based on Ukrainian designs developed through wartime experience. 

Ukraine's Air Force said it shot down 11 Shahed-type drones overnight as Russia launched a wave of 35 attack drones, including decoy drones, primarily targeting eastern frontline regions. Six additional decoys were jammed or lost. 

The package targets 105 vessels of Russia's shadow fleet, the Russian banking system, Nord Stream pipelines, and lowers the price cap on Russian crude oil.

The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems.

The fatalities included a man and a woman. All of the 11 injured victims have been hospitalized, one of whom — a 29-year-old woman — is in serious condition, Governor Serhii Lysak reported.

Rustem Umerov previously served as Ukraine's defense minister, a post he had held since September 2023.

Moscow came under drone attack for the second consecutive night, with explosions also reported in several other Russian oblasts, local Telegram channels and the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on July 18.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said four Ukrainian drones were shot down on approach to the capital, with blasts heard near Zvenigorod, Istra, and Zelenograd — suburban districts and satellite towns located to the west and northwest of central Moscow. 

Residents reported the sounds of explosions in multiple parts of the greater Moscow area overnight, according to Russian Telegram channels.

Sobyanin did not provide details on possible damage or casualties as a result of the attacks.

Flight operations were temporarily suspended at multiple airports, including Moscow's largest ones — Domodedovo, Vnukovo, and Zhukovsky — as well as Nizhny Novgorod's Strigino and Kaluga's Grabtsevo Airport. All airports have since resumed operations.

In Dzerzhinsk, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, at least five explosions were reported, with Russian news outlet Shot saying air defenses targeted drones near an industrial zone with munitions production facilities. Additional blasts were heard near Oryol, the channel said.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses had intercepted and destroyed 73 fixed-wing Ukrainian drones overnight, including 10 over Moscow Oblast.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.

The latest wave follows a series of reported Ukrainian drone attacks across Russia on July 17, including strikes on Moscow, St. Petersburg, Belgorod, Voronezh, and other oblasts. Ukraine has not commented on the overnight drone activity.

"For us, the absolute top priority is, first and foremost, to do everything possible to end this war," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.



The Russian oil giant has been trying to sell its 49.13% stake in India's Nayara refinery, but the EU's latest sanctions package could make such a deal too risky for buyers. 




Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Russian President Vladimir Putin that launching a third round of negotiations is important and that Turkey is prepared to host discussions in Istanbul once both sides agree on a date. 

In an exclusive interview, Ukrainian anti-corruption activist Vitaliy Shabunin speaks out on what he says is a politically motivated criminal case against him, as well as corruption and the democratic backsliding in Ukraine. 



"We're striking at the heart of the Russian energy sector alongside the EU," British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said.

According to the case file, he was struck in the face and torso by an enlistment officer. After he collapsed, the officer hit the man with a stun gun at least three to four times and struck his head against the floor multiple times, the records show. 

Civic watchdogs argue that Tsyvinsky's candidacy was rejected because the President's Office sees him as too independent. 



The sanctions target operatives of Russia's military intelligence (GRU), responsible for widespread malicious cyber activity in the U.K. and Europe, the Foreign Office said.



The project would involve Romanian investment in a local factory, likely in Brasov, where Ukrainian and Romanian teams would collaborate on manufacturing drones based on Ukrainian designs developed through wartime experience. 

Ukraine's Air Force said it shot down 11 Shahed-type drones overnight as Russia launched a wave of 35 attack drones, including decoy drones, primarily targeting eastern frontline regions. Six additional decoys were jammed or lost.

The House of Representatives on July 17 passed a revised $9 billion rescissions package, sending the measure to President Donald Trump for his signature.

The tally was 216–213, with two Republicans—Reps. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.)—voting against the bill.

            China has put export restrictions on technologies critical for producing electric vehicle batteries, in a move to consolidate its dominance in the sector that has contributed to the country's lead in the global EV race.
    


            Several technologies used to manufacture EV batteries and process lithium, a critical mineral for batteries, were added to the government's export control list.
    


            Inclusion on the list means transferring the technologies overseas – such as through trade, investment, or technological cooperation – will require a government-issued license, according to a statement by the country's Commerce Ministry.
    


            The new controls mirror similar restrictions introduced just three months ago on certain rare earth elements and their magnets – critical materials used not only in EV production, but also in consumer electronics and military equipment such as fighter jets. China's dominance of the rare earths supply chain has emerged as among its most potent tools in a renewed trade war with the United States.
    


            China has emerged as a leading player in the competitive global EV market, thanks in part to its ability to develop high-performance, cost-effective batteries through its comprehensive supply chain, from raw material processing to battery manufacturing.
    


            Huge numbers of car manufacturers around the world use Chinese EV batteries in their vehicles. Chinese EV battery makers accounted for at least 67% of the global market share, according to SNE Research, a market research and consultancy firm.
    


            First proposed in January, the latest licensing requirements have cast uncertainty over Chinese EV makers' overseas expansion plans, particularly as markets like the European Union have employed tariffs on Chinese car exports to push them to set up shop there. Many Chinese battery makers also have plans to localize production in markets such as Southeast Asia and the US.
    


            The Commerce Ministry said the restrictions “aim to safeguard national economic security and development interests, and promote international economic and technological cooperation.”
    


            Liz Lee, an associate director at Counterpoint Research, said the move “deepens the emerging geopolitical tech decoupling beyond materials to process IP (intellectual property).”  She added that this could accelerate efforts by the US, EU and others to boost localization of precursor materials and metal refining capabilities.
    


            China's CATL, the world's largest EV battery producer and a key supplier of Tesla, has plants in Germany and Hungary and has plans for a joint venture factory in Spain with Stellantis, the owner of Fiat and Chrysler. It is also licensing its technology to be used in a Ford EV battery plant under construction in Michigan. A Ford spokesperson told CNN the company is “not affected” by the new restrictions.
    


            Meanwhile, Chinese EV giant BYD, which manufactures its own battery and surged past Tesla in 2024 sales to become the world's largest EV maker, has EV production facilities around the world, from Hungary and Thailand to Brazil.
    


            And Gotion, another major EV battery maker in China, has plans to build a production plant in Illinois.
    


            CNN has reached out to CATL, BYD and Gotion for comment.
    


            Analysts said the true impact of the new export controls remains uncertain, as details are still unclear.
    


            Lee noted the restrictions “appear to target upstream process technologies… rather than battery cell and module manufacturing.”
    


            Since CATL's plants in Germany and Hungary focus on cell and module production and do not appear to replicate the restricted processes locally, the near-term effect may be limited, she said.
    


            For BYD, which only assembles battery packs overseas and does not manufacture battery cells abroad, the controls do not appear to affect operations at this stage, Lee added.
    


            Vincent Sun, senior equity analyst at Morningstar covering China's EV sector, said the ultimate impact would depend on how easily companies can obtain permits – something that “may take some extra time to see.”
    


            One part of the newly announced restrictions surrounds the battery cathode production technology for the making of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, a type of lithium-ion battery that has become increasingly popular in EVs in the last five years for its lower price and greater safety. Another part focuses on the processing, refinement and extraction of lithium.
    


            China dominates the production of LFP batteries and the processing of lithium globally, according to Fastmarkets, a United Kingdom-based research company. Last year, it held 94% market share for LFP production capacity and provided 70% of global processed lithium production.
    


            But while LFP batteries amounted to 40% of the global EV market by capacity, adoption of them is more prevalent in EVs made by Chinese manufacturers than elsewhere, according to Adamas Intelligence, a data analysis and consultancy firm focusing on critical minerals and batteries.
    


            James Edmondson, vice president in research at IDTechEx, a research firm, told CNN that despite LFP's lower energy density, its much lower cost, compared with its common alternative battery made of nickel, manganese, and cobalt, has made it “a staple in lower-cost vehicles” and there are plans for greater adoption by EU and US automakers.
    


            China's dominance in LFP production means that “even for LFP produced outside of China, Chinese suppliers would still often play a part in the production of precursors to LFP cathodes,” he said.
    


            China holds a “significant lead” in the technology itself, as shown by BYD's “Super E-Platform” that promised a 250-mile range on just a five-minute charge, Edmondson added. The technology outperforms Tesla's Superchargers, which take 15 minutes to deliver 200 miles.
    


            Not to be outdone, CATL followed in April with a more competitive product, an upgraded LFP battery that provides an even longer range of 320 miles with the same charging time.

Rep. Mike Haridopolos, R-Fla., weighs in on the European Union's response to tariffs, the State Department's layoffs, the House's 'Crypto Week' and more on 'Fox News Live.'

President Donald Trump signed into law the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act Friday — a landmark piece of legislation that establishes federal regulations surrounding digital currency. 

Ahead of signing the bill, Trump recalled how he previously vowed to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the planet" during a keynote address during a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, in July 2024, where he said that regulations his administration would implement would be "written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry." 

"I pledged that we would bring back American liberty and leadership and make the United States the crypto capital of the world," Trump said Friday. "And that's what we've done. And under the Trump administration, this is only going further." 

President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a signing ceremony for the "GENIUS Act" in the East Room of the White House on July 18, 2025, in Washington. 

Stablecoins are a form of digital currency tied to a stable asset like gold or the U.S. dollar, which aims to keep their prices more consistent. 

"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoin," Trump said Friday. "This could be perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the internet itself."

Included in the GENIUS Act are provisions requiring monthly public disclosure of reserve competition, as well as annual audited financial statements for issuers with more than $50 billion in market capitalization, according to the Senate Banking Committee, which spearheaded the legislation. 

HOUSE PASSES BILL MAXINE WATERS DUBBED ‘A FULL-SCALE CRYPTO CON' 

President Donald Trump arrives for a signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act in the East Room of the White House in Washington on Friday, July 18, 2025.  

The House passed the GENIUS Act Thursday by a 308–122 vote, after the measure cleared the Senate in June by a 68–30 margin. 

"For far too long, America's digital assets industry has been stifled by ambiguous rules, confusing enforcement and the Biden administration's anti-crypto crusade,"  Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said during a press conference on Thursday. "But President Trump and this Congress are correcting course and unleashing America's digital asset potential with historic, transformative legislation." 

Despite the bipartisanship and support from a host of Democrats, the legislation didn't pick up votes from all members of the president's party.

Twelve Republicans voted against the measure, which has attracted scrutiny from lawmakers like House Financial Services Committee ranking member Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., due to conflict-of-interest concerns as Trump has promoted a digital currency called $TRUMP.

"By passing this bill, Congress will be telling the world that Congress is OK with corruption, OK with foreign companies buying influence, and OK with criminals buying Trump coins to seek pardons and beneficial treatment," Waters said on the House floor Thursday. 

In addition to the GENIUS Act, the House passed two other measures related to cryptocurrency Thursday: Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act) to install some additional regulatory framework for digital assets, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which aims to stop the Federal Reserve from central bank digital currency (CBDC) directly to individuals and jeopardize their privacy.

Live Updates


• Epstein files: President Donald Trump said he ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of “pertinent” records from grand jury testimony in the case of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. According to a Wall Street Journal report, a collection of letters gifted to Epstein in 2003 included a note bearing Trump's name and an outline of a naked woman. The president denied he wrote the letter and vowed to sue the newspaper.
    


• DOGE cuts package: Congress overnight passed a package of $9 billion in spending cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting, part of the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to reduce government costs. It marks another legislative win for Trump as it heads to his desk for his signature.
    


• Trump's diagnosis: The White House said yesterday the president has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency following leg swelling. Trump's doctor said the condition is common in older adults and there are no signs of heart failure or arterial disease.
    


            President Donald Trump spoke at a White House signing ceremony for the bipartisan GENIUS Act today.
    


            Trump said the legislation is “massive validation” of the cryptocurrency industry.
    


                    “Nobody's gained a respect in such a short period of time. But this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up, because a lot of people would have given up two, three years ago. So I want to thank you for contributing to the incredible strength of America,” he said.
                





            After his remarks, Trump sat at a desk to sign the bill into law, surrounded by members of Congress and administration officials.
    


What's in the bill: It is a first-of-its kind legislation that aims to regulate a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins. The US House passed the legislation in a 308-122 vote yesterday, after a handful of Republicans initially blocked the bill over a policy dispute.
    


            Trump had urged Republicans to vote for the bill, arguing on social media that the GENIUS Act would make the US the “UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets.”
    


            GENIUS stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins.”
    


This post has been updated with remarks from the president and to reflect the bill's signing.



            As the Department of Homeland Security scrambles to meet the Trump administration's quotas for increased arrest and deportation of undocumented immigrations, officials are pleading with former ICE agents to return to service, according to an email obtained by CNN that was sent to numerous former agents.
    


            It comes with a bonus of up to $50,000.
    


                    “You served the United States of America with distinction and honor,” the message reads. “Now, your country calls upon you to serve once more.”
                





            Deemed “Operation Return to Mission,” ICE leadership issued the “urgent call” to former agency employees, indicating “you can serve in your current location and previous job series.”
    


            As CNN reported, while the administration has touted its immigration crackdown publicly, privately officials have come under fire for failing to meet White House arrest quotas, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.
    


            Trump border czar Tom Homan said today that no final decision has been made about reopening Alcatraz, when asked about reports that returning the former prison to operation could cost $2 billion.
    


            Homan did say the administration is looking “for any available bed space.”
    


                    “I think they're looking at it. I don't think any decision has been made yet,” Homan told CNN's Alayna Treene, adding that he hasn't been briefed on how much rebuilding and reopening Alcatraz would cost. Administration officials toured the site yesterday.
                





            Pressed again by reporters on whether he'd be comfortable with the $2 billion figure, Homan said, “I'd have to see how many beds come out of that number and what's the length of stay that facility is going to do — we've got short-term bed facilities and long-term bed facilities, so unless I have that information, I can't even give you a guess.”
    


            He repeatedly stressed the need for more bed space. “We're looking for any available bed space we can get that meet the detention standards that we're accustomed to,” Homan said.
    


            “Gov. (Ron) DeSantis came up with some beds pretty quickly,” Homan said, referring to the Florida detention facility the administration has called “Alligator Alcatraz.” The border czar said states have a responsibility to help.
    


            Federal grand juries are investigative bodies that hear testimony from witnesses and issue subpoenas, but it's unclear if the material gathered during this secretive panel would advance the public's understanding of the Jeffrey Epstein case — as it's not a complete record of the investigation, just enough to get an indictment.
    


            The Department of Justice is expected to ask a judge to release additional material, which is typically kept secret — but it's unclear what they will argue that will convince a judge to release additional material that has been held back to protect victims and accusers.
    


            A Justice Department official confirmed the government is expected to file the request in federal court in Manhattan at some point today.
    


CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig explains more:


President Donald Trump has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to unseal pertinent testimony related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, as he appeared to bow to pressure to release more material on the case. CNN's Elie Honig explains what documents could get released. #CNN #News


What's been made public already: Some transcripts related to the 2006 Florida grand jury investigation into Epstein have already been released. The public also received information throughout the course of the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison in 2022 for carrying out a years-long scheme with Epstein to groom and sexually abuse underage girls.
    


            Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi did not address what might become of FBI notes or interviews conducted outside of the grand jury process. Those are often much more voluminous, and — even if they don't ultimately become relevant to the criminal case — could enhance public understanding of a matter.
    


            President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after being examined for swelling in his legs, the White House announced yesterday.
    


            It's a condition in which valves inside certain veins don't work the way they should, which can allow blood to pool or collect in the veins. About 150,000 people are diagnosed with it each year, and the risk goes up with age.
    


Watch the explanation from CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta:  


CNN's Sanjay Gupta analyzes the news that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency following leg swelling.


            Steve Bannon said Friday that the Wall Street Journal story about a Jeffrey Epstein birthday letter bearing Donald Trump's name has united the president's supporters behind him once again on an issue that, up until last evening, had put him at odds with many members of his base.
    


                    “We are finally on offense,” Bannon, Trump's former aide and a leader of the MAGA movement, said via text to CNN. “President Trump has had enough and is fighting back – against his real enemies.”
                





            Bannon was one of several of Trump's high-profile supporters who had chastised his administration's handling of the Epstein case and helped keep the issue alive despite Trump's repeated attempts to dismiss the backlash.
    


            Bannon also praised Trump's move asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to unseal pertinent grand jury testimony related to Epstein, calling it a “good start.”
    


            “Good start but stay on offense—it's when Trump is @ his best –attack, attack, attack,” Bannon wrote when asked whether such a move will be enough to quell the pressure for more of the so-called Epstein files to be released.
    


            Bannon is a longtime critic of Wall Street Journal owner Rupert Murdoch, whom Trump has vowed to sue — along with the newspaper — over the story about the birthday letter, which he denies is from him.
    


                    “Murdoch showed how much he loathes Trump,” Bannon said, arguing that Murdoch will further serve as a uniting force for the president's base. “Murdoch tried to destroy the President and failed – now Trump strikes back.”
                





            President Donald Trump said he would want Rupert Murdoch to testify after vowing to sue the Wall Street Journal and its owner over the outlet's story detailing a 2003 birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein bearing Trump's name.
    


                    “I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his ‘pile of garbage' newspaper, the WSJ. That will be an interesting experience!!!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.
                





            A collection of letters gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday included a note bearing Trump's name and an outline of a naked woman, according to the WSJ report. The drawing, depicting a woman's breasts and a “Donald” signature in the place of pubic hair, surrounded several lines of typewritten text, according to the newspaper, which reviewed the letter. It concluded with the line: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.”
    


            Trump in an interview with the Journal on Tuesday denied that he wrote the letter or drew the picture and threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story.
    


            “I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn't print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I'm going to sue his ass off, and that of his third-rate newspaper,” Trump posted on Truth Social last night after the story posted.
    


            Here's what the president's day looks like so far today:
    


            We'll update you with any additional events as we get them.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson would not commit to bringing a non-binding resolution calling for the release of more Jeffrey Epstein-related materials to the floor, after the resolution was advanced by the House Rules Committee. Instead, he argued that the point of that committee vote was to allow his GOP Rules members to go on the record supporting transparency in the Epstein case, since committee Democrats had forced politically tough votes on the issue throughout the week.
    


            “We will see how all of this develops. We're in line with the White House, there's no daylight between us,” he said in the early hours of Friday morning.
    


                    Johnson added: “The resolution that was advanced tonight in the Rules Committee was for them to go on record and say, ‘No, of course, we're for transparency. Of course, every single one of the Republicans on the Rules Committee are for transparency and for releasing the files, just as the president of the United States is,' and they wanted that to make crystal clear — make it crystal clear. I think their vote tonight did. We'll determine what happens with all that, there's a lot developing.”
                





            Johnson emphasized that House Republicans support President Donald Trump's handling of the Epstein case.
    


            The speaker also touted the House's final passage of a package codifying some DOGE spending cuts, saying he was “delighted” to move it to the president's desk.
    


            The House in the early hours of Friday passed the package of $9 billion in spending cuts, which is part of the White House's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency efforts.
    


            It now awaits President Donald Trump's signature.
    


Effect on public broadcasting and international aid: Roughly $8 billion will be taken from congressionally approved foreign aid programs as part of the White House's efforts to dismantle the US Agency for International Development. Another $1.1 billion comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund NPR and PBS.
    


            Public television stations will be “forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,” PBS CEO Paula Kerger said yesterday. Advocates say the entire system of noncommercial media will become weaker without the foundational support from taxpayers, resulting in fewer original shows and less local news coverage.
    


Government funding: Passage of the bill, however, now raises questions about how and whether Democrats and Republicans will be able to work together to keep the government funded past the September 30 deadline. Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer argued the process has cast doubt on whether Democrats can work in good faith with Republican lawmakers who could agree to a spending deal now and pull future funding later.
    


CNN's Brian Stelter contributed reporting. 



            The House of Representatives passed the DOGE spending cuts package overnight. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said he'd ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “any and all pertinent” grand jury testimony in the case of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
    


Get up to speed here:



            • DOGE cuts package: House Republicans gave the final stamp of approval overnight to a package of $9 billion in spending cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting, handing a win to Trump.
    


            Congress passed the package — which is part of Trump's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency efforts — under an obscure presidential budget law used to circumvent the Senate filibuster. The measure will now head to the president to be signed into law.
    


            Trump is the first president in roughly 30 years to successfully use the maneuver.
    


            • Holdup over Epstein: Ahead of final passage, however, the package ran into problems in the narrowly divided House, as some of the same members demanded a separate and unrelated promise from GOP leadership calling for more transparency on the Epstein files.
    


            Ultimately, the committee voted Thursday night to advance the DOGE cuts package as well as a non-binding resolution that calls for the release of additional Epstein files following intense talks from a number of Republicans who asked for more transparency surrounding the case. There is nothing that would compel this to the floor, however.
    


            • Wall Street Journal report: A collection of letters gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003 included a note bearing Trump's name and an outline of a naked woman, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  The drawing, depicting a woman's breasts and a “Donald” signature in the place of pubic hair, surrounded several lines of typewritten text, according to the newspaper, which reviewed the letter. It concluded with the line: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.”
    


            Trump in an interview with the Journal on Tuesday denied that he wrote the letter or drew the picture and threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story.
    


            • Epstein files: Trump then announced last night on Truth Social that he's asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony,” related to Epstein, seeming to bow to pressure to release more material on the case.
    


            Bondi quickly reposted Trump's comments on X and wrote: “President Trump—we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.” Her department could ask judges to make such material public, but the process could be lengthy as the courts weigh privacy and other concerns.

            Three veteran Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department members assigned to the agency's arson and explosives detail were killed Friday morning by an explosion at a department training facility, according to Sheriff Robert Luna.
    


            The tragedy marks the “largest loss of life” at the department since 1857, Luna said at a news conference.
    


            The three sworn members had collectively served for 74 years and authorities are not releasing their names at this time, the sheriff said. Luna added he's met with several family members of the deputies, but some have not yet been notified.
    


            “The individuals who work our arson explosives detail, they have years of training,” Luna said, adding the members respond to an average of 1,100 calls per year, which include “dealing with some very dangerous situations or items.”
    


            “These aren't people who don't do this very often. They are fantastic experts, and unfortunately, I lost three of them today,” the sheriff continued.
    


            The incident happened shortly after 7:30 a.m. local time at the Biscailuz Center Training Academy, which houses the sheriff's department's special enforcement units and bomb squad, according to a release from the LASD. The facility is located about 6 miles east of downtown LA.
    


            The scene was rendered safe by the Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad just after 11 a.m. local time, Luna said, so now investigators can begin to determine “what happened from the very beginning to the end.”
    


            The incident is believed to have been an accident, but remains under investigation. It's unclear whether the incident was related to a training session or whether officers were handling evidence, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the incident told CNN.
    


            “At this time, we do not know the cause of the explosion … I can tell you, there is no threat to this community. This is an isolated incident,” Luna said.
    


            US Attorney General Pam Bondi and the LASD said earlier Friday the three members died in a “critical workplace incident.”
    


            “I just spoke to (US Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli) about what appears to be a horrific incident that killed at least three at a law enforcement training facility in Los Angeles,” Bondi said in a post on X. “Our federal agents are at the scene and we are working to learn more. Please pray for the families of the sheriff's deputies killed.”
    


            “Sheriff's homicide detectives are on scene,” the LASD said.
    


            The FBI is responding to assist with the incident, according to the FBI's Los Angeles field office. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also on scene, according to Bondi. LASD homicide detectives are also on scene investigating the deaths, Luna said.
    


            Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigators and members of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad are assisting at the training facility, LA Mayor Karen Bass said in a post on X.
    


            The work of the bomb squad was complicated by the fact officers had to ensure no other explosive material that could be stored there was vulnerable to detonation, the senior law enforcement source told CNN.
    


            “I am heartbroken to hear of the terrible tragedy that has unfolded today at an L.A. County Sheriff's Department facility,” Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger said in a statement.
    


            “I am closely tracking the situation as we learn more about what occurred and the condition of those affected. My heart is heavy, and my thoughts are with the brave men and women of the Sheriff's Department during this difficult time. We stand with them and their families as they navigate the hours and days ahead,” Barger said.

            At least three people have died in an explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's training facility on Friday morning, according to US Attorney General Pam Bondi.
    


            “I just spoke to (US Attorney Bill Essayli) about what appears to be a horrific incident that killed at least three at a law enforcement training facility in Los Angeles,” Bondi said in a post on X. “Our federal agents are at the scene and we are working to learn more. Please pray for the families of the sheriff's deputies killed.”
    


            The explosion happened at the LASD's Biscailuz Training Center, which houses the sheriff's department's special enforcement units and bomb squad, around 7:30 a.m. local time, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the incident told CNN. The facility is located about 6 miles east of downtown LA.
    


            The incident is believed to have been an accident, but remains under investigation. It's unclear whether the incident was related to a training session or whether officers were handling evidence, the source said.
    


            The FBI is responding to assist with the incident, according to the FBI's Los Angeles field office. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also on scene, according to Bondi.
    


            Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigators and members of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad are assisting at the training facility, LA Mayor Karen Bass said in a post on X. The work of the bomb squad is complicated by the fact officers have to ensure no other explosive material that could be stored there is vulnerable to detonation, the senior law enforcement source told CNN.
    


            “I am heartbroken to hear of the terrible tragedy that has unfolded today at an L.A. County Sheriff's Department facility,” Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger said in a statement.
    


            “I am closely tracking the situation as we learn more about what occurred and the condition of those affected. My heart is heavy, and my thoughts are with the brave men and women of the Sheriff's Department during this difficult time. We stand with them and their families as they navigate the hours and days ahead,” Barger said.

 State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce and Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst discusses the Israeli airstrikes on the Syrian capital, Damascus, on ‘America Reports.'

EXCLUSIVE: In a rare public rebuke of Israeli military action, Rep. Joe Wilson, R‑S.C., issued a harsh warning that recent airstrikes on Syria are "suicidal" for Tel Aviv. 

"I'm the co‑chair of the Israel caucus and a lifelong supporter of the State of Israel," Wilson told Fox News Digital in an emotional phone call, "I am heartsick."

He said the strikes on Syria's military headquarters were "insulting and mocking to President [Donald] Trump," who just recently lifted sanctions on Syria after meeting with leader Ahmed al-Sharaa to give Damascus a "chance" at economic prosperity after the fall of Bashar al-Assad. 

Wilson said he had a tense phone call with Ambassador Yechiel Leiter, urging him to share his warning back home that Israel must stop the strikes.

Only weeks ago, there were back-channel talks between Israel and Syria on a possible normalization deal. Now, not only are those talks out the window, but the strikes will complicate work on a U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords-style deal to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, Wilson said. "It's so sad to me, it's so detrimental."

He warned that fractures in Syria could ripple across the region — undermining emerging ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, straining NATO relations with Turkey, fracturing Druze unity in Jordan and increasing instability among Kurdish populations across Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran. He added that such fragmentation would open the door for an ISIS resurgence, targeting Israel first.

Wilson also pointed to broader geopolitical consequences, noting the strikes empower Iran and bolster Russia's presence in Syria. "Efforts should be made to expel [Vladimir Putin's forces], not to create destabilization," he said, asserting that Moscow uses its Syrian bases to project naval power across Africa and the Mediterranean.

"What is being done is actually beneficial to Iran. The more destabilization, the greater opportunity Iran has to destabilize other countries, whether it be further destabilization of Iraq, and then also it plays into the hands of war criminal Putin." 

The last Israeli strike on Syria was Wednesday, but they have not agreed to a ceasefire. 

This week, Israel's national security minister Ben Gvir said Israel must "eliminate" al-Sharaa. 

On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the nation struck to defend Druze minority communities in Syria, fearing the Syrian leadership would soon strike Israelis. 

"I did not trust Assad the father, nor Assad the son, and I certainly do not trust a leader like Julani," he said, referring to al-Sharaa by his former name. 

ISRAEL-IRAN WAR DIVIDES DEMOCRATS, BUT TRUMP'S DIPLOMACY ALSO SPLITTING REPUBLICANS

He claimed al-Sharaa "relies on jihadist groups that he operates against minorities in Syria, and tomorrow he will operate them against Israeli communities in the Golan Heights. 

"The moment we understood that the Syrian regime was behind the attacks and a partner in the massacre of the Druze — we acted against them with full force." The Druze community also has a sizable population in Israel. 

Wilson called the assertion "totally contrived and misunderstood." 

"It's so sad to me that they're taking the eye off the enemy. The enemy is Khamenei and the enemy is the head of the snake. It is not Damascus. The head of the snake is Tehran."

"They're opening the door for Tehran to rebuild Hamas to rebuild Hezbollah, to replenish and they already have the Houthis. So, it's just crazy. And again, it's suicidal. If you can't figure out who your enemy is, then you're opening the door for massive loss of life within Israel itself."

Syria's leader accused Israel of sowing discord by striking in defense of the Druze, who were involved in deadly sectarian clashes that threaten the nation's fragile unity. 

Washington is also intensifying pressure for de-escalation.

The Trump administration has formally urged Israel to halt its strikes and pursue direct talks with Damascus. Special U.S. envoy Tom Barrack reportedly made several calls to Prime Minister Netanyahu's adviser, Ron Dermer, pressing for restraint. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the strikes as a "troubling and horrifying situation," adding that the U.S. is "very concerned" and wants the fighting to stop.

The Israeli defense ministry could not be reached for comment.

Fierce fighting reignited in the Druze-dominated areas of southern Syria on Friday after tens of thousands of Bedouin tribesmen across the country mobilized to crush Druze rebels.

After days of fierce fighting, the Syrian government withdrew from the Druze stronghold of Suwayda after announcing a ceasefire. The Druze Suwayda Military Council was successful in the first round of fighting, backed by heavy Israeli airstrikes that devastated government convoys and hit government buildings in Damascus. Shortly after the government withdrew, however, dozens of allied Bedouin tribes announced a general mobilization across Syria, sending tens of thousands of fighters to take the south.

The fighting in southern Syria began on Sunday after tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between Druze and local Bedouins. The Bedouins are loyal to the government but ostensibly mobilized independently. Druze sources suspect that the mobilization was ordered or carried out with the tacit blessing of Damascus, with some suggesting that the Bedouin forces include some government troops.

Pro-government sources accused Druze militants of carrying out massacres and other atrocities against Bedouin civilians.

Bedouin commanders argued that they were not bound by the Wednesday ceasefire, which was only agreed upon by the government. Bedouin militants launched a major offensive beginning Thursday evening, pushing Druze forces back. Reports suggested that Israel launched airstrikes in support of its Druze allies, though the Israeli military did not confirm.

In a marked turnaround from Thursday, Israel said it agreed to allow Syrian government forces into the Suwayda region for the next two days to quell the renewed fighting.

“In light of the ongoing instability in southwest Syria, Israel has agreed to allow limited entry of the [Syrian] internal security forces into Suwayda district for the next 48 hours,” an Israeli official who declined to be named told reporters, according to the Times of Israel.

Pro-government sources claimed that the leader of the SMC, Hikmat al Hijri, was requesting that Damascus send its forces to Suwayda to stop the fighting.

As of Friday afternoon, local time, geolocated videos showed Bedouin forces fighting with the SMC in towns north of Suwayda city.

The scale of the Bedouin army has strained the tribes' logistics. Videos showed gunmen traveling to fighting areas in buses and being loaded into the back of a semi-trailer truck.

Though the Bedouin tribal army lacks the discipline and heavy weaponry of the government, the sheer number of fighters could overwhelm the Druze enclave. Videos showed dozens of militants taking part in assaults on Druze positions.

The lack of discipline of the Arab tribal army, motivated by tales of atrocities committed against their kinsmen, raises the risks of even worse atrocities than those that consumed the area earlier this week.

The local Christian community also fears atrocities from the invading tribal army. The representative of the Greek Catholic Church in Suwayda, Father Toni Butros, proclaimed his support for the Druze amid the struggle.

“We have not left our homeland,” he said. “As Christians, we stand with our Druze brothers and sisters against these terrorist attacks.”

The fighting in the south is the worst violence to engulf Syria since the end of the civil war on Dec. 8, 2024, surpassing the sectarian violence seen between government forces and Alawites along Syria's coast. Casualty estimates are difficult to calculate due to the chaotic nature of the fighting and a blackout in Suwayda, but confirmed deaths are in the several hundreds. The new Bedouin invasion is likely to further boost the death toll.

The Druze have been able to hold their own so far, boosted by support from Israel, which has a large, loyal Druze community.

Israel's intervention saw a rare rift between Jerusalem and Washington, with the United States denouncing Israel's airstrikes on Thursday. The Trump administration has thrown in its lot with the new government, led by former Islamic State group lieutenant and head of al Qaida in Syria, Ahmed al Sharaa, hoping to bring peace to the country, which experienced the second bloodiest war of the 21st century.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, but a new survey shows that Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy.

About two-thirds of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most — about 6 in 10 — think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people. About half say it will do more harm than good for middle-class people and people like them. 




Republicans have already begun airing advertisements framing the legislation as a tax cut for all Americans, highlighting new deductions on tips and overtime income. But Democrats have been making the case that the wealthiest Americans will benefit from the legislation, citing cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.

The new poll indicates that Republicans still have persuading to do. The high price tag may also be turning off some Americans. Trump's approval rating on government spending has fallen since the spring, according to the new survey, and about 6 in 10 U.S. adults across the political spectrum think the government is spending “too much.”




Most people have heard at least something about the new law, according to the poll, which found that about two-thirds of U.S. adults have heard or read “a lot” or “some” about it.

Those who know something about the legislation are more likely to believe it favors the wealthy, compared with people who have heard “only a little” or “nothing at all.” 

Anaiah Barrow, a 25-year-old single mom from North Carolina who doesn't identify with a political party, said she's concerned that the new law will hurt caregivers like her. Barrow -- who's juggling a job, taking care of two young children and pursuing a degree -- is concerned about losing access to day care and food stamps. 

“It has a really big effect,” Barrow said of the recently passed legislation, which she has learned about on TikTok. “It may not be as a big now, but in the long run it's going to have that effect -- it's going to hit bad.”

Even many Republicans agree that the wealthy are likely to benefit from the tax and spending law. About half say the law will do more to help the wealthy. A similar percentage say this about middle-class people, while about 4 in 10 Republicans think it will do more to help than hurt low-income people.

Lori Nichols, a 51-year-old caregiver for her elderly mother in Illinois, said the legislation has “very little for the older people and people that are on disability.” Although Nichols is a Republican, she said she didn't vote in the 2024 presidential election and voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. 

“As far as the tax part goes, it seems to me like (Trump's) just making the rich richer,” Nichols said.

Despite the overall sense that wealthy people will be the primary beneficiaries, Democrats and independents are much likelier than Republicans to think the law could harm them personally.

Nathan Hay, a shift service manager at an international dealership that repairs trucks, said he thinks lower-income people might see a “slight increase” in taxes but still supports the bill. “Personally, it's not helping me a ton,” Hay said, but he believes it will help small businesses, which have been a staple in his own life and his family's.

About half of Republicans expect the legislation to do more to help “people like you,” compared with about 2 in 10 independents and just 6% of Democrats.

“I'm not a tax accountant, but it sounds as if it would be more beneficial to (people) in the higher tax level,” said Republican Geraldine Putnam, 87, a Trump voter who lives in the rural south. 

“It's not that I would want to take away the incentive to become more wealthy — that's the American dream,” Putnam said. 

But she also thinks she'll end up paying more in taxes. “What he's doing I'm sure he thinks is correct,” she said of Trump. “It's just the extreme method that he's using.”

The law's hefty price tag may be factoring into some Americans' assessments of the law. The poll found they are less likely to approve of how Trump is handling government spending since the spring.

Just 38% of Americans approve of how Donald Trump is handling government spending, compared with 46% in an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.

Republicans are less likely to say the government is spending “too much” than they were in March 2023, when Joe Biden was president, but about 6 in 10 still think the government is overspending. A similar share of Democrats say the same thing.

Putnam, now a retiree, took issue with Trump's cuts in federal workers, even though she says she approves of being able to “trim off people who aren't really doing their jobs.” 

The way she sees it, Trump drew attention to people abusing social services, then “fires the people in the office” that are investigating that very fraud and abuse. “What's the sense in that?” she asked.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,437 adults was conducted July 10-14, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has looked to the marble finishes and hefty price tag of the Federal Reserve headquarters to claim grounds to fire Chair Jerome Powell, with whom he has tussled for years over interest rates. But the extensive use of marble in the building is, at least in part, the result of policies backed by Trump himself.

As the Fed moved forward with plans to renovate its Great Depression-era headquarters in Washington during Trump's first term, it faced concerns in 2020 during a vetting process involving Trump appointees, who called for more “white Georgia marble” for the facade of building.

The Fed's architects said the central bank had wanted glass walls to reflect the Fed as a transparent institution, but three Trump appointees to a local commission felt marble best fit the building's historic character. Marble was added as a result, according to the minutes of the Commission of Fine Arts, which advises the federal government on architecture.

The marble does not explain the roughly $600 million in cost overruns for the Fed headquarters and another nearby office building, now budgeted to cost $2.5 billion, which also includes the addition of an underground parking garage and new glass atria in the building's courtyards. But the roots of its extensive use further muddies the White House's attempts to use the renovation to paint the central banker as a profligate spender as a possible pretext to removing him.

“I wouldn't be surprised if the result costs more” because of the added marble, said Alex Krieger, a Harvard University emeritus professor who was a member of the commission and participated in hearings on the Fed's proposal.




Russ Vought, Trump's top budget adviser, cited “premium marble” in a letter to Powell last week as an example of the “ostentatious overhaul.”

In a response late Thursday, Powell wrote that the project would “use new domestic marble” for several reasons, including “to address concerns raised by external review agencies.” 

The National Capital Planning Commission, which also reviewed and approved the Fed renovation project, has started an inquiry into how Powell oversaw the updates.

“The Federal Reserve's extravagant multi-billion dollar renovation happened on the watch of the Fed's leadership, and the Fed's leadership needs to own up for this mismanagement of taxpayer dollars – as well as its botched coverup job,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. A Fed spokesperson declined to comment.

There is an uncomfortable possibility that the fate of the U.S. central bank and its foundational role in the economy hinges on a dispute about renovation costs and architecture, one that could lead a broader legal battle as to whether Trump can dismiss a Fed chair he dislikes after the Supreme Court in May described the institution as having protections against an abrupt firing.

Trump, who has redecorated the Oval Office in gold leaf, has argued that inflation is not a concern, so the Fed can dramatically slash its rate to encourage more borrowing. But Powell and other Fed committee members are waiting to see whether Trump's tariffs lift inflation, which higher interest rates could help blunt.

The Fed chair pushed back against criticism during a June congressional hearing that the renovation was lavish by saying some features were removed due to cost, leading the White House to speculate as to whether Powell deceived lawmakers or made changes to the renovation plans without getting additional approvals. At that hearing, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., also cited “white marble” as an example of extravagance.

James Blair, a White House deputy chief of staff who was recently added to the planning commission, said Wednesday that he would send a letter to the Fed requesting any revisions to the project. His goal is to see whether Powell was accurate in his congressional testimony.

“He's either telling the truth or he isn't,” Blair told The Associated Press. “If he's telling the truth, he can prove it by just submitting all the plans and revisions.”

Trump said Wednesday that he's “highly unlikely” to try to fire Powell unless there was what he deemed as “fraud.”

The attempt to remove Powell before his May 2026 term as chair ends could unleash a devastating financial blowback, as financial markets expect the Fed, with its mission of stabilizing prices and maximizing employment, to be free of White House politicking. The perception that the central bank would use its powers to serve Trump's political ends could lead to higher interest rates on the U.S. debt and mortgages, instead of the declines being promised by the president.

The 115-year old Commission of Fine Arts reviewed the plans for the renovation three times in 2020.

Duncan Stroik, who was appointed to the commission in 2019 during Trump's first term, “proposed an amendment requesting that the next submission include an alternative design in white Georgia marble, the same material used for the five existing buildings along the north side of Constitution Avenue,” the minutes of a Jan. 16, 2020, meeting said.

Stroik “does not think the proposed additions defer to the historic buildings as great marble edifices on an important street,” the minutes added.

Stroik's amendment was voted down, but the commission didn't fully endorse the Fed's plans. The architects presented new plans in May 2020, though those didn't appear to satisfy Trump's appointees.

Some commissioners “continued to object to the addition as a glass box that is reminiscent of a commercial office building, glowing at night, that would present an unacceptable contrast to the solid masonry architecture of the historic building in its monumental context,” the commission wrote in a May 2020 letter to a Fed official.

By July 2020, however, the Fed's architects came back with a new proposal, which included “panels of white Georgia marble” which would be used for the “base, cornice, and other details, consistent with the historic building,” the commission's minutes said.

Stroik, now a professor of architecture at the University of Notre Dame, said in an interview that “stone buildings don't necessarily have to cost a fortune.” But he acknowledged that the commission had not discussed expenses, which has not been part of its mission.

“If they wanted to play the cost game, you do a marble facade and you do the glass facade and you compare the cost,” Stroik said. “And you know, they never did that.”

Krieger, the former commission member, noted that the body's discussions became much more contentious after the Trump administration removed several members and replaced them with Stroik and James McCrery, a professor at Catholic University, whom he said often echoed the sentiments in a then- draft executive order from Trump that extolled classical architecture.

“At the time, it was a fierce battle over how literal to the original design should the renovations be,” Krieger said. “Normally, that attitude does add costs to the construction project.” McCrery declined to comment.

Trump issued the executive order in December 2020, which criticized modernist architecture and expressed a preference for “beautiful” classical buildings with more traditional designs. Biden revoked the order, and Trump reissued it the first day of his second term.

The commission did not fully approve the Fed's project until September 2021, after McCrery and another Trump appointee, Justin Shubow, had been removed by then President Joe Biden.

Millions of gun owners can breathe a sigh of relief today after the Justice Department yanked a Biden-era order that could have criminalized some 20 million owners of the popular AR-style “pistol.”

Last night, the department agreed to give up fighting a lawsuit filed by one of those 20 million and the Second Amendment advocacy group, Firearms Policy Center, in a major win for plinkers and hunters.

“The government is finally retreating from the Biden Administration's patently unlawful effort to turn millions of peaceable people into felons by decree,” said FPC Action Foundation President Cody J. Wisniewski, an attorney for the challengers. “This horrible rule was a perversion of our system of limited government, so we're glad to see this case resolved in favor of liberty and the rule of law.”

“The dismissal of this appeal should be the final nail in the coffin of this unconstitutional Biden ATF assault on gun owners.” – FPC President Brandon Combs https://t.co/n1Bm10VRS9 pic.twitter.com/0CdmaFNSge

At issue was the Biden administration's order to repeal a decadelong allowance of pistol braces on short-barreled AR-style firearms. Instead, Biden's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives moved to require a $200 tax and registration. While it waived the tax for those who complied, the rest — and it was a majority — would face criminal charges.

There are some 40 million pistol braces in use.

The order has been hung up in several courts, and the Justice Department's move appears to have ended that, making them OK to own and use.

“Today is a great day for freedom and the American people,” said Firearms Policy Coalition President Brandon Combs.

He added, “The dismissal of this appeal should be the final nail in the coffin of this unconstitutional Biden ATF assault on gun owners. As we explained in the case filings, braced pistols are not ‘short-barreled rifles.' But either way, they are unquestionably arms protected under the Second Amendment. We are thrilled to have secured this important win for liberty and excited to take on even more unconstitutional laws so you can exercise your rights when, where, and how you choose.”

            Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials will be given access to the personal data of the nation's 79 million Medicaid enrollees, including home addresses and ethnicities, to track down immigrants who may not be living legally in the United States, according to an agreement obtained by The Associated Press.
    


            The information will give ICE officials the ability to find “the location of aliens” across the country, says the agreement signed Monday between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement has not been announced publicly.
    


            The extraordinary disclosure of millions of such personal health data to deportation officials is the latest escalation in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has repeatedly tested legal boundaries in its effort to arrest 3,000 people daily.
    


            Lawmakers and some CMS officials have challenged the legality of deportation officials' access to some states' Medicaid enrollee data. It's a move, first reported by the AP last month, that Health and Human Services officials said was aimed at rooting out people enrolled in the program improperly.
    


            But the latest data-sharing agreement makes clear what ICE officials intend to do with the health data.
    


            “ICE will use the CMS data to allow ICE to receive identity and location information on aliens identified by ICE,” the agreement says.
    


            Such disclosures, even if not acted upon, could cause widespread alarm among people seeking emergency medical help for themselves or their children. Other efforts to crack down on illegal immigration have made schools, churches, courthouses and other everyday places feel perilous to immigrants and even US citizens who fear getting caught up in a raid.
    


            HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon would not respond to the latest agreement. It is unclear, though, whether Homeland Security has yet accessed the information. The department's spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said in an emailed statement that the two agencies “are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.”
    


            The database will reveal to ICE officials the names, addresses, birth dates, ethnic and racial information, as well as Social Security numbers for all people enrolled in Medicaid. The state and federally funded program provides health care coverage program for the poorest of people, including millions of children.
    


            The agreement does not allow ICE officials to download the data. Instead, they will be allowed to access it for a limited period from 9am to 5pm, Monday through Friday, until September 9.

            “They are trying to turn us into immigration agents,” said a CMS official did not have permission to speak to the media and insisted on anonymity.
    


            Immigrants who are not living in the US legally, as well as some lawfully present immigrants, are not allowed to enroll in the Medicaid program that provides nearly-free coverage for health services. Medicaid is a jointly funded program between states and the federal government.
    


            But federal law requires all states to offer emergency Medicaid, a temporary coverage that pays only for lifesaving services in emergency rooms to anyone, including non-US citizens. Emergency Medicaid is often used by immigrants, including those who are lawfully present and those who are not.
    


            Many people sign up for emergency Medicaid in their most desperate moments, said Hannah Katch, a previous adviser at CMS during the Biden administration.
    


            “It's unthinkable that CMS would violate the trust of Medicaid enrollees in this way,” Katch said. She said the personally identifiable information of enrollees has not been historically shared outside of the agency unless for law enforcement purposes to investigate waste, fraud or abuse of the program.
    


            Trump officials last month demanded that the federal health agency's staffers release personally identifiable information on millions of Medicaid enrollees from seven states that permit non-US citizens to enroll in their full Medicaid programs.
    


            The states launched these programs during the Biden administration and said they would not bill the federal government to cover the health care costs of those immigrants. All the states — California, New York, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Minnesota and Colorado — have Democratic governors.
    


            That data sharing with DHS officials prompted widespread backlash from lawmakers and governors. Twenty states have since sued over the move, alleging it violated federal health privacy laws.
    


            CMS officials previously fought and failed to stop the data sharing that is now at the center of the lawsuits. On Monday, CMS officials were once again debating whether they should provide DHS access, citing concerns about the ongoing litigation.

            In an email chain obtained by the AP called “Hold DHS Access — URGENT,” CMS chief legal officer Rujul H. Desai said they should first ask the Department of Justice to appeal to the White House directly for a “pause” on the information sharing. In a response the next day, HHS lawyer Lena Amanti Yueh said that the Justice Department was “comfortable with CMS proceeding with providing DHS access.”
    


            Dozens of members of Congress, including Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, sent letters last month to DHS and HHS officials demanding that the information-sharing stop.
    


            “The massive transfer of the personal data of millions of Medicaid recipients should alarm every American. This massive violation of our privacy laws must be halted immediately,” Schiff said in response to AP's description of the new, expanded agreement. “It will harm families across the nation and only cause more citizens to forego lifesaving access to health care.”
    


            The new agreement makes clear that DHS will use the data to identify, for deportation purposes, people who in the country illegally. But HHS officials have repeatedly maintained that it would be used primarily as a cost-saving measure, to investigate whether non-US citizens were improperly accessing Medicaid benefits.
    


            “HHS acted entirely within its legal authority – and in full compliance with all applicable laws – to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them,” Nixon said in a statement responding to the lawsuits last month.

Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin has exclusive insights into I.C.E. agents chaotic chase in Sacramento on Special Report.

Despite pushback from California officials to federal immigration enforcement, Border Patrol in Sacramento arrested 11 illegal migrants during a tense raid at a Home Depot parking lot on Thursday — including one man with 67 prior jail bookings in California since 1986 and a prior fentanyl trafficking conviction.

Fox News was on scene as the migrants scattered in all directions when federal agents moved in to make arrests in the sanctuary city.

That triggered multiple foot chases and several physical encounters between masked agents and fleeing migrants.

In one foot pursuit, agents chased a man who they say slashed the tire of a law enforcement vehicle. The man claimed to be a U.S. citizen.

Agents eventually maced the man in the face before arresting him and taking him into custody. His wife shouted at agents throughout the incident, insisting he is a U.S. citizen.

Border Patrol agents were forced to drive the damaged vehicle away on its rims.

Gregory Bovino, U.S. Border Patrol chief for the El Centro Sector, said his agency will continue prioritizing the removal of criminal illegal immigrants.

"There is no sanctuary city, Sacramento is not a sanctuary city, the state of California is not a sanctuary state, there is no sanctuary anywhere," Bovino said. "We'll be here, you'll probably see us in many other locations as well. We're here to stay, we're not going anywhere. We're going to effect this mission and secure the homeland."

The migrant with 67 prior jail bookings is Mexican national Javier Dimas-Alcantara, who is an aggravated felon with convictions and charges spanning decades.

His criminal history includes multiple instances of transporting and selling narcotics or controlled substances, felony burglary, possession of a controlled narcotic with intent to sell, carrying a loaded firearm in public and multiple felony-level marijuana possession charges for sale.

He's also been arrested for illegal entry, revocation of probation due to reoffending, multiple instances of providing false identification to law enforcement, multiple cases of narcotic possession and being under the influence of a controlled substance.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin slammed the defenders of sanctuary policies. 

"Dimas has been convicted of a myriad of offenses — you would not want this man to be your neighbor and yet politicians like [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom defend criminals who terrorize American communities and demonize law enforcement who defend those same communities," McLaughlin said.

"He and every other sanctuary politician should be thanking CBP for getting this scum out of American communities instead of obstructing federal law enforcement at every possible turn." 

McLaughlin said that the Trump administration has been given a clear mandate by the American people to get violent illegal aliens off the streets and out of the country.

The other apprehended migrants included a previously deported Guatemalan aggravated felon and a previously deported Mexican migrant with a prior arrest for driving without a license. 

Another detainee is a Guatemalan migrant who had a voluntary return removal in 2009 with prior arrests for trespassing and failure to provide ID.

Their names have not been released yet.

Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Nancy Larson joins ‘The Story' to discuss the ongoing manhunt for a suspect involved in the ICE agents' ambush in Alvarado, Texas earlier this month.

EXCLUSIVE: A social media account that is believed to belong to anti-ICE Texas attack suspect Benjamin Song, 32, who was captured Tuesday evening, contains anti-Israel, anti-police and anti-Trump rhetoric, according to posts reviewed and verified by Fox News Digital.

Song was arrested by the FBI Dallas Field Office after the FBI offered a $25,000 reward for his capture regarding the attempted murder of federal officers and firearms crimes in an Independence Day riot at the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas. 

A local police officer is now recovering after being shot in the neck, and 11 other individuals are also facing charges, including 10 others for the aforementioned charges. 

"Do you want to end mass shooting? Abolish the police," he posted in June 2022 under the X handle, BubbleBreakBS.

Fox News Digital was able to confirm that the "BubbleBreakBS" account belonged to Song after reviewing several social media posts, including a 2019 post when he thanked "Behind the Masks," a Facebook group that was dedicated to telling stories of protesters in the Free Hong Kong Movement, for telling his story, referring to their post as "my story."

The link that the account shared highlighted how "Ben Song, a 26-year-old Uber driver from Arlington,Texas who has been a political activist since he was 13, was moved by Hong Kong's fight for freedom and flew from the US to show his support."

The post went on to describe Song as "half Korean and half Japanese" and said he "gained many unforgettable moments during his hands-on participation in the movement." BubbleBreakBS also posted out a couple of posts days later that appeared to link to a podcast "episode" on YouTube that he was featured in. The X posts, which included several pro-Hong Kong hashtags in light of the uprising against the CCP, mentioned Song's name. However, the YouTube channel appears to be private, and Fox News Digital could not access them.

Song, a former U.S. Marine Corps reservist, appears to have been more conservative-leaning in his early college days, listing the College Republicans and martial arts clubs at the University of Texas at Arlington on his LinkedIn profile. He also listed being a contributor to a "Conservative Camp" blog for 11 months. However, during the last several years, his social media account has been littered with rhetoric attacking law enforcement, Republicans, President Donald Trump, Israel, Christians and other radical views.

WHO IS BENJAMIN SONG? NEW DETAILS EMERGE ABOUT ANTI-ICE SUSPECT CAPTURED AFTER MAJOR TEXAS MANHUNT

In June 2020, Song replied to a post from Trump in which the president wrote, "Biden wants to Defund the Police!", and Song replied, "Defund the Police! Defund the Baby Bunker B--ch!," a Trump nickname that the resistance movement used frequently online in 2020. In a 2022 post, Song called Trump "stupid as hell" and "easily controlled."

"Really f---ed to ‘both sides' this right now. All of Palestine is fighting for its life at this moment. The Joint Command says it had actionable intelligence that Netanyahu was going to extinguish Gaza soon. This is a death camp breakout. This is the Warsaw Uprising," he said on Oct. 10, 2023, just three days after the Hamas attack on Israel. "Sick."

"Hitler is scared now. Little baby Hitler-Netanyahu doesn't want to be bullied for his heinous war crimes," he wrote on Oct. 17, 2023. 

"Israel is a vicious apartheid colony committing genocide every day. Zionism is racism. Zionism is white settler colonialism. Move Israel to Sardinia or Sicily or Goteland," he posted in March 2022.

"ACAB because they are class traitors and white supremacist btw," he posted about police, using the "All cops are bastards" acronym in June 2021. "There is no world where they ‘hold each other accountable.' Cops were created by the upper class for the upper class. They protect property and keep the poor in line. They have no other purpose."

"Landlords are bad just like ACAB. It doesn't matter what individual actions there are, the institution is bad. There are no good slave owners," he said in June 2021.

"Conservatives believe in prejudice + power when it affects them (in their imagination)," he posted in July 2021.

"I've realized this is all fascist violence," he posted in March 2021. "The conservatives cry mental health, the liberal cry gun control. But every time it's white men killing people because they are black, Asian, women. This is the rising force of fascism within the neoliberal order."

While Song's social media profile was littered with anti-GOP posts, he also attacked some Democratic leaders, like former President Joe Biden, failed Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and others.

"Joe Biden is a racist. He is a sex offender. He is a corrupt puppet. His policies are s---. He engenders no hope or excitement amongst those who need it…" Song said in June 2020.

"I used to support [Andrew] Yang, even though he had some lilly livered responses when I met him in Texas. Now he's gone full fascistic bootlicker. He will lose thankfully. A new wave movement has moved against fascism. Jan 6th was the high water mark," he wrote in May 2021. 

"Beto is a dangerous Billionaire family, racist and anti-immigrant far right fascist," he said in February 2022.

In addition to Song's X handle, Fox News Digital was able to verify through online records and Instagram videos that Song was using the same martial arts studio that lists his mom as a "program director" and "owner" for filming different tactical exercises and self-defense training in the years before the attempted murder charges. 

It is unclear whether the groups of people with blurred-out faces in the social media posts were part of the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club (EFJBGC), a left-wing "anti-fascist," or Antifa, gun group that Song is allegedly tied to. 

A Fox News Digital review revealed that Song's X account tagged the EFJBGC X handle several times over multiple years. The group did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

An archived version of EFJBGC's X account also references Song while promoting a GoFundMe to help him pay for legal services after he was arrested in August 2020. The post, which claims that Song was a "member" of the "Socialist Rifle Association," goes on to say he was "being charged with two bullsh—felonies." The GoFundMe verified multiple background details Fox News Digital found while digging through his X account, including how he "practiced activism from Hong Kong to San Francisco…"

The GoFundMe, which lists Song as a "beneficiary" of more than $3,000 in donations, also says Song was a "proud member of the Black Lives Matter group ‘We Take The Streets' and that he was a "lifelong activist for the 1st Amendment, 2nd Amendment, drug reform, police brutality, and human rights." The page also said that Song was being "charged with (2) 1st degree felonies because he was exercising his 2nd Amendment right to open carry when they were assaulted and arrested."

Song's X account referenced the arrest during that same month and tagged multiple lawyers seeking help for his defense, including controversial civil rights attorney Ben Crump, writing to him that he was "facing absolutely ridiculous but quite expensive charges." Fox News Digital could not confirm whether Crump saw the messages or helped represent Song.

BubbleBreakBS account posted on then-Twitter in May 2021 that he was "setting up an airsoft team for training and gaming." 

The Telegram moniker in the link and the X handle match an Instagram account that posted several screenshots of BubbleBreakBS posts and videos showing the same painted walls and designs as the backdrop in footage from the archived website of the martial arts studio that Song's mom owns. The Instagram account's first post was also just days after BubbleBreakBS announced that the account was being created.

Song's mom, Hope, is the program director of an Arlington, Texas, martial arts studio called Sentinel Martial Arts. An archived webpage of her bio says she is a 4th-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and "oversees the implementation of all in-house and off-site programming," which includes "seminars and classes at local learning centers, schools, churches, camps and clubs; and coordination of special events, festivals, demonstrations and performances."

Older archives of the website from 2021-2023 lists Song's mom as an "owner" of the studio. Fox News Digital could not confirm whether Song's mom was aware the studio was being used for recording tactical exercises. 

Song's mom nor the martial arts studio have been accused of any misconduct in connection with Song's apparent use of the studio premises.

The alleged attack by the younger Song, who is innocent until proven guilty, came as the Department of Homeland Security is sounding the alarm on assaults on ICE agents, which DHS says have increased by 830% from last year.

"This new data reflects the violence against our law enforcement in cities across the country in the last few weeks. Politicians across the country, regardless of political stripe, must condemn this," DHS Secretary Kristi Noem posted to X on Tuesday.

"The FBI has worked tirelessly to arrest everyone associated with the shooting at the Prairieland Detention Center," FBI Dallas Field Office Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock said after Song was captured Tuesday afternoon. "We would like to thank all the entities that publicized this case and assisted in our efforts to successfully locate Benjamin Song." 

Song is being held on a $15 million bond at the Johnson County Jail and facing a slew of additional charges, including aggravated assault on a public servant, aiding terrorism and engaging in organized crime, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.

In addition to Song, a recent shooting at a Border Patrol annex facility in McAllen, Texas, resulted in injuries to a local officer and Border Patrol personnel, in addition to the gunman being killed.

"Our agents are never gonna be afraid. They know the job that they signed up for. But what they don't appreciate, what we don't want is targeting," National Border Patrol Council President Paul Perez told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. 

Fox News Digital reached out to Song, Song's mom, the Sentinel Martial Arts studio, EFJBGC, Ben Crump, and an individual who appeared to be tied to the suspect through left-wing online activism.

"The FBI has worked tirelessly to arrest everyone associated with the shooting at the Prairieland Detention Center," FBI Dallas Field Office Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock said after Song was captured Tuesday afternoon. "We would like to thank all the entities that publicized this case and assisted in our efforts to successfully locate Benjamin Song." 

Song is being held on a $15 million bond at the Johnson County Jail and facing a slew of additional charges, including aggravated assault on a public servant, aiding terrorism and engaging in organized crime, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.

In addition to Song, a recent shooting at a Border Patrol annex facility in McAllen, Texas, resulted in injuries to a local officer and Border Patrol personnel, in addition to the gunman being killed.

"Our agents are never gonna be afraid. They know the job that they signed up for. But what they don't appreciate, what we don't want is targeting," National Border Patrol Council President Paul Perez told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. 

Fox News Digital reached out to Song, Song's mom, the Sentinel Martial Arts studio, EFJBGC, Ben Crump, and an individual who appeared to be tied to the suspect through left-wing online activism.

            After decades largely cut off from the world, Angola's natural wonders are again ready for discovery. The southern African country is twice the size of Texas, and the roads and accommodation that will allow more tourists to explore the interior are just getting into place.
    


            But even a short drive from the capital city Luanda takes you to beaches, cliffs and national parks where you'll often feel like the only visitor there.
    


            Much of Luanda's growth has pushed to the south. The posh, Brazilian-style suburb of Talatona sprawls with designer shops and spas. Chinese companies built geometrically planned neighborhoods in nearby Kilamba, with identical apartment blocks evenly spaced apart.
    


            But down the coast, the urban landscape suddenly ends and, about an hour later, opens up to a lunar landscape on the beach. Miradoura da Lua, or the Viewpoint of the Moon, is a region where oceanside cliffs have over eons worn away to reveal wavy rock formations underneath. It's like a landscape of stalagmites, but on a tropical beach instead of in a cave. The highest points nearest the cliffs are tinted with red earth, shifting through shades of white and gray to the blue waters of the Atlantic.
    


            There's a small fee to enter the best viewing area, which has a raised viewing deck over a cafe and a small craft market. The cafe has a Biblioteca Fresca, or a Cool Library. Like a Free Little Library, it houses books, but is set inside a rebranded, busted refrigerator. If you donate a book, the cafe will give you a free drink.

            Just 15 kilometers (nine miles) down the coast is a gate to Quiçama National Park. Five decades of war, from a 1950s rebellion against colonial rule to the 1990s civil conflict, decimated the wildlife. Thanks to steady efforts to repopulate the park, giraffes, elephants and other large animals once again roam — but don't expect the massive herds famous in better-known safari destinations.
    


            “The combination of untouched nature, easy access and an authentic wildlife experience makes Quiçama an appealing destination,” said Lourena Lourenço Panzo, a guide from Lelutour, one of the new companies that has sprung up to cater to overseas travelers.
    


            The park covers three million acres, and the interior is far less accessible. Animals and people live in a different balance than in Africa's better-known parks. During the war years, people hunted the animals because they needed the meat to survive. In some cases, people moved onto park lands, because the boundaries weren't marked, or because landmines covered so much of the country. It's only in recent years that efforts have really taken off to explain to communities how they can benefit from tourism and conservation efforts.
    


            That also means that when you do spot animals, you'll probably get to experience the sighting alone, without the hordes of safari trucks that can fill the famous parks in East and Southern Africa.

            A short drive farther south, the long, golden beaches at Cabo Ledo are the new secret surf spot. They were never secret to Feliesiano Dinis Muteca, who's been surfing there since he was 10. Now 22, he's a certified instructor at the beach now known simply as Praia dos Surfistas.
    


            “Many foreigners come here to learn from us. We give lessons to everyone,” he said. “We have other colleagues who also make cabanas and help customers take things from the park to the beach.”
    


            Angola now has an accreditation body for instructors like Muteca. And now that the country has removed visa requirements for dozens of countries, more surfers are discovering these beaches, where Muteca and his friends have set up simple cabanas on the water. The nearby Carpe Diem Resort offers accommodation with a bar and restaurant. It also operates a larger resort on a nearby beach with cabins and sweeping ocean views from their bar and daybeds.
    


            More land is already being cleared to expand the tourism options around Cabo Ledo, so the relative isolation may not last.
    


            Deeper in the interior, in Malanje province, towering stone monoliths jut out of the highlands at Pungo Andongo. The Pedras Negras, or Black Rocks, are famed for their natural beauty, but also as one of the last holdouts against Portuguese colonizers in the 1600s. Queen Nzinga ruled this area, and led fierce resistance against the Europeans as the slave trade was expanding. Interest in her story has grown in recent years, with a monument in a Luanda plaza and a Netflix documentary about her life.
    


            The rocks formed a natural protection for the population, though ultimately that wasn't enough to keep the Portuguese out. Footprints in the rocks are said to belong to the queen, a dramatic testament to her power.
    


            From there it's a short journey to Kalandula Falls, one of the biggest in Africa. The falls also have a spiritual significance, made more powerful by their remoteness. During the wet season, the mist billows from the basin, though the flow is strong most of the year.

            It's hard to say “intrepid traveler” without irony, but that's literally what you need to be to explore Angola's interior. Without many services or infrastructure, traveling to Angola's provinces means seeing places that few people alive have explored. That's changing, with tour companies starting to offer a variety of overland packages. Luxury travel companies like Roads & Kingdoms are offering gourmet food tours of the interior, accompanied by a top Angolan chef.
    


            “When people envision tourism in Africa, thoughts tend to go towards safaris and game hunting and animals in plains,” said writer Claudio Silva, who led R&K's first Angolan tour. “Very little thought is given to the deep cultural heritage of our countries, or the food we eat, or our dreams and aspirations.”
    


            Once abandoned farmlands are being revived, including new winemakers and restored coffee plantations. These organized trips also include stops in villages for goat roasted the traditional way over an open fire, and fresh produce that was almost impossible to grow even a decade ago.
    


            Vintage train operator Rovos Rail offers trips through the interior (think Orient Express stylings in the bush) that can run from the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam to Lobito, Angola. It also offers a shorter outing from Zambia to Lobito.
    


            Iona National Park is part of a vast transfrontier park that connects Angola and Namibia, with landscapes from the Namib Desert to the Kunene River Delta. The first tented camp is expected to open to tourists later in 2025, said Pedro Monterroso, a park manager with African Parks, the nonprofit that Angola has contracted to manage Iona. Visitors can still travel there, but they have to be completely self-sufficient.
    


            “It's just that sense of vastness, the exclusivity, the impactful landscapes, because it has so many different landscapes that change every time you go over a ridge,” he said. “That's the feeling that you have in Iona, that you have the park to yourself. It's a different kind of experience, a different kind of connection with the environment, with the landscape, with nature.”

Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley, in a Fox News Digital interview, claims that Zohran Mamdani is ‘in that radical woke part' of the Democratic Party

FIRST ON FOX: Republicans aren't wasting an opportunity to make democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani a cudgel to bash Democrats across the country.

In the three weeks since his stunning victory in the New York City Democratic Party mayoral primary, Republicans have been relentless in trying to anchor Mamdani to Democrats who are running in competitive races in next year's midterms.

Among those leading the way in the messaging effort are the team at the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), which is the House GOP's campaign arm.

The NRCC on Friday launched ads aiming to tie three House Democrats in New York and one in neighboring New Jersey to Mamdani, the 33-year-old Ugandan-born state assemblyman from the New York City borough of Queens.

The digital ads target Democratic Reps. Tom Suozzi, Laura Gillen, and Josh Riley of New York and Nellie Pou of New Jersey. All four lawmakers represent competitive House districts.

The ads, which are backed by a modest buy, were shared first with Fox News Digital. 

Mamdani, who convincingly topped former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates last month to capture the New York City Democratic mayoral nomination and take a big step toward becoming the city's first Muslim and millennial mayor, is giving Republicans plenty of fodder.

He's proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) "tuition-free," freezing rents on municipal housing, offering "free childcare" for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores.

Also fueling the Republican attacks are recent news items that have gone viral. They include a 2020 photo Mamdani posted online that shows him flipping off a statue of Christopher Columbus, stories about comments Mamdani made last December when he said as mayor he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his recent comments in a cable news interview that "I have many critiques of capitalism."

"Dangerous Socialist Zohran Mamdani is the new face of Tom Suozzi, Laura Gillen, Josh Riley, and Nellie Pou's Democrat Party, and it's no coincidence. If Democrats had their way, Mamdani's pro-criminal, open-borders, anti-law enforcement, and antisemitic agenda would be the law of the land," NRCC spokeswoman Maureen O'Toole argued in a statement to Fox News.

Suozzi, who represents a district that's anchored just outside of New York City in suburban Long Island but includes a sliver of Queens, has said he "wholeheartedly" disagrees with parts of Mamdani's agenda.

Gillen, who represents a neighboring district just outside of New York City in suburban Long Island, has said that Mamdani is "too extreme" to lead the nation's most populous city.

Riley, who represents a suburban and rural district in New York State north of the city, has been criticized by the NRCC for not weighing in on Mamdani. 

The NRCC has also targeted Pou, who represents a district in the New Jersey suburbs of New York City, for failing to "call out" Mamdani.

Democrats question the effectiveness of the GOP push.

They argue that there's a world of difference between heavily blue New York City, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a roughly six-to-one margin, and some key battleground states and swing districts in the city's suburbs and elsewhere across the country.

Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, a Democrat, told reporters the day after Mamdani's victory that "I love New York, but it's a very liberal place, and I don't know that you can necessarily apply that to the rest of the country."

In the high-profile 2026 race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Republican candidate and former Sen. Scott Brown went up last week with a digital ad that edits a picture of Rep. Chris Pappas, the Democratic candidate in the race, alongside photos of Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive rock star who backed Mamdani.

Pappas, speaking with Fox News Digital last week, said, "Republicans have spent tens of millions of dollars running attack ads against me through the years trying to paint me as someone that I'm not."

"People know me. They know the work that I've been doing. They know that I'm one of the most bipartisan members of the House of Representatives because I believe in solving problems and getting things done," Pappas said. "I'm a New Hampshire Democrat. I'm proud of my track record in Congress."

The health care consequences of Trump's budget bill are already here.

We just got a preview of the likely consequences of the “big, beautiful bill” passed by Republicans in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump: Premiums on the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces are on track to increase 15 percent on average next year — a record-setting pace.

This comes from a new analysis of more than 100 health insurers selling plans to individuals on the ACA marketplaces that additionally found that plan premiums increases are twice that in 2025 and the highest single-year increase since 2018. According to the experts from KFF, a health policy think tank, one out of every four plans is raising its rates by 20 percent or more.

These rates are preliminary and will be finalized later this summer. Though the new rates were actually filed before the Republican “big, beautiful bill” passed in Congress earlier this month, KFF experts explain that the GOP's agenda is playing a role in these cost increases — and it may drive prices up even more in the future.

Here's what all of this means for you: If you buy insurance on your own through the ACA's marketplaces, your coverage may be a lot more expensive as soon as you sign up for coverage next year. If you're on Medicaid, the GOP's bill creates new work requirements that will take effect next year and could put your benefits at risk. And if you get insurance through your employer, your premiums are going to grow too if other people lose coverage, which is more likely to happen because of all of these changes. Let's break it down.

As Republicans were pulling together their budget bill, there was the clear question of what to do about enhanced ACA subsidies that have been in place since 2021, first authorized by the Democrats as part of their own budget reconciliation legislation. At the time, the enhanced subsidies both lowered costs for people already eligible for financial aid under the law and extended eligibility for financial assistance for the first time to more middle-class families. Marketplace enrollment nearly doubled from 2021 to 21 million in 2024 as a result.

But the enhanced subsidies were only authorized through 2025. Republicans, who had previously criticized the ACA for making health insurance unaffordable for the middle-class people who have now gained coverage through the expanded assistance, opted not to include an extension of the subsidies as part of their tax-and-spending bill. Instead, they chose to allow the subsidies to lapse, while slashing Medicaid spending over the next decade and providing an outsized tax cut for businesses and the wealthy.

It is possible that these subsidies could be saved if Democrats and some Republican lawmakers can band together to craft a bipartisan deal to maintain the subsidies later this year, but DC insiders are dubious that one can be struck.

If the subsidies do indeed end, they add more pain to the other regulatory changes that are coming to limit financial aid on the marketplaces. These combine to an estimated 5.1 million people who could become uninsured.

These consequences will have ripple effects: The people who drop coverage are projected to be healthier, because they are more likely to think they could live without health coverage, which leaves a sicker and costlier pool of patients in the marketplace.

Insurers are already pricing that shift in. According to the KFF analysis, health plans are citing the lapsed subsidies to explain the proposed rate increases, with the policy change contributing about 4 percent to the rate hike on average. The threat of tariffs from Trump has been cited for another 3 percent increase by some plans. The rest of the proposed rate hikes are attributed to the continued growth in the prices for medical services, which has been ongoing for decades.

And these increases may be only the beginning.

The Republican bill's changes to Medicaid don't take effect until the end of 2026, but they could also push premiums higher if millions of people lose coverage as expected. When people lose Medicaid, they are more likely to end up in the emergency room. That requires more costly care than they'd get if they were insured. Those increased costs to hospitals are passed on to insured patients when providers negotiate their payment rates with health insurance plans.

Whether patients will blame the GOP for these cost increases remains to be seen. But their wallets are already feeling the effects of the Republican budget bill.

July is a terrifying month for the Chinese Communist Party. Anniversaries in Hong Kong and Tibet highlight the weakness of authoritarian Chinese communism. Recent statements coming from Beijing on the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday are defensive to the point of sounding ridiculous: According to the Chinese government, “The Dalai Lama must reincarnate in China, according to the laws of the People's Republic.” Apparently, there's a section in the Chinese constitution governing the afterlife.

This month also marks the fifth anniversary of the annexation of once democratic Hong Kong. It's worth reviewing why Beijing annexes buffer states like Tibet and Hong Kong. Authoritarians can't afford to share borders with free and democratic neighbors. Rather, the undemocratic People's Republic needs to keep bad ideas and influences out, while at the same time keeping its people in. Normal interstate borders aren't enough. The People's Republic developed the Great Firewall to create a cognitive buffer. Similarly, it maintains geographic buffers with contiguous countries to insulate itself. Borders are difficult to control, and China has the longest land border in the world at 14,000 miles. Buffer zones create defense in depth, eliminating the need to patrol distant, inhospitable frontiers.

Why not just build another Great Wall? Because walls can be scaled. A large part of the border between North Korea and Northeast China is the Yalu River: It is difficult to patrol and easily crossed in the winter when it's frozen. China's buffer zones are made up of annexed, non-Han majority territories, which the CCP automatically treats as suspect. In these regions, the CCP uses subversion and favors to create a class of minority collaborators who do the patrolling and monitoring for it. Collaborators speak the language, know the culture, and are more effective at pointing out possible troublemakers. Nowhere is this more visible than in Xinjiang, where a cadre of Vichy Uyghurs identify targets for monitoring, arrest, incarceration, and worse.

On the occasion of the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday, it's worth a look at an important and tenuous buffer region: Tibet, once an independent state before the Chinese People's Liberation Army invaded and annexed it in 1950. The Dalai Lama, the Tibetans' spiritual and political leader, fled across the Himalayas in March 1959 to bordering free India, where he has remained in exile. Beijing hopes to name a more malleable Tibetan leader who lives under its direct control inside China to help pacify Tibetan “separatists.”

A similar strategy was employed in restive Hong Kong. Prior to annexation on July 1, 2020, Beijing bribed and threatened an entire class of Hong Kong residents (pro-establishment, as opposed to pan-democrats) to cede control of the territory slowly in the name of preventing even worse outcomes. Many freedom-loving Hong Kong citizens have been arrested retroactively in groups since annexation (the “Hong Kong 47” is a good example) for activities that were legal prior to annexation. In August 2020, 12 Hong Kong citizens attempted to flee to Taiwan by boat, only to be arrested for trying to leave. Free countries struggle to manage flows of people hoping to enter. Beijing struggles to keep people from leaving. 

How can the Chinese government presume to tell a religious figure where he will reincarnate, or require citizens to receive permission to leave? Authoritarian governments tend to be tone-deaf, due to their need to keep themselves and their citizens isolated from ideas and information that challenge their rule. Might-makes-right rule is the lowest form of governance (contrary to the four volumes of President Xi Jinping's The Governance of China) — authoritarian rule is far less advanced than systems confident and stable enough to cede control to the governed through elections. Unlike the first Cold War, in today's connected world, nonsensical authoritarian diktats are readily accessed and mocked outside information firewalls, undermining CCP claims of legitimacy. Beijing needs physical and cognitive buffers to keep its people respectful and compliant.

A survey of China's periphery demonstrates the authoritarian's need to isolate itself cognitively through the Great Firewall, pacify reluctant citizens through constant propaganda and indoctrination, and create geographic buffer zones by developing armies of willing minority collaborators.

The CCP needs to justify its rule continuously through state-run organs cranking out cringe pro-CCP propaganda, much of it aimed at minority populations in border regions. Chinese television (“government” is redundant) begins each day with a recitation of the general secretary's triumphs. “Xi Jinping” will be heard dozens of times in the first five minutes of the daily newscast, the hallmark of a cult of personality that strives to validate the party secretary for life. Schools teaching regional minority languages other than Chinese have been under great pressure to close. A recent story detailed how Tibetan preschoolers are taken from their homes and placed in Han Chinese boarding schools. The United Nations calls this cultural genocide.

These tactics would seem doomed to fail. Chinese friends tell me, “If the government says it's black, you know it's white.” However, if a lie is told often enough, early enough, it becomes true no matter how bizarre: People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the CCP, published a serious article titled “Kim Jong-un Named Sexiest Man Alive,” a story lifted from the satirical media outlet The Onion. Or recall that the soundtrack chosen for China's first Tiangong space station launch was “America the Beautiful.” Ensconced in their hermetically sealed information cocoon, the editors of People's Daily and CCTV were unable to understand The Onion's satire or recognize their poor choice of music because asking critical questions is dangerous. Information buffers may work, but they have an enormous downside.

Of all the recent messaging coming out of the Communist Chinese propaganda machine, the language on Tibet and the Dalai Lama's reincarnation has been the most bizarre. A proudly atheist Marxist government declaring that “the Dalai Lama must reincarnate in China, according to the laws of the People's Republic,” demonstrates the lengths the CCP must go to shore up its questionable legitimacy.

Beyond cognitive buffers, geographical buffers demonstrate yet another level of authoritarian paranoia and dysfunction. Authoritarian Russia's reckless invasions of Ukraine sought to preserve physical separation from both democratic Ukraine and NATO, for the same reasons the Soviet Union annexed Eastern Europe: to keep its incarcerated people ignorant of a better life in free countries. Why is the powerful Chinese government so concerned about the Dalai Lama's afterlife? His continued existence in exile threatens stability in annexed Tibet. 

A survey of Chinese border buffer regions — Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, North Korea, and Hong Kong/Taiwan — demonstrates how Beijing seeks to maintain stability and prevent embarrassing mass exodus.

Maintaining stability in Tibet requires collaborators backed up by an enormous security presence. The same is true in Xinjiang, to the north of Tibet. In 1951, the newly established People's Republic of China annexed the Central Asian state of East Turkistan and immediately began the work of creating a compliant buffer state. Tourists in Xinjiang are told, “The people of Xinjiang are 90% minority and 10% majority.” Let that sink in. Turkic Uyghurs share more with Central Asian and even Middle Eastern cultures than with Han Chinese culture, making the occupation difficult. Beijing goes to extreme lengths to anticipate and eliminate “Uyghur separatists,” even before they've done anything, by deploying loyal Han colonizers to recruit Uyghur collaborators, forcibly live with noncollaborator Uyghur families in their homes to prevent secessionist activities, destroy Muslim Uyghur culture by prohibiting the celebration of Ramadan, forcing Muslims to smoke and drink alcohol, and for those suspected of future terrorist leanings, lock them down in massive “Vocational Training Camps.”

Once in these camps, women are given drugs that effectively sterilize them. Uyghur language and culture are being eliminated in what the U.S. government determined to be a literal and cultural genocide, all to create self-policing buffers that insulate core China from adverse outside influence.

Inner Mongolia is no different. Although Mongols once ruled China during the Yuan dynasty in the 14th century, today, Beijing controls the southern half of the traditional Mongolian territory, as the province of Inner Mongolia. Independent Mongolia survived World War II, pinched between the Soviet Union and China, but Beijing carved out the province of Inner Mongolia as a buffer and has subjected the Mongolian minority to the same harsh treatment as Tibet and Xinjiang. Tibetan Buddhism is also practiced in Mongolia, which the CCP considers a threat. As in Tibet and Xinjiang, traditional religious, language, and cultural training is controlled and slowly eliminated, as documented by Los Angeles Times reporter Alice Su in 2020. Her firsthand reporting critical of the CCP's treatment of ethnic Mongolians led to her harassment by PRC security services and eventual deportation. Buffer regions are designed to keep dangerous ideas out and bad news in. 

As an aside, the buffer concept doesn't seem to apply to the shared border with authoritarian Russia, and Beijing doesn't mind seeing its people settling in Russia's eastern province, which annoys its “no limits” friends in Moscow. Sparsely populated farmland in Russian Siberia attracts Chinese emigres, relieving population pressures in China and leading to the staking of territorial claims for the eventual reincorporation of territory taken from China by Russia following the Opium Wars. With this territory comes the strategic port of Vladivostok, which, until 1860, was known as Haishenwei.

Next in the survey of Beijing's periphery comes North Korea. Although it is not currently a democratic state, reunification would see a free, democratic, and unified Korea on China's border. Many tabletop exercises on North Korean instability conclude that Beijing would actively oppose unification of the peninsula under democratic South Korean rule, preferring to prop up a failed North Korean buffer state, as Beijing could not tolerate a burgeoning South Korean economy and vibrant democracy on its border. The frontier is easily crossed, especially in the winter when the Yalu River freezes, so it would be much more difficult for the CCP to control the movement of people and ideas. 

North Korea provides a convenient and cooperative, although troublesome, buffer. Open hostility between North Korea and China is not unusual — Beijing exerted every bit of its diplomatic muscle, engaging the U.S. to help, to stop North Korea's third nuclear test in March 2013, to no avail. And yet the PRC continues to prop up the Kim regime because it considers the threat of a contiguous free market democracy to be even greater than a nuclear North Korea. In the same way, Kim is not eager to reunite and face crimes against humanity charges as the International Criminal Court threatened in 2014. And so Beijing has a willing collaborator in the North Korea buffer zone.

For 75 years, refugees from North Korea have escaped into Northeast China, where human rights groups work to resettle them in South Korea. Beijing often prevents this and forces refugees back into North Korea, where they face certain inhumane punishment. The CCP understands that having citizens flee the country is embarrassing to authoritarians, as the exodus defeats the narrative that North Koreans have “nothing to envy” (the title of an excellent book by Barbara Demick on North Korea's near collapse in the 1990s). Those who live in free countries have trouble understanding why a government would prevent its people from leaving. This is because the outflows of people to democratic countries would be significant, undermining authoritarian claims of legitimacy.

Anticipating this, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 (Article 13) defines emigration as a human right. Based on experiences following the Bolshevik Revolution, UDHR Article 13 recognizes the harm caused by Soviet policy that prevented its people from fleeing oppression. This flaw in authoritarian rule was most visible in Berlin in 1961 when the Soviet bloc suddenly and very visibly sealed its borders, not to keep people out but to keep its people in. China is a signatory to the UDHR and, in fact, sent a representative to help draft it, yet Beijing violates it routinely. Free countries struggle to control flows of people into their countries. China exerts greater effort to keep them from leaving.

Finally, July 1 marks the fifth anniversary of the PRC turning Hong Kong into yet another buffer state. In 2020, Beijing abrogated the Joint Declaration, a U.N.-held treaty with the United Kingdom guaranteeing Hong Kong 50 years of autonomy, after only 23 years. This was in response to summer 2019 protests in then-free Hong Kong that struck at the heart of CCP legitimacy. Hong Kong collaborators, the pro-establishment camp, could not stop grassroots protests against increasing PRC infiltration and subversion. The Chinese people watched with interest and envy as Hong Kong soccer fans booed the Chinese national anthem and openly protested Beijing's failure to abide by the Joint Declaration's guarantees of autonomy. Beijing could not allow this open defiance to continue. Hong Kong's shared border with Guangzhou contrasted a free, democratic society with authoritarianism in a way that made Hong Kongers exercising their right to free speech a significant threat to CCP rule. Even if Beijing could use the Great Firewall to block news from Hong Kong, Chinese visitors to Hong Kong could observe democratic freedom firsthand.

Following annexation, in August 2020, Beijing no longer tried to maintain the façade of autonomy. Twelve Hong Kong dissidents attempted to flee to Taiwan by boat. Prior to July 1, they were free to do so. Seeing the authoritarian juggernaut that was coming, the 12 left Hong Kong but were intercepted by the Chinese coast guard, arrested, and charged with “illegally entering Chinese waters” (!) even though they were clearly trying to leave. After Beijing abrogated the Joint Declaration, vocal critics like Joshua Wong, Jimmy Lai, and many others have been prevented from leaving and were eventually arrested. Such is the fate of the residents of a buffer state.

The survey of China's troubled periphery ends with Taiwan, which will continue to beckon freedom-loving Chinese people. Sitting 100 miles off the PRC's eastern coast, Taiwan demonstrates that contrary to CCP denials, the Chinese people thrive under democratic rule. PRC citizens watch Taiwan's elections with great interest and quietly wonder why they can't have a voice and a choice in their own governance. The Taiwan Strait provides a geographical buffer for the PRC, but even the Great Firewall can't prevent the Chinese people from aspiring to something better.

As in other border areas, the CCP actively seeks to subvert Taiwan's democratic governance by cultivating collaborators. Certain elements of the Kuomintang party are clearly doing Beijing's bidding. CCP agents take advantage of human greed to get elected representatives and business leaders to put personal financial interests ahead of national interests. Although many speculate on Beijing's plans to attack Taiwan militarily, the CCP's political warfare strategy uses information and economic weapons to achieve the same end, without the cost and risk. If Taiwan's citizens elect a pro-Beijing government, Taiwan's fate will look very much like that of Hong Kong.

US MUST GO ON OFFENSE IN CHINA 

So, what is to be done? The solution is easy, really. Rather than focus on China's strengths in the Taiwan Strait and eastern seaboard, the buffer regions described above highlight the inherent weakness of an unpopular, authoritarian government. Disaffected groups inside China, and diaspora who fled annexation, like the Dalai Lama, and now sit just outside the western border, are looking for rhetorical and material support from the outside. The Soviet experience in Afghanistan during the 1980s is illustrative — an unpopular occupying force had a difficult time operating where it wasn't welcome. Guerilla attacks on Soviet forces inside Afghanistan, along with other disruptive activities inside the Soviet Union, eventually forced the Soviet military into a humiliating withdrawal, which has been suggested to have led to the downfall of the Soviet Union. 

In October 2013, a vehicle with three Uyghurs crashed into the rostrum at Tiananmen Square — the three occupants and two bystanders were killed, and the CCP learned that its pacification campaign wouldn't be allowed to focus only on former East Turkistan (Xinjiang). Authoritarian rule sows the seeds of its own demise. Buffers can't stop this.

The House voted to cut billions of dollars for foreign aid and public broadcasting early Friday morning, a win for President Donald Trump as he is plagued by GOP divisions over the release of the files of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The White House's $9 billion rescissions package cleared the chamber, 216-213. Two Republicans, Reps. Mike Turner (R-OH) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), voted with all Democrats against the bill, and the legislation now heads to Trump's desk for his signature.Republicans used a procedure that automatically “deems” the bill as passed when members voted for the procedural rule, instead of having to take a vote on both the rule and final passage.

The journey to putting the rescissions package — which codifies several cuts identified by the Department of Government Efficiency — on the House floor was a rollercoaster for House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Republican leaders, coming so soon after the infighting over the “big beautiful bill” that led to record-breaking floor time and several days of negotiations.The legislation, which passed the Senate early Thursday morning, faced an uphill battle to get to the floor that afternoon.

Leadership battled with Rules Committee members who didn't want to be put on record voting against Democratic amendments that called for the release of information related to Epstein. The Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files has driven a wedge within the GOP and given Democrats a messaging opportunity.

The passing of the spending clawback comes at a time when Trump's MAGA base has revolted over the administration's findings that there was not a so-called “client list” of Epstein's that had long been speculated over. But it also comes after the Wall Street Journal published an article Thursday that Trump was one of many to write Epstein a letter for his 50th birthday, which, in part, included an imaginary conversation between the pair that said they had “certain things in common.”

The album in which the letter was included was assembled before Epstein was first arrested in 2006, according to the outlet. Trump has denied writing the letter and has pledged to sue the outlet for publishing the story.

“The Wall Street Journal, and Rupert Murdoch, personally, were warned directly by President Donald J. Trump that the supposed letter they printed by President Trump to Epstein was a FAKE and, if they print it, they will be sued,” he wrote in a Truth Social post.Trump said in a different Truth Social post that he directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to “produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval.”He added, “This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!”

Earlier this week, all but one Republican — Rep. Ralph Norman (R-NC) — voted against an amendment from Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) on Monday to release the files in the Rules Committee.

Republicans met at 6 p.m. on Thursday to advance two rules: one covering the recissions package and another covering a resolution calling for the release of some of the Epstein files. It is similar to the resolution filed by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), which already has bipartisan support.

TRUMP TO SUE WSJ AND RUPERT MURDOCH AFTER ‘DEFAMATORY' STORY ON EPSTEIN BIRTHDAY LETTER

Both rules passed the Rules Committee along party lines. The Epstein-related resolution can be brought up at a later date, but it is unclear when it will receive a vote on the House floor.

Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) filed a discharge petition that compels the Department of Justice to release information related to the disgraced, since-deceased financier, including the so-called infamous “client list.” A federal investigation found that there was no list, but Trump's “Make America Great Again” base and a large bloc of GOP lawmakers are demanding all documents be released to the public.

The rescissions package slashes budgets for USAID, PBS, NPR, and other aid programs. The House passed an earlier version of the legislation in early June that called for $9.4 billion in rescissions, but the version passed Thursday exempted $400 million in funding for AIDS prevention — a Senate move to shore up GOP support.

The Senate has passed about $9 billion in federal spending cuts requested by President Donald Trump, including deep reductions to public broadcasting and foreign aid, moving forward on one of the president's top priorities despite concerns from several Republican senators.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.

Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio — to Adams' station.

At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS — a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.

Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.

Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task — texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.

“I thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,” Adams said.




The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.

The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.

“Many of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,” said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. “There is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.”

The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.

Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like “Caillou” and “Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood” to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.

“This is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,” Gaynor said. “That is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.”

Maine's public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he's not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state's residents.

Maine's rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a “lifeline” to her growing up off the grid.

NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.

NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. “That is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,” she said.

The affair transcends violins and piccolos. NPR received support Thursday from the heavy metal band Gwar, whose lead singer Blothar the Berserker posted a call on social media for fans to pay attention to what is going on with public media.

Already, public media is seeing an increase in donations from reader and viewers to support its mission, and stations are actively sounding the alarm. In a plea to listeners on its website Thursday, Philadelphia's WXPN radio pointed to its legacy in helping people discover new music. “The most important thing you can do is support WXPN and the public media system in a way that is meaningful to you,” the station urged on its website.

But donations aren't going to fill the hole left by the loss in federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close.

Public media isn't getting any help from states, either. At least five states have reduced their own outlays for public media this year, either for budget or political reasons.

Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, vetoed nearly $6 million that Florida lawmakers had set aside for public broadcasters the day before the state's budget took effect on July 1. “Done in Florida,” DeSantis responded on social media to a Trump post calling public broadcasting a “monstrosity” that should be defunded.

Back in Alaska, KMXT public radio station's general manager, Jared Griffin, called the Senate vote a “devastating gut punch.” He estimated that the cuts would amount to 22% of KMXT's budget. Griffin said the station's board has already agreed on a plan to furlough staff members one day a month, and he's taking a 50% pay cut.

The station covers Kodiak Island, home to one of the nation's largest U.S. Coast Guard bases.

“We have to dip into our savings while we figure out what KMXT is going to look like over the next six months, Griffin said. ”At least for the next year we'll be fine but we're probably going to have to look at leasing space in our building to other organizations to help fill that gap.”

Unalaska resident Nikki Whittern said KUCB plays a vital role in the community during emergencies like the tsunami warning. 

“They broadcast everything, and they make sure that everybody knows and everybody's safe,” said Whittern, a bartender. She spoke while preparing to open the Norwegian Rat Saloon — known to local fishermen simply as “the Rat” — on Thursday morning.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) is incapable of getting his employees to show up to the office more than two days a week. This is an indictment of his leadership and reveals a flaw that should be fatal to his presidential aspirations. It is also an indictment of the California Democratic Party, which has shown itself to be a wholly owned subsidiary of powerful government unions.

This March, just weeks before the state's Legislative Analyst's Office projected current and “persistent” deficits of between $10 billion and $20 billion a year, Newsom issued an executive order directing all agency heads to update telework policies to require staff to be in their offices four days a week rather than two days, as is now the case. Agency heads were given three months to get this done, with an implementation deadline of July 1.

California's government unions, SEIU Local 1000 most prominent among them, vowed to block Newsom's order, and many elected Democrats in Sacramento joined the fight on the unions' side. Several government employee unions filed grievances with the state, while others sued. The unions spent more than $30,000 on billboards that were posted in Sacramento attacking Newsom for supposedly creating traffic jams by forcing workers to go to their place of work.

Sure enough, Newsom buckled under this pressure and capitulated. He delayed the return to work by a year, giving unions more time to flex their political muscles and prepare for another fight.

Government unions are big business in California. Combined, the California Teachers Association, California Federation of Teachers, California School Employees Association, American Federation of State and Municipal Employees, SEIU 1000, and other public safety unions have more than a million members in the state, paying more than a billion dollars a year in dues.

Between 15% and 25% of this money is spent maximizing the unions' political power, including direct donations to Democratic Party campaigns, ballot measures, political staff, lobbyists in Sacramento, and “issue advocacy.” That comes to $150 million of union dues spent every year influencing government policy.

No other special interest groups in the state come close to spending that kind of money and acquiring such influence — not Silicon Valley, not Hollywood, not the tourism industry. The government employee unions are a unified political machine. Not even the Democratic Party of California comes close to spending that kind of money to wield power.

With this airtight monopoly on political power, government unions control who gets elected, so when they “negotiate” over collective bargaining agreements, they are across the table from people they handpicked for the job. The far Left hand has a firm grip on the other Left hand. Any elected Democrat in California who dares oppose a government union in a collective bargaining negotiation signs their own political death warrant. Negotiating with government unions in California is like negotiating with the mob while Luca Brasi has a gun to your head.

Considering their overweening political power, it is not surprising that the average government union retiree in California collects a pension of $70,000 a year while the state's pension funds are underfunded by hundreds of billions of dollars.

A PIVOT POINT ON SPENDING IN THE SENATE

The California Teachers Union has no incentive to improve education in California. If test scores go down, which they have, it is used as another reason to demand more money. The American Federation of State and Municipal Employees has no incentive to ensure trash gets picked up on time or potholes are filled in. Nothing pushes government unions to deliver public services better or more cost-effectively. Their only incentive is to bleed taxpayers dry quickly before another union gets a better deal.

California has become unaffordable, as Newsom is demonstrating, and is losing thousands of middle-class residents every year. Government unions, which Newsom has proved powerless to govern, are a major reason why.

            Once again, President Donald Trump was caught in a scandal and a Comey got fired.
    


            The strange and fateful entanglement between two powerful families jumped into a new generation this week when Maurene Comey got the sack from her job as one of New York's top prosecutors.
    


            And like her father, former FBI Director James Comey, who was ousted months into Trump's first term, she left with a dramatic warning about encroaching autocracy.
    


            “Fear is the tool of the tyrant,” Comey said in a message to colleagues, obtained by CNN on Thursday, after losing her job at the US attorney's office in the Southern District of New York, where she took part in prosecutions including that of Jeffrey Epstein – who has returned to national attention of late.
    


            A controversy over unreleased Justice Department files over the late accused sex trafficker is estranging the president from some in his MAGA base, causing him to absurdly blame Democrats — and James Comey — for orchestrating some kind of “hoax”
    


            Maurene Comey also prosecuted Sean “Diddy” Combs and high-profile murder, drug and gang violence cases. She said she was let go without explanation. But the only surprise really is that it took so long. A person familiar with the situation said that being a Comey is untenable in this administration because the former FBI chief continues to criticize the president. It works both ways, however, with Trump frequently lambasting his first FBI chief, whom he fired on questionable grounds.
    


            This new front in the Trump/Comey feud is the latest dramatic twist in the politically charged story of the former FBI director, whose choices even before Trump stormed onto the scene meant he was sucked into toxic politics in a way that is unusual for a modern incumbent of his former job.
    


            After Trump took office in January 2017, Comey quickly became an early symbol of the president's attempts to bend the US government's legal agencies and instruments to his will.
    


            He is also one of the most prominent avatars for the conspiracies advanced by Trump and his MAGA crowd — which have escaped the president's capacity to control in the Epstein saga — that there is a pernicious “deep state” inside the US government plotting to bring down the president and his supporters.
    


            Comey said that he was summoned to the White House for an uncomfortable one-on-one dinner with Trump a week into his first term and asked to pledge loyalty to the president, in a breach of the protocol by which FBI directors have sought distance from the Oval Office following the long and Machiavellian rule at the bureau of J. Edgar Hoover. Comey later testified to Congress he told Trump he would be honest but not politically loyal in that encounter, which started the slide to his dismissal in May 2017.
    


            In retrospect, and especially in light of the events of Trump's second term, that meeting was one of the first signs of Trump's intention to weaponize the Justice Department and the FBI. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, who is also embroiled in the Epstein storm, and FBI Director Kash Patel are Trump ultra-loyalists and won their jobs by becoming stars in MAGA world.
    


            And ironically, the cudgel of politicized justice that Comey refused to provide for Trump seems now to be turned against him. The FBI is investigating its former director and ex-CIA Director John Brennan for possible false statements to Congress relating to the issue that first dragged Comey into the president's bad books — the intelligence community assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the 2016 election to try to help Trump win, CNN reported last week.
    


            Comey was also one of the first major public figures to sound the alarm about Trump's autocratic tendencies and a style of leadership that often appears to prioritize his own political and personal goals above a broad definition of the national interest.
    


            In a dramatic congressional hearing days after he was fired, Comey talked about contemporaneous memos he wrote after meeting Trump. He said he believed that the president was trying to get “something in exchange” for allowing him to stay in his job.
    


            Later, in his searing book “A Higher Loyalty,” Comey wrote that dealing with Trump reminded him of his days prosecuting mafia kingpins, with their “silent circle of assent.”
    


            Trump's implication in an interview with NBC after firing Comey that his decision was partly to do with the Russia investigation only heightened concerns about the president's motives.
    


            The circumstances of Comey's dismissal were one of the factors that led to the appointment of another former FBI director, Robert Mueller, to head the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Ultimately, Mueller did not establish that members of the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia's election interference effort, but did say the president's team expected to benefit from it. Trump refers to the entire issue of Russian election interference as a hoax.
    


            Comey's tortured relationship with Trump began when he was among senior intelligence officials who went to Trump Tower to meet the incoming commander in chief two weeks before he was sworn in for the first time. Comey pulled Trump aside and told him about a dossier of allegations against him that also detailed interactions between his aides and Russians.
    


            The dossier later became the centerpiece of Trump's allegations that the intelligence agencies plotted against him. It reinforced the view of many supporters that there is a shady secret government that runs the United States — a conspiracy theory that helps explain the resonance of the story around Epstein, who MAGA activists claim was murdered in prison and kept a list of famous clients.
    


            Comey's dealings with Trump were not the first time he was pulled into the country's treacherous politics. In a move that Democrats claim cost their nominee the White House in 2016, he sensationally sent a letter to Congress announcing he was reopening the Hillary Clinton State Department email probe only 11 days before the election. He has since described the episode as a nightmare, but at the time he maintained he'd had no choice to tell the public about new evidence, because if he didn't do so he'd have been accused of covering it up and potentially helping Clinton win.
    


            This episode reinforced claims by critics on both sides of the aisle that Comey is sometimes a grandstander and has a rather too finely developed sense of his own integrity that leads him into tricky political situations.
    


            Americans first saw the moral certainty Comey brought to his professional life during the George W. Bush administration. As deputy attorney general, he rushed to a Washington hospital to thwart an attempt by White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House Chief of Staff Andy Card to get a seriously ill Attorney General John Ashcroft to reauthorize a surveillance program.
    


            The sense that Comey sees himself as a guardian of some of America's most fundamental democratic values has surrounded his public moves ever since. And the message his daughter released after her dismissal suggests the apple didn't fall far from the tree.
    


            “If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain,” she wrote to her colleagues. “Do not let that happen.”
    


            Maurene Comey's dismissal occurred two months after the previous bizarre development in the Comey-Trump melodrama. Her father was interview by Secret Service Agents over a photograph he posted to social media showing shells on a beach spelling out “86 47” — a code for removing Trump from the presidency. Some senior Trump officials accused Comey of calling for the president's assassination. Comey said he had no idea that some people associated the code with violence.
    


            But the feud between Trump and Comey is as bitter as ever, and there are surely new chapters to come — which might not be out of place in the legal thrillers the former FBI chief has taken to writing in his retirement.

McALLEN, Texas (AP) — In 2006, top U.S. Border Patrol officials were asked how long it would take to hire 6,000 agents, a roughly 50% increase at the time. Michael Fisher, then deputy chief in San Diego, says the officials concluded they would need five years. 

“You have 2 1/2 years,” Fisher recalls being told.

With Immigration and Customs Enforcement now preparing to add 10,000 employees within five years to assist with President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts, the Border Patrol's torrid expansion in the early 2000s serves as a cautionary tale. Hiring and training standards were changed and arrests for employee misconduct rose. Pressure to turbo-charge growth can also lead to attrition.

“If they don't uphold pretty rigorous standards and background checks, you can end up hiring the wrong people, and then you pay a huge price in how the public perceives them,” said Gil Kerlikowske, who was commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency, from 2014 to 2017.

ICE, the main agency responsible for arresting and deporting people within the U.S., is set to get $76.5 billion, nearly 10 times its annual budget, under a bill Trump signed on July 4. Most of that money is for detention, but some is for hiring and other uses. The White House says ICE will grow from 20,000 employees to about 30,000.




“To do it today is an effort that needs to start years ago,” said Matthew Hudak, former Border Patrol deputy chief. “The funding is there, but it is nearly impossible to bring in that many people that quickly because you hit challenges.”




The Border Patrol nearly doubled its workforce from 11,264 agents in October 2005 to 21,444 agents six years later.

To recruit officers, the agency sponsored a NASCAR race car and bull riding contests. It aired ads during Dallas Cowboys football games. It advertised at military bases. Billboards and job fairs hundreds of miles from the border promised fulfilling careers, resulting in thousands of applications a week. 

The agency also loosened some hiring guidelines and training requirements. The age limit for new hires was raised to 40 years old from 37. Spanish language training was cut by up to 30 days, some training was moved online and other instruction was shifted to the field to lessen time at a training academy that the agency opened in Artesia, New Mexico, during the hiring surge, according to a Government Accountability Office report. 

Arrests for illegal crossings fell to their lowest levels in decades — a sign for some that the strategy succeeded. 

But other measurements were more troubling. 

In 2008, the Border Patrol struggled to keep new agents, with about 20% failing to graduate from the academy and more leaving after returning to their stations.

Arrests of CBP employees for misconduct increased to 336 in the 2012 fiscal year from 190 seven years earlier. The agency saw a spate of high-profile corruption cases, including agents accused of smuggling people across the border or working with drug cartels to bring illegal drugs into the U.S.

The polygraph pass rate for new applicants tumbled to 33% in 2012 from 58% four years earlier. While the accuracy of the tests came under scrutiny, one applicant admitted that his brother-in-law, a known Mexican drug smuggler, asked him to use his employment to facilitate cocaine trafficking. Another admitted to using marijuana 9,000 times, including the night before the exam. 

A 2015 Homeland Security report found that the number of investigators assigned to internal wrongdoing was “woefully inadequate” for the agency's growth. 

“Any time you have massive political pressure to beef up overnight, it never turns out well,” said T.J. Bonner, the former president of the Border Patrol agents union who retired in 2011. “Too many corners have to be cut. Then when things go wrong. the fingers get pointed.”

Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, said the department would achieve Trump's directives to hire 10,000 ICE officers, 3,000 Border Patrol agents and carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history.” The department's Career Expo in June recruited 3,000 candidates and resulted in 1,000 tentative job offers.

“Our recruitment strategy includes targeted outreach, thorough vetting, and partnerships with state and local law enforcement,” McLaughlin said.

Critics say the administration's policy to target anyone in the country illegally, not just those with criminal records, could lead to abuses. Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff and lead architect of his immigration policies, had set an aggressive target of at least 3,000 arrests a day even before any additional hiring. 

“When there are no priorities, everybody's a priority,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director of the American Immigration Council. “You're very likely to see confusion, delay, wrongful arrest, more mistakes when law enforcement agencies, especially large ones, don't have clear direction and guidance for prioritization.”

Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said competition for qualified law enforcement is tough, with departments now offering signing bonuses of $10,000 to $100,000.

Border Patrol staffing has yet to return to its peaks of the early 2010s. Trump tried to increase staffing in his first term. A contract with consulting firm Accenture PLC cost $13.6 million to set up in 2018 and resulted in only two hires over 10 months.

Trump's bill allocates about $170 billion for border and immigration enforcement, with $4.1 billion for CBP hiring that includes 3,000 more Border Patrol agents. It comes at a time of historically low crossings after they reached a record high in December 2023.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt reports on the latest cases of transgender high school athletes to be heard on 'Special Report.'

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced Thursday he is suing U.S. Masters Swimming (USMS), a competitive swimming membership organization with over 60,000 adult swimmers. 

The lawsuit is a response to an event in San Antonio where a biological male trans athlete won five women's gold medals. 

Multiple female competitors told Fox News Digital after the meet they did not know the athlete was a biological male. 

"I'm suing U.S. Masters Swimming for engaging in illegal practices by allowing men to compete in women's competitions," Paxton said in a post on X announcing the lawsuit. "The organization has cowered to radical activists pushing gender warfare, and this lawsuit will hold USMS accountable for its actions."

Paxton's statement alleges USMS engaged in "false, deceptive, and misleading practices by allowing men to compete in women's events."

USMS has provided a statement addressing the lawsuit to Fox News Digital. 

"The Texas Office of the Attorney General notified U.S. Masters Swimming on May 19 that it was conducting an investigation into policies pertaining to transgender athlete participation in USMS competitions. USMS has been cooperating fully with the investigation and has been working with the Texas Office of the Attorney General to hopefully reach an agreement about the policy. USMS implemented an interim eligibility policy on July 1 in response to feedback from our members and the Attorney General's office and in line with our partnership with World Aquatics, which USMS is a member federation of," the statement reads. 

"USMS surprisingly learned yesterday via social media that the Texas Office of the Attorney General filed a lawsuit against USMS and the five LMSCs that operate in the State of Texas. USMS is currently reviewing the allegations. 

"To be clear, under USMS's policy (which aligns with World Aquatics policy), trans women are not eligible to receive records, Top 10 times, or awards in the women's category at all USMS-sanctioned events, and trans men are eligible for those competitive recognition programs in the men's category. Moreover, trans women swimming in the women's category do not displace other women from participating or receiving recognition in any USMS event. 

"USMS policies referenced have been publicly posted on our website since 2012 and are outlined in our annually published Code of Regulations. More information about USMS's interim eligibility policy can be found in our FAQs.

"USMS is a national nonprofit community of adult swimmers focused on health and fitness. It is deeply disappointing to see our organization and individual members publicly targeted in a lawsuit that appears to be more about generating headlines than seeking justice. 

"USMS will continue to cooperate fully with the Texas Office of the Attorney General and to uphold the values that have guided our community for more than 50 years."

In June 2023, Texas passed the Save Women's Sports Act, which bans trans athletes from competing in girls and women's sports and only allows students to compete in the gender category listed on their birth certificates. The law only allows schools to recognize changes made to birth certificates that were made to correct a clerical error.

Paxton previously launched an investigation into USMS after the controversial April incident.

The trans swimmer, 47-year-old Ana Caldas, dominated all five races the athlete competed in, taking gold in the women's age 45-49 category in five races, including the 50- and 100-yard breaststroke, freestyle and the 100-yard individual medley.

RILEY GAINES WANTS TO SEND A ‘THANK-YOU NOTE' TO LIA THOMAS – HERE'S WHY

Louisiana woman and long-time swimmer Wendy Enderle said she filed a request for an eligibility review after finding out that Caldas was transgender through a news article about the April incident.

"I feel betrayed. Plain and simple," Enderle previously told Fox News Digital. 

Enderle said she did not introduce herself to Caldas until a USMS meet in Little Rock, Arkansas, in January. Upon meeting Caldas, Enderle noticed the athlete's muscles and height but still assumed Caldas was a female. 

"I knew there was something, but I didn't know what, I had no idea she was a trans female up until this past Wednesday after the meet," Enderle said. "I was shocked. … It makes me concerned, it makes me mad." 

Fellow USMS women's swimmer Angie Griffin also swam with Caldas in April without knowledge of Caldas' birth gender.

The shock of learning the news about Caldas prompted Griffin to write a formal letter of complaint to USMS. The letter also asked the organization to "re-evaluate" the recent Spring National Championship and overhaul its gender eligibility policy.

Griffin competed against Caldas in three races in San Antonio and finished behind the trans athlete in the 50-yard breaststroke and 100-yard individual medley.

"I couldn't stop thinking about how the integrity of individual competition had been compromised. Why doesn't USMS follow the same competitive standards as the rest of the world and NCAA? Why are athletes asked to accept less transparency and fairness?" Griffin previously told Fox News Digital 

"I paid my entry fees, airfare and hotel, trusting I'd be competing in a women's division defined by biological sex. I deserved to know the truth before stepping onto the blocks."

The U.S. Masters Swimming Board of Directors and Rules Committee updated its participation guidelines last month.

"USMS allows members to register for the competition category that aligns with their gender identity and/or expression and to participate in sanctioned events in that category," the new guidelines state. 

"However, swimmers will not be included in Recognition Programs (as defined above) unless they are swimming in the competition category that aligns with their sex assigned at birth or they meet the eligibility requirements."

To be eligible for the U.S. Masters Swimming's women's recognition programs, the policy states, "Members of the Female Sex are eligible for Recognition Programs in the women's category, regardless of their gender identity or gender expression.

"Members with 46 XY DSD whose gender identity or gender expression is female are eligible for Recognition Programs in the women's category if they can establish to USMS's comfortable satisfaction that their sex assigned at birth is female."

Protests and events against President Donald Trump's controversial policies that include mass deportations and cuts to Medicaid and other safety nets for poor people have started Thursday at more than 1,600 locations around the country.

CHICAGO (AP) — Protests and events against President Donald Trump's controversial policies that include mass deportations and cuts to Medicaid and other safety nets for poor people have started Thursday at more than 1,600 locations around the country.

The “Good Trouble Lives On” national day of action honors the late congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis. Protests were being held along streets, at court houses and other public spaces. Organizers have called for them to be peaceful.

“We are navigating one of the most terrifying moments in our nation's history,” Public Citizen co-president Lisa Gilbert said during an online news conference Tuesday. “We are all grappling with a rise of authoritarianism and lawlessness within our administration ... as the rights, freedoms and expectations of our very democracy are being challenged.”

Public Citizen is a nonprofit with a stated mission of taking on corporate power. It is a member of a coalition of groups behind Thursday's protests.

Major protests were planned in Atlanta and St. Louis, as well as Oakland, California, and Annapolis, Maryland.

Lewis first was elected to Congress in 1986. He died in 2020 at the age of 80 following an advanced pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

He was the youngest and last survivor of the Big Six civil rights activists, a group led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1965, a 25-year-old Lewis led some 600 protesters in the Bloody Sunday march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. Lewis was beaten by police, suffering a skull fracture.




Within days, King led more marches in the state, and President Lyndon Johnson pressed Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act that later became law.

“Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and redeem the soul of America,” Lewis said in 2020 while commemorating the 1965 voting rights marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.

Chicago will be the flagship city for Thursday's protests as demonstrators are expected to rally downtown in the afternoon. 

Betty Magness, executive vice president of the League of Women Voters Chicago and one of the organizers of Chicago's event, said the rally will also include a candlelight vigil to honor Lewis.

Much of the rest of the rally will have a livelier tone, Magness said, adding “we have a DJ who's gonna rock us with boots on the ground.”

Pushback against Trump so far in his second term has centered on deportations and immigration enforcement tactics

Earlier this month, protesters engaged in a tense standoff as federal authorities conducted mass arrests at two Southern California marijuana farms. One farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic raid.

Those raids followed Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard outside federal buildings and to protect immigration agents carrying out arrests on Los Angeles. On June 8, thousands of protesters began taking to the streets in Los Angeles.

And organizers of the June 14 “No Kings” demonstrations said millions of people marched in hundreds of events from New York to San Francisco. Demonstrators labeled Trump as a dictator and would-be king for marking his birthday with a military parade.

CBS is canceling one of the most popular political late-night shows on television, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.

The show will end in May 2026 after more than 1,500 episodes in its second iteration.

‘THE LATE SHOW with STEPHEN COLBERT' will end its historic run in May 2026 at the end of the broadcast season,” CBS said in a statement. “We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire ‘THE LATE SHOW' franchise at that time. We are proud that Stephen called CBS home. He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late-night television.”

“This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content, or other matters happening at Paramount,” the network added. 

Colbert told the audience the news at Thursday's taping of the show at the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan.

“Before we start the show, I want to let you know something I found out just last night,” he said. “Next year will be our last season. The network will be ending The Late Show in May.”

After the audience expressed disagreement with the decision, Colbert said, “Yeah, I share your feelings.”

“It's not just the end of our show, but it's the end of The Late Show on CBS,” he continued. “I'm not being replaced. This is all just going away. And I do want to say … that the folks at CBS have been great partners. I'm so grateful to the Tiffany Network for giving me this chair and this beautiful theater to call home. And of course I'm grateful to you, the audience, who have joined us every night.”

The Late Show was hosted by David Letterman for decades until Colbert took the reins in 2015.

Colbert said he was “extraordinarily, deeply grateful to the 200 people who work here.” 

“I've had the pleasure and the responsibility of sharing what we do every day with you in front of this camera for the last 10 years,” he said, adding, “It is a fantastic job. I wish somebody else was getting it. It's a job that I'm looking forward to doing with this usual gang of idiots for another 10 months.”

The show, which has been in its second iteration since its start in 1993, has featured numerous celebrities, political stars, and other notable figures. Bill Murray was the show's first guest, and Billy Joel was its first musical act.

“With much gratitude, we look forward to honoring Stephen and celebrating the show over the next 10 months alongside its millions of fans and viewers,” CBS said.

 Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the Senate debate on 'Fox News @ Night.'

What can you get for $9.4 billion?

3G Capital recently purchased footwear giant Skechers for $9.4 billion. 

$9.4 billion could cover your rent for a pretty nice apartment in New York City for more than 40,000 years. 

Yes, it will just be you and the cockroaches by then. 

Or, you could pay the cost of every major disaster in the past four decades – ranging from Chernobyl to Fukushima to Hurricane Sandy. 

'LONG OVERDUE': SENATE REPUBLICANS RAM THROUGH TRUMP'S CLAWBACK PACKAGE WITH CUTS TO FOREIGN AID, NPR

But $9.4 billion isn't a lot when cast against nearly $7 trillion in annual spending by the federal government. 

And it's really not much money when you consider that the U.S. is about slip into the red to the tune of $37 trillion. 

Which brings us to the Congressional plan to cancel spending. That is, a measure from Republicans and the Trump Administration to rescind spending lawmakers already appropriated in March. The House and Senate are now clawing back money lawmakers shoved out the door for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and foreign aid programs under USAID. The original proposal cut $9.4 billion. But that figure dwindled to $9 billion – after the Senate restored money for "PEPFAR," a President George W. Bush era program to combat AIDS worldwide. 

In other words, you may have a couple thousand years lopped off from your rent-controlled apartment in New York City. Of course that hinges on what Democratic mayoral nominee Zorhan Mamdani decides to do, should he win election this fall. 

Anyway, back to Congressional spending. Or "un-spending." 

The House passed the original version of the bill in June, 216-214. Flip one vote and the bill would have failed on a 215-215 tie. Then it was on to the Senate. Republicans had to summon Vice President Vance to Capitol Hill to break a logjam on two procedural votes to send the spending cancellation bill to the floor and actually launch debate. Republicans have a 53-47 advantage in the Senate. But former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska and Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted nay – producing a 50-50 tie.

Fox is told some Senate Republicans are tiring of McConnell opposing the GOP – and President Trump – on various issues. That includes the nay votes to start debate on the spending cancellation bill as well as his vote against the confirmation of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in January.

"He used to be the Leader. He was always telling us we need to stick together," said one GOP senator who requested anonymity. "Now he's off voting however he wants? How time flies."

Note that McConnell led Senate Republicans as recently as early January.

But McConnell ultimately voted for the legislation when the Senate approved it 51-48 at 2:28 am ET Thursday morning. 

Murkowski and Collins were the only noes. The services of Vice President Vance weren't needed due to McConnell's aye vote and the absence of Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn. She fell ill and was admitted to George Washington Hospital for exhaustion. 

As for the senior senator from Alaska, one GOP senator characterized it as "Murkowski fatigue."

"She always asking. She's always wanting more," groused a Senate Republican.

Murkowski secured an agreement on rural hospitals in exchange for her vote in favor of the Big, Beautiful Bill earlier this month. However, Murkowski did not secure more specificity on the DOGE cuts or help with rural, public radio stations in Alaska on the spending cut plan.

SENATE TO DEBATE TRUMP'S $9B CLAWBACK BILL AFTER DRAMATIC LATE-NIGHT VOTES

"My vote is guided by the imperative of coming from Alaskans. I have a vote that I am free to cast, with or without the support of the President. My obligation is to my constituents and to the Constitution," said Murkowski. "I don't disagree that NPR over the years has tilted more partisan. That can be addressed. But you don't need to gut the entire Corporation for Public Broadcasting." 

In a statement, Collins blasted the Trump administration for a lack of specificity about the precision of the rescissions request. Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee in charge of the federal purse strings, also criticized the administration a few months ago for a paucity of detail in the President's budget. 

"The rescissions package has a big problem – nobody really knows what program reductions are in it.  That isn't because we haven't had time to review the bill," said Collins in a statement. "Instead, the problem is that OMB (the Office of Management and Budget) has never provided the details that would normally be part of this process."

Collins wasn't the only Republican senator who worried about how the administration presented the spending cut package to Congress. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss.,  fretted about Congress ceding the power of the purse to the administration. But unlike Collins, Wicker supported the package.

"If we do this again, please give us specific information about where the cuts will come. Let's not make a habit of this," said Wicker. "If you come back to us again from the executive branch, give us the specific amounts in the specific programs that will be cut."

DOGE recommended the cuts. In fact, most of the spending reductions targeted by DOGE don't go into effect unless Congress acts. But even the $9.4 billion proved challenging to cut. 

"We should be able to do that in our sleep. But there is looking like there's enough opposition," said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Fox Business.

So to court votes, GOP leaders salvaged $400 million for PEPFAR.

"There was a lot of interest among our members in doing something on the PEPFAR issue," said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. "You're still talking about a $9 billion rescissions package - even with that small modification."

The aim to silence public broadcasting buoyed some Republicans.

HOMELAND SECURITY HALTS $18.5M IN TAXPAYER FUNDS FOR 'RADICAL' PROGRAMS

"North Dakota Public Radio - about 26% of their budget is federal funding. To me, that's more of an indictment than it is a need," said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. 

But back to the $9 billion. It's a fraction of one-tenth of one percent of all federal funding. And DOGE recommended more than a trillion dollars in cuts.

"What does this say for the party if it can't even pass this bill, this piddling amount of money?" yours truly asked Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.

"I think we're going to lose a lot of credibility. And we should," replied Kennedy.

But the House needed to sync up with the Senate since it changed the bill – stripping the cut for AIDS funding. House conservatives weren't pleased that the Senate was jamming them again – just two weeks after major renovations to the House version of the Big, Beautiful Bill. But they accepted their fate.

"It's disappointing that we're $37 trillion in debt. This to me was low-hanging fruit," said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo. "At the end of the day, I'll take a base hit, right? It's better than nothing."

White House Budget Director Russ Vought is expected to send other spending cancellation requests to Congress in the coming months. The aim is to target deeper spending reductions recommended by DOGE. 

But it doesn't auger well for future rescissions bills if it's this much of a battle to trim $9 trillion.

What can you get for that much money? For Republicans, it's not much.

Republicans were swinging for the fences with spending cuts.

But in the political box score, this is recorded as just a base hit.

In this article

Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics plunged more than 30% on Friday as the future of its approved gene therapy treatment appeared at risk.

The Food and Drug Administration will request that the company voluntarily stop all shipments of the treatment, Elevidys, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.

Sarepta told CNBC it had not heard from the FDA.

Separately, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an interview with Bloomberg News that the agency is considering whether the company's gene therapy should stay on the market.

The FDA has been investigating two patient deaths tied to Elevidys, which accounts for more than half of Sarepta's total net product revenue. The company also reported a third death tied to a separate experimental gene therapy.

Elevidys has been mired in controversy even since before it was approved. The gene therapy has yet to clearly prove it can benefit people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a condition that erodes muscle function over time.

People with the disease eventually lose the ability to walk, and most die by their early 20s, meaning there's a huge unmet need for treatment. The FDA in 2023 originally granted Elevidys a conditional approval for patients only between the ages of 4 and 5, the group that saw the most benefit in clinical trials.

The following year, the agency granted the treatment full approval for patients 4 and older who could still walk and accelerated approval for patients 4 and up who could no longer walk. The latter decision was especially contentious because there was less evidence that Elevidys could help people whose disease had already progressed so much.

Plus, Elevidys failed to meet its goal in a Phase 3 trial, though the company contended that the drug showed promise on other metrics in the study. Then head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Peter Marks, agreed with Sarepta's assessment and overruled FDA staff to expand approval of Elevidys.

Earlier this year, Sarepta disclosed that two teenage boys died from liver failure after receiving Elevidys. Then this week, reports emerged that another person died during a Phase 1 trial investigating another one of Sarepta's gene therapies for a different disease.

The two therapies are different, though they share the same method of delivery, heightening the safety concerns around Elevidys. The safety risks of Elevidys are especially important given the uncertain benefit, said BMO analyst Kostas Biliouris.

For example, Novartis' gene therapy Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy has also caused liver toxicity and death, but the benefit of that treatment is clear.

"That's why deaths here matter so much versus Zolgensma, for example," Biliouris said.

And Zolgensma is just one drug of many for a large company like Novartis. For Sarepta, Elevidys is everything.

Executives this week tried to reassure investors that even if it can only treat patients who can still walk, where deaths haven't been reported, the therapy should bring in at least $500 million a year. Sarepta last month stopped shipping Elevidys to patients who can no longer walk while it explores a safer way to administer the treatment.

The top concern for investors at this point is whether the FDA pulls the drug, Biliouris said. The company's stock has now fallen more than 87% this year.

"If the FDA pulls Elevidys from the market," he says, "Sarepta is done."

Jennifer Handt, whose son was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in late 2020, said it was "heartbreaking" that other patients won't have a treatment option to turn to if shipments of Elevidys are paused. 

Her son, Charlie, was dosed with Elevidys in 2022 as part of Sarepta's late-stage trial and noticed improvements in six to 12 months, including increased stamina and more fluid motions. The drug also eased a telltale symptom of the condition called Gowers' sign, which causes children difficulty when getting up from a sitting or lying position. 

She said her son is "completely stable" three years out from his dose. Handt said she was aware of the liver toxicity risks before Charlie enrolled in the trial.

"We don't have the luxury of not taking the risk," Handt said. "There are families that dealt with this disease before that would have done anything to have an option, even if there are risks." 

"Every family should have the choice to take this leap with this drug and potentially see benefits," she added.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Friday that he and House Republicans want "maximum transparency" on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and called for more information to be made public.

"Everybody wants the Epstein files, which is the real documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and anybody associated with that. We want the American people to see it," Johnson said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

The speaker also insisted that President Donald Trump shares this view. "What I believe in is maximum transparency, and so does President Trump," said Johnson.

The comments came after the Wall Street Journal revealed the existence on Thursday of an album of what it called "bawdy" letters compiled for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. The album reportedly included a letter from Trump that bore his signature and a drawing of a naked woman.

Johnson said he discussed the report with Trump on Friday morning before appearing on CNBC.

"The president and I talked about that ridiculous allegation this morning. He said it's patently absurd, he's never drawn such a picture, he's never thought of drawing such a picture," the speaker said.

"He's so frustrated by it, and he's going to wind up, I think, suing some of the media outlets that have put all this out there because [the White House] informed them that it was totally contrived," Johnson added.

Yet just as the White House mounted a full-scale messaging campaign to discredit the Journal's reporting, Trump also bowed to some of the pressure he is under from Republicans to reveal more about the case against Epstein.

Late Thursday evening, Trump announced that he has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to release "any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval" on Epstein.

Grand jury transcripts are generally kept tightly sealed under federal judicial rules, however, raising questions about why Trump's order to Bondi was limited to these records and not evidence uncovered during the investigation.

Johnson told CNBC the rules about grand jury testimony are intended to protect the identities of innocent victims, and to guard against the airing of "bogus allegations that would be made against people that can't be authenticated."

Aside from records that would be "held back from a court of law," said Johnson, "I say put it out there, and I think the president believes the same."

The remarks underscore the dilemma that Johnson and Republicans in Congress face as they seek to satisfy their base's demands and suspicions about Epstein, without crossing a president who insists the theories are a hoax perpetuated by Democrats.

The wealthy financier died by suicide in 2019, shortly after he was arrested on federal charges of child sex trafficking.

The circumstances of Epstein's death and his connections in life to wealthy and powerful men — some of whom allegedly abused young women on Epstein's properties — have fueled conspiracy theories about what the Justice Department might have uncovered during their years long investigation of him.

Democrats have seized on the discord within the pro-Trump ranks, putting forth legislation that would force the DOJ to release the Epstein files. Some Republicans in Congress have sided with those efforts.

The Republican-led House Rules Committee voted Thursday night to advance a resolution calling on the DOJ to release Epstein-related information. Democrats slammed the measure as toothless, since it would not require the DOJ to comply.

On Friday morning, Trump wrote, "If there was a 'smoking gun' on Epstein, why didn't the Dems, who controlled the 'files' for four years, and had Garland and Comey in charge, use it? BECAUSE THEY HAD NOTHING!!!"

FBI agents assigned earlier this year to review investigative files in the criminal case against notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were instructed to "flag" any documents that mentioned President Donald Trump, Sen. Richard Durbin said Friday.

Durbin's claim came as the Illinois Democrat sent the Justice Department and FBI letters asking them to explain what his office called "apparent discrepancies regarding the handling of the Epstein files and findings from a July 7 Department of Justice (DOJ) memorandum and instructions reportedly received by FBI personnel."

Durbin's letters, which were addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, added to pressure on the Trump administration over Bondi's decision to withhold from the public evidence about Epstein despite past promises that it would be released.

Durbin is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over the Justice Department and FBI.

The senator's description of instructions given to FBI agents regarding mentions of Trump's name was made in the letter to Patel. 

Trump is a former friend of Epstein, who died from suicide in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on child sex trafficking charges.

On Thursday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that a "bawdy" letter bearing Trump's signature was sent to Epstein in 2003 for this 50th birthday. Trump has angrily denied writing such a letter and said he will sue the Journal.

"According to information my office received, the FBI was pressured to put approximately 1,000 personnel in its Information Management Division (IMD) … on 24-hour shifts to review approximately 100,000 Epstein-related records in order to produce more documents that could then be released on an arbitrarily short deadline," Durbin wrote to Patel.

"This effort, which reportedly took place from March 14 through the end of March, was haphazardly supplemented by hundreds of FBI New York Field Office personnel, many of whom lacked the expertise to identify statutorily-protected information regarding child victims and child witnesses or properly handle FOIA requests," the letter said.

"My office was told that these personnel were instructed to 'flag' any records in which President Trump was mentioned."

Meta Platforms declined to sign the European Union's artificial intelligence code of practice because it is an overreach that will "stunt" companies, according to global affairs chief Joel Kaplan.

"Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI," Kaplan wrote in a post on LinkedIn Friday. "This code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act."

Last week, the European Commission published a final iteration of its code for general-purpose AI models, leaving it up to companies to decide if they want to sign. 

The rules, which go into effect next month, create a framework for complying with the AI Act passed by European lawmakers last year. It aims to improve transparency and safety surrounding the technology.

Meta isn't the first company to stand up against Europe's new AI rulebook. 

ASML Holding and Airbus were among the signatories in a recent letter that called on the EU to delay the code for two years. Last week, OpenAI committed to signing the code of practice.

"We share concerns raised by these businesses that this over-reach will throttle the development and deployment of frontier AI models in Europe, and stunt European companies looking to build businesses on top of them," Kaplan wrote.

Kaplan replaced former global affairs chief Nick Clegg earlier this year. He previously served as vice president of U.S. policy at Facebook and was a staffer in President George W. Bush's administration.

Consumers' worst fears about tariff-induced inflation have receded, though they are still wary of price increases to come, according to a University of Michigan survey Friday.

The university's closely watched Survey of Consumers for July showed overall sentiment increased slightly, rising 1.8% from June to 61.8, exactly in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate and at its highest level since February. Questions on current conditions and future expectations produced monthly gains as well.

On inflation, the outlook at the one- and five-year horizons both tumbled, falling to their lowest levels since February, before President Donald Trump made his "liberation day" tariff announcement on April 2.

The one-year forecast plunged to 4.4%, down from 5% in June and well off the 6.6% level in May, which was the highest reading since late 1981. For the five-year outlook, the expectation slid to 3.6%, down 0.4 percentage point from June.

"Both readings are the lowest since February 2025 but remain above December 2024, indicating that consumers still perceive substantial risk that inflation will increase in the future," Joanne Hsu, survey director, said in a statement.

Indeed, the respective outlooks in December were for 2.8% and 3%, largely in line with readings throughout 2024, before Trump took office in January.

"Despite risks of rising consumer inflation in the next few months, consumers have well-anchored expectations that tariff inflation will be temporary, and that conditions should improve by the time we enter 2026," said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. "Inflation expectation is an important factor for the Fed and according to this report, the trajectory looks encouraging."

Inflation worries peaked as Trump levied 10% across-the-board tariffs as well as so-called reciprocal duties that he has backtracked on pending negotiations. However, in recent days he has announced tariffs on individual products such as copper, raising the specter of future price increases.

The readings are below their long-term averages, with the headline sentiment index down 6.9% from a year ago and 16% from December. The expectations reading fell 14.8% from July 2024, though the current conditions index was 6.5% higher.

When the Justice Department sold Once Upon a Time in Shaolin it concealed the sale price citing “trade secrets.” Now, after a four year FOIA battle, the DOJ finally disclosed the price.

 Welcome back to FOIA Files! This week, I'm feeling sparks of energy. The government finally disclosed to me the auction price for Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, the seventh studio album by renowned hip-hop group, Wu-Tang Clan. The Justice Department seized the album in 2018 from Martin Shkreli, the notorious pharmaceutical executive and hedge fund manager who was convicted of securities fraud. The government later sold the album but kept the sale price secret. After spending more than four years trying to pry loose that detail, I just got it! Take a trip with me down the Wu-Tang rabbit hole for the whole backstory. If you're not already getting FOIA Files in your inbox, sign up here.

I assume most people know the story by now. Wu-Tang Clan sold the only copy of their 31-track album, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, at auction in 2015 to Shkreli for about $2 million. The album, conceived as a work of art, was pressed onto two compact discs and stored in a vault in Casablanca before it was sold. The buyer had to agree that they would not duplicate it or play it commercially for 88 years—until 2103.

Monday - Friday: 12:00 - 13:00 SIN/HK  |  0600 - 07:00 CET

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is reassessing its flagship $500 billion futuristic city called The Line.

The public investment fund has tapped consulting firms to conduct a strategic review into the feasibility of the 105-mile linear city, located at Neom — itself a huge new development in Saudi Arabia.  

Neom confirmed the news, first reported by Bloomberg, saying that strategic checks are "common practice" on long-term megaprojects.

But the move comes amid global scrutiny of Saudi Arabia's ambitious infrastructure agenda, as well as growing pressure on public finances.

Neom did not detail what the review would be focused on, but "it's likely that it's going to look at technical feasibility, financing and also economic impact," according to Tim Callen, a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute. 

"I think these are all areas where people have had questions in the past; is the technology there to actually achieve what Neom wants to do? Is the cost of development too high? That's clearly become an even more pressing issue as oil prices have headed down the last couple of years," Callen told CNBC's Access Middle East on Friday. 

The site of The Line, in Saudi Arabia's northwestern desert, is currently a sprawling construction site replete with cranes and pile drivers, and a recently built road. Long parallel tracks cut through the sand, comprising the spine of what planners say will be a high-speed rail system.

It's designed to be a high-tech city sandwiched between two glass skyscrapers — each more than 1,600 feet high — which the Saudi government says will eventually house 9 million people.

The project is just one of the hyper-futuristic venues planned in Neom, the brainchild of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a region that the kingdom hopes will bring millions of new residents to Saudi Arabia and revolutionize living and technology in the country.

It's a core pillar of Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil revenues and create new jobs and industries for its burgeoning young population.

The cost of Neom as a whole has been estimated to be as high as $1.5 trillion. After many years of seemingly unlimited spending, 2024 began to see an abrupt shift as the Saudi budget deficit grew and the price of a barrel of oil fell well below what the kingdom needs to balance its budget.

"It's clear that if oil prices, as you were saying earlier, are around $70 a barrel, that's a very different environment than if they are $100 a barrel, where they were on average in 2022," the Arab Gulf States Institute's Callen said. International benchmark Brent crude was trading at $70.15 per barrel at 2:15 p.m. London time on Friday.

"So many of these projects are going to have to be reassessed, reprioritized. Does that mean Neon is not going to happen? No, I think Neom will definitely continue in some form. But whether it's on a smaller scale and over a longer duration than originally envisaged, is quite likely, I think."

There has also been a fair amount of criticism for what some in the kingdom describe as a "yes-man" mentality at Neom, where consultants and advisors are said to provide highly optimistic forecasts and cost-revenue projections in an effort to stay in their employers' favor.   

"I don't think expectations were managed well from a leadership perspective at the project level," Tarik Solomon, chairman emeritus at the American Chamber of Commerce in Saudi Arabia, told CNBC.  

"For a project of this scale to succeed, it has to adjust to market realities and it has to build trust."

Solomon praised Neom and The Line as being "one of the boldest ideas I've seen that has actually gone into execution," but added that "the architectural and consulting firms involved have an important role here and they should have more of a sense of ownership and responsibility to carry."

In tandem with the planned "assessment" of The Line, job cuts are planned across Neom as a whole, one consultant who works for the project told CNBC.  

"They're finally starting to make financially sound decisions," the consultant, who asked to remain anonymous due to restrictions on speaking to the press, said.

Neom did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

The AI Race:

BrightAI raised $51 million to sell sensors and software that monitor infrastructure.

While many artificial intelligence tools are aimed at software developers and office workers, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla and former Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker's Inspired Capital are investing in a startup deploying the technology for dirty, time-consuming infrastructure maintenance tasks like pest control and inspecting power poles and air-conditioning systems. 

San Francisco-based BrightAI has raised a $51 million Series A round led by Khosla Ventures  and Inspired Capital, along with BoxGroup, Marlinspike and VSC Ventures. The round valued the company at around $300 million, according to a person familiar with the company who didn't want to be named discussing financial details. Upfront Ventures led a previous round, and the company has raised a total of $78 million.

Amy Shack Egan is no stranger to the demands of entrepreneurship.

In 2015, she founded Modern Rebel, a wedding planning company, when she was just 23 years old.

And in February, she launched Cheersy, a digital platform that connects engaged couples with wedding coordinators. So far, she's raised more than $500,000 in pre-seed funding.

Starting a business "is not for the faint of heart," Egan, now 33, says. "I'm wearing a million hats."

But she doesn't subscribe to the idea that to launch a successful startup, you have to work around the clock and abandon your personal life.

That's just not realistic for founders with children, Egan says.

Already a mom of one, Egan and her husband John found out that she was pregnant with twins a month before she planned to officially launch Cheersy.

"I think anyone, even if they're not an entrepreneur, is like, how the hell do you raise two babies at the same time?" she told CNBC Make It previously. 

Now, she's navigating a daily balancing act between investor calls, strategy meetings and prenatal checkups.

Juggling the early stages of a startup along with twin pregnancy presents "a unique challenge," Egan says, but she's working on achieving balance at work and at home.

Since the twins are due in August, Egan decided to extend Cheersy's pre-seed fundraising round and push back the seed round until 2026.

But she's found that the "hustle and grind" culture of entrepreneurship leaves little room for life outside work.

One potential investor told Egan that they only take calls with founders on the weekends "to see how committed they are."

"I could not stand that," she says. "That irked me to my core."

In Egan's experience, hustle culture places an even greater burden on female entrepreneurs, who are often expected to simultaneously build their businesses and handle the lion's share of family obligations.

"The game is rigged against you," she says.

Finding her "village" of other female founders has helped lighten the load, along with the support of her husband. Still, Egan found that she had to let go of the concept of "having it all."

"I wish more moms were entrepreneurs, but I also understand that we don't have great support systems in place for them to do this," she says. "You're going to be sacrificing a lot."

Spending time with family and friends is essential to "not being completely burned out at every single stage," Egan says. Still, she often finds herself working at odd hours to compensate for being off the clock.

"I think that the component of mental health and physical health as a founder is often overlooked, and it shouldn't be," she says.

In her view, making time for a life outside Cheersy is the "special sauce" that makes her successful.

"As important as it is to build the company, it's just as important to build a life," Egan says. "I truly believe that to be really great at something, you're not 100% just in that lane."

In this article

Chevron has completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess, after prevailing against Exxon Mobil in a legal dispute over offshore oil assets in the South American nation of Guyana.

The ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce is a huge win for Chevron, which had sought to buy Hess to gain access to the vast Guyana oil reserves.

"We have maintained from the beginning that this is the outcome that we expected. It's a straightforward interpretation of contract language, and we're very pleased that the transaction has now closed," said Chevron CEO Mike Wirth on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Friday. "Good for Chevron and also good for the industry because it affirms a long-standing practice that asset level rights of refusal don't apply in corporate level M&A transactions."

Exxon CEO Darren Woods first revealed the dispute's outcome to CNBC's Becky Quick earlier Friday.

Chevron shares were more than 1% lower during Friday's session after rising more than 2% in the premarket on the announcement. Exxon stock, meanwhile, fell more than 3%.

"We disagree with the ICC panel's interpretation but respect the arbitration and dispute resolution process," Exxon said in a statement Friday.

The dispute had created significant uncertainty over whether Chevron's acquisition of Hess would close, weighing on Chevron's stock performance. The transaction would have failed if Exxon had prevailed.

Exxon and China National Offshore Oil Corp. had filed an arbitration case with the ICC, claiming a right of first refusal over Hess' assets in the Stabroek Block, an oil development off the coast of Guyana.

Hess has a 30% stake in the oil patch, while Exxon leads the project with 45% and CNOOC maintains 25%.

"We welcome Chevron to the venture and look forward to continued industry-leading performance and value creation in Guyana for all parties involved," Exxon said.

As the combination moves ahead, Wirth told CNBC said he anticipates "some" headcount reductions. Chevron had already been reducing staff, after announcing in February plans to lay off 15% to 20% of its workforce in an effort to cut costs.

"We'll integrate the two companies. As is typical in a deal like this, there are some overlaps, and so you'll see some reductions," Wirth said. "But our industry is like many others where you have to continually look to be efficient, and technology evolves. It's a competitive world out there."

One of the most prolific Wall Street investors you've never heard of is preparing to launch a hedge fund.

He's never been written about in a mainstream news article, but in certain quant finance circles, Hao Zhang is a revered figure. For 17 years, up until 2024, the quant researcher produced some of the most valuable trading signals at $60 billion hedge-fund giant Two Sigma.

A pioneer in applying machine learning to markets at Two Sigma, Zhang is now planning to hang out his own shingle. He's in the early stages of talking to potential investors and hedge fund service providers, according to five people who've been briefed on the plans.

Zhang intends to call his firm Hippocampus Capital Management, the sources said, and is targeting a launch date in early 2026, one of the people said. It's not clear how much capital he's looking to raise. Zhang's contract with Two Sigma prohibited him from raising money from investors before July 1, the people said.

Industry sources expect the launch to generate significant interest from investors, given Zhang's reputation and track record. His alpha research has been responsible for billions in trading profits for Two Sigma over the course of his career, the people said.

Zhang did not respond to requests for comment. Two Sigma declined to comment.

Two Sigma, which has 1,700 employees today, was a comparatively small firm when it hired Zhang in 2007, operating in what was then the secretive hedge fund niche of quant trading.

The fund was on the vanguard of machine learning, an early artificial intelligence method that helps computers make decisions and predictions, and recognize patterns. Zhang, with his specializations in both stats and computer science, early on developed lucrative trading models focused on machine-learning non-linear techniques — uncovering complex, non-obvious patterns in market data — people familiar with Zhang said. The group that evolved around such strategies took on different names over the years, but staff shorthand was often simply "techniques."

While Two Sigma would pursue other machine-learning initiatives, techniques became the crown jewel and a closely guarded secret. Some refer to Zhang as the "godfather" of the unit, according to former employees.

People familiar with Zhang, including two former Two Sigma employees, said the billions of dollars attributed to his trading models make him one of the top researchers in the company's nearly 25-year history.

The small footprint Zhang does have online comes from university press stories connected to his donations — which have ramped up in recent years — to the California Institute of Technology and the University of California at Berkeley.

Zhang transferred from Fudan University in Shanghai to Caltech in 1997 to study engineering and applied science, later earning a master's in statistics and a Ph.D in computer science at UC Berkeley.

"That training and education has been a cornerstone in my life," Zhang said in the 2024 announcement of his endowment of a Berkeley professorship.

While studying at Berkeley, Zhang lived with another math and stats whiz named Peng Zhao, according to several people who know them. Zhang joined Two Sigma after completing his doctorate; Zhao helped build Citadel Securities, where he was named CEO in 2017.

Two Sigma has historically maintained a low profile, as is common with quant investment firms.

But its last two years have been uncharacteristically tumultuous, highlighted by the long-simmering cold war between founders John Overdeck and David Siegel that burst into public view in 2023. The firm grappled with another scandal that year when a rogue researcher from the techniques unit was accused of unilaterally tampering with trading models, resulting in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and $90 million in civil penalties earlier this year (Two Sigma denied wrongdoing).

A series of organizational reorgs have also transpired, as well as senior leadership departures and layoffs.

Zhang's techniques unit hasn't been immune to the leadership shakeups. Ken Baron stepped down in 2024, and Kan Huang left for Cubist Systematic Strategies last fall. Zhang went on sabbatical last year and departed in late 2024, the people said.

He racked up tens of millions in compensation over the years, according to people familiar with the matter, which will come in handy in launching Hippocampus. Quant fund startups are notoriously expensive to get off the ground — costing millions for the necessary data and technology — and can take years to yield returns.

The U.S. has doubled down on its plan to impose higher tariffs on the European Union next month, seeking to ramp up pressure on the bloc to reach a deal.

With less than two weeks to go until U.S. President Donald Trump's Aug. 1 deadline, the EU continues to negotiate with U.S. trade officials, while drawing up a series of possible countermeasures if a deal is not forthcoming.

On Friday afternoon, the Financial Times reported that Trump was now demanding a minimum of 15-20% tariffs on imports from the EU.

Earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had said the EU continues to be "very eager" in negotiating a trade agreement.

The U.S. president, whose trade war tactics have earned him the TACO nickname, will not accept a postponement of the Aug. 1 deadline, Leavitt added Thursday.

TACO stands for "Trump always chickens out" in reference to the president's tendency to date to announce high import tariffs, only to later delay or lower them.

Michal Baranowski, Polish undersecretary of state at the ministry of economic development and technology, said that, as work continues in a bid to reach a deal, the first part of the EU's strategy is to negotiate with U.S. officials in good faith.

"The second one is, let's prepare for countermeasures in case we don't [reach a deal]. And we have countermeasures on both the steel and aluminium tariffs as well as the initial package of 72 billion [euros] for so-called reciprocal tariffs," Baranowski told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Friday.

"Point three, we are comparing notes with other countries that are affected by U.S. tariffs, not to necessarily coordinate but to get a sense of where everyone else is, because the other countries negotiating with the U.S. are a bit on the same wagon," he continued.

"Fourth, we are really strengthening European competitiveness."

Poland's Baranowski said the EU represents the "most vital economic relationship" for the U.S., adding that Washington has "as much to gain or to lose from this relationship as Europe."

His comments come shortly after the EU's top trade negotiator Maros Sefcovic traveled to Washington for further trade talks.

The prospect of fresh U.S. tariffs represents a major blow to the EU. The 27-nation bloc had been scrambling to secure a preliminary agreement to spare it from receiving a Trump letter dictating a new, across-the-board tariff on its exports to the U.S.

The U.S. and EU have the largest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world, representing almost 30% of global trade in goods and services, and accounting for 43% of the global gross domestic product (GDP), according to EU figures.

Last year alone, the value of EU-U.S. trade amounted to 1.68 trillion euros ($1.96 trillion), equivalent to roughly 4.6 billion euros of trade per day.

Trump has repeatedly hit out at the EU for what he perceives to be an unfair trading relationship, often citing the EU's trade surplus with the U.S.

As part of its push to reach a U.S.-EU framework trade deal, the European bloc is said to be planning to offer the U.S. tit-for-tat tariff reductions on cars.

The move, as reported by the Financial Times on Thursday, would see the EU drop its 10% duties on U.S. car exports if the Trump administration reduces its own tariffs on the sector to below 20%.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, declined to comment on the report when contacted by CNBC on Friday.

The U.S. president imposed 25% tariffs on foreign-made vehicles and parts earlier in the year, hitting companies across Europe particularly hard.

Sweden's Volvo Cars, for instance, on Thursday reported a sharp decline in second-quarter operating profit, saying the result reflects an ongoing challenging environment for the industry. The automaker, which is seen as one of the most exposed European automakers to U.S. tariffs, was the first regional carmaker to release results in what is expected to be a bruising earnings season.

Even Google's head of Android, Sameer Samat thinks the computer science major needs a rebrand.

"It is thought of as, 'go learn how to do Java coding,'" Samat said of the major, adding that if that's what you want to do, "you don't need a degree."

That's not how Samat, who studied computer science himself at UC San Diego, views a major in computer science.

"It's definitely not learning to code," Samat said. "It is the science, in my opinion, of solving problems."

While coding is a skill taught as part of the major, the discipline is more about breaking down problems, learning how to design a system, and collaborating on those tasks, Samat said.

As software engineering becomes more automated, more individuals are beginning to question the practicality of pursuing a computer science degree. AI is increasingly handling fundamental tasks like coding, making it harder for some computer science graduates to secure full-time positions and internships.

To be clear, Samat still thinks the degree is valuable and that "learning to code is really important," even as tools like Codex become more prominent and companies like Google and Meta and generate some code with AI.

The head of Android said that when he learned to code, people had just stopped learning Assembly, a low-level programming language, and started coding in other languages. Samat said he still learned how to write code with Assembly because it was instructive on how the machine underneath works. 

There will always be a higher, more abstract language that computer programmers will learn to build new technology, Samat said.

"Maybe someday it'll be natural language, where we're just talking about what we want, and something is building the underlying software for you," Samat said. But he doesn't think that time will come for "a while."

Students shouldn't become computer science majors just because they think others will find it valuable, Samat said. The Android executive said that mindset won't necessarily be shared by their prospective employer, and job seekers should have "passion" outside of computer science.

"I don't think that the degree enough is enough to make yourself relevant for some of the most important companies," Samat said, adding that you need to take it "to the next level."

Samat draws from personal experience, having launched two startups in his early twenties, one of which led to an introduction to Sergey Brin. He said that building a startup early in his career ultimately made him a more effective contributor when he later joined Google.

Whatever other interest you have, said Samat, "I think it's really important that it be something that you're really excited about going deep in and really becoming a 5% top expert in the field."

The European Union has reached an agreement on a new sanctions package against Russia, which includes a lower price cap for Moscow's crude oil barrels.

Within a year of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the G7 and EU restricted the price at which non-G7 countries could continue purchasing Moscow's crude and oil products while using shipping and logistical services from G7 companies.

The measures aimed to limit Russia's oil revenues — the backbone of its economy and war coffers — while retaining the country's supplies in the market to avoid a major shortage.

The price cap agreed in December 2022 banned access to G7 transport, insurance and reinsurance services if non-G7 buyers paid more than $60 per barrel for crude. Formerly a staple of European refiners' intake, Russian crude now primarily heads to buyers in China and India.

Russia's crude production averaged 9.19 million barrels per day in June, according to the International Energy Agency's July report. The price cap measures have also shifted the transport of some of Russia's volumes to a so-called shadow fleet of off-radar tankers and shell companies.

EU policymakers on Friday signaled the Russian oil price threshold would be lowered as part of a newly agreed sanctions package.

"I welcome the agreement on our 18th sanctions package against Russia. We are striking at the heart of Russia's war machine. Targeting its banking, energy and military-industrial sectors and including a new dynamic oil price cap," EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on social media.

The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas concurred that a "lower oil price cap" was part of the freshly agreed measures, also noting that the bloc had, for the first time, sanctioned Russian oil producer Rosneft's largest refinery in India.

Neither official explicitly named the level of the new price cap. 

The new price cap on Russian crude will remain flexible in line with market dynamics and will be set at just above 47 dollars per barrel at current market prices, according to four European officials who spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic.

CNBC has reached out to Canada, holder of the G7's yearly rotating presidency in 2025, for comment on whether the group endorses the lowered threshold. CNBC has also contacted Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Energy for comment.

The price cap amendment is part of a broader European push to further pressure Russia to cease hostilities in Ukraine.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially took a more conciliatory tone toward the Kremlin than his predecessor Joe Biden after taking office in January, but has shown signs of diminishing patience in the face of stalled negotiations to broker a ceasefire.

U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham has recently hinted at the possibility of U.S. measures against countries that buy Russian oil, in an attempt to "give President Trump a congressional sledgehammer — if needed — to end this bloodbath."

Buyers such as India have previously defended their right to purchase discounted Russian oil, citing the national interest to secure the most affordable energy resources.

Oil markets have been rocked by supply stability concerns in recent months, as escalating tensions between Israel and Tehran raised the specter of flow disruptions in both Iran and the broader oil-rich Middle East.

In this article

Shares of Swedish defense giant Saab jumped on Friday morning, after the company reported stronger-than-expected profit and sales growth for the second quarter.

Shares were last seen trading 14.3% higher at 7:01 E.T.

Saab's operating income for the second quarter came in at 1.98 billion Swedish kronor ($200 million), marking a 49% year-on-year jump and a beat on the 1.71 billion krona expected by analysts polled by LSEG.

Quarterly sales rose by a better-than-expected 30% year-on-year.

The company also hiked its 2025 outlook on Friday, raising its full-year organic sales growth projection to a range of 16% to 20%, up from its previous forecast of between 12% and 16%.

Saab's shares have surged 131% since the beginning of the year, according to LSEG data.

The stock is one of many in the European defense space that has benefited from a broad regional push to ramp up security budgets.

On Wednesday, the European Commission unveiled a proposal for a 2 trillion euro budget that would include a significant bump in funding for defense. It comes as part of what officials have labelled Europe's "era of rearmament," which has already seen the bloc unveil plans to mobilize as much as 800 billion euros ($928 billion) to help member states hike spending on national security.

Meanwhile, members of the NATO military alliance recently agreed to hike their defense spending targets to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP).

Speaking to CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday, Saab CEO Micael Johansson said activity in the European defense market was "really high," but that Saab had "a great portfolio supporting the demand in the market."

"What you see in this quarter is that we are ramping up dramatically," he said. "We have a number of campaigns going now, there's a big interest and it's ramped up a bit lately."

When it comes to the regional defense spending boost — which was triggered after U.S. President Donald Trump pushed for Europe to take greater ownership of its own security — Johansson said Europe needed to take the opportunity to bolster its defense sector.

"The U.S. administration rightly is saying we have to step up in Europe and take a big responsibility for our own security," he told CNBC.

"So, many countries are now boosting their own defense industries. I do want to see a level playing field, of course, in terms of competition in the market, but I do think we need to buy more European as well — even though we need to have a strong transatlantic link … we have to have this strong European defense industrial base to manage the aggressive neighbor to the east for a long time going forward."

In a note on Friday, Citi analysts reiterated their "Sell" rating on Saab stock, while conceding that the company had had "a very strong quarter."

They nevertheless added that their valuation models still pointed to a target price of 374 Swedish krona. After Friday's rally, that would mark a decline of around 31% from current prices.

"There is currently a strong upwards momentum in European defense spending," they said. "We estimate it will peak at 3.5% of GDP and we are skeptical of further increases as governments have other uses of cash."

Netflix used generative AI to save money on a recent production — and the company's co-CEO said he was "thrilled" with the results.

Ted Sarandos revealed on Thursday that the streamer used the technology when making "The Eternaut," an Argentine production based on a popular sci-fi comic.

Sarandos said the show is the first Netflix title to use fully AI-generated shots in its final footage, with a sequence that shows the collapse of a building in Buenos Aires. Without AI, Sarandos said, such an effect would not have been cost-effective for a production the size of "The Eternaut."

"In fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with visual, traditional VFX tools and workflows," Sarandos told analysts during Netflix's quarterly earnings call.

Sarandos said everyone was "thrilled" with the final product.

"The creators were thrilled with the result. We were thrilled with the result," he said. "And more importantly, the audience was thrilled with the result. So, I think these tools are helping creators expand the possibilities of storytelling on screen, and that is endlessly exciting."

Netflix is no stranger to AI. Sarandos has previously spoken about the use of AI on Rodrigo Prieto's film "Pedro Paramo" and how much money was saved using AI for deaging effects as opposed to what it cost for Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman."

"In fact, the entire budget of the film was about the VFX cost on 'The Irishman,'" Sarandos said during Netflix's first quarter earnings call in April.

AI remains a thorny issue in society writ large and in Hollywood in particular. Demands over AI usage were at the center of the historic dual actors and writers' strikes that shut down production in 2023.

Fans expressed frustration at Disney in 2023 over Marvel Studios' choice to use AI for credit art in "Secret Invasion," a Disney+ series. Tyler Perry has said he has paused studio expansion plans because of the AI capabilities that are already available.

Visual effects is one area of Hollywood that could be drastically changed by AI, as audiences demand explosive climaxes and superhero features that strain production budgets.

As Netflix's news illustrates, it won't just be summer blockbusters that are changed.

Visitors to the United States will need to pay a "visa integrity fee," according to a provision of the Trump administration's recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act.  

The fee applies to all visitors who need nonimmigrant visas to enter, and cannot be waived.

However travelers may also be able to get the fees reimbursed, according to the provision.

Details about the new requirement are scant, which has resulted in "significant challenges and unanswered questions regarding implementation," a spokesperson from the U.S. Travel Association told CNBC Travel.

However, here is what is known thus far.

How much is the fee?

The fee will be at least $250 during the U.S. fiscal year 2025, which runs from Oct. 1, 2024, to Sept. 30, 2025. However, the secretary of Homeland Security is free to set the fee higher, according to the provision.

Thereafter, the visa integrity fee will be adjusted for inflation.

Who must pay the new fee?

The "visa integrity fee" applies to all visitors who need nonimmigrant visas, which includes tourists, business travelers and international students.

When is the fee paid?

The fee is paid when the visa is issued, according to the provision. Thus, visitors whose visa requests are denied will not be charged.

Does the fee replace other visa fees?

No, the provision states that the new fee is "in addition to" other fees, including regular visa fees.

"For example, an H-1B worker already paying a $205 application fee may now expect to pay a total of $455 once this fee is in place," Steven A. Brown, a partner at the Houston-based immigration law firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC, wrote in a post on his firm's website.

Additionally, the fee must be paid on top of a "Form I-94 fee," which the One Big Beautiful Bill Act increased from $6 to $24. That fee must be paid by anyone who is required to submit a Form 1-94 arrival and departure record, which applies to most travelers.

How can travelers get reimbursed?

To get their money back, visa holders must comply with the conditions of the visa, which includes "not accept[ing] unauthorized employment," and not overstay the visa validity date by more than five days, according to the provision.

Reimbursements will be made after the travel visa expires, it says.

The fee has not yet been implemented, according to Brown.

It is not clear when it will begin.

"I believe it would need a regulation, or at least a notice in the Federal Register, regarding implementation on collection," said Brown.  

It is also unclear how travelers will pay the fee, the U.S. Travel Association told CNBC.

"The bill directs the DHS Secretary to charge the fee, but DHS does not own the visa application, issuance or renewal process — so where and when would DHS collect the fee?" the spokesperson said.  

In response to CNBC's enquires, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said: "The visa integrity fee requires cross-agency coordination before implementation."

More questions surround how and when the reimbursement process kicks in.

Since many visas are valid for several years, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office said it expects "a small number of people would seek reimbursement."

Moreover, "CBO expects that the Department of State would need several years to implement a process for providing reimbursements. On that basis, CBO estimates that enacting the provision would increase revenues and decrease the deficit by $28.9 billion over the 2025‑2034 period."

Brown said he is advising clients to treat the fee as nonrefundable.

"If you get it back, great. But it is usually difficult to get money back from the government," he said. "I would rather them view it as a 'bonus' if they get the refund."

"President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill provides the necessary policies and resources to restore integrity in our nation's immigration system," a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNBC.

Data shows most visa holders comply with their visa terms. For the fiscal years between 2016 and 2022, between 1%-2% of nonimmigrant visitors overstayed their visas in the United States, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service.

However, an estimated 42% of the approximately 11 million unauthorized population living in the United States entered the country legally, but overstayed their period of admission, the data shows.

Brown said the visa integrity fee will likely impact B visa holders — or leisure and business travelers — and international students more than other types of travelers.

"For B visa holders, they may not want to add an additional $250 per person to their trip costs," he said.

The new fee, plus the I-94 fee, come as the United States prepares to host several major events in 2026, including the "America 250" celebration, in honor of the country's 250th anniversary, and parts of the FIFA World Cup.

These hurdles are compounded by problems at Brand USA, the destination marketing organization that promotes inbound travel into the United States, which saw the One Big Beautiful Bill Act slash its funding from $100 million to $20 million.

The cuts came after the U.S. Commerce Department fired nearly half of Brand USA's board members in April.

Brand USA did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Ahead of the passage of the new legislation, U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman praised the bill's contributions to U.S. infrastructure, air traffic control and border security.

But, he added: "The smart investments in the travel process make foolish new fees on foreign visitors and reductions to Brand USA, America's promotion arm, that much harder to swallow."

Tesla and Waymo seem to be duking it out over who has the bigger size — and size in this case refers to the companies' respective robotaxi boundaries in Austin.

Waymo has been offering self-driving rides to the general public for a few months, and Tesla has been testing out rides to a limited number of invitees last month.

Three days after Tesla showed off an expanded, phallic-shaped geofence in Austin, Waymo on Thursday said that it has more than doubled its service area in the city from about 37 square miles to 90 square miles.

The coverage area includes new neighborhoods such as Crestview, Windsor Park, Sunset Valley, Franklin Park, and more, according to Waymo.

Lovers of robotaxis might have to temper Tesla's and Waymo's ability to please — for now.

For Tesla, unless you're one of the handful of people who received an invite from the company or know someone who got an invite, you'll have to wait until the company opens the service up to the broader public.

It's unclear when that will happen. Tesla's latest announcement of the service area expansion didn't mention whether the company was adding more robotaxis on the road or inviting more passengers.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has pledged that the robotaxi service will ramp up quickly.

A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Waymo said that the service area expansion will allow more people in Austin to experience a fully autonomous ride.

However, the service is only available through the Uber app, which does not allow users to request a robotaxi. Users can only opt in for the option. This means the app will decide to pair users up with a human driver or a robotaxi, depending on what's available first or what's more time-efficient.

When trying to hail a Waymo in Downtown Austin on Thursday, Business Insider found in repeated tests that Uber will pair users with a human driver when the destination calls for going on the 35 highway or MoPac Expressway.

Waymo currently doesn't take public passengers on the highway.

Chris Bonelli, a spokesperson for Waymo, told BI in an email that a rider will likely be matched with an Uber driver if a more optimal route requires going on the freeway.

Waymo employees are currently taking fully autonomous freeway rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, Bonelli said.

When Business Insider set a closer destination that doesn't require a highway or toll, Uber immediately suggested a Waymo.A spokesperson for Uber did not respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump, who has made hundreds of millions of dollars in the White House from his recent dive into crypto, has now signed the first major piece of crypto legislation into law.

During a July 18 White House ceremony, Trump signed legislation backed by the crypto industry known as the Genius Act, which creates a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a popular type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of stable assets like the U.S. dollar.

"This could be perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the internet itself. A lot of people are saying that," Trump said. "What do you guys think? If you say yes, I'm saying yes."

Trump signed the legislation while surrounded by Republican lawmakers who sponsored the bill and crypto executives.

"Nobody's gained the respect in such a short period of time," Trump said. "This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up."

Crypto advocates have argued the law will protect consumers and set industry standards that could allow stablecoins to become mainstream for digital payments and other financial instruments.

Trump's signature came after the House of Representatives this week voted 308-122, with all Republicans and several Democrats voting in favor, to approve the legislation after the Senate voted for the bill in June. 

"It's a very important act. The Genius Act. They named it after me," said Trump, drawing laughs from supporters.

Trump campaigned in the 2024 election on supporting crypto-friendly policies in a departure from the Biden administration.

"It's good for the dollar and it's good for the country. And that's why I backed you at an early stage," Trump said. "And I also did it for the votes ‒ because you did come out and vote, I will say."

In short time, Trump has built a cozy relationship with the lucrative crypto industry and embraced the digital currency to boost his own personal wealth since returning to the White House in January.

Trump has made $620 million from his crypto ventures during his second White House, a Bloomberg analysis found. That includes about $460 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized financial company and platform that sells its own branded tokens. The Trump family has stake in the venture.

Trump's meme coin, called $TRUMP, has also earned an estimated $320 million in fees, according to Reuters, but it is unclear how much has gone toward a Trump-controlled entity and its partners.

In May, Trump hosted a dinner at his Virginia golf club for 220 investors who plowed a combined $148 million into his crypto venture, the $TRUMP meme coin, raising ethics concerns from Democrats and other critics.

Democrats pointed to Trump's growing ties to the crypto world in criticizing the legislation.

“The Genius Act will accelerate Trump's corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market and the reach and profitability of Trump's USD1,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, on the Senate floor in May. "And, for the first time in American history, this bill will make our President, Donald Trump, the regulator of his own financial product."

The Republican-controlled House this week also approved two other crypto bills that still require sign off from the Senate. One measure, which cleared by a 219-210 vote with only Republican support, would bar the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank for cryptocurrency.

Another bill, known as the Clarity Act, would establish cryptocurrency regulations pushed by the industry including weakening the Securities and Exchange Commission's oversight of cryptocurrency. It passed by a 294-134 vote, with 78 House Democrats joining Republicans.

"We're going to be growing it even more," Trump said of the crypto industry, "more than anyone ever thought."

 Institutional capital brings Bitcoin stability and status, but also systemic risk, regulatory pressure, and a creeping erosion of its core ethos. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin is now a macro asset, with behavior increasingly tied to traditional risk markets and vulnerable to the same systemic pressures as TradFi assets.

Custodial concentration is reshaping Bitcoin's market structure, increasing systemic risk and weakening self-custody norms.

A cultural and structural split may emerge, with a “clean” institutional Bitcoin and a “wild” self-sovereign one, threatening the asset's neutrality and mission.

As institutional capital flows in, Bitcoin (BTC) is shedding its outsider status. This evolution brings new credibility and new capital, but also binds Bitcoin to the rhythms of global finance—macroeconomic factors, quarterly rotations, and regulatory compromise. Can the leading cryptoasset keep its soul in the Wall Street era?

Institutional involvement is making Bitcoin less volatile, to the joy of long-term investors and the dismay of short-term traders. However, its entrance into Big Finance means it is now as dependent on macroeconomic conditions and business cycles as any globally traded asset.

This means Bitcoin traders must now, more than ever, pay close attention to global—especially US—economic conditions and policy shifts. The current tariff tensions are just one example.

Analyzing Bitcoin's correlation with traditional assets and credit indicators reveals a structural shift in the asset market since 2018, when institutions first started to take an interest in Bitcoin.

As the recent report by Glassnode and Avenir shows, both the 2018–2022 and 2023–2026 market cycles were marked by strong positive correlations with SPY (S&P 500 ETF) and QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF), and a negative correlation with the US Dollar Index (DXY). Bitcoin now trades like a tech-heavy growth asset: it rises with liquidity and falls with dollar strength.

Yet the most striking—and growing—correlation is the negative one with HY OAS, or high yield option-adjusted spreads. HY OAS measures the extra yield investors demand to hold risky bonds over safe Treasurys. Wider spreads signal stress in credit markets; narrower ones reflect risk appetite.

Bitcoin's deepening negative correlation with HY spreads means it underperforms when credit risk rises. In other words, Bitcoin has become high-beta to market sentiment: it thrives in optimism, and suffers disproportionately when fear creeps into financial markets. This is the price of its growing institutionalization—higher legitimacy, but also higher sensitivity to systemic risk.

On the bright side, this also means Bitcoin is poised to benefit disproportionately from accommodative financial conditions and rising liquidity. Traders can use these correlations to anticipate Bitcoin's moves as part of a broader macro portfolio.

One institutional behavior that deserves more attention is the quarterly performance rotation. Unlike retail holders driven by conviction or speculation, institutions often sell simply to lock in profits for reporting periods. This introduces artificial sell pressure, especially around quarter and year-end closings, which can create false signals in price action.

This appears to be what happened in the final 10 days of 2024, when spot BTC ETFs saw $1.4 billion in outflows, signaling year-end profit-taking by shareholders.

Beyond trading dynamics, Bitcoin's growing institutionalization brings deeper structural and philosophical risks, chief among them, the creeping threat of centralization.

Bitcoin was built as a decentralized peer-to-peer system, but custodial ETFs and funds now hold over 1.4 million BTC—more than 6.6% of the total supply. Public and private companies hold another 1.1 million BTC (5.3%), and governments, mostly the US, around 500,000 (2.4%), according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.

While none of these actors can rewrite the protocol or seize control over the network, they can influence markets, and perhaps worse, they can change user behavior. The rise of ETFs discourages self-custody. For many investors, managing wallets and seed phrases feels like unnecessary friction. But offloading custody to intermediaries may erode the very financial sovereignty that makes Bitcoin valuable in the first place.

There's a broader cultural risk, too. As regulation tightens, we may see the emergence of two types of Bitcoin: a “clean,” regulated version held by institutions, and a “wild” version stigmatized and marginalized, perhaps even censored at the mining or wallet level. The bifurcation might not affect price in the short term, but it corrodes Bitcoin's core mission: to offer a neutral, permissionless money system.

Institutional capital is a double-edged sword. It brings liquidity, credibility, and broader adoption. But it may also burn the very foundations on which Bitcoin was built. The challenge now is not to reject institutions outright, but to understand how Bitcoin behaves in their world, and to resist the capture that undermines its neutrality, resilience, and freedom.

Washington — President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the "exciting new frontier" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.

The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.

"We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me," the president joked in the East Room of the White House. "I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act." 

Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.

The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.

"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love," he said. "Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people." 

David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president "stepped in and saved this bill." Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through. 

"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins," Mr. Trump said. "This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that."

The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed "one-for-one" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, "strengthening the dollar" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a "21st-century upgrade." 

Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed "Crypto Week" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.

"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out," the president said. "You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation."

The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year. 

The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.

The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week. 

Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.

"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED….BUT NO MORE," Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. "THIS IS BIG!!!"

Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence. 

"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval," the president wrote on Truth Social. "This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!"

Bondi said the Justice Department is "ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts." A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.

The crypto rally cooled off on Friday as the "crypto week" optimism over Congress passing landmark crypto legislation and President Trump potentially opening up retirement accounts for digital asset investments turned into a profit-taking opportunity.

Bitcoin BTC$118,738.05 slipped to $117,500 during the U.S. session from trading above $120,000 earlier, down 0.6% over the past 24 hours. It's also now just about flat week-over-week even after Monday's rally to just below $124,000. Ether (ETH) earlier Friday surged to near its 2025 high around $3,700 before turning lower, changing hands around $3,550 recently, still up 4.5% over the last day and more than 20% over the past week.

XRP broke above its 2018 record late Thursday and hit a fresh all-time high of $3.60 early Friday, then retraced below $3.4 retaining 4% daily gain and 35% weekly advance.

The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broad-market benchmark tracking major cryptos, also hit a record high of 4,133 overnight before declining 3.7% from that peak.

On the macro front, a July survey by the University of Michigan showed that consumer sentiment is still down 16% from December 2024 and below historical average despite the recent uptick. Inflation expectations still cooled but remained elevated: consumers expected 4.4% inflation for the year ahead, down from 5% last month, while long-run inflation expectation fell to 3.6% from 4%.

Capping the crypto week, Trump is expected to sign the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act into law, marking this first major federal law designed to regulate the crypto industry.

While bitcoin languished below record levels, rotation to other cryptocurrencies accelerated through the week. ETH and XRP advanced 20%-25% over the past, with other large-caps including dogecoin DOGE$0.2136, SUI SUI$4.0126, and natIve tokens of Cardano ADA$0.8034, Avalanche AVAX$22.84, Uniswap UNI$8.9695 all booking double-digit gains versus flat BTC.

Coinbase analysts, led by head of research David Duong, said in a Friday report that the current rally is "powered by structural strength and steady accumulation, not runaway speculation."

Derivatives markets are not showing excessive froth, global liquidity conditions are supporting risk assets and ETFs, treasury companies show continuous demand, they argued, forecasting that bitcoin has more room to run.

"Pullbacks may occur, but we think current on-chain and market signals argue that bitcoin's advance stands on solid ground rather than late-cycle euphoria," the authors said.

The House of Representatives yesterday passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act alongside legislation for stablecoins (GENIUS Act) and crypto market infrastructure (Clarity Act). While the GENIUS Act has already passed the Senate, the Anti-CBDC bill still requires a Senate vote.

The current version of the Anti-CBDC bill has refined its language to block only retail central bank digital currencies. Earlier drafts could potentially have prevented the Federal Reserve from using distributed ledger technology (DLT) for a wholesale CBDC only usable by institutional users.

The legislation defines a central bank digital currency as “a form of digital money or monetary value that is—    (i) denominated in the national unit of account;    (ii) a direct liability of the Federal Reserve System; and    (iii) widely available to the general public.”

This distinction matters because wholesale CBDCs are not “widely available to the general public.” A Financial Times opinion piece published today suggested the legislation could isolate “the dollar from the rapid expansion of wholesale CBDCs, which allow faster and cheaper settlements among commercial banks and between central banks themselves.” However, this interpretation appears to misunderstand the current bill's scope.

The Federal Reserve began exploring the classification of wholesale CBDCs a couple of years ago in response to Republican opposition to government digital currencies. The central bank distinguishes between tokenized reserves, which represent existing central bank balances using different technology, and wholesale CBDCs, which create separate legal liabilities. Even if the Anti-CBDC legislation had failed to exclude wholesale CBDC, the Federal Reserve could have argued that a tokenized reserve is no different to current reserves. This is one of the reasons why central banks now prefer to use the term tokenized reserves instead of wholesale CBDCs.

(KNSI) — The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, authored and led by Congressman and Majority Whip Tom Emmer (MN-06).

In a vote of 219-210, the bill prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency and codifies President Donald Trump's Executive Order to forbid federal agencies from exploring its development.

In a press release, Emmer explained, “For years, we have worked to educate our colleagues on the dangers of this insidious technology, which would undermine our values and destroy Americans' right to privacy. President Trump understands this threat and has already issued an Executive Order preventing the development of a CBDC. Now, we must codify it to ensure that the United States' digital currency policy remains in the hands of the American people so that any future development of digital cash reflects our American values of privacy, individual sovereignty, and free market competitiveness. We are proud to have led this years-long effort, and thank our colleagues for their support.”

Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, a CBDC is a digital form of sovereign currency designed and issued by a central government, which transacts on a digital ledger controlled by that government. Emmer says a CBDC “is government-controlled, programmable money that, if developed without the privacy protections of cash, could give the federal government the ability to surveil Americans' financial transactions and suppress politically unpopular activity.”

In January, President Trump issued an Executive Order entitled Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology which prohibits federal agencies from establishing, issuing, or promoting CBDCs. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act codifies this Executive Order and guarantees that “future administrations are unable to weaponize the technology against the American people.”

Washington — President Trump is set to sign a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, one day after the bill passed the House despite some opposition from conservatives. 

The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, will be the first major law governing digital currency, establishing a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency, since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats. 

The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. 

Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what they dubbed "Crypto Week" in Congress. The Clarity Act would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. 

Mr. Trump is scheduled to sign the GENIUS Act in a ceremony at the White House at 2:30 p.m. ET.

The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week. 

Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.

"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED….BUT NO MORE," Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. "THIS IS BIG!!!"

Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act takes place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence. 

"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval," the president wrote on Truth Social. "This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!"

Bondi said the Justice Department is "ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts." A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.

BitMine Immersion Technologies sees a massive stock surge driven by crypto hoarding, now holding over 163,000 ETH worth over $500 million.

BitMine Immersion Technologies has recently transformed its strategy by pivoting to cryptocurrency hoarding. The stock has experienced a remarkable climb from under $10 to approximately $46 this month, reflecting a surge driven by the company's asset accumulation. Now holding over 300,657 ETH, totaling around $1 billion, BitMine also has a substantial bitcoin reserve. This strategic move followed a $250 million private placement and has contributed to the stock's impressive rise of about 400% year-to-date. Institutional confidence is gaining momentum with Peter Thiel's Founders Fund acquiring a 9.1% stake, improving market sentiment despite the company operating at a loss. This situation indicates a high-risk, high-reward dynamic as it engages retail investors amidst soaring momentum and considerable volatility.

The stock has surged about 400% year-to-date, now priced around $46.

The company has expanded its Ethereum holdings to 300,657 ETH, now totaling around $1 billion.

A recent $250 million private placement bolstered its cryptocurrency hoarding strategy.

Institutional investment includes a significant stake from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, indicating rising confidence.

The company remains unprofitable, creating a blend of high reward potential with equally high risks.

BitMine Immersion Technologies focuses on accumulating cryptocurrencies, notably Ethereum and bitcoin. It has rapidly evolved its operations to embrace this high-stakes market. Despite impressive growth, technical indicators suggest inflated valuation metrics, with price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios significantly exceeding industry norms.

In the cryptocurrency market, BitMine is navigating competition from established players like Coinbase and Binance, which dominate with exchange services. Additionally, companies like MicroStrategy and Square have adopted similar strategies by accumulating bitcoin, which poses a challenge in attracting mainstream investment amidst growing volatility.

Investors should watch upcoming regulatory changes and market trends strongly influencing cryptocurrency prices. While the recent surge signals potential upside, the inherent risks remain present as volatility can lead to sharp price fluctuations. Monitoring institutional buying and market sentiment will be critical for assessing near-term trading opportunities.

Retail investors need to approach BitMine with a balanced perspective. With its aggressive strategy towards cryptocurrency hoarding, it might appeal to those looking for high-reward investments. However, it's crucial to prepare for potential risks. Given the stock's rapid ascent, adopting a well-planned entry and exit strategy can help manage exposure while capitalizing on momentum.

Investing in cryptocurrency stocks allows you to gain exposure to the digital asset market without directly buying cryptocurrencies. This sector has shown the potential for high returns, albeit with increased volatility.

Institutional investment often signifies confidence in a company's prospects. Large funds, like Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, help attract retail investors and can stabilize stock prices during periods of volatility.

This depends on your risk tolerance. The company's pivot to cryptocurrency is ambitious, but its unprofitable status and market volatility necessitate caution. Always perform thorough due diligence and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.

The primary risks include market volatility, unprofitability, and competition in the cryptocurrency space. It's crucial to assess these factors before investing, as they can significantly impact stock performance.

 Crypto industry hails GENIUS Act as a win, while Senator Elizabeth Warren criticizes it for consumer protection gaps. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering the creation of an innovation exemption within its regulatory framework to foster tokenization, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said during a press event on Friday, according to Bloomberg.

In the Bloomberg report, Atkins said that the SEC staff was considering changes that would promote tokenization, including an innovation exception that would allow for new trading methods and provide targeted relief to support the development of a tokenized securities ecosystem.

Atkins said the movement of assets onchain is inevitable, stating: “If it can be tokenized, it will be tokenized.” While he acknowledged the uncertainty of the outcome, he was optimistic about the industry's future.

On Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act, along with two other pieces of crypto legislation: the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.

In contrast to his predecessor, Gary Gensler, Atkins is known for his pro-crypto stance. Following the passage of the GENIUS Act, Atkins said: “Blockchain and crypto asset technologies have the potential to revolutionize America's financial infrastructure and deliver new efficiencies, cost reductions, transparency, and risk mitigation for the benefit of all Americans.”

The stablecoin legislation is now set to be sent to President Donald Trump for approval. Once signed, the law will take effect 18 months later, or 120 days after the Treasury and Federal Reserve issue final regulations to implement the GENIUS Act.

Supporters in the crypto industry are excited about the bill. Ethereum developer Eric Conner described this act as “the clearest signal yet that DeFi is winning the regulatory argument.”

In an interview with Bloomberg, Atkins responded to concerns that stablecoin issuers may not hold enough hard currency reserves to truly back the value of their coins, stating: “One thing that I think the new bill, soon to be signed into law, makes clear is that these are not securities. It's the banking regulators who will be overseeing them, and I think that's appropriate.”

Still, some expressed a conservative attitude. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the legislation, saying it was insufficient to protect consumers. She said that the bill failed to adequately address the potential risks consumers face, such as market manipulation and fraud.

In the Friday interview, Atkins emphasized the importance of disclosure, saying, “The government should not stand as a blocking agent for those sorts of things, but we need to enable it in the proper way with proper guidelines and proper disclosures.”

 An OG Bitcoin whale's $9.6 billion transfer and the stablecoin audit requirements imposed by the GENIUS Act are sparking correction concerns among some industry watchers. 

Crypto market watchers are warning of a potential correction as whales offload billions of dollars in Bitcoin, even as the US Senate passes three major bills aimed at clarifying digital asset regulation.

A Satoshi-era whale awakened after 14 years of dormancy and moved $9.6 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC), which he received in April and May of 2011, Cointelegraph reported on Thursday.

The whale may have opted to sell due to concerns related to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, as the “US government moves to enforce audit requirements on stablecoins,” according to Jacob King, financial analyst and the CEO of WhaleWire.

“That alone will burst the biggest bubble and fraud in financial history: Bitcoin. It's entirely propped up by fake money printed out of thin air,” he wrote in a Friday X post.

King's comments come a day after US regulators passed three key cryptocurrency bills, including the GENIUS Act, in a 308-122 vote on Thursday.

Other industry watchers are more optimistic. According to Katalin Tischhauser, head of investment research at digital asset bank Sygnum, the GENIUS Act provides “clear regulatory frameworks and compliance pathways” for the “legal recognition of stablecoin as settlement instruments.”

Despite the initial concerns, long-term Bitcoin whales may not “care all too much about the bill,” according to Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.

“Even without regulation, you still held for several years and have now reached incredible levels of wealth,” he told Cointelegraph, adding:

The Satoshi-era whale realized a more than 2.4 million percent increase over 14 years, after holding the Bitcoin stash since 2011, when BTC was trading below $30.

“While the whale's selling may not have occurred due to correction concerns, some investors may still await a pullback, explained the analyst, adding:

Nansen's analysis of the options data indicates that the sentiment is “mildly bullish but still placing bets that cover both directions.”

Meanwhile, the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds logged the 11th consecutive day of net positive inflows, amassing over $522 million worth of investments on Thursday, Farside Investors data shows.

The hope is to create an AI ecosystem driven not by statistical guesswork, but by logic, rules, and transparency, says David de Hilster, a professor in Northeastern's College of Engineering. 

This fall, students at Northeastern University's Miami campus will have the opportunity to join a new club with an ambitious mission: to design and build decentralized AI systems using the blockchain and a programming language called NLP++.

The club — open to all students — is being launched by David de Hilster, an engineering professor and longtime computer language  developer. It will serve as a collaborative hub for students interested in AI, language, and distributed systems, and will be tasked with creating the foundational framework to integrate de Hilster's logic-based programming language into the blockchain.

The hope is to create an AI ecosystem driven not by statistical guesswork, but by logic, rules, and transparency, he says.

“The goal is to create an open, decentralized ecosystem for developing, maintaining and using linguistic resources — for every human language and topic domain,” de Hilster says. “Without the blockchain, NLP++ is a standalone programming language. With the blockchain, NLP++ becomes replete with dictionaries, knowledge and algorithms that perform at human level and in a trustworthy manner.”

A product of the modern web, a blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger that stores records of transactions across a cluster of computer systems. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum are built on the blockchain.

Twenty-five years ago, de Hilster set out to develop a method for computers to analyze and interpret text the same way that humans think. The result was Natural Language Processing ++, or NLP++, a computer programming language he co-developed.

He says it could one day be used to create digital assistants that use logic and rule-based thinking to answer questions — a notable departure from the probability-based technologies that power today's popular chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude.

While NLP++ may provide the foundation, equally important is the data needed to create those AI-based systems. But high-quality data collection can be hard, especially if done manually, collaboratively and transparently — which is where the blockchain comes in.

One of the blockchain's primary advantages, de Hilster says, is that it is not operated or owned by any one private entity. The decentralized nature ensures transparency and allows for open access to all linguistic resources built on the NLP++ platform.

“The idea will be that when we have people writing algorithms to do something — let's say an intelligent agent for sports — and then write that in NLP++ as part of the blockchain, people can use it,” he says.

Down the line, de Hilster and his team plan to create an NLP coin to financially incentivize contributors to develop and maintain these resources.

While the club will begin designing the system this fall, fully implementing NLP++ into the blockchain will likely take years. But de Hilster believes the payoff could be transformative.

Unlike ChatGPT and similar tools, a digital assistant built with NLP++ would not rely on vast datasets and probabilistic models to generate responses. Instead, it would tap into structured, blockchain-hosted rules and logic — functioning more like a reasoning human than a predictive machine, de Hilster says. 

“We want to do trustworthy NLP, and the way you do that is you have to do it like humans — humans do not use probabilities by reading lots of stuff to understand,” de Hilster says. “We have rules. If I give you 100 sentences in English, every person who speaks English could tell me which ones are and which ones aren't.”

Prices for bitcoin BTC$118,738.05 and ether (ETH) have risen 29% and 9% this year, and traders are positioning for further upside in the major cryptocurrencies.

Data from leading crypto options exchange Deribit showed that traders have placed $2.36 billion in notional open interest in the $140,000 strike call option, making it the most popular bet on the platform. This robust positioning extends to the $120,000 and $130,000 call strikes.

In stark contrast, the most popular put option at the $100,000 strike holds only half the open interest of the top call, underscoring the strong bullish sentiment in the market.

The ether options paint a similar bullish picture. As of the time of writing, the $4,000 call was the heaviest, with a notional open interest of $650.8 million, according to data source Amberdata. Meanwhile, nearly $280 million was locked in the call option at the $6,000 strike.

A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish.

Market flows over decentralized platforms also paint a bullish picture for ether.

On Derive, 25% of ETH's trading volume of the past 24 hours has been concentrated in calls between $3,000 and $4,000 for the July 25 expiry, the exchange told CoinDesk. Additionally, 8% of the July 25 expiry open interest is locked in the $4,000 call.

"[Its] a strong signal that traders are aligned on a fast, continued breakout and reflects a growing appetite for leveraged long exposure as bullish conviction builds," Dr. Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive, told CoinDesk.

The bullish bias for ETH is likely catalyzed by positive regulatory developments in the U.S, particularly the passage of the GENIUS Act stablecoin regulation. The bill is said to come down heavy on yield-bearing stablecoins, marking a positive pivot for the Ethereum-dominated decentralized finance.

"We anticipate two major shifts in a post-GENIUS landscape. First, treasurers seeking crypto-denominated yield will increasingly turn to native ETH staking and transparent restaking vaults. Second, yield-bearing tokens will evolve into clearly defined, auditable assets—distinct from stablecoins and unburdened by legacy regulatory assumptions," Daniel Liu, CEO of Republic Technologies, said in an email.

"Both trends are likely to increase transaction activity and fee generation on Ethereum, reinforcing the long-term value of ETH and strengthening the case for institutional treasuries holding it," Liu added.

Oops, something went wrong

It may have taken five months, but investors who bought Ethereum when Eric Trump said to buy the asset are finally in the green.

“In my opinion, it's a great time to add ETH,” he said on X on Feb. 3, adding, “You can thank me later,” in a now-deleted portion of the post.

Eric Trump's post came after ETH had retreated below the $3,000 price point following President Donald Trump‘s initial announcement of tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico days before.

While Trump's post framed Ethereum's reaction to the news as a potential knee-jerk, it ended up as an enduring sell-off. The asset tanked by an additional 41% in the following weeks, turning his post into a meme.

But Trump may have the last laugh following the cryptocurrency market's recent resurgence. At last look, ETH is back above $3,000, over 3% higher than when he said to buy.

Several factors are driving Ethereum's recent bounce. For one, the asset appears to be benefiting from broader cryptocurrency market risk-on sentiment as Bitcoin surges to new record highs.

Meanwhile, ETH is also experiencing a positive vibe shift as the tokenization narrative has taken off in recent weeks. The narrative has been stoked as lawmakers advance a stablecoin regulatory framework called the GENIUS bill and as Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) has launched tokenized equities on the Ethereum Layer 2 chain, Arbitrum.

Beyond the tokenization narrative, the Ethereum corporate treasury meta is gaining momentum. In the past few days alone, Sharplink (NASDAQ:SBET), the Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin-backed gaming company turned treasury firm, has acquired over $100 million worth of ETH, bringing its total to nearly $700 million worth of ETH. Meanwhile, BitMine (NYSE:BMNR), the Tom Lee-backed Bitcoin miner turned ETH treasury, has announced that it now holds about $500 million worth of ETH, exceeding its initial private placement raise by 100%.

Amid all these, inflows to spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds have also spiked. Last week, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded their second-largest day of inflows ever.

Amid ETH's recent bounce, $10,000 price predictions have again flooded the timeline.

“Arise Chikun, it's time,” BitMEX founder and Maelstrom investment chief Arthur Hayes said last week, adding, “ETH = $10,000.”

Similarly, EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson has said, “ETH is going to $10,000,” citing anticipated inflows to Ethereum ETFs.

“Most people think the ETH ETF approval is already priced in and it's been a big bust vs. BTC (in terms of assets for ETHA vs. IBIT),” he said. “It's not. Because the real catalyst is still ahead: staking approval, expected before October. Once that hits, ETH becomes the first yield-bearing crypto ETF in U.S. history.”

Jackson added that ETH could soar as high as $15,000 if Layer 2 adoption and ETF inflows beat expectations.

These predictions suggest an over 3x price potential for ETH in the current market cycle.

La société détient désormais environ 120 306 ETH, ce qui la place parmi les plus grandes réserves institutionnelles d'Ethereum sur les marchés publics.

Bit Digital (Nasdaq: BTBT) hat seine Ethereum-Bestände erweitert, indem es 19.683 ETH mit Erlösen aus seinem kürzlich durchgeführten, registrierten Direktangebot in Höhe von 67,3 Millionen US-Dollar an institutionelle Investoren erworben hat. Das Unternehmen hält nun etwa 120.306 ETH und zählt damit zu den größten institutionellen Ethereum-Beständen auf öffentlichen Märkten.

Das Unternehmen setzt den Großteil seiner ETH-Bestände ein und betreibt Validatoren, um Erträge zu erzielen und gleichzeitig die Sicherheit des Ethereum-Netzwerks zu unterstützen.

Bit Digital substantially increases ETH position to 120K tokens, positioning itself as a major institutional Ethereum holder following $67.3M raise.

Bit Digital has made a significant expansion of its Ethereum holdings, purchasing 19,683 ETH using proceeds from its recent $67.3 million registered direct offering. This acquisition brings the company's total Ethereum holdings to approximately 120,306 ETH, establishing it among the largest institutional Ethereum treasuries in public markets.

This strategic move demonstrates Bit Digital's strong conviction in Ethereum's fundamental role in the digital asset ecosystem. The company isn't merely accumulating tokens but is actively participating in network operations through staking and validator services. By staking the majority of its ETH holdings, Bit Digital generates yield while simultaneously contributing to Ethereum's security infrastructure.

What makes this approach particularly noteworthy is how it transforms Bit Digital's business model. Rather than focusing solely on cryptocurrency mining, the company is positioning itself as an Ethereum infrastructure operator and institutional holder. This provides investors with regulated exposure to Ethereum's economics through a traditional equity vehicle – effectively bridging traditional markets with emerging digital asset infrastructure.

The timing aligns with Ethereum's evolution as a settlement layer for stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized applications. Bit Digital's treasury strategy suggests confidence in Ethereum's long-term utility beyond speculative value, focusing instead on its functionality as programmable financial infrastructure with native yield generation capabilities.

NEW YORK, July 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bit Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq: BTBT) ("Bit Digital" or the "Company"), today announced that it has purchased approximately 19,683 Ethereum ("ETH") using the net proceeds from its recently completed $67.3 million registered direct offering to institutional investors. Following the transaction, Bit Digital holds approximately 120,306 ETH.  

"With approximately 120,000 ETH, Bit Digital is positioned among the largest institutional Ethereum treasuries in the public markets," said Sam Tabar, Chief Executive Officer of Bit Digital. "We view Ethereum as foundational to the next phase of digital financial infrastructure. We believe Ethereum's programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets, and we remain committed to scaling our ETH holdings as part of that long-term strategy."

ETH is increasingly utilized across real economic activity, serving as the core collateral layer for stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized applications. ETH's ability to generate native yield and support programmable financial systems positions it as more than a digital asset. Bit Digital sees Ethereum as an integral part of how value will move and settle in modern markets, as a global coordination layer for the emerging onchain economy, and an essential component of future-facing treasury strategy.

Bit Digital operates Ethereum infrastructure as part of its broader strategy to participate directly in the network's long-term growth. The Company stakes the majority of its ETH holdings and operates validators, earning yield while contributing to the security and performance of the Ethereum network. By combining this operational involvement with the compliance standards and oversight of a public company, Bit Digital offers investors regulated exposure to Ethereum's underlying economics through a traditional equity vehicle.

About Bit Digital

Bit Digital is a publicly traded digital asset platform focused on Ethereum-native treasury and staking strategies. The Company began accumulating and staking ETH in 2022 and now operates one of the largest institutional Ethereum staking infrastructures globally. Bit Digital's platform includes advanced validator operations, institutional-grade custody, active protocol governance, and yield optimization. Through strategic partnerships across the Ethereum ecosystem, Bit Digital aims to deliver exposure to secure, scalable, and compliant access to onchain yield.

EXCLUSIVE: Robin Elliott-Knowles and Georgia Kumari Bradburn, the co-directors of CPH:DOX and BFI London Film Festival title The Stimming Pool are among the 13 recipients of the third Independent Cinema Office (ICO) Miles Ketley Memorial Fund bursary for emerging UK filmmakers.

Alice Russell, director of Bifa-winning documentary If The Streets Were On Fire (2023), and Marley Morrison, director of Glasgow audience award winner Sweetheart (2021), have also received awards.

The ICO board has approved an extension of the fund, which had been scheduled to finish this year. The fund will now continue on for three more years (2026 to 2028). The new funding includes a 40% increase in value, meaning the annual budget will now be £7,000 each year. The fund previously had £15,000 to give out across its initial three years.

Further 2025 recipients are writer-directors Abraham Adeyemi, Alix Eve, Arwa Aburawa, Edem Kelman, Gianni Esporas, May Ziade, Raheela Suleman, Theo Panagopoulos and producer Tolu Stedford.

The fund was established in 2022 in memory of former ICO trustee and prominent producer and media lawyer Miles Ketley. Filmmakers are eligible through previous participation in ICO Screening Days.

While several funds focus on supporting production costs, the Miles Ketley bursary can be used to support the filmmaker's professional development, for example providing filmmaking equipment, development courses, project development costs or international festival travel.

Previous recipients include Is There Anybody Out There? director Ella Glendining, After Love director Aleem Khan and Rebel Dykes filmmaker Sian A. Williams.

“We continue to be impressed by the ambition and originality of the work we see from early-career filmmakers, and we know many of them face challenges to sustain that momentum,” said Catharine Des Forges, director of the ICO. “The Miles Ketley Fund is about making those next steps possible, especially for voices that have historically been overlooked by mainstream funding routes.”

For the first time ever, the total value of all cryptocurrencies surpassed $4 trillion Friday before pulling back slightly, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) accounting for over 70% of total market value, driven by surging investor demand and a string of regulatory victories in the U.S.

Bitcoin rose 1.4% in 24 hours to top $120,336, while Ethereum surged 6.4% to $3,647, per CoinGecko data, with BTC's market cap climbing to $2.395 trillion and ETH's at $440.4 billion. Both assets have since retreated, with BTC currently trading at $118,673 and ETH at $3,610.

"The $4 trillion crypto market milestone underscores the industry's rise as a mainstream asset class," Devere Bryan, group general manager of stablecoin issuer First Digital, told Decrypt. "Bitcoin's status as digital gold fuels unparalleled wealth creation."

The surge follows Thursday's bipartisan passage of the GENIUS Act, which creates the U.S.'s first federal framework for stablecoins, and the CLARITY Act, offering a legal structure for broader crypto assets.

Both bills now head to President Trump, who is expected to sign them today.

On the same day the House delivered crypto's biggest legislative victory, institutional investors poured $522.6 million into spot Bitcoin ETFs.

It extends a two-week streak of heavy inflows totaling over $4 billion, the second consecutive week above $2 billion, according to U.K.-based asset manager Farside Investors.

“I believe the momentum will be sustained in the short-term,” Charmaine Tam, head of OTC sales and trading at Hex Trust, told Decrypt. “We did not witness a "Buy on Rumour, Sell on Facts'," after the passing of the "landmark crypto legislation," she added.

She expects the momentum to continue as "other countries will likely follow the US in setting clear crypto rules, leading to even more global adoption" and institutional capital deployment.

Ethereum's market dominance jumped from 9% to 11% while Bitcoin's share dropped 4 percentage points, signaling the start of "altcoin season," according to analysts as investors rotate into higher-risk assets.

"Institutional capital is finding its footing, with Ethereum's surge past $3,600 backed by a whopping $726m in single-day ETF inflows signalling systematic adoption," Sohan Sen, head of Structured Products at Mantle, told Decrypt.

"Beyond the charts, sustained value will premise on live activity at the infrastructure level," Sen said, pointing to Ethereum's role hosting over half of global stablecoin supply as validation that "programmable money is inevitable as table stakes in the future of finance."

Bitcoin's climb to $120,336 comes after completing its strongest weekly performance since May, though analysts are watching for consolidation signals.

QCP Capital shared that the asset "took a brief pause after surging past the $120k mark, triggering profit-taking flows that began to cap the momentum."

“A pullback toward $110k, which marked the previous cycle high, may provide a more stable foundation for the current rally to consolidate," QCP analysts said in the firm's latest research note.

Meanwhile, on Myriad, a prediction markets platform developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, just 7.4% of users believe Bitcoin will close above $122,000 by 11:59 p.m. UTC on Friday.

An overwhelming 94% majority have voted No, suggesting that traders are positioning for a near-term pullback or consolidation.

Circle President Heath Tarbert discusses stablecoin legislation and the overall cryptocurrency landscape on 'Mornings with Maria.'

The Magic City could soon be better known as the "Crypto City," as certain market signals have risen to the surface and now indicate a quiet cryptocurrency comeback.

"I don't think this is a fad or a trend that's going to go away. And I think it's got huge benefits, and I think it's being done correctly now," Property Markets Group (PMG) managing partner Ryan Shear told Fox News Digital.

"Miami's crypto market's quietly coming back," he added, "and I would attest that that's very much true."

Starting in May, PMG launched crypto-to-cash payments for pre-construction condos across its Florida portfolio via publicly-traded payment processing company Shift4. The setup allows crypto holders to invest in real estate while developers receive U.S. dollars, aiming to bridge the gap between emerging tech and traditional finance.

BITCOIN BREAKS $123,000 PRICE RECORD AS LAWMAKERS BEGIN ‘CRYPTO WEEK' IN WASHINGTON

Another Miami real estate project, The Rider Residences, reportedly completed the area's first direct wallet-to-wallet crypto transaction – removing fiat currency from the process entirely – around the same time.

This comes amid other signs of crypto momentum: the Winklevoss twins' Gemini recently opened its first Miami office in the Wynwood neighborhood ahead of a confidential IPO filing; Citadel, which is building its new Miami headquarters, joined Goldman Sachs in backing a $135 million round for crypto firm Digital Asset, as Bloomberg reported earlier this year that they were exploring crypto trading.

"We're seeing a strong wave of activity from companies across tech, finance and digital innovation. While some started in crypto or blockchain, many now span fintech, private capital and emerging investment platforms. They're not just showing up. They're committing," the Chairman, CEO and founder of Blanca Commercial Real Estate – who closed the office lease deal for Gemini – Tere Blanca also told Fox News Digital.

"Miami gained national attention early on for embracing crypto, but the more interesting story is how that early energy evolved into something much bigger," she continued.

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez provides perspective on the cryptocurrency and how it has contributed to the Miami economy on ‘Mornings with Maria.'

Coming out of the pandemic, Miami positioned itself to be the "crypto capital of the world," with the mayor creating a "MiamiCoin," accepting 100% of his own salary in only crypto and making direct efforts to attract more pro-crypto business. From 2021 to 2023, the Miami Heat's home stadium was named FTX Arena.

Though the FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried fallout rippled skepticism and caution throughout the industry, Shear believes that's all quelled now.

"The way that we borrow money, the way we structure contracts with buyers, the way lenders lend money, everybody got smarter and safer for everybody's benefit. Nobody wants to see a crash like that," Shear said.

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez says city workers can accept salaries in Bitcoin because 'we want our employees to be able to be in an asset that will appreciate and that will hedge against inflation.' 

"The way that we set up with Shift4, the reason it took so long and the reason we did it carefully, and they did it carefully and the escrow agents and all the legal council we got, it was done with the lens of this can go south," he explained.

It's still too early for PMG to tally the numbers of transactions placed, but Shear says PMG has accepted 65 crypto transactions under their previous system and expects to exceed those metrics moving forward.

TRUMP POISED TO SIGN LANDMARK CRYPTO BILL AS HOUSE REPUBLICANS NAVIGATE LEGISLATIVE HURDLES

PMG and Shift4 are encouraging crypto holders to use stablecoins like USDC and USDT to start. But from centralized exchange accounts like Coinbase, you can also pay with assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

"As a new emerging financial instrument, I think there's a lot of people, no different than real estate or other asset classes, that want to diversify, de-leverage, and so forth," Shear noted. "All we do is really create an avenue to do that seamlessly."

"We're de-risking positions by telling people, hey, take some of your digital currency and why don't you diversify and put it into real estate," he expanded. "Frankly, when you take a step back over history, that's what a lot of people are generally doing between investing in a stock market or investing in hard assets or investing in commodities. This is just another avenue. So I think the nature of what we're doing is de-risking by offering another avenue effectively."

"While we're not brokering crypto deals ourselves," Blanca clarified, "we're certainly seeing early signs of adoption. Residential sales using digital currency are already happening in Miami, and that gives us a glimpse of where things might be headed."

"But what really stands out is how the companies behind these technologies are planting roots in Miami, and are poised to expand across the region. That's what's driving meaningful, long-term demand for space," she said.

Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., joins 'Mornings with Maria' to discuss President Donald Trump's push to make America the 'crypto capital' of the world as the House gets set to vote on regulation.

Shear predicts Miami is setting the pace for crypto transactions to be more widely accepted nationwide, as he applauded Congress for setting "the tone for deregulating this industry."

On Wednesday, the House of Representatives clinched a new record for the longest vote in history due to a conservative rebellion over cryptocurrency bills.

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) to establish stablecoin regulations has already passed the Senate. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act), expected to have at least some bipartisan support, would have placed new federal guardrails on cryptocurrency.

However, the last bill, a Republican priority called the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, proved a flashpoint during Wednesday's marathon vote.

'Making Money' host Charles Payne discusses the stock market's reaction to President Donald Trump's latest tariff maneuver and the future of blockchain technology.

"I think we're scratching the surface," Shear said. "I don't think crypto is specific to Florida. Well, Miami seems to be a hub of it."

"Miami is a very forward-thinking city. And it's not Silicon Valley. We're not a tech hub. And it's not New York, but it seems to be a good mix of a lot of the best cities," he noted. "So I think it just works well with the culture down here. And I think that permeates through a lot of industries."

The PUMP token from memecoin launchpad Pump.fun has experienced steep declines following its record-breaking initial coin offering in July 2025. The token launched after a presale that raised $500-600 million in just 12 minutes.

PUMP reached an all-time high of $0.006812 on July 16 before falling to approximately $0.0053 by July 18. This represents a decline of over 56% from its peak price.

The token's initial success was short-lived as profit-taking began almost immediately. According to BitMEX data, 6,042 wallets out of 10,145 ICO participants (59.6%) had already sold or transferred their tokens to centralized exchanges within the first week.

It's been almost 1 week since the @pumpdotfun  ICO💊

From 10,145 participants who contributed $448.5M:

➡️59.6% sold or transferred ➡️37.4% continue to HODL➡️3% increased their holdings

Our quant reveals traders are still BULLISH on $PUMP. Read on👇https://t.co/mIH0MN8Tby pic.twitter.com/pFdAa2FXfH

— BitMEX (@BitMEX) July 17, 2025



Only 3,791 wallets (37.4%) continued holding their tokens. A small group of 312 wallets (3%) actually increased their holdings during this period.

The selling pressure came despite the token debuting at $0.0056, which was 40% above its presale price of $0.004. The ICO set a fully diluted valuation of around $4 billion with a total supply of 125 billion coins.

The widespread selling activity has created downward pressure on PUMP's price. BitMEX analysts noted that such conditions typically lead to aggressive hedging and strong negative funding rates in derivatives markets.

However, the token's funding rates have remained positive. This suggests some market confidence that the token may still increase in value despite the recent declines.

The price drop accelerated on July 17, with the token falling nearly 20% in a single day. This prompted Pump.fun to launch a major buyback campaign.

The platform repurchased $19.2 million worth of tokens, buying back approximately 3.2 billion PUMP tokens. This action temporarily boosted the price by 20%, though these gains proved short-lived.

Beyond the token's price struggles, Pump.fun itself faces challenges with declining platform activity. Trading volumes on the memecoin launchpad have dropped from $11.6 billion in January to $3.65 billion in June.

This decline in platform usage raises questions about the sustainability of PUMP's current valuation. BitMEX analysts warned that if volume trends continue, the token's price may be difficult to justify.

The platform also faces increased competition from new rivals like LetsBonk. This competition threatens Pump.fun's dominant position in Solana memecoin launches.

Security concerns have also emerged since the token's launch. Over 2,400 fake PUMP tokens and 6,700 scam attempts have been detected, including wallet-draining malicious applications.

The PUMP token lacks inherent utility features such as governance rights, staking options, or platform fee-sharing mechanisms. This has drawn criticism given the high concentration of tokens among large holders.

Roughly 60% of the total supply is held by approximately 340 wallets, creating concerns about market manipulation. The token's structure as a meme token without fundamental use cases adds to investor uncertainty.

Despite the challenges, some positive developments have occurred. On-chain data shows recent smart money inflows of about $3.7 million into PUMP.

Some public figures have increased their holdings by around 24% in the last 24 hours, indicating ongoing speculative interest in the token.

OKX exchange listed PUMP/USDT trading pairs on July 18, potentially increasing the token's exposure to more traders. However, this listing has not reversed the overall downward price trend amid continued selling pressure.

A growing number of public companies are buying altcoins like ether (ETH), Solana's SOL (SOL), and XRP XRP$3.2394 as part of a broader treasury strategy modeled after high-profile Bitcoin acquisitions, according to a new report from Animoca Brands Research.

Titled Altcoin Strategic Reserves, the report explains how companies are using financial engineering tools—such as convertible debt and equity issuance—to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, often aiming to hold more crypto per share over time.

This playbook was popularized by companies like MicroStrategy, which holds over 600,000 bitcoin BTC$118,738.05 and frames BTC as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.

Now, altcoins are entering the picture. Firms adding assets like BNB, TRX, HYPE, and FET to their balance sheets are positioning themselves as rare points of access for investors who want exposure to these tokens but lack easy on-ramps like spot ETFs.

The stock market has responded. According to Animoca, companies announcing altcoin holdings saw average share price increases of 150% in one day, 185% in a week, and 226% in a month. However, these strategies carry substantial risk. Altcoins are often more volatile, less liquid, and more technologically experimental than Bitcoin, which could amplify losses during downturns.

Still, if tokens are used in staking or other network-based functions, the report suggests this could enhance liquidity, security, and legitimacy across their ecosystems—making altcoin treasuries a potential accelerant for broader crypto adoption.

Yesterday the House resoundingly approved the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, attracting strong Democrat support with a vote of 308 to 122. Given the Senate has already approved the bill, the legislation is all but final, only needing  President Trump's signature. 

Additionally, two other bills received supportive votes, including the Clarity Act for crypto market infrastructure which also attracted strong Democrat support. It attracted 294 votes in favor with 134 opposed. A bill to prevent a CBDC was passed with a much tighter margin of 219 to 210. However, both the Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act would still need to be approved by the Senate.

On the one hand, the passage of the GENIUS Act is something to celebrate, providing much needed regulatory clarity to an area which is rapidly expanding. 

On the other hand, this regulatory framework comes at a significant cost: it substantially weakens Federal Reserve oversight. While Democrats focused their opposition on President Trump's conflicts of interest, they overlooked how this legislation undermines the Fed's traditional role in financial stability.

Under the Biden administration, many banking regulators went too far in their apparent attempts to de-bank the crypto sector. The reaction has been to sideline the FDIC and Federal Reserve.

While stablecoins are attracting significant hype, they have the potential to become an important payment instrument and type of money. Yet the GENIUS Act gives the Federal Reserve very limited involvement in their oversight. That is largely split between the States, the Treasury and the OCC, which in turn reports to the Treasury.

One example is what happens in a crisis. Consider the speed at which Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. Now think about how much faster a stablecoin collapse can happen. Yet if the Fed has to step in when a State regulated stablecoin has a problem, the Fed has to provide 48 hours notice. By that time, the stablecoin would be finished.

Instead, important powers have been given to the Treasury. A stablecoin issuer has to comply with the GENIUS Act. But under exigent circumstances, the Treasury can decide otherwise. In other words, it can grant exemptions from the GENIUS Act.

Arguably, the Treasury has a conflict of interest when it comes to stablecoins. It is the issuer of national debt, and the stablecoin sector could likely become its largest investor. Therefore, its natural inclination might be to be overly permissive with stablecoin issuers. The more demand for Treasuries, the lower the interest rate on short term debt. And President Trump has made no secret of his desire to see lower interest rates.

Plus, money sitting in stablecoins is not in the banking system, reducing the impact of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy levers. Yet the Federal Reserve still retains  the responsibility for safeguarding financial stability, with one hand tied behind its back. If its independence is uncorruptible, the alternative is to reduce its influence.

The GENIUS Act doesn't just chip away at the Federal Reserve's powers in overseeing monetary policy and maintaining financial stability, it triggers subsidence in the foundations. That could have far reaching consequences for the United States economy and its ‘exorbitant privilege' of controlling the world's dominant currency.

A twisted reactor in Germany just smashed a nuclear fusion record.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Nuclear energy as we know it today is generated through fission—the process of splitting atomic nuclei, which produces electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. The problem? Fission also creates radioactive waste as a byproduct of using uranium fuel.

That's where nuclear fusion—or, at least, the promise of it—comes in.

Nuclear fusion is the same process that powers stars, like our Sun. Inside a star, hydrogen nuclei slam together under intense pressure and heat, fusing into helium and releasing a huge burst of energy. Scientists have long wanted to recreate fusion on Earth because it could deliver clean, virtually limitless power with no carbon emissions and much less radioactive waste than today's nuclear plants.

Fusion reactors are still very much in the experimental stage, and scientists mostly focused on developing a kind of reactor called a tokamak, which uses magnetic coils to confine plasma in a donut-shaped chamber by generating a magnetic field. But the other serious design contender is called a stellarator.

Stellarators are more complex than tokamaks—especially when it comes to their magnetic coils—but they're also more flexible. They can sustain plasma with less power and have design features that make controlling that plasma easier. The Wendelstein 7-X stellarator in Germany is one such monster, and it recently smashed a record in ... well, atom smashing. 

In a recent experiment, researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics sustained a stable plasma reaction in the Wendelstein 7-X for 43 seconds, reaching the “triple product” performance level that's required for viable nuclear fusion and achieving the all-time best results for any stellarator.

Maybe 43 seconds doesn't sound like much, but it's now the longest plasma duration ever in nuclear fusion, including tokamaks. Previously, the now-defunct JT60U Tokamak in Japan and the JET European Tokamak in the U.K—which boasted triple the plasma volume—held the records for plasma duration. 

The triple product measures how close a fusion reactor is to reaching self-sustaining ‘breakeven' energy production levels—the point at which a reactor produces more energy than it consumes. The three factors that go into the triple product are the density of ionized particles flowing through hot plasma, the temperature of ions being fused, and energy confinement time (how long it takes for heat to escape plasma that's not heated again). Longer confinement times mean better insulation.

Unlike fission reactors, which use heavy elements such as uranium, fusion reactors rely on lighter elements (like the hydrogen ions deuterium and tritium), which help them avoid creating toxic nuclear waste. 

The fuel injector for Wendelstein 7-X was created exclusively for this stellarator by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which has also been instrumental in advancing other types of reactors. Several European laboratories—including the Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research (CIEMAT) in Spain and Budapest's HUN-REN Center for Energy Research—contributed to the development of the fuel pellets. 

As plasma was heated with microwaves over those record-breaking 43 seconds, the fuel injector provided the stellarator with 90 pellets of frozen hydrogen ions. The microwave heating system used electron cyclotron resonance—the most effective method for fusion, which uses electromagnetic waves to heat and ionize plasma to temperatures that (in this case) reached a scorching 30 million degrees Celsius (about 54 million degrees Fahrenheit). Because success depended on balancing heating with pulses of incoming fuel, the pellet injector was programmed with automatic pulse rates, which is an unprecedented move.

“The new record is a tremendous achievement by the international team. It impressively demonstrates the potential of Wendelstein 7-X,” Prof. Dr. Thomas Klinger of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics said in a press release. “Elevating the triple product to tokamak levels during long plasma pulses marks another important milestone on the way toward a power-plant-capable stellarator.”

While its mouth is closed, this artifact speaks volumes about the medieval past.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Many ancient wooden structures have been lost to time, as wood unfortunately decomposes quickly. However, water can act as a time capsule—in perfectly anaerobic wetland or underwater conditions, wood can survive for centuries. And recently, archaeologists from Nicolaus Copernicus University (NCU) discovered a striking example of that preservation—a 1,000-year-old wooden face during an underwater research expedition.

In 2024, scientists from NCU's Center for Underwater Archaeology and the Museum of the First Piasts in Lednica found the face submerged in Poland's Lake Lednica. The team recently presented its findings at a press conference. 

The face was carved onto a wooden structural beam called a hook. According to a press release from NCU, the carving measured 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) tall and 9 (3.5 inches) centimeters wide, and features intricate details including realistic eyes, nose, mouth, and oval-shaped head. The wood was also marked with the number 353. 

Experts estimate that the tree from which the face (and beam) were carved the face's tree fell in the year 967, meaning the carving has likely existed for over a millennium. This was around the same time that the founder of the Polish state, Mieszko I, was baptized, and Poland shifted into a state of Christian assimilation. 

This isn't the first face of its kind to be discovered. Similar depictions have been found in other Slavic cities including Wolin, Novgorod the Great, and Staraya Ladoga. According to experts, consistencies between these finds suggest that the beam found at Lednica reflects a local artistic and spiritual tradition, rather than Scandinavian or Rus influence. In short, the recent discovery is just one piece in the larger puzzle of medieval Slavic life. 

“This discovery not only evokes admiration for the craftsmanship from over a thousand years ago but also opens a fascinating discussion about the spiritual life of early medieval Slavs,” Andrzej Pydyn, director of the Centre for Underwater Archaeology at NCU, said in the press release.

Experts suggest the beam on which the face was engraved served as part of the settlement's defensive rampart—and its purpose may have gone far beyond just architecture. The style of woodworking suggests that the face had mystical meaning, and likely depicted a deity, protective spirit, or hero watching over inhabitants of the area. 

Other evidence supports the idea of the being part of the spiritual practices of medieval Slavic society. The researchers also discovered horse jaws and bones around ramparts, which may have come from ritual offerings or protective sacrifices, Mateusz Popek from NCU said. The team also found similar bones underneath houses.

  “The [wood] face is a priceless monument and a rare example of an item combining utility and symbolic functions,” a post from the Museum of the First Piasts in Lednica reads. “The discovery from Lake Lednica not only impresses, but also opens new questions about the life, culture and spirituality of the inhabitants of these lands from over a thousand years ago.”

The expression and location of proteins in tissues represent key determinants of health and disease. Although recent advances in multiplexed imaging have expanded the number of spatially accessible proteins1,2,3, the integration of biological layers (that is, cell structure, subcellular domains and signalling activity) remains challenging. This is due to limitations in the compositions of antibody panels and image resolution, which together restrict the scope of image analysis. Here we present pathology-oriented multiplexing (PathoPlex), a scalable, quality-controlled and interpretable framework. It combines highly multiplexed imaging at subcellular resolution with a software package to extract and interpret protein co-expression patterns (clusters) across biological layers. PathoPlex was optimized to map more than 140 commercial antibodies at 80 nm per pixel across 95 iterative imaging cycles and provides pragmatic solutions to enable the simultaneous processing of at least 40 archival biopsy specimens. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we identified epithelial JUN activity as a key switch in immune-mediated kidney disease, thereby demonstrating that clusters can capture relevant pathological features. PathoPlex was then used to analyse human diabetic kidney disease. The framework linked patient-level clusters to organ disfunction and identified disease traits with therapeutic potential (that is, calcium-mediated tubular stress). Finally, PathoPlex was used to reveal renal stress-related clusters in individuals with type 2 diabetes without histological kidney disease. Moreover, tissue-based readouts were generated to assess responses to inhibitors of the glucose cotransporter SGLT2. In summary, PathoPlex paves the way towards democratizing multiplexed imaging and establishing integrative image analysis tools in complex tissues to support the development of next-generation pathology atlases.

Spatial biology technologies have gained increased attention recently as they provide molecular insights into transcriptomic and proteomic expression while preserving histological context1. The term multiplexed imaging refers to the expansion of antibody-based labelling beyond conventional limits (that is, 3–4 antibodies per section)2,3. Multiple commercial systems are available with varying performance and cost. For example, methods based on mass spectrometry4,5 require specialized equipment and antibody conjugation to metals, enabling spatial projections with high precision and reproducibility at cellular resolution (between 250 and 1,000 nm per pixel). Alternatively, microscopy-based methods6,7 are more economically accessible and rely on the cyclic detection of DNA-conjugated antibody panels or direct immunofluorescence using fixed integrated widefield microscopy. Although such methods achieve an image resolution of 200–300 nm per pixel, there is a trade-off between detection speed and signal amplification. Results from studies that used both mass spectrometry and microscopy-based methods8,9 aligned well with comprehensive reviews of the literature10 that reported panels ranging between 30 and 60 antibodies. This body of work set the foundation for the development of image analysis strategies that focused on the identification of cell identities and states through cell segmentation11,12,13,14.

In 2018, iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i)15 was introduced as an open-source tool for multiplexed imaging and advanced image analysis. These techniques were based on the use of unmodified commercial antibodies in cyclic rounds of immunofluorescence imaging through simple steps of chemical elution and flexible light microscopy. 4i was originally applied in vitro using 41 antibodies at a resolution of 165 nm per pixel, which enabled the detection of functional multilayered subcellular features of cell injury through pixel-level analysis. To our knowledge, there is only one study that recreated the original 4i protocol in multicellular specimens16 with sufficient multiplexed imaging depth (21 imaging cycles for 54 markers) and image resolution (160 nm per pixel) to perform pixel-based image analysis. However, despite being one of the largest and most complex datasets available, the outputs derived from multiplexed imaging have primarily been used to recapitulate known cellular events during organ development. In this context, we postulate that the potential of multiplexed imaging methods to define tissue-based integrative features associated with health and disease remains underexplored.

A study10 that discussed the current landscape of antibody-based multiplexed imaging showed that there is a diverse range in performance among the methods. From all the different criteria that can be used to define the advantages and limitations of each method, we propose two criteria to evaluate the potential to support image analysis tools that aim to integrate multiple biological layers (Supplementary Fig. 1a): the number of markers (panel size) and the image resolution per pixel. Although it is evident that panel size directly affects the scope of processes that can be analysed, image resolution and the biological insights gained from it are harder to appreciate. To illustrate the importance of image resolution, we compared a mass-spectrometry-based method (Supplementary Fig. 1b) and a microscopy-based method (Supplementary Fig. 1c) for analysing kidney samples using markers of cell identity and DNA. This comparison highlighted an obvious resolution mismatch that had a clear impact on the ability to delineate subcellular structures (for example, nuclei and even nucleoli) and the borders of neighbouring cells (for example, renal endothelial and epithelial cells).

Among the reported multiplexing methods10, the average panel size is approximately 37 markers with an average resolution of 267 nm per pixel. The most used systems, such as imaging mass cytometry (IMC; 40 markers at 1,000 nm per pixel) and co-detection by indexing (CODEX; 56 markers at 250 nm per pixel), provide reliable references of current commercial standards. Thus, it is not surprising that most studies in the field of antibody-based spatial proteomics fundamentally rely on single-cell segmentation as a core step, similar to the approaches used in spatial transcriptomics17,18. That is, neither the resolution nor the panel size provide the foundation for more integrative image analysis. Furthermore, most studies of organs that have high cell density (for example, the kidney) typically report cell identity and state19,20 but do not provide integrative data across biological domains. These limitations represent an opportunity for the next generation of multiplexed imaging methods to scale panel sizes beyond current limits. Moreover, computational tools can be built to extract hallmarks of health and disease by weighting and connecting the contributions of each biological layer (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Here we introduce PathoPlex, a scalable, quality-controlled and interpretable framework. It combines highly multiplexed imaging at subcellular resolution with an open-source software package to facilitate integrative analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens (Fig. 1a).

In brief, multiplexed imaging is performed in iterative cycles, whereby indirect immunofluorescence labelling is conducted first, followed by image acquisition by fluorescence microscopy (for example, widefield or confocal) and subsequent antibody elution (Fig. 1a, part 1). To prevent tissue lifting, we recommend coating the glass surfaces with poly-d-lysine for small-scale experiments or with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) for large-scale experiments, as APTES is more efficient at preventing tissue detachment compared with poly-d-lysine (Methods). In this report, our largest experiment included 95 imaging cycles with antibodies against 150 proteins and 20 quality-control imaging cycles with only secondary antibodies for a total of 170 layers. After detailed examination, we included 142 (122 protein and 20 quality control) layers for analyses, which generated >600 billion available pixels. It is worth noting that the tissues remained stable and did not show signs of damage within 95 imaging cycles, which suggests that this is not the limit of the technology.

a, PathoPlex represents a combination between a universal framework for highly multiplexed imaging in pathological tissues (left) and a Python library (spatiomic) to analyse protein co-expression patterns (PCPs) or clusters (right). b, Step-by-step interpretation of generated clusters. c, Summary of all experimental datasets in this study. Scale bars, 50 μm. FC, fold change; p, pixel.

To accommodate the scale of these datasets and to enable modular composition and extendibility of bioinformatic analyses, we developed a high-performance computing library for spatial proteomics (which we term spatiomic) that leverages various algorithms based on graphics processing units (GPUs)21,22, integrates common data formats23 and is freely available as a Python package through the PyPi registry (Fig. 1a, part 2). The package spatiomic features multiple registration algorithms to align images of individual markers for joint analyses. To identify protein co-expression patterns, spatiomic includes modules to preprocess images, obtain a representative subsample, reduce dimensionality using self-organizing maps (SOMs), construct a similarity-based neighbourhood graph and perform graph clustering24. Co-expression patterns can be consistently identified across all images of an experimental dataset and spatially projected. As these co-expression patterns are generated on the basis of pixel-level clustering, from now on, we refer to them as ‘clusters'.

Each cluster has the potential to represent a biological process and warrants further interpretation (Fig. 1b). As a first step, the individual contribution of each marker to the cluster was analysed to define the specific co-expression pattern that each cluster represents. For this reason, the mean normalized intensity (the level of contribution per marker) and the log2-transformed fold change in relation to the mean of other clusters (the specific contribution of each marker) were systematically evaluated. As each marker represents proteins with known or predicted locations, distributions and expression patterns, it can be projected back into space for visual validation. Cluster abundance was used as a quantifiable metric to statistically compare conditions and to isolate differentially expressed clusters. Notably, changes in cluster abundance can result not only from differences in protein expression levels but also from changes in protein distribution (for example, cytoplasmic to nuclear shifts).

As an overview, we first provided proof-of-principle and quality-control datasets in three different organs (<30 markers at a resolution of 160 nm per pixel). PathoPlex was then validated using the kidney as a model organ with high cellular density and structural complexity through in-depth analyses of three additional datasets (Fig. 1c). These datasets were obtained from the following sources: (1) an experimental mouse model of immune-mediated kidney disease (34 markers at 80 nm per pixel); (2) clinical biopsy samples from individuals diagnosed with advanced diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (61 markers at 160 nm per pixel); and (3) research biopsy samples from individuals diagnosed with youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) (142 markers at 80 nm per pixel) without pathological signs of DKD, including a subset of individuals with short-term treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.

Proof-of-principle experiments were performed on the basis of representative samples from autoimmune hepatitis, meningioma and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (Supplementary Fig. 3) and controls in human liver, brain and kidney, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4) showing broad applicability in pathology and a wide potential for marker selection, including transcription factors, enzymes, structural proteins, subcellular domains, cell surface receptors and phosphorylation targets.

Quality-control criteria for PathoPlex were first established in murine tissues and then extended to human specimens. In brief, consecutive imaging cycles of an antibody panel constituted the first level of control. This step was important because incomplete elution might lead to cross-reactivity with subsequent cycles or residual signals from the previous cycle. The second level of control involved direct imaging after elution to confirm the lack of fluorescent signals (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The third level of control included imaging cycles using secondary antibodies without previous incubation of primary antibodies (secondary-only cycles). This step ensured the absence of remnant viable primary antibodies and generated additional layers that could be included in image analyses (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The fourth level of control involved successful re-staining after multiple imaging cycles (Extended Data Fig. 1c). This stage was used to confirm that the epitope is preserved and the effectiveness of antibody elution. Furthermore, we applied practical quality-control steps for human tissue samples throughout 95 imaging cycles. This strategy showed complete elution efficiency using secondary-only cycles (Extended Data Fig. 1d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and  6) and effective re-stainings after 60 cycles (Extended Data Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 7).

Once all the imaging cycles were completed, image alignment was performed to account for potential shifts during the various cycles. It is well established that nuclei can be easily stained, but commonly used labels are either unstable (for example, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)) or expensive (for example, DRAQ5). For this reason, we introduce N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS-E), a pan-protein label commonly used in super-resolution microscopy25. NHS-E consistently generated reference images for alignment and showed equally high performance compared with nuclear references (Supplementary Fig. 8). Moreover, NHS-E can be used to segment tissue-containing areas to limit the analysis of regions with potential nonspecific binding. Unlike DAPI or DRAQ5, which need constant re-staining every imaging cycle, NHS-E requires a single application at the beginning of the protocol and remains stable for up to 95 cycles.

PathoPlex combines different strategies to optimize performance and to minimize the potential introduction of batch effects, including adaptable microscopy, accessible and customizable imaging set-ups and low-cost automatization of liquid handling (Extended Data Fig. 2a). PathoPlex can be implemented using any inverted system for fluorescence microscopy, including widefield, spinning disk and confocal, which provides flexibility in terms of image resolution, scanning time and file size (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

It is worth mentioning that classical pathology protocols and some multiplexing technologies may inadvertently introduce batch effects, as specimens are processed as individual slides. By contrast, PathoPlex uses imaging chambers that enable the parallel processing of multiple tissues in single runs. Each imaging chamber is organized as an independent and self-contained experiment by including both control and experimental samples (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Considering the size of average unmodified histopathological samples, commercial solutions can be used to process between 2 and 24 intact samples at the same time (Extended Data Fig. 2d). However, as the number of wells increases, manual pipetting increases the likelihood of user error. Although this source of error can be mitigated through automation, commercially available liquid-handling systems are often expensive and not accessible to the wider scientific community. For this reason, PathoPlex introduces two practical 3D printing-based strategies to simplify liquid handling. The first approach involved the creation of a large unified single-well imaging chamber (11 × 7.4 cm) using a 3D-printed frame (Extended Data Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 9a) that can hold 40 intact human kidney biopsy samples (approximately 100 mm2 in size) and even higher numbers of smaller biopsy samples (for example, with size extrapolation, this equates to approximately 77 skin biopsy samples). The second strategy involved the automation of staining and elution cycles. To achieve this, we repurposed a 3D printer as a low-cost liquid handling system, with the printer head controlling liquid addition and removal (Extended Data Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 9b and Supplementary Video 1). This approach produced successful staining and elution cycles (Extended Data Fig. 2g), saving approximately 70% hands-on time with minimal user input (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Although an automated solution for multiplexed imaging using 4i principles has been previously reported26, our universal framework provides users with the flexibility to design their experiment according to their needs, including sample size and image resolution.

Next, we performed a proof-of-concept experiment, whereby PathoPlex was used to analyse the pathophysiology of a well-characterized mouse model of immune-mediated kidney disease27. These mice exhibit a clear disease course that ranges from acute injury to crescentic glomerulonephritis (CGN). That is, protein loss in the urine (proteinuria), the subsequent development of pathological lesions (crescents) in the renal-filtering units (glomeruli) and progressive loss of kidney function. A total of 34 markers were used at a resolution of 80 nm per pixel to acquire approximately 5 billion pixels in 40 regions of interest (ROIs) centred on individual glomeruli (Fig. 2a). The antibody panel was designed to detect cell identities, subcellular compartments and signalling pathway activity (Supplementary Table 1). From a total of 33 generated clusters, 27 clusters were biologically defined (Supplementary Table 2). Significant changes in cluster abundance during the disease course (Fig. 2b) were used as a metric to define integrative features (Fig. 2c) that reflected well-characterized pathogenic processes28,29,30,31.

For other comparisons, two-sided Mann–Whitney, Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett T3 or ANOVA with Holm–Šidák tests were used depending on the number of comparisons. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05 or not significant (NS).

Additional histopathological sections from the same experimental animals were carefully evaluated by two expert renal pathologists in a blinded fashion, who were specifically asked to diagnose and stage disease and to quantify structural changes (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Images of CGN were defined by significant vascular injury and the presence of crescentic lesions, whereas acute injury was determined by the vacuolation of tubular cells (Extended Data Fig. 3b). In line with these findings, cluster 26 (which included contributions from early endosome antigen 1 and ezrin) was more abundant in disease than in control samples (Extended Data Fig. 3c), a finding that represented a characteristic feature of acute disease (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Notably, the spatial distribution of cluster 26 corresponded to the location and pattern used by expert pathologists for diagnosis and staging (Extended Data Fig. 3e). This result suggests that PathoPlex can detect pathogenesis-related tissue alterations— similar to those used by human experts—in an unsupervised manner.

Previous studies have shown that modulation of JNK signalling can lead to substantial protective effects in kidney autoimmunity and fibrosis32,33. The proposed cellular targets of JNK inhibitors have mostly been immune cells (that is, activated macrophages). However, effector cells of crescent formation are parietal epithelial cells (PECs). During crescent formation, these cells are activated through processes that are mediated by growth factors (for example, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF))34, and their increased potential for proliferation and migration is regulated through the de novo expression of the glycoprotein CD44 (ref. 35) and the tetraspanin CD9 (ref. 36).

We performed bulk RNA sequencing on nuclei isolated from mice with immune-mediated kidney disease to clarify this issue (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Analyses of the differentially expressed genes (Extended Data Fig. 4b) identified the transcription factor JUN with the highest activity score (Extended Data Fig. 4c), as calculated from the differential expression of JUN-regulated targets (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Notably, JUN has a crucial role in AP-1 activation through JNK, which mediates CD44 signalling37. As a readout of JUN activity, its phosphorylated protein product JUN(Ser63) (pJUN) was included in our antibody panel. Cluster 21 featured pJUN as a top contributor and was consistently increased in both acute and CGN disease states compared with controls (Fig. 2d). Cluster 21 was essentially restricted to PECs and tubular cells, with a high frequency in tubular cells during acute injury and a gradual increase in PECs during disease progression to CGN (Fig. 2e). As tubular cells do not represent an effector population during crescent formation, we turned our full attention to the role of JUN activity in PECs.

As an initial validation step, we evaluated the effect of JUN activity modulation in PECs. To this end, PEC activation (that is, increased migration) was induced in vitro using PDGF36. PEC migration was attenuated with the JNK inhibitor (JNKi) CC930 (also known as tanzisertib) in two independent experimental set-ups. Results from both of these experiments confirmed that CC930 has a direct effect on activated murine PECs (Fig. 2f). In a second validation step, we analysed human biopsy samples from patients diagnosed with CGN to delineate JUN activity during the progression of human crescentic lesions (n = 12 patients and n = 3 healthy participants). Normal glomeruli from healthy individuals and from individuals with CGN showed that pJUN was expressed in scattered PECs without CD44 expression. As pathological lesions in CGN develop in a focal pattern, some glomeruli appeared normal and only a subset exhibited crescent characteristics, all in the same patient sample. Although some glomeruli showed abundant pJUN+CD44– PECs, pJUN+CD44+ PECs were exclusively found in CGN samples (Fig. 2g), which indicated an association between JUN activity and PEC activation in human specimens. In a third validation step, CGN was modelled in rats to test the efficacy of CC930 as a preventive strategy (before disease induction) or as a therapeutic strategy initiated 7 days after disease induction (Fig. 2h). Proteinuria was substantially decreased in the preventative study (Fig. 2i) and glomerular damage was mitigated with interventional treatment (Fig. 2j), which included substantial modulation of CD44 expression in PECs (Fig. 2k and Extended Data Fig. 5). Together, these data confirmed that PathoPlex-derived clusters can identify actionable pathological features with high spatial precision.

Next, we sought to apply PathoPlex to unravel the complexities of human disease. The performance of PathoPlex was tested in clinical specimens with patient-level heterogeneity in one of the most common clinical features of end-organ damage in diabetes, namely DKD38. A total of 38 human kidney specimens (from 18 individuals without diabetes (controls) and 20 individuals with advanced DKD) were profiled in 422 ROIs using 61 markers (Supplementary Table 3) to obtain >100 billion pixels at 160 nm per pixel (Fig. 3a). PathoPlex identified 18 clusters with differential abundance between control and DKD samples (Supplementary Table 4). For example, cluster 19 (with contributors from apoptosis inducing factor mitochondria associated 1 (AIFM1) and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 6 (TRPC6)) was increased in tissues from individuals with DKD and localized primarily in the proximal tubules. This result was corroborated when projected onto conventional histopathology images (Fig. 3b). We validated the expression of TRPC6 in proximal tubules using both immunogold in electron microscopy (Extended Data Fig. 6a) and IMC-based antibody expression (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Analyses of a mouse model of DKD (Extended Data Fig. 6c) also confirmed that TRPC6 expression is increased in proximal tubules (Extended Data Fig. 6d).

RCC, renal cell carcinoma. b, Scheme of cluster identification to differential abundance and cluster definition. We show the example of C19, which represents metabolic tubular injury (with TRPC6 and AIFM1 as top contributors). c, Single-cell segmentation reveals disease-specific cell-level metaclusters (MCs). PTs, proximal tubules; PTMs, post-translational modifications. d, Mean cluster abundances correlate with patient-level renal function (linear regression with 95% confidence interval). For this example, cluster 28 represents ECM remodelling and is inversely associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). e, Unsupervised bicluster analysis for patient stratification differentiates between DKD and control specimens with perfect accuracy and isolates a subset of biologically meaningful clusters. f, Druggabilty profiling of standard care. The top contributors of clusters selected in b were used as a DKD signature that was extended using open-access tools (that is, STRING), and then cross-referenced to the CTD to select a subset of drugs. Multiple medications for the standard care of diabetes interacted with our expanded DKD signature. g, Drug–protein interactions were quantified for our DKD signature. One example is PDE5 inhibitors as potential modulators of TRPC6–AIFM1 through cGMP signalling, which was confirmed through a re-analysis of public single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data47. Differential cluster abundance analysis used a two-sided t-test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. Cluster composition analysis relied on a two-sided t-test with Holm–Šidák correction. Correlation analysis was performed using two-sided Spearman's rank coefficient. For other comparisons, two-sided t-test, Mann–Whitney or Kruskal–Wallis tests were used depending on the number of comparisons. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.

Our analysis revealed multiple additional differentially regulated clusters that reflected known biological processes, including ERK-mediated and integrin-mediated signalling in multiple nephron segments (Extended Data Fig. 7). To connect these findings to cell-level features, we performed deep-learning-based cellular segmentation using CellPose39 (Supplementary Fig. 10) to characterize the co-occurrence of multiple clusters in well-defined cell-level metaclusters. For example, metacluster 16, which was increased in DKD, contained clusters that represented multiple processes associated with proximal tubule injury (Fig. 3c). Notably, a subset of clusters showed strong correlations with kidney function (Extended Data Fig. 8), including cluster 28 (extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling) (Fig. 3d), thereby linking subcellular pathological features to patient-level organ function.

To further validate the biological relevance of PathoPlex-derived clusters, we calculated the multivariate cluster join counts for each biopsy sample independently and then averaged them at the condition level (Extended Data Fig. 9). These subcellular and intercellular spatial networks recapitulated aspects of kidney architecture by arranging them into functional compartments, including glomerular and tubular segments, individual cell types (for example, podocytes) and ECM. Moreover, the networks highlighted pathophysiological changes (for example, an increased connection between proximal tubule microtubules and Ca2+ signalling). Next, we applied a nonlinear co-occurrence prediction model across cell-sized windows (MISTy)40, which identified groups of condition-specific mutually predictive clusters that reflected functional (for example, glomerular, tubular and interstitial) and subcellular (for example, nuclear or cytoplasmic) compartments that defined immune activation, ECM remodelling, metabolic stress and cell injury (Extended Data Fig. 10). We also performed image-level pseudotime analysis with a multiscale model41 to propose a path from individuals without diabetes but with varying kidney function to individuals with DKD. This analysis resulted in the identification of two potential trajectories of pathogenesis that showed a strong association with histopathological changes (Extended Data Fig. 11a). For trajectory 1, determinant features included tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which reflected the loss of kidney function in a subpopulation of individuals without diabetes (Extended Data Fig. 11b). For trajectory 2, specific features included podocyte injury, Ca2+-mediated mitochondrial stress in proximal tubules and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) dysfunction, which reflected diabetic end-organ damage in individuals with impaired kidney function (Extended Data Fig. 11c).

To reinforce the value of PathoPlex as a foundational tool to perform unsupervised disease phenotyping, we used UnPaSt42 to conduct label-free biclustering based on cluster abundances. UnPaSt was able to accurately discriminate between control and DKD samples (Fig. 3e). Bicluster-specific clusters reflected the increased abundance of functional integrity features (that is, podocyte physiology and metabolism) in control specimens, and of pathogenic features in DKD samples (that is, macrophage infiltration, immune activation, AIFM1–TRPC6 signalling, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ECM remodelling, and GR, β-catenin, histone H2B and ubiquitylation dysfunction). In summary, PathoPlex-derived clusters can be immediately used to extend the scope of computational analyses to add layers of biological context (that is, pseudotime, niche profiling and feature subclassification) and to connect PathoPlex to the broader computational spatial biology ecosystem.

Next, we aimed to leverage PathoPlex-derived clusters to infer additional clinically relevant information, such as potential opportunities for drug repurposing. First, we selected the top contributing proteins from each cluster to define a cluster-based DKD signature that was extended using the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes and proteins (STRING)43. Then we cross-referenced our extended DKD signature with the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)44. Notably, different drug classes used in the standard treatment of diabetes45 interacted with the proteins represented in our extended DKD signature (Fig. 3f), including SGLT2 inhibitors38. Next, we analysed a publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset46 generated from recently diagnosed young individuals with T2D without overt DKD and included a subset of patients receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor. This analysis confirmed our extended DKD signature at the transcriptional level and revealed a partial transcriptional modulation in proximal tubules with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment (Extended Data Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 5). This result suggests that individuals with diabetes may benefit from additional interventions to reverse them to the healthy reference state. For this reason, we quantified the number of known drug–protein interactions for members of our extended DKD signature. This analysis led to the identification of potential targets to revert cell communities to the healthy reference state, including phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors as potential regulators of TRPC6 signalling. As an additional external validation step, we used a public single-nucleus RNA-sequencing dataset from a rat model of DKD47 to assess the link between cGMP signalling and TRPC6-mediated mitochondrial stress in proximal tubules (Fig. 3g). Although transcriptomic detection of TRPC6 was insufficient to confirm a direct effect on this target, cGMP modulation was associated with the attenuation of several components of our extended DKD signature. Together, our findings confirm that the applicability of PathoPlex-derived clusters extends beyond the definition of integrative pathological features. Indeed, they can link the spatial context to single-cell transcriptomics and even pharmacological modelling.

Up to this point, our experiments included well-defined disease and control groups with recognizable pathological features identifiable through traditional histopathological methods. In our final experiment, PathoPlex was applied to 18 human kidney research biopsy samples without overt histopathological changes to test the limits and added value of PathoPlex. We aimed to identify early stages of kidney stress in T2D and to further profile the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on these integrative features of cellular stress. To this end, archival tissue specimens from 5 healthy individuals, 6 individuals with T2D not treated with SGLT2 inhibitors (T2D+SGLT2i–) and 7 individuals with T2D treated with SGLT2 inhibitors (T2D+SGLT2i+) from a previous study46 were selected for analysis. A total of 142 markers (122 biological and 20 quality control; Supplementary Table 6) were imaged at 80 nm per pixel, which systematically covered glomerular and non-glomerular regions across 284 ROIs. This strategy generated >600 billion pixels, which contributed to 140 clusters (Fig. 4a). A total of 24 clusters showed significant regulation between groups (Fig. 4b), which revealed specific biological processes with distinct subcellular locations (Fig. 4c). Significant differences encompassed increases in clusters that represented stromal cell filopodia, the mesangial matrix and vascular smooth muscle cells. Moreover, reductions in clusters associated with structural and functional features of proximal tubules (that is, cell adhesion, brush border integrity, JAK2–H2B-mediated cell cycle, mitochondrial integrity and lactate transport), peritubular capillary integrity, mitochondrial and ER integrity in the distal tubule and nitric oxide production in the collecting duct were observed.

SGLT2 inhibitors attenuated changes in peritubular capillaries and mitochondrial integrity in proximal tubules, and increased gluconeogenesis in proximal tubules. SGLT2 inhibitors were also characterized by the decreased abundance in a cluster representing lysosomal and proteasomal stress in endothelial cells. However, SGLT2i treatment did not fully reverse the T2D-specific changes in cluster abundance. First, the fold changes of significantly differentially abundant clusters in T2D+SGLT2i– samples relative to control samples were defined to represent the baseline effect of T2D. Then, the same comparison was performed between T2D+SGLT2i+ and control samples to represent the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on T2D. This comparison indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors promoted a reconstitution of peritubular capillary and mitochondrial integrity in proximal tubules, together with a partial reversal of the increase in clusters representing vascular smooth muscle and stromal filopodia (Fig. 4d). These data demonstrate the potential of PathoPlex to uncover features of injury before disease onset that are inaccessible to classical histopathology.

Finally, on the basis of the two diabetes datasets generated in this study (Figs. 3 and 4), we propose a continuum of early glomerular and tubulointerstitial alterations that precede quantifiable reductions in end-organ function and that eventually converge in DKD. These alterations include an impaired glomerular filtration barrier, podocyte loss, ECM remodelling and tubular injury following prolonged hyperglycaemia (Fig. 4e). Although some early changes seemed to be attenuated by SGLT2 inhibitors, further studies are required to fully profile the potential long-term preventive effects of this intervention throughout the entire clinical course of DKD. In summary, our results demonstrate the utility of PathoPlex to extract meaningful integrative features from even non-pathological tissues. Notably, the framework also provided further pathophysiological evidence to support the use of SGLT2 inhibtors31 as an early intervention in T2D. Our results highlight the potential need for further treatments to optimally preserve kidney health in individuals with T2D at high risk of DKD.

Multiplexed imaging is a rapidly growing field10,48 and its contribution to a deeper understanding of tissue biology is illustrated by the recent generation of organ-level atlases, for example, in placenta8 and intestine9 using MIBI-TOF and CODEX, respectively. Moreover, previous efforts to characterize archival pathological tissues have provided new insights into the tumour microenvironment using IMC in breast cancer49,50 and melanoma51 as well as in post-mortem COVID-19 specimens using IBEX52. Despite these recent successes, widespread application of these technologies has been hampered by several factors. These include access to commercial equipment, antibody panel size (average of 37 markers) and composition (that is, mostly focused on cell identity), limited spatial resolution (average of 267 nm per pixel), high-throughput in single specimens and insufficiently defined quality control steps. Here we provided a detailed protocol for highly multiplexed imaging at subcellular resolution for archival FFPE tissues. The use of PathoPlex for multiplexed imaging includes the following advantages: (1) no dependency on commercial equipment; (2) open-access 3D printing-based solutions for sample preparation and automation; (3) compatibility with any inverted fluorescence microscope, ranging from widefield to high-end confocal microscopy; (4) scalability in antibody panel size (>120), image resolution (up to 80 nm per pixel using confocal microscopy) and sample sizes (that is, intact clinical tissues); (5) use of unmodified antibodies broadly accessible to the scientific community; (6) introduction of stringent quality-control steps to define best practices; and (7) minimization of batch effects through the parallel processing of up to 40 clinical biopsy samples (approximately 4,000 mm2 of available tissue). Together, PathoPlex paves the way for universal access to multiplexed imaging in clinical specimens. It also unlocks one of the largest and most comprehensive biobanks inadvertently created to a wide array of users: FFPE archives in clinical pathology centres and research institutes. It is now up to users to build on this resource to explore well-characterized patient cohorts, generate antibody panels that best address their scientific or clinical questions and to leverage the most efficient and suitable microscopy systems.

As emerging multiplexed imaging technologies generate larger and more complex datasets, image analysis tools need to adapt. Although cell segmentation and identification of cell states remain the most accepted methodologies for both technical development53 and biological interpretability54, unsupervised methods are starting to gain attention. Recent examples of pixel-based image analysis tools for multiplexed imaging data include cellular changes during normal retinal development in human organoids16 and the generation of quantitative annotations both independently and in conjunction with cell segmentations in various human tissues55. However, PathoPlex provides integrative features that recapitulate health, stress and overt disease, which can be pharmacologically modulated. As part of PathoPlex, we provide spatiomic, an efficient, scalable and streamlined end-to-end workflow for the community to analyse multiplexed imaging datasets of over half a trillion pixels. Overall, PathoPlex introduces a shift away from characterizing tissues solely at the cellular level (cell typing and their spatial organization) and towards a data-driven approach that captures the most distinctive biological signatures across spatial scales based on spatial co-expression patterns derived from individual pixels.

Recent advances in community-based strategies include minimum information guidelines56 and a public repository for antibodies compatible with multiplexed imaging57. These initiatives highlight the importance of continuous development in this new and rapidly growing field. Although PathoPlex shows promise, several areas require further optimization. PathoPlex enables users to perform more imaging cycles, which provides an opportunity to expand antibody panel sizes and in turn can extend their scope. However, time efficiency remains crucial for implementation in research and even more so as a clinical application. For this reason, we consider that robotic automation or sample size enrichment through parallel processing of multiple tissue microarrays may be considered in the future. Furthermore, as antibody panels can rapidly expand, standardizing quality-control metrics (that is, validation, secondary-only cycles and re-staining) will benefit potential PathoPlex users and the growing multiplexed imaging community. Moreover, PathoPlex enables the generation of datasets with sizes beyond current standards (>600 billion pixels), which present an analytical challenge that is currently best addressed by GPU acceleration. In this context, we recognize the need to implement additional features to minimize user reliance on specialized hardware. Finally, our work raises important computational questions regarding the need to establish integrative ontology terms that combine multiple biological layers to facilitate broad interpretability. Moreover, the increasing technical requirements to transfer, share, store and process data at a scale will soon challenge available resources.

FFPE tissues were collected and prepared according to institutional protocols. For Fig. 2, validation kidney biopsy specimens from individuals with ANCA-associated CGN were obtained from the Hamburg Glomerulonephritis Registry (https://www.sfb1192.de/en/register). For Fig. 3, control kidney specimens were obtained from nephrectomies performed on individuals with renal cell carcinoma in collaboration with the Division of Nephrology and Clinical Immunology, RWTH Aachen University Medical Center. Kidney biopsy samples from individuals with DKD were obtained from the Department of Nephrology and the Department of Pathology Georges Pompidou European Hospital, Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris. For Fig. 4, nested protocol research kidney biopsy samples were obtained from volunteers (adolescents and young adults; n = 13) with T2D (12–21 years of age, T2D onset at <18 years of age, T2D duration 1–10 years and HbA1c < 11%) from the Renal HEIR and the IMPROVE-T2D studies. The participants were recruited from the Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Bariatric Surgery clinics at the Children's Hospital Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora. T2D was defined according to criteria of the American Diabetes Association plus the absence of glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet cell, zinc transporter 8 and/or insulin autoantibodies. The Renal HEIR and IMPROVE-T2D cohorts have intentionally harmonized study protocols. Medication use was recorded for all participants, and T2D treatment, including SGLT2 inhibitors, was determined by their medical provider. Normative kidney reference tissue from research biopsy samples were provided by five healthy young adult participants in the CROCODILE study (NCT04074668). For Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4, kidney biopsy samples were obtained from the Hamburg Glomerulonephritis Registry (https://www.sfb1192.de/en/register), liver specimens were provided by the Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf and brain specimens were provided by the Institute of Neuropathology, Freiburg University Hospital. Ethics approvals were obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the RWTH Aachen University Medical Center (EK-016/17), the local ethics committees of the Chamber of Physicians in Hamburg (PV4806) and Freiburg (Ethikvotum 10008/09), the Paris Ethics Committee (IRB00003888, FWA00005831) and the Colorado Ethics Committee (NCT03584217 and NCT03620773). All tissue collections were performed in accordance with the ethical principles stated by the Declaration of Helsinki.

Archival FFPE tissues from experimental immune-mediated kidney disease and DKD were collected according to institutional protocols of Hamburg, Melbourne, Heidelberg and Paris (N047/20, MMCB/2006/29, H2052-2071/23 and 358-86/609EEC, respectively). All experimental animals were housed at an ambient temperature of 20 ± 2 °C, humidity of 55 ± 10% and a light–dark cycle of 12–12 h. In brief, mouse crescentic nephritis was induced according to an established protocol58. Rat tissues were obtained from two experimental set-ups32,59. Administration of a JNK inhibitor (CC930, dose of 60 mg kg–1 in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose) or vehicle alone was performed twice daily by oral gavage. The prevention study (therapy started at day 0 and animals were killed on day 1) was performed in outbred male Sprague–Dawley rats, as this strain is known to develop heavy proteinuria59. The therapeutic study (therapy started at day 7 after disease induction and continued until animals were killed on day 28) was performed in inbred male Wistar Kyoto rats, which are prone to developing crescent formation. In both studies, proteinuria measurements and histopathology were performed according to standardized protocols32,59. Btbr-Lepob/ob (Btbrob/ob) mice were obtained by crossing two heterozygous Btbrob/WT mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. This model shows morphological and physiological traits of DKD (that is, hyperglycaemia, albuminuria and glomerular hypertrophy). Wild-type littermates were used as controls.

Depending on the number of samples, a suitable-sized glass surface was selected and coated with poly-d-lysine (1 mg ml–1; Merck, A-003-E) for 30 min or with APTES (Merck, 440140) 10% v/v in acetone (Merck, 320110) for 2 min and then dried overnight before mounting the sections. We initially used poly-d-lysine for all our experiments but realized that significant lifting was progressively observed in all organs tested, including kidney, lung, colon, liver and brain. Lifting was initially mild in kidney samples but highly prominent in lung and colon specimens. For example, we observed partial but meaningful tissue lifting in 76 out of 498 ROIs (15%) by the end of 49 imaging cycles (Fig. 3). Furthermore, from 23 lung specimens analysed over 8 imaging cycles, lifting was already observed in 7 of them (30%). These observations across multiple tissue types led us to conclude that poly-d-lysine coating exhibits organ-dependent and time-dependent reliability limitations, for which we recommend potential users to perform pilot studies in their organ of interest. However, after a comprehensive literature review, we identified APTES as an ideal coating agent. Using APTES, tissue lifting occurred in only 1% of kidney specimens (Fig. 4). After coating, FFPE tissues were cut at a thickness of 2–3 μm and carefully mounted on the coated glass surface (for example, µ-Slide 2-well glass-bottom (Ibidi, 80287), µ-Slide 8-well glass-bottom (Ibidi, 80827), Cell Imaging Plate 24-well glass-bottom (Eppendorf, 0030741021) or Nexterion glass (Schott, 1868767)). To prevent dissolution of the plastic components in the chambered coverslips and plates by the solvent used for deparaffinization, the walls of each well were protected by a seal of transparent silicone (Pattex) or a ring of solvent-resistant plastic, respectively.

The following steps were performed only once before initiating the sequence of cycles.

Samples were treated with the following set of solutions: Histo-Clear (National Diagnostic, HS-200) three cycles of 10 min each, followed by an ethanol series consisting of three cycles of 100% ethanol (10 min), two cycles of 70% ethanol (5 min), one cycle of 50% ethanol (5 min) and finally, triple immersion in double-deionized water (ddH2O) for 5 min each.

Samples were immersed in target retrieval solution pH 9 (Agilent, S236784-2) and heated for 15 min using a steamer (Braun; FS 3000). Afterwards they were left to cool down to room temperature for 30–60 min. Sections were then incubated for 15 min in EnVision FLEX wash buffer (Agilent, K800721-2).

To limit nonspecific antibody binding, samples were incubated in a blocking solution consisting of 5% BSA (Merck, A7906) in Dulbecco's PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14190094) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, samples were washed three times for 5 min with wash buffer.

An elution buffer was prepared according to a previously described formulation15, which consisted of 0.5 M glycine (Carl Roth, 3908.2), 3 M urea (Merck, U5378), 3 M guanidine hydrochloride (Merck, G4505) and 70 mM TCEP (Merck, C4706) mixed in ddH2O and adjusted to pH 2.5. Samples were incubated in elution buffer once for 5 min and then three times for 10 min on a shaker, followed by three washes of 5 min with wash buffer.

Whenever used as a reference for alignment, NHS-E (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10168) diluted in PBS (1:400) was added to the samples for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h, samples were washed three times for 5 min with wash buffer.

The following steps were completed for every subsequent cycle of staining and carried out in a light-free environment to prevent the crosslinking of antibodies.

Samples were incubated with primary antibodies in EnVision FLEX antibody diluent (Agilent, K800621-2) for either 1 h at room temperature (Fig. 2) or overnight at 4 °C (Figs. 3 and 4), followed by three washes of 5 min with wash buffer. We provide confirmation of each staining pattern for every antibody in Supplementary Data 1 and 2. We also validated the practical feasibility of 1-h incubations at room temperature under non-multiplexed and multiplexed imaging conditions (Supplementary Fig. 11).

Appropriately matched secondary antibodies (and directly conjugated primary antibodies) and the nuclear markers DAPI (Merck, D9542, 1:200) or DRAQ5 (Abcam, ab108410, 1:200) were mixed in antibody diluent and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, samples were washed three times for 5 min with wash buffer.

An imaging buffer was prepared according to a previously described formulation15, which consisted of 700 mM N-acetyl-l-cysteine (Merck; A9165) mixed in ddH2O and adjusted to pH 7.4. Imaging buffer was added to samples for imaging and then washed three times for 5 min with wash buffer before elution.

Samples were incubated with elution buffer once for 5 min and then three times for 10 min on a shaker, followed by three washes of 5 min with wash buffer.

Thereafter, these steps were repeated until the desired number of antibodies was reached. Together, each cycle (using 1 h of incubation time for primary antibodies) can be completed in under 4 h of bench work. All cycles per experiment (antibodies and order) are described in Supplementary Table 7. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining was performed after the last immunofluorescence staining only in Fig. 3 following a standard protocol, including incubation with periodic acid (Th. Geyer, 3257.1) to oxidize the sections, followed by Schiff's reagent (Merck, 1090330500) to label glycol-containing structures. The sections were then counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin (Agilent Technologies, S330930-2).

Secondary antibodies were diluted in a ratio ranging from 1:200 to 1:300. The following antibodies were used: goat anti-guinea pig IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11073); goat anti-guinea pig IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21435); donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21202); donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-31570); donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-31571); donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21206); donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A-31572); donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-31573); donkey anti-goat IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11055); donkey anti-goat IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21432); donkey anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21208); donkey anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A78945); donkey anti-sheep IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11015); donkey anti-sheep IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21436); streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S11223); and streptavidin Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S21381).

FFPE tissues were cut at a thickness of 2–3 μm, carefully affixed onto Superfrost Plus adhesion slides (Epredia, J1800AMNZ) and dried overnight at 37 °C. Subsequently, samples underwent sequential treatment involving triple immersion in xylene (10 min each) followed by an ethanol series (5 min each) consisting of three rounds of 100% ethanol, two rounds of 70% ethanol, one round of 50% ethanol and finally triple immersion in ddH2O (5 min each). The immunostaining procedure mirrored the one used for PathoPlex samples but substituted 5% BSA with SuperBlock blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 37535) during the blocking step. Finally, after immunostaining, samples were mounted using ProLong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36930).

For Fig. 2, images were acquired using a LSM 800 confocal microscope plus AiryScan (Zeiss, ZEN2.6) with the optimized ×63 objective (NA: 1.4). For Fig. 3, a Thunder Imager Live Cell and 3D assay (Leica Microsystems) fitted with a ×40 (NA: 1.10) or ×63 (NA: 1.40) objective was used to acquire images, which were processed using a computational clearing algorithm (Leica Microsystems)60. The positional data of the imaged region for each sample were stored in Leica Application Suite X software (v.3.7.6, Leica Microsystems), which ensured consistent capture of the identical location for each cycle. For Fig. 4, a CellDiscoverer 7 with LSM 900 (Zeiss, ZEN 3.5 System) and AiryScan Multiplex fitted with a ×50 (NA: 1.20) objective and ×0.5 zoom was used to acquire images. Supplementary Table 8 summarizes the approximate microscopy times per experiment, considering image acquisition as the most important contributing factor. However, there are additional practical contributors, including chamber repositioning, movement delay between the ROI and data storage, which should be accounted for during implementation.

Tinkercad (Autodesk; https://www.tinkercad.com) was used to create designs for the 3D-printed parts. The design of the headpiece was adjusted on the basis of a previously proposed design61. The BLTouch Cover Size Fixed was designed by louise_tguk on Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5013058). The chamber frame, the table for the chamber frame, the corner frame, the stage, the solution container, stands 1 and 2 for the solution container, the discard container, the base plate, the headpiece, the alignment guide, the BLTouch cover size fixed and the BLTouch cover box were printed using PLA filament 1.75 mm (Flashforge). The inner frame was printed using NinjaFlex TPU filament 1.75 mm (NinjaTek). The dewaxing container, the dewaxing container holder, the dewaxing carrier and the carrier handle were printed using PolyLite PETG filament 1.75 mm (Polymaker). An Ender-5 Plus printer (Creality) was used. The following settings were implemented in Ultimaker Cura (v.4.13.1; Ultimaker): nozzle size, 0.40 mm; layer height, 0.20 mm; wall thickness, 2.0 mm (PLA and PETG for containers), 1.2 mm (PLA and PETG for others) and 0.80 mm (TPU); top and bottom thickness, 2.0 mm (PLA and PETG for containers), 0.8 mm (PLA and PETG for others and TPU); nozzle temperature, 190 °C (PLA) and 235 °C (PETG and TPU); bed temperature, 69 °C (PLA), 75 °C (PETG) and 50 °C (TPU); fan speed, 100%; print speed, 60 mm s–1 (PLA), 40 mm s–1 (PETG) and 20 mm s–1 (TPU); first-layer print speed, 20 mm s–1 (PLA), 15 mm s–1 (PETG) and 10 mm s–1 (TPU); infill, 20% and zigzag; build-plate adhesion, brim. Masking tape was used to create an adhesive surface on the bed.

To prepare for the use of the liquid-handling system, several preliminary steps were required. These encompassed manual deparaffinization, antigen retrieval and mounting the Nexterion glass with sample sections onto the chamber frame. The deparaffinization process described above required the use of a dewaxing container, a container holder, a dewaxing carrier and carrier handle printed with PETG. After completion of dewaxing, the Nexterion glass with sections underwent antigen retrieval and washing procedures as outlined above. After washing, any excess wash buffer present at the edges of the glass was carefully removed. The Nexterion glass was then inserted into the bottom of the chamber frame, and its edges were securely sealed using silicone. It was crucial to allow the silicone to dry for a minimum of 15 min. To prevent the samples from drying out during this process, regular application of wash buffer to the samples was necessary while ensuring that the silicone did not become excessively wet. Once the silicone was completely dry, the inner frame was positioned in the frame and samples were covered with wash buffer. The following process used a liquid-handling system based on a 3D printer (Ender-5 Plus). For light shielding, the 3D printer was covered by a 3D Printer enclosure (Creality). The window on the front of the enclosure needed to be covered with an opaque material to shield the inside from light. The BLTouch built into the Ender-5 Plus was also partially shielded by attaching the BLTouch Cover Size Fixed. Our liquid-handling system was based on three different g-codes: (1) ‘BSA to Elu.gcode', which automated the process from blocking with BSA during the initial cycle to elution and the pouring of imaging buffer; (2) ‘1st Ab to Img.gcode', which automated the process of washing the imaging buffer, incubating the primary and secondary antibodies and pouring the imaging buffer; and (3) ‘Elu to Img.gcode', which automated the process of washing the imaging buffer, elution and pouring the imaging buffer. The settings of the solution containers corresponding to each g-code are shown in Supplementary Table 9. The solution container stand consists of numbered sections ranging from 1 to 12, which are designated for container installation. Each solution-filled container was placed in the section with the corresponding number on the stand. The corner frames were inserted into the holes at the four corners of the table. Solution container stands 1 and 2 with solution containers, the discard container, the stage, the table and the chamber frame were placed on the base plate. Specifically, solution container stand 1 needed to be positioned at the front side of the base plate. To prepare for the operation of the 3D printer, the print bed was removed and autolevelling was disabled. Once each g-code was initiated, after calibrating the home position, the printer head moved slightly backward and the printer stage was lowered. The printer then paused for 60 s before resuming operation. During this pause, the headpiece and BLTouch cover box were attached to the printer head and BLTouch, respectively, and the base plate, complete with all the necessary components and solutions, was placed on the printer stage using the alignment guide. Once installation was complete, the enclosure was completely closed. The washing, staining and elution processes were then automatically performed by pushing down on the solution containers and table with a rod in the headpiece. The BSA to Elu.gcode, 1st Ab to Img.gcode and Elu to Img.gcode programs were completed in approximately 2 h 15 min, 3 h 10 min and 1 h 15 min, respectively. The dimensions of the chamber frame match those of ready-made plates used for imaging cultured cells. For an example of how this solution works, see Supplementary Video 1.

Primary PECs were thawed and cultured at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in endothelial cell basal medium (ECBM; PromoCell, C-22210) and 20% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 10500064) until 70%–80% confluence. The maintenance culture was passaged three times a week by gentle trypsinization using trypsin-EDTA 0.05% (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25300054).

Migration assays were performed using Culture-Insert 2 wells in μ-Dish 35 mm (Ibidi, 81176). Each well was seeded with 30,000 PECs in 100 μl ECBM without supplements and with 1% FBS and incubated overnight. The insert was then removed, which created a gap of 500 μm between cells. PECs were stimulated with either PDGF-BB (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 315-18-50UG, per manufacturer's recommendations of 2.0 ng ml–1) or with PDGF-BB and tanzisertib HCl (CC-930; Selleck Chemicals, S8490) or PDGF-BB and vehicle, in this case DMSO (Merck; D2650). All combinations were diluted using ECBM without supplements and with 1% FBS. Images were taken every 10 min for 23 h using the Personal Automated Lab Assistant (Leica Microsystems). Areas of migration were measured using Fiji.

Scratch assays were performed using glass-bottom FluoroDishes seeded with 50,000 cells in 2 ml ECBM with 1% FBS at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. After 48 h, cells reached 90% confluence and were ready for the experiment, in which a sterile plastic 1,000 μl micropipette tip was used to scratch the cell monolayer to create a wound of around 1,000 μm. Next, the cell monolayer was gently washed with ECBM with 1% FBS to remove dead cell debris. To use the nucleus for tracking, PECs were stained with 80 nM Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 20 min at 5% CO2 and 37 °C and washed once with Dulbecco's PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14190094). Afterwards, 2 ml fresh ECBM with 1% FBS was added for image acquisition. Time-lapse imaging was performed using a Leica DMi8 M/C/A inverted microscope equipped with ×10 Plan Apo objective (Leica Microsystems). Images at both sides of the wound were acquired every 5 min with an ORCA-Flash4.0 digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) using MetaMorph (v.7.10.3.279) software (Molecular Devices). To visualize the wound, adjacent positions were stitched using the Stitching plugin from Fiji ImageJ. Tracking of the first 8 h of migration was performed with the TrackMate plugin from Fiji (v7.10.2) and custom-made scripts62. Mean square displacement was calculated using the CelltrackR package63.

For electron microscopy with immunogold labelling, kidneys were removed, cut into 2-mm-thick razor blade sections and immersion-fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C. The samples were then resliced into 50-µm-thick sections using a vibratome. Vibratome sections were incubated with the primary antibody against TRPC6 (rabbit, final concentration 1:200). After washing and overnight incubation at 4 °C with the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit 1:100 (Nanoprobes), sections were silver enhanced with HQ silver (Nanoprobes) for 8 min in the dark at 4 °C, washed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, treated with OsO4 (0.5% for 45 min at room temperature) and stained with uranyl acetate (1% w/v in 70% v/v ethanol, 30 min at room temperature). After dehydration, sections were embedded in epoxy resin, Durcupan ACM (Sigma-Aldrich). Next, 50-nm ultrathin sections were cut using an UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems) and analysed using an 80 kV Zeiss Leo 910 transmission electron microscope.

Tissue sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated, followed by staining using a standard protocol for immunohistochemistry according to the protocol by Fluidigm. Nuclei were labelled with iridium, and TRPC6 antibody (Abcam, ab105845) was coupled to 174Yb heavy metal. Data acquisition was performed on a Helios time-of-flight mass cytometer (CyTOF) coupled to a hyperion imaging system (Fluidigm). Areas for ablation were selected on the basis of haematoxylin and eosin staining performed on an adjacent slide. All data were collected using the commercial Fluidigm CyTOF software (v.01).

Images were evaluated by two expert pathologists in a blinded fashion to define disease states as either control, acute or crescentic phase. Next, multiple metrics were also calculated in a blinded fashion, including tubular injury score (0–3+), cell numbers per cross section, percentage of cellular crescents and percentage of tubular injury.

Glomeruli were isolated at day 4 after NTS treatment and in control groups after kidney perfusion with Dynabeads (Invitrogen), preserved in RNAlater and stored at −80 °C until processing. For preparation of nuclei, nuclei were extracted from the isolated glomeruli according to a modified protocol64. The nucleus suspension was incubated on the magnet to remove magnetic beads used for the isolation of the glomeruli. Nuclei were mixed with RLT buffer (Qiagen) and frozen at −80 °C. Total nuclei RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

Bulk RNA-sequencing data were processed using our previously published open-source Snakemake65 workflow for RNA-sequencing analysis with pytximport66. In brief, raw FASTQ files provided by the sequencing facility were assessed for quality with FastQC67, followed by trimming of adapter sequences and removal of low-quality reads with fastp68. Next, processed sequences were selectively aligned to a reference gentrome based on Ensembl GRCh38 (release 112)69 and transcript counts were quantified with Salmon70. We used pytximport to estimate gene counts from transcript abundances with counts_from_abundance set to length_scaled_tpm. Differentially expressed genes were identified using PyDESeq2 (ref. 71) with log2-transformed fold shrinkage. Genes were considered differentially expressed if their log2-transformed fold change value was greater than 0.5 or lower than −0.5 and their false-discovery-rate-adjusted P value was less than 0.01. The results from PyDESeq2 were used to infer transcription factor activity based on the CollecTRI72 gene regulatory network reference with decoupler-py73 univariate linear modelling.

Commonly used functions for the analysis of PathoPlex imaging data were combined into the spatiomic Python package. spatiomic comprises different submodules that facilitate data loading, image registration, image preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, spatial analyses, neighbourhood graph construction and clustering. In this section, we describe the architecture of this software package and the general functionality it includes. Parameter choices and detailed workflows are described in subsequent sections. Both the computational analysis library and the code for all analyses are available online through GitHub and Zenodo, as detailed in the Code and Data availability sections.

spatiomic comes with support for multiple common microscopy imaging formats and flexibly supports AnnData74 objects, NumPy75 arrays and pandas DataFrames76. It uses cuml, cucim and cugraph from the RAPIDS ecosystem21 as well as cupy77 for GPU-accelerated computations, which enables analyses to scale to billions of data points with affordable hardware with a time requirement of just minutes to hours depending on dataset size. The library was extensively unit-tested, typed and documented. Documentation, including a full example notebook detailing how to apply spatiomic analyses to PathoPlex data, is available at: https://spatiomic.org/.

To enable modular composition of analyses, spatiomic encompasses several submodules as described below.

The data.read class offers a method for parsing common microscopy imaging formats such as .tiff, .lif and .czi files through readlif, tifffile and aicspylibczi bindings. A random subsample of imaging data can be obtained through the data.subsample class. The submodule further contains functionality to subset multichannel images to a specified list of channels and to export data to AnnData74 objects, which enables interoperability with the scverse23.

The process submodule offers common functions for preprocessing imaging data. This includes the clip class for channel-wise histogram clipping to either absolute values or percentiles, the zscore class for channel-wise z scoring and the normalize class for the channel-wise scaling of intensity values to a given range. It also includes the register class, which exposes different methods for image registration and registration evaluation.

Dimensionality reduction is an important step in many single-cell and spatial omics analyses. spatiomic provides classes that help reduce the dimensionality of both the channel dimension and the data point dimension. The former is possible through the integration of the dimension.pca, dimension.tsne and dimension.umap classes, which internally rely on the Python packages scikit-learn78, umap-learn79 and cuml21. The latter is achieved by incorporating the dimension.som class, which enables GPU-accelerated training of SOMs thanks to an XPySOM22 integration. To train SOMs with the Pearson correlation as distance metric, we extended XPySOM with a CuPy-based function, which is available from GitHub (https://github.com/complextissue/xpysom).

The neighbour submodule exposes classes that enable the creation of k-nearest and shared nearest neighbour graphs, which facilitates the construction of similarity-based graphs for graph clustering and distance-based neighbourhood graphs for spatial analysis.

Clustering algorithms enable the unsupervised identification of similar (protein co-expression) patterns, which facilitates automatic partitioning of complex signals into biologically meaningful groups. spatiomic.cluster includes classes for GPU-accelerated clustering with the Leiden graph clustering algorithm24, k-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering.

The spatial submodule incorporates functions for the explorative analysis of spatial distribution patterns in both immunofluorescence and clustered images, including global and local univariate and bivariate measures of spatial distribution based on PySAL80. It further includes code for efficient join count quantification and spatial vicinity graph construction and interoperability tools for use together with PySAL80, thereby ensuring compatibility with a wide range of spatial statistics applications81.

The tool submodule contains utility functions for additional evaluation or analysis. It enables quantification of cluster abundance and identification of significantly differentially expressed clusters, calculation of mean immunofluorescence marker intensities per cluster and identification of cluster-defining immunofluorescence markers.

spatiomic includes plotting functions based on matplotlib82 and seaborn83 that facilitate visualizing common plots, for example, image registration metrics, SOM training-quality metrics, cluster projections, spatial adjacency graphs as well as cluster contributor histograms and volcano plots.

spatiomic is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the scale of multiplexed imaging data and available computing resources. The only mandatory system requirement is Python (v.3.10) or higher. Although many individual functions run in seconds, and a complete exemplary workflow (excluding data download) can be completed in less than 3 min on a standard personal laptop, spatiomic substantially benefits from CUDA-enabled GPUs compatible with the RAPIDS ecosystem for larger datasets. At the scale of analysis presented in this paper, three specific steps took several hours to complete on a single GPU. First, image registration time scales linearly with the number of ROIs acquired and imaging cycles. Second, the time for SOM training scales linearly with the training sample size, the number of training iterations and the number of SOM nodes. Finally, the transfer of cluster labels from the trained SOM to all images in the dataset scales linearly with the number of acquired ROIs and the number of SOM nodes. Therefore, users are encouraged to evaluate and test parameter choices to optimize performance for their specific experimental design. For example, smaller, more homogeneous datasets may benefit from smaller training subsamples and SOM sizes, which will result in faster analysis. Moreover, users should select hardware that is appropriate for their analytical needs and desired turnaround time.

Image registration is the first step of every computational analysis of PathoPlex images. Given the cyclical nature of image acquisition and imperfect repositioning of standard microscopy systems, aligning signals from all imaging cycles to a common reference is a prerequisite for joint analyses.

We propose two different ways of aligning iteratively acquired immunofluorescence images: on the basis of either a nuclear or a pan-protein stain as a registration reference. Although nuclear markers are widely used for registration, a pan-protein marker enables the alignment of images and facilitates the delineation of the portion of the image covered by tissue, thereby lowering the computational burden for downstream processing and reducing the cluster annotation time by masking the empty background. To combat autofluorescence due to red blood cells (RBCs) in samples with abundant RBCs, we further used a RBC marker to specifically remove this source of noise. Detailed parameter choices and method descriptions are provided for the respective experimental datasets in the subsequent subsections. Differences between datasets, such as the use of NHS-E for foreground segmentation and the use of glycophorin A for erythrocyte segmentation in selected datasets, represent the iterative improvement of PathoPlex, with earlier experiments informing strategies for further scaling in subsequent experiments. In particular, the preprocessing steps described in this section refer only to the transformation of nuclear staining or NHS-E for registration purposes and do not indicate the transformation of marker intensities as used for further analysis, unless indicated otherwise.

To align cycles from the CGN mouse dataset (Fig. 2), nuclear reference images (DAPI in cycles 1–17, DRAQ5 in cycles 18–42) were clipped image-wise to the range between the 1st and 99.9th intensity percentiles. Intensity values were z scored and normalized to the range 0–1. Gaussian blur with a sigma of 1 was then applied to the nuclear reference images to reduce noise and to improve comparability across cycles, followed by histogram matching of all subsequent images to the histogram of the reference image from the first cycle. These processed nuclear images were then aligned to the processed refence nuclear image obtained in the first imaging cycle. To this end, all intensity values below the 70th intensity percentile were set to 0 in both the reference nuclear staining and the staining to be aligned to increase the contrast between the nuclei (constituting less than 30% of the imaged pixels in all images) and the unstained background, followed by x and y offset detection between images with the phase_cross_correlation function of the Python package scikit-image84, as included in spatiomic.process.register. All channels were projected onto the first cycle on the basis of the detected offset. Finally, the maximum offset detected between any two cycles was subtracted from all sides of all registered images, which resulted in square-sized and equally sized images.

For the study of specimens from individuals with advanced DKD and from individuals without diabetes (Fig. 3), all images were first corrected for camera distortion using the remap function of OpenCV85 by linear interpolation based on a reference image of a micrometre-scale microgrid captured with the respective microscope objective. Histogram matching of the nuclear channel for each cycle to the reference nuclear channel of the first cycle was used to increase the similarity between nuclear images. Following that, the phase cross-correlation offset detection, as implemented in spatiomic.process.register.get_shift, was used to align all images to the first imaging cycle on the basis of the x and y offsets between the nuclear (DRAQ5) channels. For each field of view (FOV), the overlap across all cycles was calculated and the images were cropped to the respective overlap area.

This experiment (Fig. 4) leveraged NHS-E, a pan-protein stain, as a registration reference. To facilitate registration and further image processing, we applied local mean downscaling with a 2 × 2 pixel kernel to all imaging data. We then clipped the NHS-E histogram to the range between the 1st and 95th percentiles and normalized the NHS-E intensity to the range 0–1. After NHS-E preprocessing, Gaussian blurring with a sigma of 1, thresholding at the 70th percentile and phase correlation-based offset detection with an upsampling factor of 5 were applied to identify the x and y offset between NHS-E images from all cycles, using the first imaging cycle as the reference. After correcting for this offset, SIFT-based homography detection86 was performed and images from subsequent cycles were warped to match the reference from the first cycle. Pre-registration and post-registration structural similarity index metrics (SSIMs) were evaluated for all registration pairs. Manual registration checks were performed for images with the following criteria: the SSIM decreased following registration; the SSIM after registration was lower than 0.3; any offset was greater than 300 pixels; or the SSIM after registration was lower than 0.8 and the SSIM improvement lower than 0.05. To account for RBC-derived autofluorescence, glycophorin A intensities across all images were clipped to the range between the 90th and 99.5th percentiles, and Otsu thresholding was used to binarize signals and to create RBC masks. Masks were smoothed through the removal of small objects <72 pixels, two iterations of binary dilation and hole filling. To remove signals from empty background without tissue, processed NHS-E signals were combined across all cycles by minimum projection (thus excluding areas with lifting at any point) for each image and Otsu thresholding was used to binarize signals. All images were then restricted to the area covered by the NHS-E mask but not included in the RBC mask. Autofluorescence correction was performed using secondary-antibody cycles acquired repeatedly throughout the experiment. For each primary-antibody imaging cycle, tissue autofluorescence was estimated by interpolating the signals from the nearest preceding and subsequent secondary-only cycles at the same wavelength, thereby accounting for minor fluctuations in autofluorescence. This estimated autofluorescence was then subtracted from the corresponding channels with lower intensity clipping at zero.

To achieve reliable and accurate results, we used an iterative registration framework called Elastix87 and a Python wrapper package called PyElastix88. To improve contrast and to mitigate the effects of varying signal strength across cycles, we applied histogram equalization to the nuclear channels. We also reduced the computational load by rescaling the images by a factor of 0.25. The first cycle was established as a reference, and subsequent cycles were aligned to it using normalized correlation as the optimization metric. The registration process involved iterative steps at six different resolution levels, with 1,000 iterations per level. We used the rigid Euler transform to account for x and y offsets as well as rotation. Further preprocessing was performed for brain samples with reduced contrast by truncating pixel intensity values to high percentiles. This approach focused on the sparsely available nuclei. All registrations were manually verified, and if individual registrations were unsuccessful, minor adjustments were made to the downsampling factor, spatial sample number or iteration number until satisfactory registration was achieved to maximize image inclusion.

Owing to differences in size and lens characteristics between the immunofluorescence and PAS images, additional processing steps were required to align the two modalities. First, lens-specific calibration matrices were used to remove optical distortions as described above for the human advanced DKD experiment. Next, the PAS images were rescaled to match the physical pixel resolution of the immunofluorescence images. As only greyscale images were used for registration, the PAS images were converted from RGB to greyscale using the OpenCV85 Python library. For the greyscale version of the immunofluorescence image stack, three structural marker channels (DRAQ5, LTL and collagen IV) were selected and combined into a single channel using weighted addition. To enhance visual similarity between the greyscale PAS and immunofluorescence variants, the PAS image was inverted, and histogram equalization was applied to both the PAS and immunofluorescence images. To establish an initial alignment for registration of the immunofluorescence onto the PAS image, the PAS images were centrally cropped to match the smaller size of the immunofluorescence images (3,000 × 4,000 versus 2,048 × 2,048 pixels, respectively). Once the x and y offsets in this subregion were determined by the registration algorithm, the original multichannel immunofluorescence images were transformed accordingly. The full-size RGB PAS images were also cropped to the size of the transformed immunofluorescence images to facilitate overlaying of the registration results.

In a subsequent investigation, our goal was to evaluate the suitability of DAPI, DRAQ5 and NHS-E as registration reference labels. To achieve this goal, we acquired images of all three marker channels for each imaging spot in each cycle. For each image requiring registration, transformations based on each of the three markers were independently computed. The corresponding DRAQ5 channel of each image was adjusted to account for the detected transformation, and the structural similarity index measure was computed by comparing it to the DRAQ5 channel of the reference cycle. This approach ensured that the different registration references could be compared using DRAQ5 as a quality metric, which consistently provided reliable and high-contrast images. All registrations were manually reviewed, and in instances where registration was not successful, minor adjustments were made to the downsampling factor, the spatial sample number or the iteration number until a satisfactory registration was achieved. This process ensured that no image had to be discarded and that high-quality alignments were obtained.

Complete elution of bound antibodies between cycles is key to the cyclic acquisition of images. To quantify elution efficiency, secondary-antibody-only staining cycles were acquired throughout the experiments to establish a baseline autofluorescence profile. For each primary-antibody staining, the 50th and 99.95th intensity percentiles were quantified and compared with the secondary-antibody-only cycles acquired at the same wavelength using secondary antibodies directed against the host species of the primary antibody. For instances when at least one value was equal to or lower than any intensity from the secondary-antibody-only cycles (as may be the case for non-abundant markers, for example, markers for rare immune cells or phosphorylation states), the images were manually re-evaluated to include specific staining.

Protein co-expression clusters are the standard output of PathoPlex analyses with spatiomic, which captures specific co-expression patterns of different proteins at the pixel level. These patterns are jointly identified for all imaging data from each respective PathoPlex experiment, which results in a consistent clustering across all samples and facilitates comparisons of spatial expression or co-expression of immunofluorescence markers. Identification of these pixel-level clusters is a multistep process that consists of weighted random subsampling of the data to ensure equal representations of all desired variables, signal preprocessing, training of a SOM to identify representative co-expression signals and finally similarity graph-based clustering. Once clusters were identified, their constituting signals were compared to all other clusters and projected in space to infer the biological processes they represent. Last, cluster abundance was quantified and compared across conditions to delineate regulated signals. We applied this overall concept to each experimental dataset with parameters specified as described in the subsequent subsections.

To limit bias due to different data sizes between samples and to reduce the computational burden of pixel-based clustering, a weighted subsample of approximately 5 million (10 million for the early human diabetes dataset) random pixel positions per imaging plate were sampled. For each imaging plate (n = 1 for all experiments, except for the human advanced DKD experiment, for which n = 2 imaging plates were used), the number of subsampled pixel positions was equally distributed across all disease states, and for each disease state, all samples were equally weighted. Finally, each FOV of a given sample was given the same weight in the subsample. For the early human diabetes treatment dataset, the subsample also considered equal numbers of pixels from periglomerular, glomerular and tubular images.

Immunofluorescence markers differ in intensity range and abundance, which therefore requires preprocessing steps to improve comparability. On the basis of weighted random subsamples, histogram clipping and range normalization classes contained in the spatiomic.process submodule were fitted. After channel-wise fitting of the classes on the random weighted subsample, all channels of all images of each respective dataset were transformed according to the established clipping limits and normalization and scaling settings. For mouse samples and the advanced DKD experiment, histogram clipping was performed based on the 50th (lower) and 99.7th (upper) percentiles for each respective marker in the subsample. Owing to the extensive marker panel for the larger early human diabetes treatment experiment, coupled with the increased sensitivity of the confocal microscopy system used for this dataset, histogram clipping was performed based on absolute intensity thresholds established by human expert annotation in a condition-blind fashion, with each marker evaluated on random patches extracted from random images, followed by normalization of the clipped images.

Pixel-based clustering was used to isolate groups of similar immunofluorescence marker signals (clusters), which formed the basis of all downstream analyses. The first step towards this clustering is the fitting of SOMs to the dataset to reduce data-point dimensionality and to ensure computational feasibility of graph clustering as well as to improve representation of signals that are relatively rare in the training data. For each imaging plate (n = 2 for the human advanced diabetes experiment, n = 1 for all other datasets), a SOM was trained on the corresponding weighted random subsample. The SOM was initialized with a grid size of 500 × 500 nodes (400 × 400 for the early diabetes experiment) and used the Euclidean distance metric for the mouse CGN dataset and the advanced human diabetes dataset with the cosine similarity metric used for the early human diabetes experiment. The training process used spatiomic.dimension.som. For human samples, a final learning rate of 10−4 and a final Gaussian neighbourhood sigma of 10−3 (3 × 10−3 for the early human diabetes dataset) were used. For the mouse samples, the default settings for the learning rate and neighbourhood size were used. The training process was repeated for 50 iterations for all datasets.

On the basis of the representation of the signals contained in each experiment as provided by the respective SOM nodes, we used Leiden graph clustering to identify clusters of protein co-expression patterns and applied the clusters to all pixels from all images for each dataset. First, the similarity-based neighbourhood graph of SOM nodes was built using spatiomic.neighbor.knn_graph using cosine (early diabetes treatment experiment) or Euclidean distance (all other experiments). When image acquisition was performed using multiple plates (Fig. 3), the neighbourhood graph construction step was modified to use an adaptation of the batch-balanced k-nearest neighbours89 algorithm, implemented in spatiomic.neighbor.knn_graph. A neighbour count of k = 40 for each respective plate was used. When only one imaging plate was used (all other experiments), a neighbour count of k = 40 (k = 50 for the early human diabetes experiment) was used without any batch integration. After graph construction, we used the Leiden24 graph clustering algorithm to identify clusters of similar protein co-expression patterns. A Leiden resolution of 2.5 and an iteration count of 10,000 were used for the advanced DKD experiment, a resolution of 2.0 and an iteration count of 1,000 for the early human diabetes treatment experiment and a Leiden resolution of 1.0 and an iteration count of 10,000 for the mouse CGN experiment samples.

To assign biological identities to protein co-expression clusters derived from PathoPlex output, we used a two-step approach that combined statistical overrepresentation with spatial distribution analysis and signal interpretation by human experts. Owing to computational constraints, statistical analyses were performed on subsampled data (used with the early diabetes experiment, with 500,000 pixels randomly selected from the weighted random subsample) or the representative SOM nodes (all other datasets). For each cluster, we calculated the mean normalized intensity and the log2-transformed fold change of marker intensity (relative to all pixels or nodes not assigned to that cluster), which reflected the signal strength and cluster specificity, respectively. Significance was assessed using a two-tailed t-test with Benjamini–Hochberg (early diabetes dataset) or Holm–Šidák (all other datasets) correction for multiple testing (implemented in spatiomic.tool.get_stats). Dominant markers in each cluster (termed high contributors) were identified by ranking markers based on the product of their mean intensity and log2-transformed fold change, and retaining only those with mean normalized intensity ≥ 0.2, adjusted P < 0.05 and log2-transformed fold change ≥ 1. Intensity histograms further visualized marker distribution patterns in each cluster for all markers and were also considered for cluster interpretation. Individual clusters were spatially projected onto the corresponding immunofluorescence and—where available—PAS-stained images. Human experts then visually validated and refined cluster identities by assessing their spatial distribution, considering morphological structures and correlations with immunofluorescence signals and integrating contextual biological knowledge.

As multiplexed imaging data from Figs. 2 and 3 did not include a pan-protein marker in their panel, no foreground segmentation was performed before pixel-level clustering, which resulted in multiple clusters that corresponded to empty background areas. To account for this limitation (largely circumvented by NHS-E and a larger antibody panel in Fig. 4), we restricted extended analyses (but not differential cluster abundance analyses) to specific foreground clusters only or we treated all background clusters as a single cluster. For Fig. 4, we similarly assessed the specificity of all clusters and quantified their relative frequency, focusing visualizations and biological assessment to clusters deemed to represent specific signal (excluding minor imaging artefacts, autofluorescence signals and imperfect foreground segmentation) and accounting for >0.1% of foreground pixels. The specificity of clusters, defined as the extent to which clusters correspond to clear biological processes and/or structures, both at the spatial and at the molecular level, was assessed individually by a panel of three experts. In controversial cases, the experts presented their arguments until a unanimous decision for exclusion was reached. If arguments for exclusion were not unanimously accepted, the cluster was not excluded.

Cluster abundances were analysed by quantifying the number of pixels assigned to each cluster for each field of view in a dataset using spatiomic.tool.count_clusters. The abundances were normalized to a range of 0–1 to facilitate comparison and interpretation across FOVs. For the mouse CGN and the advanced diabetes experiment, these normalized abundances were further aggregated to obtain the mean cluster abundance per field of view for each mouse or patient. Differential abundance analysis was performed by quantifying the log2-transformed fold change in cluster abundance between different experimental and clinical conditions by performing a two-sided t-test. To account for the higher number of unique clusters and larger sample sizes, P values for the advanced DKD and the early diabetes treatment experiments were corrected for multiple testing with Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate adjustment. Statistical testing used the spatiomic.tool.get_stats function. Results were visualized with spatiomic.plot.volcano for all datasets. For visualization purposes, the volcano plots were restricted to feature clusters determined to represent specific foreground signal. Moreover, to assess the impact of batch integration, quality control was performed by comparing differences in log2-transformed fold changes in inter-group cluster abundances between the imaging plates (Supplementary Fig. 12).

Based on our foundational pixel-level protein co-expression clusters, we used multiple downstream applications to connect the output from PathoPlex with community resources and public knowledge bases, showcasing how pixel-level data can be aggregated at different levels to derive information across multiple biological scales.

UnPaSt42 is a biclustering method initially developed for unsupervised patient stratification based on omics data. UnPaSt identifies differentially expressed biclusters in a two-dimensional matrix with samples (for example, images or patients) in columns and features (for example, clusters) in rows. A differentially expressed bicluster is a submatrix consisting of samples and features such that these features are overexpressed or underexpressed in these samples compared with all other samples in the input data matrix. We applied UnPaSt with binarization P value threshold of P = 0.05, direction = ‘both' (to identify biclusters consisting of both upregulated and downregulated clusters) and all other parameters set to default to image-level and patient-level cluster intensities. As UnPaSt is not deterministic, consensus biclusters were built on the basis of results of ten independent runs.

To evaluate the druggability of the molecular signature of advanced DKD and to identify potential therapeutics, we combined drug–protein interaction data from the CTD44 with STRING90 protein–protein interaction data. Initially, we manually identified AIFM1, TRPC6, CALR, HSPA5, ITGB1 and CTNNB1 as possible targets involved in the altered signalling cascades revealed by PathoPlex based on the significantly differentially expressed clusters and their molecular composition. Next, we used STRING data for Homo sapiens to link every potential target to a broader network of interacting proteins. We only considered direct interactions with a confidence score exceeding 0.75. In a subsequent step, CTD chemical–gene interaction data were used to extract possible therapeutics that affect proteins in our target networks. This search was limited to compound–protein interactions described in mice (Mus musculus), rats (Rattus norvegicus) or humans. Only interactions that did not involve co-treatment and did not affect the reaction of another externally administered compound were included. Our goal was to determine the impact of existing pharmacological treatments on the extended protein networks and to explore the potential for repurposing drugs authorized for other indications; therefore, we further filtered the results, preserving only entries for which the chemical name had a matching entry in the European Medicines Agency's list of authorized agents (date of consultation: 23 August 2023). In a second step, to further assess the impact of current antidiabetic drugs, results from all protein networks were combined and filtered for compounds containing ‘glutid', ‘gliflozin', ‘glitazon', ‘gliptin', ‘metformin', ‘pril' or ‘sartan'.

Although pixel clusters provide valuable subcellular and extracellular information, they can also be used to inform existing cell-level clustering workflows. To quantify the co-occurrence of pixel-level clusters within cell-level metaclusters, we first applied the Cellpose39 segmentation model using the parameters model_type = “nuclei” and diameter = 30 to the pre-processed DRAQ5 channel of each image. Statistical testing of nucleus counts per image was performed using statannotations91 with a two-sided nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test, comparing diabetes and control samples. Centroids of all identified nuclei were then expanded radially by the smaller of either 5 µm or 50% of the shortest Delaunay triangulation edge length to approximate cell areas. Within these estimated areas, the relative abundances of pixel-level clusters were calculated to produce feature vectors for each cell. To identify cell-level metaclusters, a k-nearest neighbour graph was constructed using spatiomic.neighbor.knn_graph with neighbor_count = 50 followed by Leiden24 clustering with a resolution of 1.0. Condition-specificity of meta-clusters was confirmed by averaging their relative abundances across images at the patient level. Within each cell-level metacluster, the fraction of pixels corresponding to each pixel-level cluster was quantified, which provided a quantification of the cell-level co-occurrence patterns of pixel clusters. Differences in normalized metacluster abundance at the patient-level between conditions were visualized through a two-component principal component analysis using spatiomic.dimension.pca with default parameters and significance was established through a Mann–Whitney U-test with Bonferroni correction.

PILOT41 is a previously published, multiscale, unsupervised method that uses optimal transport to compute the distance between data points and infer a disease trajectory. First, we used the normalized abundance of the clusters as the cluster proportions for each FOV from all samples. Next, we computed the distances between the clusters as a cost matrix. In the subsequent step, we used the cluster proportions and the cost matrix to compute the Wasserstein distance92 (W1) between the data points. Then, we obtained the trajectory of the disease by applying the diffusion map93 to the distance matrix of the samples. Finally, we used the assigned pseudotimes of the data points to reveal the changes in the proteins or clusters. In summary, PILOT uses stepwise nonlinear models to determine significantly changing proteins or clusters across the disease trajectory.

The immediate spatial neighbourhood analysis was based on join counts between unique clusters that were used to create an adjacency graph using spatiomic.spatial.vicinity_composition. First, for each pixel position, the eight surrounding pixel positions (Chebyshev distance of 1 pixel; that is, first-order queen neighbourhood) were examined to count the instances of nearby clusters. This process was applied to all pixels in all images using a vectorized approach. The cluster counts were then aggregated at the dataset level for images of the same disease condition. Next, connections between identical clusters were discarded, and the remaining connections were normalized to a range of 0–1. Non-foreground clusters were discarded. The resulting adjacency matrix was used to construct a directed graph for each condition, with the graph representing the relationships between clusters. Although the entire adjacency matrix was quantified and evaluated, a neighbourhood cluster abundance of 7.5% was established as minimum value to be included in the graph plot for visualization purposes, focusing the visualization on the most common adjacencies. The graph layout was calculated using the software packages Graphviz94 and NetworkX95.

Condition-specific structural patterns were identified using MISTy40 (mistyR v.1.6.1). To that end, image data (112 images from advanced DKD samples and 310 from control samples) were aggregated at two different resolutions by summing the cluster counts in bins with a side length of 10 μm (62 × 62 pixels). Clusters capturing empty background, unstained tissue parts and nonspecific signals were collapsed into a single background cluster. To account for truncated bins at the edges of slides, we transformed the counts into proportions. We used these cluster proportions per bin as an intrinsic representation of the structure in a bin (MISTy intraview). To capture the broader tissue structure, we constructed the paraview by summing up the cluster proportions of the 20 nearest neighbours using family = “constant”, l = 20. To construct the paraview for the high-resolution aggregation, we computed the weighted sum of the cluster proportions of the 80 nearest neighbours using a Gaussian kernel with a bandwidth of 2.5 μm (corresponding to 15 pixels) (family = “gaussian”, l = 2.5, nn = 80). With these view compositions per aggregation, a MISTy model was independently trained for each sample. The MISTy models identified significant structural patterns in the different spatial contexts by associating the proportion of pixels belonging to each cluster in each spatial context to the target proportions in the intraview. MISTy can learn both simple linear relationships (for example, cluster X has a higher proportion if cluster Y has a lower proportion) and complex nonlinear relationships. By combining the predictions from the intraview and paraview for each cluster, MISTy enabled us to disentangle whether the prediction for a given cluster improves, and to what extent, when taking different spatial contexts into account. To compare the MISTy importance scores between conditions, we first computed the mean results per sample due to differing numbers of imaged FOVs. We then aggregated the MISTy results per patient and finally per condition (advanced DKD and controls). For each level of aggregation, group and view, we generated a graph representing the inferred relationships between clusters. In each graph, the nodes represent the clusters and the edges between the clusters were weighted by the importance scores inferred by the MISTy model (thresholded to conserve only significant relationships with importance > 1.0). The graph layout was calculated using Graphviz94 and NetworkX95.

To contrast our findings at the protein-level with transcriptomic data and to establish a bridge to proposed treatments of DKD, we leveraged two public RNA-sequencing datasets with pharmacological intervention or different treatment data, covering rodent and human samples.

Data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession: GSE220939). Files from individual patients were converted to AnnData74 objects, and information on the diabetes and SGLT2i treatment status of each patient was added. To remove ambient RNA contamination, Cellbender96 (v.0.3) training was performed on each sample individually with a training fraction of 0.5 for 100 epochs. Observations with a Cellbender cell probability ≤ 0.5 were discarded. Next, all observations were combined into a single AnnData object, quality-control metrics were quantified and cell clustering was performed using the Python package scanpy97. As part of this step, mitochondrial, ribosomal and haemoglobin genes were identified, and quality control metrics were calculated using the calculate_qc_metrics function. Barcodes containing ≥50% mitochondrial RNA, ≥20% rRNA or ≥5% haemoglobin genes were discarded. Barcodes with reads for less than 500 or more than 5,000 genes were discarded to correct for doublets, as were genes detected in at most 4 observations. The total number of reads per cell was normalized and the counts were log1p transformed. To reduce dimensionality, the first 50 principal components were computed using scanpy's pca method with the arpack singular value decomposition solver. As inter-individual batch effects were present, Harmony98 data integration was performed with standard parameters, using the harmonypy99 implementation available through the external module of scanpy. On the basis of the adjusted principal components, the 50 nearest neighbours of each cell were identified using the neighbours function of scanpy97, which was configured to use the Pearson correlation similarity metric. Graph clustering was performed using the Leiden algorithm72 with a resolution of 0.5. On the basis of cell-identity genes (adapted from a previous study46 and PanglaoDb100), clusters were manually annotated to represent different cell types. Cell types and transcripts related to the pathways altered at the protein level were chosen, and gene counts were visualized using the dotplot function of scanpy97. Statistics per cell type of interest were calculated on the depth-normalized gene counts using the get_stats function of spatiomic, configured to revert log1p transformation. Nonparametric independent Wilcoxon rank-sum testing was performed using the ranksum function of scipy101 with Benjamini–Hochberg correction.

Preprocessed data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession: GSE209821). Gene counts were read into R using Seurat and converted to AnnData74 with SeuratData and SeuratDisk. In the next step, the AnnData object was read using the scanpy97 Python library, and provided metadata were combined with the gene counts. The provided counts had already been filtered for quality-control metrics and cluster labels from a previous study were provided47, thus, only depth normalization to the median read depth was performed. Observations were further filtered to only retain proximal tubule cells from controls, untreated mice or mice treated with soluble guanylate cyclase activators. Differential expression statistics of genes corresponding to defining markers of clusters upregulated in the proximal tubular compartment in the advanced DKD PathoPlex experiment were calculated based on depth-normalized gene counts using the spatiomic.tool.get_stats function, configured to run nonparametric independent Wilcoxon rank-sum testing using the ranksum function of scipy101 with Holm–Šidák correction.

To further evaluate the expression of TRPC6 and AIFM1 in the proximal tubule of kidneys with metabolic damage, we assessed their expression in Btbrob/ob mice and control mice at 12 and 24 weeks of age. Immunofluorescence was performed on 5 FOVs per sample, with n = 3 samples per group and time point, which produced a total of n = 12 samples and 60 FOVs. The proximal tubule area was segmented by thresholding the LTL channel to an intensity greater than 1,500, followed by filling holes smaller than 1,000 pixels and removing objects smaller than 20,000 pixels. After proximal tubule segmentation, a random subsample of 50,000 pixel positions was selected from the proximal tubule area of each FOV. These subsamples were combined for each unique condition and time point. Changes in TRPC6 and AIFM1 expression were visualized through histograms of marker intensities, grouped by time point and condition. Statistical analysis was performed using the statsannotations91 Python package, for which the subsampled intensities served as input, with the corresponding condition as the label for each intensity. An independent t-test based on the statannotations91 Python package was used to assess statistical differences in TRPC6 expression between conditions at each time point.

Statistical analyses, including cluster composition, differential cluster abundance and differential gene expression, were performed using spatiomic.tool.get_stats and statannotations. These tools internally rely on scipy101 and statsmodels102 and were used to perform either Benjamini-Hochberg or Holm–Šidák-corrected two-tailed t-tests (for cluster composition and differential abundance analysis), Mann–Whitney U-tests (for differences in nucleus counts and cell-level metacluster abundance) or nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (for differential gene expression from single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data). Bulk RNA-sequencing differential gene expression analysis was performed using PyDESeq2, combining single-factor analysis using Wald tests with log2-transformed fold change shrinkage with approximate posterior estimation generalized linear models103. Detailed descriptions of these tests, including information on input data and additional filters, are provided throughout the Methods. All other statistical analyses, including the quantification of changes in cell migration, clinical parameters (for example, proteinuria or eGFR), sample-specific variables (such as age), PEC activation, injury patterns in CGN and principal component analysis, were performed using GraphPad Prism (v.9). Violin plots report median and interquartile values. Significance was evaluated using the unpaired t-tests with Welch's correction comparing two continuous variables, a paired t-test for before and after settings, and the Brown–Forsythe, Welch ANOVA and Dunnett's tests when comparing three continuous variables. Correlation analyses were performed using Spearman rank coefficients. Principal components were selected on the basis of the percentage of total explained variance using normalized cluster abundances at the image-level or the patient-level as input. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05 for all analyses, with a threshold of P < 0.01 applied for specific cases as outlined throughout the methods.

(a) Schematic overview of all strategies deployed. (b) PathoPlex is compatible with multiple microscopy systems, including widefield, spinning disk and laser confocal, which directly determine imaging time, file size and image resolution. (c) Strategies to minimize bias introduction are based on creating self-contained batches, where tissues are processed in parallel using imaging chambers that contain specimens representing all experimental groups, including controls. (d) Suggested imaging chambers for histopathological studies (2–24 wells). (e) Multi-well pipetting can be performed manually or using liquid handling systems. Alternatively, 3D printing can be used to customize a 1-well imaging chamber, which simplifies liquid handling. (f) In addition, a 3D printer can also be used as a liquid handling system. The printer head is used to automate liquid addition and removal. (g) Specificity, and elution controls of 3D printer-based imaging cycles.

2 expert pathologists analyzed all samples and defined all 3 groups with 100% accuracy. (a) Quantitative pathology analyses to differentiate acute injury and CGN vs controls, showing compartment-specific changes in acute injury and CGN. Each dot represents one mouse (N = 3 controls, N = 3 acute injury, and N = 6 CGN; red line represents medians). Two-sided t tests and Mann Whitney tests were used. (b) While mice with CGN have overt lesions, those with acute injury show only minor abnormalities, namely subtle vacuolation in the proximal tubuli (green). (c) Volcano plot showing all regulated clusters comparing controls to acute injury, featured cluster 26 (C26). (d) Principal component (PC) analysis revealed clear separation between images from controls (blue) and acute injury (orange) specimens with C26 being the top contributor to PC1. (e) Spatial projections of cluster 26 (C26) show a regulation pattern in the luminal side of kidney tubuli, a similar location to the one used for pathologists to define acute injury. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001; EEA1: Early Endosome Antigen 1, EZR: Ezrin. Scale bars represent 60 µm.

(a) Schematic description of experimental design with nephrotoxic serum (NTS) glomerulonephritis and glomerular nuclear isolation for bulk RNA sequencing. (b) Volcano plots show transcriptionally regulated genes at day 3 post NTS injection. (c) Transcription factor activity score, and (d) differential expression of JUN-regulated targets, where blue means downregulated by JUN and red means upregulated by JUN. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using PyDESeq2 combining single-factor analysis using Wald tests with log2 fold-change shrinkage using approximate posterior estimation generalized linear models. Parts of panel a were created using BioRender (https://biorender.com).

(a) Percentage of CD44+phospho-c-Jun+ parietal epithelial cells (PECs) among controls, NTS injected day 1 (alone and vehicle) and NTS injected day 1 with a preventive JNK inhibitor (JNKi) administration. (b) Percentage of CD44+phospho-c-Jun+ PECs among NTS injected day 7 (alone), NTS injected d28 (alone and vehicle) and NTS injected day 28 with JNKi administration started at day 7 post NTS injection.

(a) Expression of TRPC6 in normal murine proximal tubuli using immunogold in electron microscopy. This is a representative image from 3 biological replicates. (b) Expression of TRCP6 using Imaging Mass Cytometry in the human kidney (controls and diabetic kidney disease; DKD). These are representative images from 2 biological replicates per condition. (c) Schematic representation of a murine model of obesity and early DKD, showing albuminuria at 24 weeks of age. (d) Increased expression (distributional shift in pixel intensity) of TRPC6 in proximal tubuli in ob/ob mice at 24 weeks of age. Scale bar in (a) represents 250 nm and scale bars in (b) represent 50 µm. Parts of panel c were created using BioRender (https://biorender.com).

Histopathological staining allows cluster assignment to exact structural locations. (a) Cluster 0 (ERK-mediated podocyte signaling) and (b) cluster 14 (integrin-mediated nephron signaling). In both cases, cluster abundance was regulated in DKD. ****P < 0.0001. Scale bars represent 100 µm.

Cluster abundances correlate with clinical renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR). (a) Cluster 11 (impaired distal nephron metabolism) and (b) cluster 39 (dysregulated glucocorticoid receptor signaling). Scale bars represent 100 µm.

(a) Pseudotime analysis was performed based on our interpretable clusters, identifying a path from controls to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that correlates with histopathological changes. This path can be separated into two trajectories. (b) Trajectory 1 defined a transition based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), marking the range in renal function in our non-diabetic controls. Pseudotime was strongly associated with clusters representing loss of tubular integrity, extracellular matrix remodelling (ECM; fibrosis) and myofibroblast expansion (fibrosis). (c) Trajectory 2 was strongly associated with clusters representing podocyte injury, mitochondrial stress in proximal tubuli (PTs) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) dysfunction. PILOT uses non-linear regression methods and leverages the Wald test to evaluate the difference in the fitted model for each cluster vs. the model fitted for background clusters.

(a) Cell types identified via single-cell RNA-sequencing. Even in early diabetic kidney disease, transcripts related to ER stress, Ca2+-mediated tubular injury, integrin beta 1-, and GR-signaling (b), as well as ECM remodelling and pro-fibrotic signaling (c) showed differential gene expression patterns compatible with differences observed at the protein level found in advanced diabetic kidney disease. SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i)-treated patients exhibited incomplete modulation of transcriptomic changes.

A study led by a scientist at the University of California San Diego offers new warnings on the dangers of human interactions with wildlife.

Assistant Professor Shermin de Silva of the School of Biological Sciences studies endangered Asian elephants and has reported on their shrinking habitats, a downturn that has resulted in territorial conflicts between people and elephants.

Along with her study coauthors, de Silva now provides fresh evidence in the journal Ecological Solutions and Evidence on the serious consequences of humans supplying food to wild animals. The report indicates that such provisioning can lead wildlife to become habituated to people, causing the animals to become bolder and more prone to causing problems. Even for those who live in areas without native elephant populations, the new study provides cautionary information about interactions with any wildlife species living among us.

Wild elephants are a prime attraction in Asia, with Sri Lanka and India featuring some of the world's last abundant populations of Asian elephants.

In Sri Lanka, de Silva studied 18 years of elephant-tourist interactions at Udawalawe National Park. She found that the elephants congregating near tourists at the park's southern boundary have developed "begging" behavior and have become habituated to sugary foods, sometimes breaking through fences to continue being fed. As a result of elephants being drawn to the fence, several people have been killed or injured, and at least three elephants have been killed, while others have ingested plastic food bags and other contaminants. Such close human-wildlife encounters, including tourists feeding animals from sightseeing vehicles, also increases the risk of disease transmission to animals.

In India's Sigur region, study coauthors Priya Davidar and Jean-Philippe Puyravaud of the Sigur Nature Trust observed feeding interactions with 11 male Asian elephants, four of which died from suspected human causes. One elephant was successfully rehabilitated and returned to natural foraging behavior.

"Many people, especially foreign tourists, think Asian elephants are tame and docile, like domestic pets," said de Silva, a faculty member in the Department of Ecology, Behavior and Evolution and founder of the non-profit conservation organization Trunks & Leaves. "They don't realize these are formidable wild animals and try to get too close in order to take photographs or selfies, which can end badly for both parties."

Of the 800 to 1,200 elephants estimated living in Udawalawe National Park, the study found that 66 male elephants, or nine to 15% of the local male population of Asian elephants, were observed begging for food. Some elephants, including a popular male named Rambo, became local celebrities as they solicited food from tourists over several years.

"Food-conditioned animals can become dangerous, resulting in the injury and death of wildlife, people or both," the researchers note in their paper. "These negative impacts counteract potential benefits."

Since wild elephant feeding cannot be adequately regulated as an ongoing activity, the authors of the study recommend that feeding bans should be strictly enforced.

The researchers recognize that tourists are for the most part acting with good intentions, like people in many areas around the world who feed or leave food for wild animals in their regions. They can act from a motivation that they are helping friends in nature and take gratification from such interactions. "But this encourages wild animals to seek food from people, attracting them to areas that can put themselves or people at risk," said de Silva. "It can be a conduit for disease transfer between species. Such feeding can also cause animals to lose their ability to forage for themselves if the behavior becomes prevalent, especially with young animals."

Such interactions, de Silva says, can change animals' movement patterns and possibly force them to lose knowledge of natural food sources if they become too dependent on handouts.

With rare exceptions, people should avoid feeding wild animals, de Silva urges, and encourages people to engage in responsible tourism.

The success of cancer immunotherapies is predicated on the targeting of highly expressed neoepitopes, which preferentially favours malignancies with high mutational burden. Here we show that early responses by type-I interferons mediate the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors as well as epitope spreading in poorly immunogenic tumours and that these interferon responses can be enhanced via systemic administration of lipid particles loaded with RNA coding for tumour-unspecific antigens. In mice, the immune responses of tumours sensitive to checkpoint inhibitors were transferable to resistant tumours and resulted in heightened immunity with antigenic spreading that protected the animals from tumour rechallenge. Our findings show that the resistance of tumours to immunotherapy is dictated by the absence of a damage response, which can be restored by boosting early type-I interferon responses to enable epitope spreading and self-amplifying responses in treatment-refractory tumours.

The global PhD class of 2025 is entering the workforce at a tumultuous moment. In many ways, the world continues to course-correct from disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and students in the United States and beyond are weathering the  deep cuts to science and international collaborations by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Others are left wondering whether a research career is still worth pursuing, particularly in places facing economic crises or being torn apart by war, such as Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza.

US government funding for scientific research is currently approaching a 25-year low, even though global investment in research and development has tripled over the past three decades. But investment in science and technology hasn't necessarily led to more jobs, meaning that scientists attempting to launch their careers today continue to face shortages in faculty positions in academia alongside a shrinking industry job market.

Nature's careers team spoke to five early-career researchers who began their PhDs during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and are now planning their next steps. One requested anonymity, fearful of repercussions from speaking out. Whereas some are hopeful about their futures, others share how the challenges of the past few years have disrupted their plans or realigned their priorities.

Defended her PhD in astrophysics from the University of Kent in Canterbury, UK, in December 2024.

I started my PhD in September 2020, and despite the difficult conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, I was actually very fortunate. I had applied to PhD programmes outside Kent after completing my master's degree there, but ended up staying with my supervisor. I made that choice before the lockdowns happened, but it was an absolute blessing in disguise to have stayed in a place I knew. For my PhD, I characterized the surface spots on young stars using citizen-science data through a programme called the Hunting Outbursting Young Stars project. To really study how stars form, you need to look at day-to-day changes in these surface spots, which you could never get a professional observation facility to do because of the time and cost involved. Instead, I used data from citizen scientists who submit observations to a database using personal telescopes and cameras. Looking back on my PhD, I think that citizen science has the power to be important and effective in these uncertain and under-funded times.

I've been out of the academic world for about eight months now, and I'm a bit disillusioned because it feels like you can do everything right and still end up without a permanent position. Because of that, doing a postdoc hasn't been my first option, but the job market feels so bleak that I've reconsidered.

There are a lot of things I like about the United States, but I wouldn't touch a postdoc position there with a barge pole. I am a queer woman of child-bearing age who wants to have kids one day and, in my opinion, it's not great to be any of those things in the United States right now. I also have some chronic health conditions, and I don't want to have to navigate them in the US health-care system. Unfortunately, things feel only a little bit better in the United Kingdom because it seems like funding for UK research projects is scarce too.

When I think about parts of my career that still bring me joy, I think about my professional community. I've really enjoyed doing outreach and being in a university setting. I value that kind of devotion to learning and research. Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been mindful of connecting intentionally with colleagues. Maybe I don't see these people every day, because we're an international community, but I do try to appreciate those bonds and keep in touch. I think that's become important to all of us.

Earnt her neuroscience PhD from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in February.

I started my PhD in 2019 in a brand-new laboratory, and it was like the Wild West. We didn't even have pipettes when I started, and my principal investigator went on maternity leave soon after. But the past six years of my life have revolved around using mice to study what happens in our brains when we're isolated physically and socially from each other, which ended up being topical during the pandemic. Even so, I sometimes feel like I'm playing catch-up. The pandemic made me work creatively and forced me to be independent early on, but it also created challenges. When I started looking for jobs at the end of last year, it was tricky to navigate the dual disruptions of the pandemic and being one of the first students to graduate from my lab, both of which reduced the number of projects I've been able to jump on during my PhD.

I accepted a postdoc position through the University of Washington in Seattle and housed at the Veterans Affairs hospital there in November. Then, in February, I had a video meeting with the two PIs who I'd be splitting my time with, and they told me there'd been a federal hiring freeze (now extended until October). Right now, my postdoc position is in limbo, and it's hard not to feel that if I'd defended my PhD even two weeks earlier, I could have avoided this. When the freeze happened, the policy was that if you had already started paperwork for recruiting, you were allowed to continue.

#OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers

#OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers

It's difficult to plan around all the chaos, and I'm struggling to decide whether I should leave Utah to move to Washington — which is more expensive, but where my family is — or stay until things get sorted. I applied for a US National Research Service Award that funds postdoctoral research. If I get it, the award stipulates that I have to start spending it right away, so it might prompt some movement on beginning my postdoc.

Another complication is that I'm switching fields — from looking at social and emotional behaviours in mice, to studying circuits in neurodegeneration in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans — a model organism that I lack experience with. I applied for the postdoc grant over a marathon four days and just about fell over afterwards. Thank goodness for my cat, Yoshi, who is really bearing the responsibility of boosting my mental health.

If this grant doesn't come through, it's hard to know what I'll do. I've always heard that academia is the more stable career path, and part of me went looking for a postdoc position thinking that I could ride the uncertainty out, but it doesn't feel like that's the case any more. No matter which path I take, I think I would have encountered instability. My hope is that if I can get this position settled, the next five years will help me to work out the next steps.

Will defend his biochemistry PhD at the University of Wisconsin–Madison later this year.

I started my programme in August 2020, so COVID-19 restrictions made it interesting from the start. My cohort wanted to connect, but it was difficult because of social distancing, and it took me a long time to get my bearings in a new city (I'd moved from Illinois). Fortunately, I was still able to do two out of three lab rotations in person during my first year, and by the time I picked my lab in 2021, we were back to doing full-time research in person.

The bigger upset has been the uncertainty around US politics. I knew Trump was going to start his second term with more of a plan, but I didn't anticipate what would happen. Things are a mess, and it feels like a lot of unnecessary changes have been made to hinder science. It takes a toll mentally, but it also makes my principal investigator and lab group more conservative about our spending. We don't know how long the money is going to last or whether new funding will come in, so we're trying to cut costs. I've had to check with my supervisor about every little thing that I buy.

My thesis research is developing methods for sorting out and breaking down plastics in the municipal waste stream. I want to continue working in sustainable biotechnology, and there are three options for that: academia, government and industry. Academia is supposed to be the safe option, but there is little to no upward mobility and I'm not very interested in doing an academic postdoc. Government was a strong contender, but the US administration is cutting funding for government research and seems to be openly against sustainability, from what I've seen. Even if policies get walked back, many government researchers have already been laid off or resigned, and the public's trust has been lost. And then we get to industry. For years I've heard people say ‘biotechnology is in a slump, but maybe by the time you graduate, things will be better'. Now I'm about to graduate, and it seems worse than it was before I started.

So, on all three fronts, US job prospects are not great, and I don't want to compromise on the type of research I want to do. I will probably start looking for opportunities abroad. It's an internal conflict, however. Do I owe it to my community and country to stay and fight for a better world, or is leaving justified if it means living to fight another day? I don't want to sound too alarmist, but it does often feel as if people's livelihoods are on the line. It makes it hard to plan for the future.

A fifth-year PhD student at a university in Israel is seeking a postdoc opportunity abroad. They requested anonymity out of concern for their family's safety and future job prospects.

I wrote my master's thesis from a tiny, enclosed balcony in 2020 during lockdown. I stayed in the same lab for my PhD, but the uncertainty at that time didn't help with my motivation or planning my research for the next few years. I work with human data, and data collection was halted or intermittent for my first year, starting in late 2020 and into 2021. At the same time, Israel was in another period of intense anti-government protests because of criminal charges against our Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. My partner and I went to a few protests, but everything around it was scary — the police response, coronavirus and, above all, the uncertainty of whether the political climate would be one that I could stay in for the length of my PhD.

The most popular and universally predictive protein simulation models employ all-atom molecular dynamics, but they come at extreme computational cost. The development of a universal, computationally efficient coarse-grained (CG) model with similar prediction performance has been a long-standing challenge. By combining recent deep-learning methods with a large and diverse training set of all-atom protein simulations, we here develop a bottom–up CG force field with chemical transferability, which can be used for extrapolative molecular dynamics on new sequences not used during model parameterization. We demonstrate that the model successfully predicts metastable states of folded, unfolded and intermediate structures, the fluctuations of intrinsically disordered proteins and relative folding free energies of protein mutants, while being several orders of magnitude faster than an all-atom model. This showcases the feasibility of a universal and computationally efficient machine-learned CG model for proteins.

Over the past 50 years, substantial developments in hardware, software and theory have advanced the simulation of macromolecules from proof of principle to in silico study of protein folding and dynamics1,2. Despite this success, an ongoing challenge of the field is the accurate and efficient representation of large, biologically relevant systems. These systems are inherently multiscale: while fine-grained models must be used to describe local and fast processes, the long-timescale dynamics may be better captured at a coarse-grained (CG) resolution, which is both more computationally efficient and facilitates a more direct understanding of how macroscopic observables arise from interactions between microscopic degrees of freedom. Up to now, the most successful and widely used simulation approach is molecular dynamics (MD) with all-atom resolution1,3. Atomistic MD effectively models macromolecular changes, such as protein folding or protein–ligand binding, and predicts their thermodynamic properties. However, all-atom MD comes at extreme computational costs and requires great efforts to post-process and analyse the data4,5. It is still unclear whether there is a computationally efficient CG scale that lends itself to a general and accurate simulation model. Although deep-learning methods have been wildly successful in predicting protein structure and function by reasoning over large-scale genomic and structure datasets6,7, they often do not tie into a physical level of understanding. In this Article we show that deep learning can be used to develop a universal CG protein force field capable of predicting protein structures, structure transitions, folding mechanisms, folding upon binding of an intrinsically disordered peptide, and changes of free energy upon mutation, similar to all-atom MD methods, but orders of magnitude faster.

Most MD simulation studies employ atomistic force fields fitted on a combination of quantum-chemical calculations and experimental data. Modern force fields have been shown to be qualitatively accurate for processes on nanosecond to millisecond timescales and are often quantitatively consistent with experiments2,8. Recently introduced machine-learned force fields9,10,11 may capture the quantum-mechanical interactions between nuclei in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation even more accurately than conventional MD, but they also come at higher computational cost12.

Ever since the first protein simulations, the community has striven to develop universal (CG) macromolecular models that are computationally more efficient and more simple to analyse. The feasibility of such models is justified by statistical mechanical descriptions of protein dynamics, such as energy landscape theory13, and results from decades of analysis of atomistic simulations4. These studies suggest that a protein's free energy landscape can be sufficiently described by a reduced number of collective variables with minimal loss of accuracy compared with atomistic MD. Some CG models have shown success in specific systems. These include structure-based models14, which rely on the known native structure of a protein to explore its free energy landscape, the Martini15 CG force field, which can effectively model intermolecular interactions including membrane structure formation and protein interactions, and CG force fields developed to model protein folding and conformational dynamics such as UNRES16 or AWSEM17. These models are limited to system-specific applications. For instance, Martini inaccurately models intramolecular protein dynamics, and UNRES and AWSEM often do not capture alternative metastable states.

The main hindrance to the development of an accurate biomolecular CG model is the difficulty in efficiently modelling multi-body interaction terms, which are essential to realistically represent correct protein thermodynamics and implicit solvation effects18,19. In contrast, classical all-atom force fields model most non-bonded interactions as a sum of two-body terms.

Bottom–up CG force fields20 are typically fit to match the equilibrium distribution of an all-atom model, so they could in principle reach atomistic-level accuracy and predictiveness. By leveraging recent developments in deep learning, it has become possible to machine-learn such many-body CG force fields using neural networks18,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30. In particular, using the variational force-matching approach31,32, such force fields have been shown to accurately reproduce the all-atom distributions of CG observables for single18,21,22,25,27,33 and multiple proteins24. Despite these advancements, a transferable CG force field that could be considered as universal, quantitative, predictive and as reliable as a modern atomistic force field is still missing34.

In this Article we propose a neural network-based CG model that is truly transferable in sequence space. We learn the model parameters using a bottom–up approach from atomistic simulations of a set of proteins and then use it to successfully simulate the conformational dynamics of proteins never seen at any learning stage, with low (16–40%) sequence similarities to the training or validation protein set. This CG model is orders of magnitude faster than all-atom MD simulations, predicts metastable folded, unfolded and intermediate states comparable with all-atom MD simulations, and is consistent with experimental data for larger proteins, such as relative folding free energies of protein mutants, where converged all-atom simulations are not available. These results indicate that the CG model ‘learns' to represent effective physical interactions between the CG degrees of freedom and provides strong support for the hypothesis that, using deep-learning methods, a universal CG model for realistic and predictive protein simulations at low computational cost is within reach.

We generated a dataset of all-atom explicit solvent simulations of small proteins with diverse folded structures, as well as many combinations of dimers of mono- and dipeptides. Using the training data, we trained a CG force field, CGSchNet22, and conducted extensive simulations of the learned CG model on new, unseen proteins of various sizes and structures (details are presented in Fig. 1, Methods and Supplementary Section 1).

 Pipeline for building and testing a transferable, bottom–up, machine-learned, CG protein force field from a diverse dataset of all-atom simulations, a chosen CG resolution, and a set of basic physical prior energy terms (bonds, angles, dihedrals and purely repulsive interactions). The CG atom types z and CG coordinates x are transformed into pairwise distances dij are fed into the neural network architecture to predict the CG effective potential energy U and corresponding CG forces F. The trained neural network can subsequently be used to simulate new sequences and predict observables such as root mean square deviations (RMSD), radii of gyration (Rg) or dictionaries of secondary structure in proteins (d.s.s.p.).

To assess the ability of our approach for learning a transferable CG force field, we first tested how it reproduces the folding/unfolding free energy landscape of all-atom MD simulations for a set of unseen 8-peptides (Fig. 2a,b) and unseen small fast-folding proteins: the 025 mutant of chignolin (PDB 2RVD; Fig. 2c), TRPcage (2JOF; Fig. 2d), the beta–beta–alpha fold (BBA) (1FME; Fig. 2e) and the villin headpiece (1YRF; Fig. 2f). None of these proteins had sequence similarity >40% to any stretch of sequence from the training or validation datasets (Table 1 and Supplementary Section 5.3). The free energy surfaces of the CG model were obtained through parallel-tempering (PT) simulations to ensure converged sampling of the equilibrium distribution (Supplementary Section 4.2). Long constant-temperature (300 K) Langevin simulations were also performed for comparison, producing consistent results and multiple folding/unfolding events for all proteins (Supplementary Sections 6.4 and 6.9). We also obtained converged folding/unfolding reference landscapes from atomistic simulations for comparison.

Each subfigure shows the two-dimensional (2D) free energy (FE) surface of the CG model (CGSchNet) and reference atomistic simulations at 300 K as a function of the first two TICA coordinates39 for the two 8-peptides and as a function of the fraction of native contacts, Q, and the Cα r.m.s.d. to the native state for the four small proteins. The structures shown are sampled from the most folded-like metastable basin (or labelled metastable basins for the 8-peptides) for CGSchNet (orange) and atomistic (grey) models. CG free energy landscapes are obtained through Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR)-reweighted61 parallel-tempering simulations (details are provided in Supplementary Sections 4.2 and 6.4).

Source data

The free energy landscapes of the two 8-peptides match the atomistic references closely (Fig. 2a,b). These peptides are mostly disordered, and their landscapes are mostly determined by the torsional dynamics contained in the prior energy term of the model, whereas the machine-learned multi-body terms have a small effect on the result. In contrast, for the four fast-folding proteins (Fig. 2c–f), the neural network must learn to predict the configurational landscape; control simulations with only the prior energy term only visit the unfolded state for these proteins (Supplementary Fig. 7). For these systems, the CG model predicts metastable folding and unfolding transitions, and the CG folded states are predicted with a fraction of native contacts Q close to 1 and low Cα root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values, and they are populated with structures closely resembling the correct native state (Fig. 2c–f). For chignolin, the model is also able to stabilize the same misfolded state with misaligned TYR1 and TYR2 residues, as found in the reference atomistic simulations (Fig. 4).

For three of the four fast-folding proteins in Fig. 2, the free energy basin containing the native state is the global minimum, whereas for BBA it is a local minimum, indicating that all proteins are able to fold/unfold correctly (also Supplementary Fig. 25). However, the relative free energy differences between the metastable states do not exactly match the reference. The model performs better on chignolin, TRPcage and villin than on BBA, which contains both helical and anti-parallel β-sheet motifs. Previous CG models have also noted difficulty on this target system24,35.

To assess the ability of our CG model to fold and maintain the folded states of larger and more complicated systems, we considered the following proteins: 54-residue engrailed homeodomain (1ENH) and 73-residue de novo designed protein alpha3D (2A3D) (Fig. 3). The sizes of these proteins prevent atomistic simulations from sampling the folding/unfolding transitions in reasonable time, whereas the full free energy landscape can be easily explored by the CG model. Therefore, we simulate the folded state with the atomistic force field and compared these dynamics with those of our CG model, defining the lowest free energy minimum as the CG folded state. From extended configurations, the model simulates the folding of both proteins to their correct native structure (Fig. 3a,b).

a–h, 54-residue homeodomain (PDB 1ENH; a–d) and 73-residue alpha3D (PDB 2A3D; e–h). Cα r.m.s.f. values of the folded state to the crystal structure are shown (taken from a trajectory window that remained folded for more than one million MD steps; Supplementary Section 5.2) in comparison to reference (AMBER) all-atom simulations (c,g), along with an exploration of the free energy surface as a function of the fraction of native contacts, Q, and the Cα r.m.s.d. to the native state, obtained through MBAR-reweighted61 PT simulations (a,e). A folding trajectory starting from a completely elongated structure is shown (b,f), with orange structures illustrating folding and the crystal structure shown in grey (d,h).

Source data

We also compared the Cα root-mean-square fluctuations (r.m.s.f.) within the CG folded-state free energy minimum with the reference all-atom simulations. The CG model stabilizes homeodomain in a state very close to the reference native structure, with similar terminal flexibility to the all-atom simulations (Fig. 3a, bottom left) but with slightly higher fluctuations along the length of the sequence. The difference between the folded state predicted by our model and the crystal structure (mean r.m.s.d., ~0.5 nm; fraction of native contacts, ~0.75) is similar to that of the all-atom simulations from ref. 1 (Supplementary Fig. 12), suggesting the difficulty in accurately predicting homeodomain's crystalline structure.

Our reference simulations of alpha3D show flexibility at the termini as well as between each helical bundle (Fig. 3b), similar to the CG model. The CG model also stabilizes a metastable state of alpha3D very close to the native structure corresponding to an alternative three-helix bundle topology with a different packing of the helices (a detailed analysis is provided in Supplementary Section 6.8 and Supplementary Fig. 24). Alpha3D is a protein designed de novo by iteratively stabilizing the selected native state topology, and precursors of the protein populate both the native state and the alternative topology similar to the one detected by our model36.

These results show that the transferable machine-learned CG model can extrapolate to larger unseen proteins, stabilizing the correct native states and reproducing their associated backbone fluctuations. As an additional analysis, we also demonstrate the extrapolative performance of our CG model on stabilizing the folded states of two large proteins for which we only have experimentally determined structures as reference data, and on reproducing the conformational heterogeneity of a partially disordered protein. The results are discussed in detail in Supplementary Section 6.1.

We compared the characteristics of the learned CG energy landscapes with the reference simulations and with three other CG force fields with similar resolutions: AWSEM17, UNRES16 and Martini15 (Supplementary Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). We note that AWSEM is parameterized to stabilize native states17, and all presented targets should be stable at this temperature. Similarly, UNRES is parameterized with conformational data for multiple systems at several temperatures at ~300 K (ref. 16). The Martini force field is unable to stabilize the folded state of a protein without elastic restraints37,38; here, we show Martini simulation results without native restraints to compare the force field's ability to explore the conformational landscape of a protein system without prior knowledge of the protein's structure. In Supplementary Fig. 27, we show that Martini simulations with an elastic network only allow for small fluctuations around the native structure.

Figure 4 shows the free energy landscapes of the four small fast-folding proteins from Fig. 2 as a function of the two slowest time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) coordinates39, generated from extensive MD simulations using the reference all-atom model, CGSchNet, AWSEM, UNRES and Martini. The all-atom landscapes exhibit the most structure and have the most metastable states, whereas the CG landscapes are smoother. CGSchNet explores much of the all-atom free energy landscape and it clearly resolves folded and unfolded states as well as other metastable states, whereas this behaviour is rarely observed with the other CG models. Often, AWSEM, UNRES and Martini only stabilize a single metastable state, which is either folded or unfolded. This behaviour is expected, as both the AWSEM and UNRES force fields have been primarily parameterized for stabilizing proteins with a more pronounced fold rather than whole free energy landscapes of less stable proteins. Interestingly, there is also appreciable similarity between the all-atom reference and our machine-learned CGSchNet in structural ensembles besides the folded state prediction. For chignolin, all three all-atom main states (folded, misfolded and unfolded) are visited by both CGSchNet and AWSEM, but these are clearly metastable only with CGSchNet. AWSEM explores but does not stabilize the additional states, and UNRES and Martini do not fold chignolin at all. In the landscapes of TRPcage, BBA and villin, these differences are even more striking, as CGSchnet captures several of the metastable states of the all-atom reference, in particular those with a partial fold, but these states are not explored by the other CG force fields. Nevertheless, substantial differences in the unstructured states between the reference and CGSchNet indicate that there is still room for improvement in our CG model.

Results are presented for the reference atomistic simulations, for Langevin simulations of our CG model (CGSchNet), and for three different CG force fields of a comparable resolution to our CG model, AWSEM, UNRES and Martini. Each landscape includes representative structures from different metastable minima.

Source data

A quantitative comparison between the folded states obtained with an all-atom model for these proteins and the CG models considered here is presented in Supplementary Section 5.4. Not only does our model better populate and stabilize the native state structure than the other CG models, but it is comparable to a reference all-atom model (Supplementary Fig. 12). In particular, in the case of homeodomain (1ENH), the folded-like metastable state visited by the atomistic model is at a Q-value of around 0.6, lower than in our CG model.

It is important to note that our model is not designed primarily for structure prediction, but rather for the exploration of free energy landscapes for protein systems through CG MD. Unsurprisingly, structures predicted by AlphaFold36 for these test proteins are very close to the corresponding crystal structures, as AlphaFold models are primarily trained to recover PDB structures.

To test our CG model's extrapolative ability beyond protein folding, we consider the PUMA-MCL-1 system as a case study of concerted folding and binding of an intrinsically disordered peptide (IDP). The disordered BH3 motif of the PUMA ligand undergoes coupled folding and binding to the induced myeloid leukaemia cell differentiation protein MCL-140. Starting from an extended structure, we simulated the PUMA peptide with our transferable CG model either alone or in the presence of the folded MCL-1 protein. Figure 5 reports the evolution of the Cα r.m.s.d. of the ligand to its helical (folded) state during the simulations in both cases. The trajectories of the isolated PUMA (Fig. 5a,b, light blue) exhibit large r.m.s.d. fluctuations, indicating that the peptide remains disordered on its own. By contrast, the peptide simulated in the presence of the MCL-1 protein (orange) rapidly drops to an average r.m.s.d. value of ~2.5 Å, indicating induced folding of the peptide by the binding partner. The final simulation snapshot reported on the top right of Fig. 5a reinforces this result. Details about these simulations are provided in Supplementary Section 5.5.

a, Time series of the r.m.s.d. of the PUMA ligand to its reference helical (folded) structure from the PDB (2ROC) when simulated alone (light blue traces) or close to the folded MCL-1 protein (orange traces). On the left and on the right are shown the starting structure and a structure at the end of the simulation, respectively. b, As in a but when the PUMA peptide is simulated close to ubiquitin (PDB 1D3Z), which is not its correct binding partner. The horizontal dashed line marks the 0.25 nm threshold for comparison.

Source data

As a control, we simulated the unfolded PUMA ligand with a protein that is not known to induce its folding, ubiquitin (PDB 1D3Z). Here, although the peptide remains close to the protein, in none of the simulated trajectories does it fold into a stable helix, as indicated by the much larger deviations of the r.m.s.d. trace (in purple), and by the final simulation snapshot on the right of Fig. 5b. Together, these results indicate that, when simulated with our CG model, the PUMA peptide forms a stable helix only when in the presence of its correct binding partner, MCL-1. Although the CG model was trained partially on interacting mono/dipeptide pairs (Supplementary Section 1.2), the training data contain no protein–protein complexes such as MCL-1/PUMA. Despite this, the model learns nontrivial interactions that can correctly model the PUMA peptide both alone and in the presence of its correct binding partner.

We illustrate the extrapolative power of our chemically transferable CG model in estimating folding free energy changes upon mutations, comparable to experimentally measured ΔΔG values, as described in Methods and Supplementary Section 5.6. Such mutational analysis is straightforward using our CG model, because the identity of an amino acid is solely defined by the type of the Cβ bead in our model (or the Cα bead for GLY): mutations can be performed simply by changing these bead types as illustrated in Fig. 6a. We chose ubiquitin as a test system, given its extensive and available experimental data, focusing specifically on the set of conservative mutations investigated by Went and Jackson41. We note that ubiquitin has only 18% sequence similarly with any proteins in the training/validation datasets.

a, The resolution of the CG model allows for straightforward point mutations. b, Comparison of the ΔΔG value estimated from our model and the reference experimental ΔΔG at 298 K from ref. 41. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r = 0.63) and mean absolute error (MAE = 1.25 kcal mol−1) are also reported. The black dotted line shows y = x, and the shaded region marks the interval y = x ± 1 kcal mol−1. Error bars are estimated via bootstrapping, resampling 99 times by taking batches of 10,000 independent elements of the initial folded and unfolded ensembles for each mutation.

Source data

Figure 6b presents the comparison between the experimental ΔΔG values from ref. 41 and those obtained by our model as described in Supplementary Section 5.6. There is a strong correlation between our results and the experimental values; the Pearson correlation coefficient obtained with our CG model is comparable with what can be obtained with all-atom approaches42,43. This result indicates that the model has learned the general physical interactions among the residues at the CG resolution, thereby allowing useful predictions on new systems such as mutation effects.

We have shown that it is possible to machine-learn a transferable, bottom–up, CG effective force field that can be used for MD simulation on proteins with little sequence overlap with the systems used for training the model. Notably, the number of training systems is very small, containing only 50 small protein domains and 1,245 dimers of mono- or dipeptides. We have demonstrated that the model samples similar conformational spaces as an explicit water all-atom model, but is orders of magnitude faster (Supplementary Table 9). With this increased efficiency, the CG model can characterize the folding/unfolding free energy landscapes of larger proteins where comprehensive atomistic MD is unaffordable. Despite this substantial improvement, our current MD code is not optimized, and the simulation throughput can be further improved by implementing speedups and optimizing parallel batch simulation. Our model also excels in more difficult tasks, such as predicting the folding upon binding of an intrinsically disordered peptide in the presence of its protein partner, despite the lack of protein complexes in the training dataset. However, intrinsically disordered proteins appear too structured and compact in our model, which should be a subject for future investigation. Finally, we have used the model to estimate changes in stability upon mutation in the protein ubiquitin, finding good correlation with the experimentally measured values.

In contrast to models such as AlphaFold6, our model is not a protein structure prediction tool. Rather, it explores the complete free energy surface of the systems of interest, including but not limited to the folded protein structure. The ultimate goal of our model would be to reproduce the thermodynamics of our systems consistently with the underlying atomistic model, but there are some protein targets, such as BBA, where our model predicts the folded state as being less stable than the unfolded. Yet, even in these systems, our model predicts a metastability in the folded region of BBA's free energy landscape, whereas other CG models do not. Further improving the reliability of free energy predictions is an important future aim that will require both expanding the training dataset and further method development.

The key property of our CG model is the deep graph neural network (GNN) representation of its effective energy that can capture multi-body terms without imposing restrictive functional forms. The importance of multi-body terms in CG models has been extensively discussed in the literature18,19,44,45,46. Although it is expected that neural networks can capture the important multi-body effects, it is remarkable that such a CG force field is transferable in sequence space, especially given the rather small sequence coverage of the training set. A trade-off between structural accuracy and transferability has been observed in the past for various CG protein models47,48. However, most CG effective energy functions have been previously parameterized with pre-designed functional forms, limiting the ability to model multi-body interactions. In practice, this precluded the possibility of quantitatively investigating the accuracy/transferability trade-off in protein systems. A deep neural network is the natural answer to such a problem and allows us to address this challenge. Although this is not the first instance of a bottom–up machine-learning-based protein CG model18,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30, previously proposed versions were either explicitly parameterized for single specific systems or were not transferable to proteins substantially different from those used in training/validation datasets.

The particular neural network chosen here (SchNet49) is quite simple. It consists of a series of continuous-filter convolutions and does not include an attention mechanism, nor explicit long-range interaction terms. This architectural choice was motivated by the goal of developing a ‘proof-of-concept' model, that can be trained and simulated as fast as possible while still yielding the desired results. More sophisticated architectural choices could produce better-performing CG models. In particular, the lack of long-range interactions in our model may affect the model performance on much larger and multi-protein systems, where electrostatic interactions may play an important role50,51. Multiple approaches for including long-range interactions52,53,54,55 and/or attention mechanisms56 have been recently proposed for all-atom resolutions and could be incorporated into our modelling framework in the future.

To prevent our model from exploring nonphysical regions of conformational space, we employed a prior energy model (Supplementary Section 3.1); however, the model is quite sensitive to any change in this prior energy (Supplementary Section 3.3). The current functional form and parameterization of the prior model is the result of extensive testing, and this set of terms can be further optimized in future work.

It is also important to note that our CG model was trained at a specific thermodynamic condition. Transferability in temperature/pressure or other additional environmental parameters is therefore not expected at this point. In particular, the temperature dependence of the CG effective energy is highly nontrivial, as it really represents a free energy with an entropic component57. An explicit dependence of the model on thermodynamic conditions could, in principle, be included in the framework58,59. However, in practice, its training would require the curation of a substantially larger dataset encompassing multiple simulations at multiple thermodynamic conditions, which would probably require even more large-scale computational resources than those used in this work.

The results presented here were obtained with a model that, although aggressively coarse-grained with respect to an explicit water atomistic model, still retains the full backbone heavy atoms and an additional atom per side chain (excluding GLY). We have not yet investigated alternative resolutions for building a transferable model, and we expect transferability to be strongly tied to the chosen resolution. Although different methods have been proposed for the simultaneous optimization of CG effective energy and CG mapping60, it remains unclear if and which additional resolutions allow for the optimal design of a transferable and quantitatively accurate model. We believe that the results presented here open the way to a systematic investigation of this point.

We generated a dataset of all-atom explicit solvent simulations of 50 CATH domains62, representing small proteins with diverse folded structures, as well as ~1,200 dimers of mono- and dipeptides. We stored all instantaneous forces on the protein atoms, performed basic force aggregation on a CG backbone representation of the proteins27, and trained a CG force field, CGSchNet22, which combines a deep GNN with physically motivated prior terms. We then conducted a series of extensive Langevin and PT simulations of the learned CG model on new, unseen proteins of various sizes and structures to demonstrate its capabilities and limitations. Wherever feasible, we also performed extensive all-atom MD simulations for the test systems and analysed them with Markov state modelling4,5 for comparison.

Our model was built using the deep-learning Python packages PyTorch63 and PyTorch Geometric64. Building on previous efforts22,27,33, we chose to model the optimizable term of our CG effective energy with the GNN architecture CGSchNet, which is based on a previous architecture, SchNet49. See Supplementary Section 2 for a detailed description of network architecture, hyperparameter choices and training routines. The ability to directly learn species-dependent interactions and CG bead-wise features from data represents the primary advantage of using a convolutional GNN such as CGSchNet in this pursuit. More recent GNN architectures65,66 may be used as an alternative. However, we note that newer architectures can require more computational resources and more extensive hyperparameter searches, thereby creating substantial training barriers given the large number of MD simulation frames and the system sizes used in training.

We designed our CG model within the framework of variational force-matching31,32. In practice, we optimize the parameters {θ} of a network representing the effective energy \({\tilde{U}}_{\rm{CG}}({\bf{R}};\{\theta \})\), where R are the CG coordinates, by minimizing a loss function in the form

Here, N is the number of CG atoms in the system. In equation (1), \({\tilde{{\bf{F}}}}_{{\rm{CG}},\,\Delta }({\bf{R}};\{\theta \})\) are the forces associated with the CG effective energy, \({\tilde{{\bf{F}}}}_{\rm{CG}}({\bf{R}};\{\theta \})=-{\nabla }_{{\bf{R}}}{\tilde{U}}_{\rm{CG}}({\bf{R}};\{\theta \})\), after subtraction of the ‘prior forces':

where \({{\bf{F}}}_{{\rm{prior}}}({\bf{R}})=-{\nabla }_{{\bf{R}}}{\tilde{U}}_{{\rm{prior}}}({\bf{R}})\) and \({\tilde{U}}_{{\rm{prior}}}({\bf{R}})\) is a pre-fit ‘prior energy' term. The atomistic force is similarly modified. The definition of a prior energy is discussed in the next section and it has been shown to play an important role in constructing stable and accurate neural network-based CG models by enforcing asymptotic physical behaviour in regions of phase space not covered adequately by training/validation datasets obtained through all-atom MD21,22,33,34. In equation (1), the operator \({{\mathcal{M}}}_{F}\) projects the atomistic forces fAA(r), as a function of the atomistic coordinates r, in CG space. We have shown in previous work that a careful choice of \({{\mathcal{M}}}_{F}\) is crucial to the optimization of the CG model27. In this Article, \({{\mathcal{M}}}_{F}\) is defined for each CG site as the sum of forces on the preserved atom and neighbouring hydrogen atoms connected via constrained bonds27.

A good choice of the prior energy model should be connected to the resolution chosen to define the CG model34. Previous non-transferable CG studies22,25,27 have utilized a resolution that retains only the Cα atoms for each amino acid. However, when considering 20 naturally occurring amino acids, the type enumeration for common local energy terms, such as four-body dihedral interactions, becomes very large. Efforts in the past48 have attempted to mitigate such scaling, but this can lead to potentially limiting or overly biasing expressions for the associated prior energies.

For this work we chose to retain the following five atoms for each residue: backbone N, Cα, C, O and side-chain Cβ. We label different atoms with an integer atom type, with the Cβ atom having a residue-dependent atom type number. In the case of GLY residues, which do not contain a Cβ, we retain only four atoms—N, Cα, C and O—and assign the residue-dependent atom type number to the Cα atom. Supplementary Fig. 3 provides a graphical description of the CG resolution and atom type labelling.

This five-bead-per-residue CG mapping is not unprecedented—the successful AWSEM17 CG force field, which retains the Cα, the Cβ and the O atoms (as well as virtual sites for N and C atoms), utilizes a comparable resolution. This choice of CG resolution allows for a direct interpretation of secondary structures and leads to intuitive prior energy choices (for example, physical bond/angle terms, physical dihedral angles and so on). A description of the terms in the prior force field is provided in Supplementary Section 3.1.

It is important to stress that if the prior energy is used alone (without the trainable neural network energy term \({\tilde{U}}_{\rm{CG}}({\bf{R}};\{\theta \})\)), it is completely incapable of stabilizing any secondary or tertiary protein structures (Supplementary Fig. 7 presents the results from control, prior-only simulations). The function of the prior energy is only to prevent the model from visiting configurationally nonphysical regions (for example, configurations involving overlapping atoms), with little to no additional bias on the configurational landscape. To illustrate the relative importance of each prior on model stability/ability to access unphysical configurations, we include a prior ablation study, where the effect of removing each prior subinteraction, one by one, is investigated on a chignolin-specific model at the same five-bead-per-residue resolution (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Three strategies were used to create the training dataset. First, to capture sequence and secondary/tertiary structure diversity in proteins, we constructed a dataset of all-atom simulations of 50 protein domains in their native state from the CATH62 database (Supplementary Section 1.1 presents the domain selection procedure). Each simulation represents 100,000 frames of all-atom MD data in which the forces and positions of the solute are saved. In addition to this dataset of folded CATH simulations, we constructed a second dataset wherein ~1,200 mono/dipeptide dimer systems were simulated using umbrella sampling with dimer centre-of-mass distances as a reaction coordinate, and each system consists of 27,000 frames. Although this dataset does not contain direct secondary/tertiary structure information, it contains valuable asymptotic force information for atoms that are brought very close together through the nature of the enhanced sampling strategy. The necessity for both the CATH and dimer datasets was demonstrated by an ablation study in which we systematically remove both entire datasets and selected samples (Supplementary Fig. 20). Finally, additional frames were constructed from the previously described CATH and dimers datasets by taking every 50th frame of each simulation and additively combining bead positions with a Gaussian noise of mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5 Å (Supplementary Section 6.6 provides details of the hyperparameter selection). These distorted ‘decoy' frames were combined with a zero delta-force label and used as additional training data, and are designed to prevent uncontrolled neural network extrapolation on distorted high-energy configurations that may arise transiently during CG simulation. Due to the induced distortion, the prior alone predicts a high baseline energy on the corresponding areas of phase space. Effectively, the decoy training data helps to ensure that the network does not attempt to predict strong forces in configurations that should be dominated by the prior terms. A comprehensive discussion on the training and validation datasets that are used to parameterize the model is provided in Supplementary Section 1.

From the CG model, we can estimate ΔΔG values by treating the effect of a single point mutation as a perturbation to the wild-type energy67,68. Under the assumption that the mutation does not significantly perturb the density of states, the effect of the mutation on protein stability can be estimated from perturbation theory67,68 (a detailed analysis is provided in Supplementary Section 5.6).

Most faunas from the Mesozoic era were dominated by sauropod dinosaurs, the largest terrestrial animals to ever exist. These megaherbivores were remarkably diverse and widely distributed. Here we study three Late Jurassic faunas from the USA, Portugal and Tanzania, each approximately 150 million years old, which are known for their extreme sauropod diversity. Whereas general taxonomic composition was similar in these three faunas, the major clades differed in relative abundance. Moreover, their depositional strata record distinct climatic regimes. Using dental microwear texture analysis, we investigated the impact of these climate regimes and the resulting food availability on the different sauropod taxa. Wear patterns in camarasaurid macronarians show minimal variation across different climate regimes, supporting previous studies suggesting that these animals migrated to follow their preferred climate niche and food source. North American camarasaurids show similar wear patterns to those of Portuguese turiasaurs, another broad-crowned taxon, which did not exist in the Jurassic of North America. By contrast, where camarasaurids and turiasaurs co-occurred in Portugal, their microwear patterns are distinct, suggesting niche differentiation to avoid ecological competition between these two clades. Flagellicaudatan diplodocoids display highly variable wear patterns, indicating limited migration (and therefore seasonal variation in diet), which aligns with observed biogeography patterns in the USA. Early-branching titanosauriforms show highly distinct wear patterns between different climate regimes, which can probably be attributed to different abrasive loads in the respective habitats. Our results demonstrate that dental microwear texture analysis not only records dietary preferences but also reveals behaviour such as competition and migration related to dietary niches in past ecosystems.

Late Jurassic ecosystems across the planet were dominated by sauropod dinosaurs in terms of size and body mass contribution1. The three best-known and represented Late Jurassic faunas are from the USA, Tanzania and Portugal. These sauropod faunas had very similar taxonomic compositions, with brachiosaurid macronarians and diplodocoids occurring in all three. The North American and Portuguese faunas furthermore shared the presence of camarasaurid macronarians, whereas turiasaurs and early somphospondylans occur both in Portugal and Tanzania. The Tanzanian fauna further included non-neosauropod mamenchisaurids2,3,4,5,6,7, which are otherwise primarily known from the Jurassic of Asia8,9,10,11. Although generally similar, within-clade species diversity and the abundance of individuals from the distinct taxa are different between the three faunas. Whereas camarasaurid macronarians and diplodocid diplodocoids dominated in the USA12,13,14,15, brachiosaurid titanosauriforms and dicraeosaurid diplodocoids predominated in Tanzania5,16 and turiasaurs in Portugal17,18. The reasons for these unequal distributions of taxon abundance remain poorly understood.

As the largest terrestrial megaherbivores that ever roamed the Earth, sauropods must have greatly depended on plant productivity and availability. Similarly to sauropods, major plant groups were distributed globally during the Late Jurassic, with conifers forming the canopy together with ginkgoes. Tree ferns reached intermediate heights, whereas other ferns, seed ferns, cycads and horsetails usually composed the understorey. The only notable difference between the floras of the three sauropod-bearing formations was the absence of the conifer clade Pinaceae and of horsetails in Tendaguru, where also cycads were a comparatively minor component of the plant cover19,20,21. Moreover, the relative abundance of the different plant clades differed between the three biomes21, which was correlated to distinct climate regimes.

Palaeoclimatic reconstructions indicate different climatic conditions in these three regions during the Late Jurassic20,22,23,24,25. The western USA was reconstructed as semi-arid to arid, with a mean annual temperature ranging between 12 °C and 30 °C, depending on latitude22,25 and probably strong seasonality24. Mean annual precipitation was found to be higher in Portugal and Tanzania compared with the USA, suggesting a more humid climate than in the USA24,25. In Portugal, mean annual temperature ranged between 18 °C and 24 °C, whereas it was considerably warmer, with 24–30 °C, in Tanzania25. Seasonality was probably strong in Tanzania as well, with wet winters22,26 and dry summers20, corresponding to a monsoon-type climate25. We hypothesize that these different climate regimes probably controlled forage availability, which in turn shaped distribution and abundance of different sauropod taxa adapted for foraging on specific plant taxa. Furthermore, we propose that large-bodied herbivores in such habitats affected by seasonality either adopted a generalist feeding strategy, using diverse dietary resources in the same place year-round, or depended upon seasonal migration if they had a narrower dietary niche.

Strong niche partitioning between major sauropod groups has been suggested on the basis of their distinct skull shapes and tooth morphologies, and the posture of the neck and forelimbs7,18,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40. However, morphology can provide only general information about possible feeding adaptations and is not direct evidence whether a certain dietary resource was actually exploited. A promising avenue to assess niche partitioning in sauropods and other archosaurs is the study of dental microwear as a dietary proxy35,41,42,43,44,45,46. We here use three-dimensional dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA), a semi-automated quantitative approach to evaluate microscopic surface wear of enamel wear facets47,48, as a means to test whether distinct sauropod taxa occupied the same niche in three different geographical areas (Fig. 1) irrespective of climate, and how these food preferences and availability may have shaped sauropod distribution during the Late Jurassic period.

We analysed measurements taken from the enamel of buccal and occlusal surfaces from the sauropod dental microwear texture (DMT) dataset acquired by ref. 49, which were categorized as either scan quality 1 or 2 (see Methods and refs. 49,50 for details). Because ref. 50 found that measurements from casted tooth surfaces in this dataset yielded inaccurate results, we only exported measurements taken from original teeth and from moulds. Furthermore, as we aimed to compare the impact of diverging climatic regimes on the well-studied faunas of the Morrison (USA), Tendaguru (Tanzania) and Lourinhã (Portugal) Formations, we excluded all measurements of teeth from other geographical areas. The final set of 322 measurements belongs to 39 sauropod individuals, 17 of which were recovered from the Lourinhã Formation (Portugal; all represented by isolated teeth), 13 from the Morrison Formation (USA; between 1 and 8 teeth per specimen) and 9 from the Tendaguru Formation (Tanzania; between 1 and 8 teeth per specimen) (Supplementary Table 1). They include teeth from a range of tooth positions and wear stages, but these differences are expected to have minimal impact on the final results because (1) there are relatively few morphological differences along the tooth rows of sauropods7,18,32,51,52 and (2) based on studies on mammalian dental microwear, recorded wear features in the tooth enamel reflect the ingesta of the past few weeks to months irrespective of how worn they already are53,54,55.

Despite our sampling efforts, the three geological formations and four clades could not be equally represented. Owing to the difference in sample size and distribution of clades, our study sample allows for limited direct comparisons of clades in different faunas and climate regimes (Fig. 1). Turiasaur samples were restricted to Portugal. Camarasaurids and flagellicaudatans were sampled from Portugal and the USA. Titanosauriforms could be compared between Portugal and Tanzania. For representative images of typical teeth and analysed microwear patterns for each taxon and geological formation, see Extended Data Fig. 1.

First, we tested whether buccal and occlusal surfaces could be compared directly. Most height (matf, metf, Sa, Sdc, Sk, Sp, Sq, Sv, Sz; see Supplementary Table 6 for parameter descriptions) and volume (Vm, Vmc, Vv, Vvc, Vvv) parameter values were larger for occlusal surfaces than for buccal surfaces in Titanosauriformes, Camarasauridae, Turiasauria and an unidentified macronarian (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Complexity (Asfc, Sdr) and mean slope (Sdq) parameters showed the same pattern. Mean density of furrows (medf) was comparable for occlusal and buccal surfaces in Camarasauridae and Turiasauria, but it was lower for occlusal surfaces than buccal surfaces in Titanosauriformes. For Flagellicaudata, only four scans of one occlusal surface were of good enough quality for the analyses, all other surfaces were buccal. Height and volume parameters were very similar between buccal and occlusal surfaces, whereas complexity (Asfc, Sdr) and density of furrows (medf) were higher for buccal surfaces than for occlusal surfaces in Flagellicaudata (opposite to macronarians and turiasaurs). Given the ambiguous results, we performed the subsequent analyses both with separate datasets for occlusal and buccal surfaces, as well as with the combined dataset.

Owing to the distinct differences between buccal and occlusal surfaces for all parameters and in most clades, we separate surfaces in analyses concerning diet reconstruction. Note that Flagellicaudata from Portugal, unidentified Macronaria from the USA, and unidentified Sauropoda and Macronaria from Tanzania are missing as they are only represented by either buccal or occlusal surfaces.

Of all major clades, flagellicaudatans show the highest variability across all geographical regions and in nearly all parameter values (Supplementary Fig. 1). Sampled titanosauriforms from Tanzania (which are probably all brachiosaurids; E.T., personal observation, 2022) are highly variable as well, whereas camarasaurids and turiasaurs occupy very restricted areas in the principal component analysis (PCA) plots (Fig. 3). In a canonical variate analysis (CVA), taxa could mostly be separated with little overlap and confident assignment to the correct clade (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 2). However, Portuguese titanosauriforms and turiasaurs strongly overlap with North American camarasaurids, and to a lesser extent with flagellicaudatans from Portugal (Fig. 4a). These four groups are all distinct from Portuguese camarasaurids, North American flagellicaudatans and brachiosaurids from Tanzania (Fig. 4).

Comparing taxa measured from two different geographical regions, flagellicaudatans from Portugal had distinctly lower values related to wear surface complexity, slope and density of furrows, than North American flagellicaudatans. Titanosauriforms from Tanzania tend to show larger height and volume parameters, as well as higher complexity values, and significantly larger slope and density than those from Portugal (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 4). Camarasaurids from Portugal and the USA are similar in parameter values, except for height and volume parameter values, which are higher in Portuguese camarasaurids compared with those from the USA (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 4). Different regions (and thus climate regimes) also seem to have had a distinct impact on wear patterns of their megaherbivore inhabitants. When comparing only buccal surfaces, visible, non-significant differences exist between flagellicaudatans from the USA and Portugal and between titanosauriforms from Tanzania and Portugal. Camarasaurids from the USA and Portugal are very similar in most DMT parameters (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 4). When compared with brachiosaurids from Tanzania, significant differences are found with camarasaurids from both Portugal and the USA (Fig. 5) as well as with flagellicaudatans from Portugal (Supplementary Table 4).

In Portugal, no differences are seen among taxa regarding complexity parameters (Asfc, Sdr). These parameters, however, are clearly distinct between flagellicaudatans (larger and more variable) and camarasaurids (lower and more consistent) in the USA. Slope (Sdq) and density of furrows (medf) followed a similar pattern to complexity parameters, with little differences between all sauropod clades from Portugal, whereas in the USA, flagellicaudatans showed distinctly larger values than camarasaurids.

Only limited comparisons can be made within the Tanzanian sample, because the vast majority of sampled teeth were from brachiosaurid titanosauriforms. Only an indeterminate sauropod tooth and an indeterminate macronarian survived the dataset cleansing for the final analyses. Whereas the absence of enamel wrinkling on the indeterminate sauropod tooth suggests a basal, non-eusauropod affinity (which is surprising because such early forms are currently not represented by other skeletal material in the Late Jurassic biomes discussed above)5,7,14,18,56, the indeterminate macronarian tooth could stem from a brachiosaurid titanosauriform. The single occlusal surface from the indeterminate sauropod and the single buccal surface of the macronarian fell within the range of brachiosaurid buccal surfaces, so all specimens from Tanzania showed similar values within the fauna.

Overall, there seems to be a strong location-specific tendency consistent across taxa (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 5). Pooled specimens from Tanzania are characterized by significantly larger complexity (Asfc, Sdr) and density of furrows (medf) when compared with pooled specimens from both Portugal and the USA. This location-specific separation also becomes evident in the PCAs, which show a clear separation of the Tanzanian fauna from the Portuguese fauna. The assemblage from the USA partially overlaps with Tanzania when buccal or buccal and occlusal surfaces are considered but is completely separated when only occlusal surfaces are considered. USA and Portugal greatly overlap, regardless of whether occlusal, buccal or all surfaces are compared.

DMTA revealed dietary overlap between some sauropod clades, but also distinct niche segregation between others. Moreover, ecosystem (fauna)-specific wear signatures indicate that habitat parameters in the three analysed Late Jurassic ecosystems from Portugal (Lourinã Formation), USA (Morrison Formation) and Tanzania (Tendaguru Formation) were different, probably owing to climatic differences, which affected both plant community and environmental abrasive load.

Overall higher roughness and complexity were observed in occlusal versus buccal surfaces in all taxa except for Flagellicaudata, where occlusal surfaces could only be observed in one tooth specimen. Hence, the limited occurrence of flagellicaudatan occlusal surfaces in our dataset hampers direct comparison with taxa that had tooth-to-tooth occlusion (and mammaliaform comparisons). The differences in occlusal versus buccal wear patterns are probably related to the different tooth morphologies. Turiasaurs and early-branching macronarians (represented by camarasaurids, brachiosaurids and possibly early somphospondylans in our dataset; Fig. 1), show true occlusion between antagonistic teeth. Such tooth-to-tooth occlusion resulted in strongly developed, V-shaped wear facets reaching from the apex down the mesial and distal surfaces7,17,18,27,28,35,51. Although the teeth lack adaptations for advanced oral food processing, such as chewing, such attritional contacts increase general wear on the occlusal surfaces compared with buccal surfaces. Through attritional contacts and tooth-to-tooth interaction, food is also trapped between teeth more efficiently, resulting in more tooth-to-food contacts (abrasion). Buccal surfaces hence experience less food contacts than occlusal surfaces, which is also evidenced by the development of the distinct occlusal wear facets with exposed dentin. In flagellicaudatans, the very narrow, pencil-shaped teeth show no distinct occlusal contacts, and only a single wear facet with exposed dentin formed on the tip of the tooth, which can be considered ‘occlusal surface-like' (compare Fig. 1).

Camarasaurids and turiasaurs had very similarly shaped, broad-crowned teeth with well-developed tooth-to-tooth occlusion7,17,18,51 and relatively narrow snouts57,58. Although these overlapping morphologies may suggest similarities in feeding niche, there was a distinct separation between camarasaurids and turiasaurs co-occurring in Portugal based on DMT data (Fig. 4a). North American camarasaurids, on the other hand, show considerable overlap with Portuguese turiasaurs. They show consistently low (height and roughness) signals, which is interpreted as a low-abrasive, consistent diet. In generalists, we would expect greater diversity of incorporated forage plants, and hence also a less consistent, more variable DMT signal. Portuguese camarasaurids are slightly different from their counterparts from the Morrison Formation, showing overall larger surface roughness. This pattern is best explained by ecological competition between camarasaurids and turiasaurs where they co-occurred in Portugal, which resulted in niche partitioning. Our data suggest that camarasaurids in Lourinã ended up occupying a different dietary niche from turiasaurs, and from contemporary camarasaurids, in North America. The absence of turiasaurs in the North American Morrison Formation allowed camarasaurids on that continent to occupy a similar feeding niche as that occupied by turiasaurs in Portugal (Fig. 4a). The unique dietary niche of camarasaurids in Lourinhã indicates that camarasaurids were more flexible in their dietary traits than turiasaurs, or that turiasaurs outcompeted camarasaurids in their preferred niche in Portugal—or a combination of both. At the same time, camarasaurids from North America and Portugal were similar in their very low variability of wear features.

Additional evidence for migratory behaviour in sauropods derived from dental wear studies is important, as the currently available evidence is so sparse. On the basis of stable isotope data from a single Camarasaurus tooth from the Morrison Formation, ref. 59 suggested that this animal migrated throughout the year, potentially following its preferred food source and/or climate niche over the seasons. In fact, the strong seasonality in the Morrison Formation habitat24 probably impacted availability of a herbivore's preferred forage. A seasonal signal is known from microwear in mammals53,54,55, and must have been present in sauropods, too, given their high tooth formation and replacement rates52,60,61,62, which led to very short exposure times of a few weeks to maximum 2 or 3 months for each functional tooth. Therefore, if seasonal dietary shifts existed, finding a consistent dental microwear signal within one sauropod taxon is unlikely, as it would imply that all sampled teeth were derived from individuals that died in the same season. The consistently low variation in the DMT signal of camarasaurids from both the Morrison and the Lourinhã Formations is hence remarkable. It hints at a very narrow dietary niche occupied by camarasaurids, which may have forced these taxa to seasonally migrate and follow climate-driven availability patterns of their preferred food source throughout the seasons—not only in northern America but also in Portugal. Their absence from the Tendaguru fauna5 could indicate that camarasaurids were not well-adapted for the hot, tropical, and presumably less seasonal, climate of the region.

The strongly variable signal in flagellicaudatans of the Morrison and Lourinhã Formations, in combination with even faster tooth replacement rates than camarasaurids52,60, on the other hand, hints at a broad dietary niche and rather unselective foraging. Unselective foraging has also been inferred for at least adult flagellicaudatans on the basis of their squared snout shape35. Such a broad dietary niche, indicated by variable DMT and the presence of differently sized wear features, would have allowed these animals to shift their diet to adapt to seasonal availability of resources. A seasonal dietary shift would render migration in this clade less necessary. Non-migratory behaviour in flagellicaudatans is also in parts supported by the biogeographic pattern of these clades within the Morrison Formation, where macronarian genera generally seem to have been more widespread compared with flagellicaudatan genera13,15,63,64. The more global distribution of macronarians within the formation may then have been partly due to their migratory behaviour, whereas flagellicaudatans restricted their geographic range by not migrating. The different environments they inhabited seem to have impacted microwear patterns, too.

The strongly overlapping ranges of Portuguese titanosauriforms and turiasaurs in the CVA (Fig. 4), controlled by their high similarity in general surface roughness and complexity (Supplementary Fig. 1), show that these clades cannot securely be distinguished on the basis of DMT patterns. Hence, there seems to be a very strong environmental signal that overprints any dietary niche signal in Portugal, at least in these two clades, no strict niche separation between them or a distinct niche separation that could not be captured by DMTA or within the available dental sample. The overall lower values for height, volume and complexity parameters as well as low density of furrows for taxa from Portugal as compared with the Tanzanian fauna indicate that a low-abrasive diet was abundantly available in Portugal. Portuguese titanosauriforms, camarasaurids and turiasaurs are all very similar in their DMT patterns (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). If these taxa were all migrating to some extent, following their preferred low-abrasive food sources, they must have occupied large enough home ranges to avoid competition—which seems to be supported by their large body size65. Camarasaurids from the USA showed very similar dental wear to turiasaurs (and also camarasaurids, to some degree) from Portugal (Fig. 4a). The Tanzanian taxa, however, are significantly different (compare Fig. 6). Brachiosaurid titanosauriforms dominate our sample from Tanzania, and the combined sauropod fauna from Tendaguru show significantly larger complexity and density of furrows as compared with the faunas from both Portugal and the USA. Therefore, the sauropod taxa from the Tendaguru ecosystem must have differed in feeding preferences and/or Tendaguru sauropods ingested much higher abrasive loads compared with sauropods from the other two ecosystems, and especially in Portugal, where titanosauriforms showed distinctly lower surface roughness and complexity than in Tanzania (Fig. 6).

Although the flora of the Tendaguru Formation is different from that of the Lourinhã and Morrison Formations, in the absence of horsetails and pinacean conifers, and the low abundance of cycads19,20,21, several lines of evidence suggest that this was not the primary cause for the comparatively strong abrasion in Tendaguru sauropod teeth. Intrinsic abrasives in plants are mostly hard parts, such as seeds and silica-rich phytoliths. In the Tendaguru ecosystem, plants with extant relatives that have a high silica content were ginkgoes, cycads and possibly some ferns21,66. These were rather minor components of the flora, however21, with ginkgoes mostly growing in conifer-dominated forests20; conifers are relatively low in phytolith content66. We would therefore not expect overall stronger abrasion in an ecosystem with a lower relative abundance of highly abrasive plants, as is the case in Tendaguru. Moreover, given that titanosauriforms (the only clade we can compare directly between Tendaguru and another biome, in this case Lourinhã) had relatively broad snouts and reached enormous body masses, they were probably rather unselective in their diet, and it is therefore unlikely that they focused on these minor and silica-rich components of the flora. The presence of brachiosaurids and other early-branching titanosauriforms with similar morphologies in all three biomes analysed herein furthermore suggests that food preferences of these sauropods were comparable in the different biomes. The distinct abrasion patterns in sauropod teeth from Tendaguru are thus unlikely to be produced by plant-intrinsic abrasives. In fact, such intrinsic abrasives have already been shown to have a lesser impact on dental wear than external mineral abrasives.

Data from mammals67,68,69,70,71 suggest that external mineral abrasives incorporated with the diet have a more pronounced effect on observed DMT signatures than plant type and phytolith content. Feeding experiments have shown that depth and complexity of wear features in particular, as well as density of furrows, were more strongly impacted by diets with high external abrasive load than by diets with high phytolith content. The observed distinct differences in complexity (Asfc) and density of furrows (medf) in Tanzanian brachiosaurids hence are probably stemming from a certain environmental grit load, rather than just phytoliths as internal abrasives of ingesta.

Considering that the Tendaguru ecosystem in Tanzania was a riverine environment featuring extended floodplain areas, a potential source of grit would have been forage gathered close to the ground35,41. Low-level forage always comes with substantial amounts of sand and grit attached, if either pulled out of the ground or eaten shortly after rainfall on sandy ground. In extant herbivorous ungulates, soil intake can be up to 33% of dry matter intake in sheep72,73 or 0.5–1.5 kg in cattle74. However, our measurements from Tendaguru are mostly from brachiosaurids, which have obvious adaptations for high-level foraging27,29,34. Moreover, the Tendaguru fauna includes relatively abundant remains from the flagellicaudatans Dicraeosaurus and Tornieria, which have been consistently reconstructed as a low-to-mid-level feeders29,35,52, but no sampled flagellicaudatan tooth from Tendaguru survived our quality checks49,50. The higher abrasive load in Tendaguru brachiosaurids compared with all sauropod teeth except for two teeth referred to Flagellicaudata from the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal (Fig. 6) therefore rather stems from the geographical location of the two ecosystems.

Palaeogeographic reconstructions suggest that Tendaguru would have been near an enormous desert belt, which stretched approximately between palaeolatitudes 16° and 32° S (ref. 75). The presence of this desert probably resulted in wind-blown particles frequently covering the vegetation, which in turn caused more pronounced abrasive wear. In fact, sand-sized external quartz abrasives are known to cause large complexity and roughness values in mammalian herbivores69,71 that exceed parameter values attributed to high phytolith load. The recovered DMT patterns in Tendaguru sauropods fit this observation (Figs. 2 and 6). Consequently, we think that the hypothesis of the nearby desert as the main contributor of grit to the abrasive load of the Tendaguru environment explains our observed patterns best.

DMTs can be impacted by a number of factors related to intrinsic features of the food the individual had ingested, the general external abrasive load in the environment and the behaviour of the feeding individual. Teasing apart these factors in fossil ecosystems is not straightforward. In fact, our recovered within-taxon differences across different ecosystems and climate regimes indicate that inferences based on a limited sampling must be treated with some caution. Nevertheless, our study also shows that with careful investigation and correlation of microwear data with climate reconstructions, palaeobotanical evidence and morphological feeding adaptations, some of these factors can be identified. In fact, our data suggest ecological competition between broad-crowned taxa based on distinct patterns in dental microwear. Additionally, low variation in wear features supports earlier reports of migratory behaviour for camarasaurids in the Morrison and Lourinhã Formations, whereas a non-migratory behaviour can be suggested for flagellicaudatans on the basis of highly variable microwear patterns. Moreover, we could detect distinct microwear texture differences in titanosauriforms from Lourinhã and Tendaguru, which we interpreted in terms of a greater load of external abrasives in Tendaguru, probably stemming from a nearby desert. DMTA can thus be a useful additional proxy to palaeogeography and habitat reconstruction.

For the 322 scans included in our analysis (Results), we imported a total of 25 of the 34 parameters computed by ref. 50, which are frequently applied on dental wear surfaces for diet inference47,48,67,69,70,76. These represent surface height, volume, complexity, density, slope, plateau size and anisotropy (Supplementary Table 6). Larger height and volume parameters (and a greater surface roughness in general) have been found to be indicative of feeding on tougher, more fibrous, or mechanically challenging diets (for example, grasses or hard objects such as seeds and molluscs)43,48,70,77, but are also affected by greater abrasive loads (dust or grit ingestion)68,69. Complexity is a good indicator of hard object feeding43,77, while anisotropy and density reflect incorporation of small particles (either external or internal abrasives)70,71,78, but may also be affected by intense, directional oral food processing.

The scan data underwent a visual two-step quality screening by D.E.W. and A.S. to exclude scans affected by sediment particles, glue residues, fractures and postprocessing artefacts. Scans from moulds were also checked for imperfections such as air bubbles. The evaluation was guided by ref. 79 for identifying postmortem dental wear. Each scan was assigned a quality rating: good (1), fair (2) or bad (3); only scans attributed to quality 1 and 2 were considered here. For exemplary surface scans of each clade, see Extended Data Fig. 1.

For each tooth specimen and surface (occlusal and/or buccal), median values per parameter were calculated from up to four (at least one) non-overlapping scans. If several teeth of one individual had been measured, the mean from all teeth was then calculated for the individual. Where more than four measurements were available from different moulds of a single surface, we excluded the scans from the mould that had less scans qualified as quality 1 by ref. 50. For further details on data acquisition and quality assessment, see ref. 50.

Statistical analyses to test for palaeoecological and/or climatic signals in the DMT were conducted in JMP Pro v.17. We used Dunn's test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple pairwise comparisons. We found pronounced differences between buccal and occlusal surfaces for most clades (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). We therefore analysed buccal and occlusal surfaces both individually and pooled for each clade per fauna (to assess niche partitioning between major taxa). To test for general faunal differences and to assess climate/habitat impact, we solely used the pooled dataset of buccal and occlusal surfaces.

PCA including 20 DMT parameters with a factor loading larger than 0.7 (Asfc, matf, medf, metf, Sa, Sdc, Sdq, Sdr, Sk, Smc, Smr, Sp, Sq, Sv, Sz, Vm, Vmc, Vv, Vvc, Vvv) were computed with varimax factor rotation to facilitate interpretation of principal components (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). One brachiosaurid specimen from Tendaguru (MB.R. 2190) had to be excluded from the PCA, as it was so aberrant that it affected clear separation of groups in the dataset.

CVA of all 25 parameters was used to maximize separation between clades for detection of niche partitioning, with either clade or clade + fauna as an identifier (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 2).

The immunogenicity of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) used for the delivery of nucleoside-modified messenger RNA limits the levels and durability of expression of the encoded protein. Here, by leveraging the Mannich reaction for ionizable lipid synthesis, and via the in vitro and in vivo screening of six combinatorial libraries of synthesized lipids, we report the identification of an antioxidant ionizable lipid, C-a16, exhibiting reduced immunogenicity. When incorporated into LNPs for mRNA delivery, C-a16 mitigated the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, thereby extending the duration of protein expression. In mice, and compared with commercial LNPs, LNPs incorporating C-a16 and co-delivering Cas9 mRNA and guide RNA for the editing of the transthyretin gene led to 2.8-fold higher editing efficiency; LNPs with C-a16 delivering fibroblast growth factor 21 mRNA increased the expression of the protein 3.6-fold; and when delivering mRNA encoding a tumour neoantigen or the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, LNPs with C-a16 induced stronger antigen-specific immune responses. Our findings support the further testing of C-a16 as a promising ionizable lipid for mRNA delivery in therapeutic applications.

Did Neanderthals have family recipes? A new study suggests that two groups of Neanderthals living in the caves of Amud and Kebara in northern Israel butchered their food in strikingly different ways, despite living close by and using similar tools and resources. Scientists think they might have been passing down different food preparation practices. 

“The subtle differences in cut-mark patterns between Amud and Kebara may reflect local traditions of animal carcass processing,” said Anaëlle Jallon, PhD candidate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and lead author of the article in Frontiers in Environmental Archaeology. “Even though Neanderthals at these two sites shared similar living conditions and faced comparable challenges, they seem to have developed distinct butchery strategies, possibly passed down through social learning and cultural traditions. 

“These two sites give us a unique opportunity to explore whether Neanderthal butchery techniques were standardized,” explained Jallon. “If butchery techniques varied between sites or time periods, this would imply that factors such as cultural traditions, cooking preferences, or social organization influenced even subsistence-related activities such as butchering.” 

Written in the bones 

Amud and Kebara are close to each other: only 70 kilometers apart. Neanderthals occupied both caves during the winters between 50 and 60,000 years ago, leaving behind burials, stone tools, hearths, and food remains. Both groups used the same flint tools and relied on the same prey for their diet — mostly gazelles and fallow deer. But there are some subtle differences between the two. The Neanderthals living at Kebara seem to have hunted more large prey than those at Amud, and they also seem to have carried more large kills home to butcher them in the cave rather than at the site of the kill.  

At Amud, 40% of the animal bones are burned and most are fragmented. This could be caused by deliberate actions like cooking or by later accidental damage. At Kebara, 9% of the bones are burned, but less fragmented, and are thought to have been cooked. The bones at Amud also seem to have undergone less carnivore damage than those found at Kebara.  

To investigate the differences between food preparation at Kebara and at Amud, the scientists selected a sample of cut-marked bones from contemporaneous layers at the two sites. They examined these macroscopically and microscopically, recording the cut-marks' different characteristics. Similar patterns of cut-marks might suggest there were no differences in butchery practices, while different patterns might indicate distinct cultural traditions. 

The cut-marks were clear and intact, largely unaffected by later damage caused by carnivores or the drying out of the bones. The profiles, angles, and surface widths of these cuts were similar, likely due to the two groups' similar toolkits. However, the cut-marks found at Amud were more densely packed and less linear in shape than those at Kebara.  

Cooking from scratch 

The researchers considered several possible explanations for this pattern. It could have been driven by the demands of butchering different prey species or different types of bones — most of the bones at Amud, but not Kebara, are long bones — but when they only looked at the long bones of small ungulates found at both Amud and Kebara, the same differences showed up in the data. Experimental archaeology also suggests this pattern couldn't be accounted for by less skilled butchers or by butchering more intensively to get as much food as possible. The different patterns of cut-marks are best explained by deliberate butchery choices made by each group.  

One possible explanation is that the Neanderthals at Amud were treating meat differently before butchering it: possibly drying their meat or letting it decompose, like modern-day butchers hanging meat before cooking. Decaying meat is harder to process, which would account for the greater intensity and less linear form of the cut-marks. A second possibility is that different group organization — for example, the number of butchers who worked on a given kill — in the two communities of Neanderthals played a role. 

However, more research will be needed to investigate these possibilities. 

“There are some limitations to consider,” said Jallon. “The bone fragments are sometimes too small to provide a complete picture of the butchery marks left on the carcass. While we have made efforts to correct for biases caused by fragmentation, this may limit our ability to fully interpret the data. Future studies, including more experimental work and comparative analyses, will be crucial for addressing these uncertainties — and maybe one day reconstructing Neanderthals' recipes.”

Premature menopause has been described as a life-changing diagnosis with profound physical, psychological, and social consequences. Affected women not only experience the effects of estrogen deficiency, but they also experience the unanticipated loss of reproductive function. However, some women are more adversely affected by these changes than others. A new study helps explore reasons for these differences. Results are published on July 16 in Menopause, the journal of The Menopause Society.

Premature menopause, medically known as premature or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a condition in which the ovaries cease to function normally before the age of 40. It has been linked to an elevated lifetime risk for depression and anxiety. A recent meta-analysis revealed an odds ratio of 3.3 for depression and 4.9 for anxiety in women with POI compared with those without the condition. The increased risk is understandable given the combined experience of infertility and the additional burdens resulting from estrogen deficiency, such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, reduced bone mineral density, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, among others. For some women, infertility means altered life goals, loss of sense of control, social stigma, and disrupted social roles.

However, not all women experience depression or the same level of depression when presented with the same diagnosis. In this new study, researchers gathered data from nearly 350 women with POI to try to identify the specific variables that contribute to the likelihood of depressive symptoms. Their first observation was the high prevalence of depression among participants. Nearly one-third (29.9%) of the women with POI suffered from depressive symptoms.

The researchers additionally found that a younger age at POI diagnosis, severe menopause symptoms, fertility-related grief, and lack of emotional support were risk factors. No significant difference was found in depressive symptoms between women using estrogen plus progestogen therapy and those not using hormone therapy, underscoring the role of psychosocial factors. Interestingly, a genetic cause for POI was associated with lower depressive symptoms. Another unexpected result was that, even though a higher burden of menopause symptoms was independently associated with depressive symptoms, hot flashes (specifically night sweats) were not.

This is the first known large-scale study to investigate specific variables that are associated with depressive symptoms in women with POI. The researchers believe its results highlight the importance of comprehensive care addressing both physical and psychological aspects of menopause at an early age.

Survey results are published in the article "Depressive symptoms in women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI): a cross-sectional observational study."

"The high prevalence of depressive symptoms in those with POI highlights the importance of routine screening in this vulnerable population. Although hormone therapy is recognized as the standard of care for those with POI for management of some menopause-related symptoms and preventive care, it is not first-line treatment for mood disorders. This was evident in this study in which there was no difference in depressive symptoms between those using hormones and those not using hormone therapy. Addressing behavioral-health concerns with evidence-based interventions should be part of any comprehensive POI care plan," says Dr. Monica Christmas, associate medical director for The Menopause Society.

And a reminder that in the world of non-QC computing, right from its very roots, the ability of computers improved in mind boggling large steps every year.QC records, other than the odd statistic about how many bits they can make, have largely not made any strides in being able to solve real world sized problems (with exception of those that use QCs purely as an analog computer to model QC behavior)

Also, in the world of QC, right from its very roots, the ability of QC improved in mind boggling large steps every year. It's only that you cannot see it if you only look at the wrong metric, i.e., factorization records.It's a bit like saying "classical computing technology has not improved for 50 years, it's only recently that we finally start to have programs that are able to write other programs".

ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit. 

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it's ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

To see a list of 2024 updates, go here.



OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user's calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.

Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”

CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.

we planned to launch our open-weight model next week.we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are…

OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet's Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.

Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot's approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.

Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don't lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.

OpenAI has started using Google's AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia's GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using non-Nvidia chips in an important way.

Researchers from MIT's Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.

The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb's X post.

Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.

OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.

OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…

OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT's conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.

OpenAI's ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users' own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company's slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.

OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive's devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI's reach to a larger audience in the future.

OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person's life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.

OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.

By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks & instruction following. Because it's faster, it's a great alternative to OpenAI o3 & o4-mini for everyday coding needs.

OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.

After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI's products.

OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI's products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company's expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.

OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.

OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model's personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.

An issue within OpenAI's ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch's testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”

OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.

OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI's cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI's VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won't be a separate system card released for it.”

Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI's transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI's top-reported score.

OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.

OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI's safety report.

OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI's previous models.

Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company's X post.

All of your image creations, all in one place.Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg. pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj

OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.

OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk's X and Mark Zuckerberg's Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.

OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI's API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.

OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It's accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek's upgraded V3.

OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI's API.

OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.

OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT's Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”

OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI's premium service, which offers access to the company's GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.

More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.

The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI's o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.

In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. 

OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.

OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior.

OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. 

The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI's ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. 

OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn't expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. 

OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. The company's CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.

OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.

OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it's not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that's “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. 

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story…

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI's Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT's weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch.

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI's] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. 

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model's “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that's designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post. 

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company's o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI's corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's.

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

Operator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website.

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they'd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Yes.

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

It's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they're inconsistent at best.

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

SpaceX employees are more likely to be injured while working at Starbase than any of its other manufacturing facilities, according to company worker safety records reviewed by TechCrunch.

Starbase, a sprawling launch-and-manufacturing site that recently incorporated as its own Texas city, logged injury rates almost six times higher than the average for comparable space vehicle manufacturing outfits and nearly three times higher than aerospace manufacturing as a whole in 2024, according to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) data released in May. That outsized injury rate has persisted since 2019, when SpaceX began sharing Starbase injury data with the federal regulator. 

Starbase is home to SpaceX's most ambitious program: a fully reusable, ultra-heavy-lift rocket called Starship. The company has been moving at a breakneck pace to bring Starship online to launch Starlink internet satellites and other payloads. 

Since Starship's first orbital test in April 2023, SpaceX has attempted eight additional integrated flights. During three of those tests, the company made history by catching the massive Super Heavy booster with “chopstick” arms attached to the launch tower. 

The data suggests that SpaceX's rapid progress comes at a cost. And while injury rates alone don't provide a complete picture of the safety culture at Starbase, they do offer a rare glimpse into the working conditions of the world's leading space company. 

OSHA uses a standardized safety metric called Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) to measure a company's safety record and compare it to industry peers, like Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance. The publicly available data has limitations. It doesn't distinguish between minor injuries like stitches versus serious incidents such as amputations. 

TechCrunch calculated the TRIR based on that data, which includes the total number of incidents and total number of hours worked by SpaceX employees at each site. 

Starbase, which plays a central role in SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's mission to make life multi-planetary, is an outlier in the company and across the industry as a whole. Its TRIR topped out at 4.27 injuries per 100 workers in 2024, when it employed an average of 2,690 workers, according to the data submitted to OSHA. Injured Starbase employees were unable to perform their normal job duties for a total of 3,558 restricted-duty days, plus 656 lost-time days where injuries made them unable to work at all. 

Starbase is classified by the U.S. government as a space vehicle manufacturing operation. The injury rate in this sector has fallen dramatically since 1994, dropping from 4.2 injuries per 100 workers to 0.7 injuries per 100 workers in 2023, according to historical data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (BLS calculates these rates through its annual company surveys, which asks for the same information found in OSHA's worker injury forms.) But despite major changes in safety processes across the industry, Starbase is closer to the rates of 30 years ago. 

The injury rate across all of SpaceX's manufacturing facilities — which includes an engine development and testing site in McGregor, Texas; a Starlink satellite manufacturing complex in Bastrop, Texas; the Falcon rocket complex in Hawthorne, California; and another satellite manufacturing site in Redmond, Washington — is 2.28. 

These other facilities report lower TRIR rates, though most still exceed the industry averages. For instance, 2024 data shows TRIR rates 2.48 at McGregor, 3.49 at Bastrop, 1.43 at Hawthorne, 2.89 at the Redmond site. The 2024 TRIR for aerospace manufacturing as a whole is 1.6. 

SpaceX also operates several non-manufacturing sites, including barge operations off both coasts, offices in Sunnyvale, California, and launch sites at Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Space Force Base. 

Former OSHA Chief of Staff Debbie Berkowitz told TechCrunch via email that Starbase's TRIR “is a red flag that there are serious safety issues that need to be addressed.” 

However, there is a debate among safety professionals about whether TRIR is the most reliable metric for assessing and predicting injury rates, particularly serious incidents like fatalities, and especially for small companies. A recent paper on TRIR questioned its statistical validity and advocated that organizations use alternative measures of safety performance instead. 

Of the 14 OSHA inspections at SpaceX facilities over the past four years, six involved accidents and injuries at Starbase. That includes a partial finger amputation in 2021 and a crane collapse in June 2025. The latter inspection is still ongoing. Investigations by other news outlets including Reuters have uncovered hundreds of previously unreported worker injuries, including crushed limbs and one fatality. 

The 2024 injury rate at Starbase marks an improvement to that of the prior year, which topped out at 5.9 injuries per 100 workers in 2023 and 4.8 injuries in 2022. But it still leads among SpaceX's land-based facilities, and is second overall only to its west coast booster recovery operations, which has a TRIR of 7.6. 

OSHA confirmed TechCrunch's calculation of Starbase's TRIR over email, but otherwise did not respond to questions regarding that location's injury rate. SpaceX did not respond to request for comment.   

NASA has a major stake in Starship's development. The agency is counting on using the rocket to return humans to the Moon before the end of this decade, and it is paying more than $4 billion to SpaceX for two crewed Starship flights to the lunar surface. 

Both the contract for the Starship lander and SpaceX's contract for its Commercial Crew services to the International Space Station contain particular clauses that allow the agency to take action in the case of a major breach of safety, such as a fatality or a “willful” or “repeat” OSHA violation. 

While a persistently high TRIR rate can be evidence of a safety problem, it is not an automatic trigger for action, and does not fall under the definition of a “major breach of safety” in their contracts. 

“NASA interacts frequently with its partners, including SpaceX, to ensure safety from a mission assurance perspective, and remains in regular contact with the company during normal contract administration,” a NASA spokesperson told TechCrunch in response to questions about the company's TRIR. “Safety is paramount to NASA's mission success. The agency continues to work with all our commercial partners to build and maintain a healthy safety culture.” 

Among rocket makers with vehicles in operation, Starbase still leads the pack: at ULA's manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama, the TRIR is 1.12 injuries per 100 workers; at Blue Origin's rocket park on the coast of Florida, the rate is 1.09.

Privacy-focused browser DuckDuckGo is rolling out a new setting that lets users filter out AI images in search results. The company says it's launching the feature in response to feedback from users who said AI images can get in the way of finding what they're looking for. 

Users can access the new setting by conducting a search on DuckDuckGo and heading to the Images tab. From there, they will see a new dropdown menu titled “AI images.” Users can then choose whether or not they want to see AI content by selecting “show” or “hide.”

Users can also turn on the filter in their search settings by tapping the “Hide AI-Generated Images” option.

DuckDuckGo's new feature comes as the internet is being flooded with AI “slop,” which refers to low-quality media content made using generative AI technology. 

“The filter relies on manually curated open-source blocklists, including the ‘nuclear' list, provided by uBlockOrigin and uBlacklist Huge AI Blocklist,” DuckDuckGo said in a post on X. “While it won't catch 100% of AI-generated results, it will greatly reduce the number of AI-generated images you see.”

DuckDuckGo says it plans on adding additional filters in the future, but didn't provide specifics. 

It's worth noting that DuckDuckGo's example for the new feature depicts an image search for a baby peacock, likely in reference to Google facing controversy last year for showing more AI-generated images of baby peacocks rather than real-life images when conducting an image search for the bird.

I want a future where we don't need a desktop PC to get the best gaming graphics. Maybe I'm a dreamer who needs to keep on dreaming, but I think that that pie-in-the-sky wonderland is closer to reality than you may think, and all PC component makers need to do is hop on the eGPU train. Better yet, they need to make something that's as easily dockable as a Switch 2, but with the added power of a discrete graphics card that could push a laptop or gaming handheld into a full desktop experience.

The recently revealed Razer Core X V2 has been weighing on my mind as much as it seems it would weigh down my desk. At its core, it's an eGPU, or external graphics processing unit. The GPU normally handles the most intensive rendering tasks necessary for high-end creative apps or gaming. Razer's latest version is a $350 shoebox filled with surplus PC parts that could bump up the gaming potential of your average lightweight laptop. It makes use of Thunderbolt 5 connectivity to allow for faster data transfer speeds, though it will only grant those 80 Gbps bidirectional speeds with a compatible device that also has a Thunderbolt 5 port. It's compatible with USB-C-based Thunderbolt 4 laptops and USB 4 handhelds, but those devices also need to support external graphics to get the juice from the discrete GPU.

We've seen similar designs from companies like Gigabyte with its recently announced Aorus RTX 5090 AI Box. It's the opposite of what I want to see from an eGPU. Even after you spend the Benjamins on Razer's case, you have to source your own graphics card and power supply with enough wattage to power it. This means you're already halfway there to a mini ATX desktop.

It could be so much more. Why does it have to be in a box, anyway? Couldn't an eGPU enclosure be a complete docking station for your laptop or handheld? Imagine how nice it would be, after schlepping around town all day, to take your lightweight laptop, slot it into your desktop battle station, and then be set up for a console-like gaming experience.

To keep it low-profile, you would need to engineer some novel ways to power the device and still manage excess heat. Smaller companies like Ayaneo sell the $600 Graphics Starship with an AMD Radeon 7600M XT housed inside. That eGPU has reverse power support for up to four monitors. It's still pretty chunky, which is why the better options for some kind of dockable device lie in laptop GPUs. We could have slimmer boxes with a device-specific slot for a laptop or handheld. It could have enough ports to support multiple monitors and include USB and Ethernet. What I'm saying is: what if Razer combined its Dock Chroma with a laptop-level eGPU?

Asus kicked off 2025 with the promise of the XG Mobile eGPU with Thunderbolt 5 support and up to Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090-level graphics. Gizmodo first saw it in January this year, but it has yet to see the light of day. Asus promised it would be compatible with a $900 Asus ROG Ally X, but we don't yet know how well this could improve the graphics capabilities of the company's most expensive handheld. The upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X with the all-new Xbox-ified version of Windows has the same USB 4 connection, so it will similarly support the XG Mobile should it arrive sometime later this year. As for pricing, all we have right now are rumors, but I don't expect either the Xbox Ally or XG Mobile to be cheap.

Desktops will still have the edge in graphics capability above any mobile dock, especially if they house a solid gaming CPU like AMD's leading Ryzen 7 9800X3D. The data speeds will continue to be a hindrance. USB 4's bandwidth maxes out at 40 Gbps, which may not be enough for the highest-end GPUs. Plus, so few handhelds have USB 4 compatibility. You can't hook up a Steam Deck unless you do surgery on your device to enable Oculink—a separate type of fast data connection. We need to wait for the next era of handheld APUs—AKA accelerated processing units—to see if their performance matches up with an external graphics card and makes the setup worth the cost. I'll just keep dreaming until some saint-like Santa figure finally hears my pleas.

In the summer of 2005, Tan Dailin was a 20-year-old grad student at Sichuan University of Science and Engineering when he came to the attention of the People's Liberation Army of China.

Tan was part of a burgeoning hacker community known as the Honkers—teens and twentysomethings in late-'90s and early-'00s China who formed groups like the Green Army and Evil Octal and launched patriotic cyberattacks against Western targets they deemed disrespectful to China. The attacks were low-sophistication—mostly website defacements and denial-of-service operations targeting entities in the US, Taiwan, and Japan—but the Honkers advanced their skills over time, and Tan documented his escapades in blog posts. After publishing about hacking targets in Japan, the PLA came calling.

Tan and his university friends were encouraged to participate in a PLA-affiliated hacking contest and won first place. The PLA invited them to an intense, monthlong hacker training camp, and within weeks Tan and his friends were building hacking tools, studying network infiltration techniques, and conducting simulated attacks.

The subsequent timeline of events is unclear, but Tan, who went by the hacker handles Wicked Rose and Withered Rose, then launched his own hacking group—the Network Crack Program Hacker (NCPH). The group quickly gained notoriety for winning hacking contests and developing hacking tools. They created the GinWui rootkit, one of China's first homegrown remote-access backdoors and then, experts believe, used it and dozens of zero-day exploits they wrote in a series of “unprecedented” hacks against US companies and government entities over the spring and summer of 2006. They did this on behalf of the PLA, according to Adam Kozy, who tracked Tan and other Chinese hackers for years as a former FBI analyst who now heads the SinaCyber consulting firm, focused on China.

Tan revealed online at the time that he and his team were being paid about $250 a month for their hacking, though he didn't say who paid or what they hacked. The pay increased to $1,000 a month after their summer hacking spree, according to a 2007 report by former threat intelligence firm VeriSign iDefense.

At some point, Tan switched teams and began contracting for the Ministry of State Security (MSS), China's civilian intelligence agency, as part of its notorious hacking group known as APT 41. And in 2020, when Tan was 36, the US Justice Department announced indictments against him and other alleged APT 41 members for hacking more than 100 targets, including US government systems, health care organizations, and telecoms.

Tan's path to APT 41 isn't unique. He's just one of many former Honkers who began their careers as self-directed patriotic hackers before being absorbed by the state into its massive spying apparatus.

Not a lot has been written about the Honkers and their critical role in China's APT operations, outside of congressional testimony Kozy gave in 2022. But a new report, published this month by Eugenio Benincasa, senior cyberdefense researcher at the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zürich university in Switzerland, expands on Kozy's work to track the Honkers' early days and how this group of skilled youths became some of China's most prolific cyberspies.

“This is not just about [Honkers] creating a hacker culture that was implicitly aligned with national security goals,” Benincasa says, “but also the personal relations they created [that] we still see reflected in the APTs today.”

The Honker community largely began when China joined the internet in 1994, and a network connecting universities and research centers across the country for knowledge-sharing put Chinese students online before the rest of the country. Like US hackers, the Honkers were self-taught tech enthusiasts who flocked to electronic bulletin boards (dial-up forums) to share programming and computer hacking tips. They soon formed groups like Xfocus, China Eagle Union, and The Honker Union of China and came to be known as Red Hackers or Honkers, a name derived from the Mandarin word “hong,” for red, and “heike,” for dark visitor—the Chinese term for hacker.

The groups were self-governing with loosely formed hierarchies and even had codes of ethics shaped by influential members like Taiwanese hacker Lin Zhenglong (known by his handle “coolfire”). Lin believed hacking skills should be cultivated only to strengthen cyberdefenses—to learn the ways of hackers in order to thwart them—and wrote an influential hacking manual “to raise awareness about the importance of computer security, not to teach people how to crack passwords.”

There were no simulated environments for hackers to build their skills at the time, so Honkers often resorted to hacking real networks. Lin didn't oppose this—hacking wasn't illegal in China except against government, defense, or scientific research networks—but he published a set of ethical guidelines advising hackers to avoid government systems or causing permanent damage and to restore systems to their original condition after Honkers finished hacking them.

But these guidelines soon fell away, following a series of incidents involving foreign affronts to China. In 1998, a wave of violence in Indonesia broke out against ethnic Chinese there, and outraged Honker groups responded with coordinated website defacements and denial-of-service attacks against Indonesian government targets. The next year, after Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui announced his Two-States Theory challenging the Communist Party's One China doctrine, the Honkers defaced Taiwanese government sites with patriotic messages asserting the existence of a unified China.

In 2000, after participants at a conference in Japan denied facts around the Nanjing Massacre, in which an estimated 300,000 Chinese were killed during Japan's 1930's occupation of the city, Honkers circulated a list of more than 300 Japanese government and corporate sites, along with email addresses of Japanese officials, and prompted members to target them.

The so-called patriotic cyberwars gave the Honkers a common cause that forged an identity unique from Western hacking groups, which the Honkers had emulated until then. Where Western hackers were primarily motivated by curiosity, intellectual challenge, and bragging rights, the Honkers bonded over their common cause to help China “rise up.” In the words of a China Eagle Union pledge, the Honkers vowed “to put the interests of the Chinese nation above everything else.”

The patriotic wars put China's Honkers on the map and inspired more to join them. Honker Union swelled to an estimated 80,000 members, Green Army to 3,000. Most were just enthusiasts and adventure seekers, but a subset stood out for leadership and hacking skills. A particularly influential group among these, whom Benincasa calls the Red 40, would go on to found or join many of China's top cybersecurity and tech firms and become integral to the state's cyberspy machine.

There's no evidence that the government directed the patriotic hacking operations, says Benincasa, but their activity aligned with state interests, and they drew government attention. A retired People's Liberation Army rear admiral and former professor at the PLA National Defense University praised their patriotism. The public also appeared to support it. A report claimed that 84 percent of internet users in China favored the patriotic hacking.

But in April 2001, this began to change after a Chinese fighter jet clipped a US reconnaissance plane midair off the coast of Hainan and sparked an international incident. The collision killed the Chinese pilot and forced the US plane to land on Hainan, where the Chinese military seized the aircraft and held the crew for more than a week. The incident stoked nationalist sentiments among US and Chinese hackers alike, and both sides lobbed cyberattacks against the other country's systems.

The Chinese government grew concerned over its lack of control of the Honkers and feared they could become a liability and escalate tensions. The Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper likened the hacking to "web terrorism,” and the head of the Internet Society of China issued a statement through China's official state media condemning it as well. The retired PLA rear admiral who previously praised the groups now warned they were a threat to international relations.

The Honkers got the message, but with their patriotic mission shelved, the groups now became less cohesive. There were leadership clashes and disagreements over direction and priorities—some wanted to turn professional and launch cybersecurity companies to defend China's systems against attack; others wanted to go rogue and sell malicious tools. The former left to join tech firms like Baidu, Alibaba, and Huawei or cybersecurity firms like Venustech and Topsec. Some became entrepreneurs and launched their own security firms, like NSFocus and Knownsec, which became leaders in vulnerability research and threat intelligence. Some, however, shifted to cybercrime. And others, like Tan, became contract hackers for the PLA and MSS or founded firms that served these operations.

According to Benincasa, the PLA and MSS began hiring Honkers around 2003, but the recruitment became more structured and earnest following the 2006 hackings attributed to NCPH and Tan. The recruitment expanded during and after the 2008 Beijing Olympics and was likely helped in 2009 with the passage of China's Criminal Law Amendment VII, which criminalized unauthorized intrusions into any network as well as the distribution of hacking tools.

Hacker forums began to shutter, and some Honkers got arrested. Word spread that Tan was among them. According to Kozy, Tan faced seven and a half years in prison, though it's unclear whether he served any time. Kozy believes he cut a deal and began work for the MSS. In 2011, it appears he launched an antivirus firm named Anvisoft, which may have served as a front for his MSS work.

Former Honkers Zeng Xiaoyong (envymask) and Zhou Shuai (coldface) also became contractors for the PLA and MSS and worked on operations conducted by APT 41, APT 17, and APT 27, according to Benincasa. Some worked through shell companies, others worked through legitimate firms who acted as intermediaries to the intelligence services.

Topsec and Venustech were two firms alleged to have assisted these efforts. Topsec employed a number of former Honkers, including the founder of the Honker Union of China, and Topsec's founder once acknowledged in an interview that the PLA directed his company. In 2015, Topsec was linked to state-sponsored cyber operations, including the Anthem Insurance breach in the US.

Over the years, many tools used by China APT groups were built by Honkers, and the PLA and MSS mined them for vulnerability research and exploit development. In 1999, Huang Xin (glacier), a member of Green Army, released “Glacier,” a remote-access trojan. The next year, he and Yang Yong (coolc) from XFocus released X-Scan, a tool to scan networks for vulnerabilities that is still used by hackers in China today. In 2003, two members of Honker Union released HTRAN, a tool to hide an attacker's location by rerouting their traffic through proxy computers, which has been used by China's APTs. Tan and fellow NCPH member Zhou Jibing (whg) are believed to have created the PlugX backdoor in 2008, which has been used by more than 10 Chinese APTs. According to Benincasa, Zhou developed it even further to produce ShadowPad, which has been used by APT 41 and others.

Over the years, leaks and US indictments against former Honkers have exposed their alleged post-Honker spy careers, as well as China's use of for-profit firms for state hacking operations. The latter include i-Soon and Integrity Tech, both launched by former Honkers.

Wu Haibo (shutdown), formerly of Green Army and 0x557, launched i-Soon in 2010. And last year, someone leaked internal i-Soon files and chat logs, exposing the company's espionage work on behalf of the MSS and MPS. In March this year, eight i-Soon employees and two MPS officers were indicted by the US for hacking operations that targeted US government agencies, Asian foreign ministries, dissidents, and media outlets.

Integrity Tech, founded in 2010 by former Green Army member Cai Jingjing (cbird), was sanctioned by the US this year over ties to global infrastructure hacks.

This year, the US also indicted former Green Army members Zhou and Wu for conducting state hacking operations and sanctioned Zhou over links to APT 27. In addition to engaging in state-sponsored hacking, he allegedly also ran a data-leak service selling some of the stolen data to customers, including intelligence agencies.

This isn't unlike early-generation US hackers who also transitioned to become cybersecurity company founders and also got recruited by the National Security Agency and Central Intelligence Agency or hired by contractors to perform hacking operations for US operations. But unlike the US, China's whole-of-society intelligence authorities have compelled some Chinese citizens and companies to collaborate with the state in conducting espionage, Kozy notes.

“I think that China from the beginning just thought, ‘We can co-opt [the Honkers] for state interests.'” Kozy says. “And … because a lot of these young guys had patriotic leanings to begin with, they were kind of pressed into service by saying, ‘Hey you're going to be doing a lot of really good things for the country.' Also, many of them started to realize they could get rich doing it.”

Young people appear to be increasingly vulnerable to gastrointestinal cancers, but researchers aren't entirely sure what is driving the surge in disease.

In a new study out this week, scientists led by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute found that rates of early-onset GI cancers—those occurring in people younger than 50—are rising more rapidly than other types of cancer. In particular, colorectal cancer cases have significantly increased, while rates of other forms of the disease, like stomach cancer, are creeping up, too. While the paper doesn't come to definitive conclusions as to why these conditions are becoming more common, the researchers point to risk factors like obesity, a poor diet, and sedentary behavior.

“Colorectal cancer is the most common early-onset GI cancer worldwide, accounting for more than half of the cases, but it is not the only GI cancer that is rising in younger adults,” said senior study author Kimmie Ng, director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber, in a statement.

“Unfortunately, pancreatic, gastric, and esophageal cancers are also increasing in young people,” she added.

45 Is the New 50 When It Comes to Colorectal Cancer Screening

Ng and her colleagues reviewed data collected from 100 studies, as well as past scientific reviews, and cancer-related guidelines. They also analyzed three publicly available cancer statistic databases.

Since 2010, the incidence of early-onset GI cancers has been increasing globally, they found, but especially in high-income countries like the U.S. Between 2010 and 2019, the age-adjusted incidence rate in the U.S. increased by 2.16% annually—the greatest increase of any early-onset cancer during that time. In 2022, there were at least 25,000 Americans under 50 who developed GI cancer. The team's findings were published Thursday in JAMA.

An earlier, separate review of data—by some of the same authors—over a similar time period concluded that the rate of GI cancer has tripled in young people aged between 15 and 19, and almost doubled in those aged between 20 and 24.

“The rising incidence of early-onset GI cancers is alarming and underscores the need for enhanced prevention strategies and early detection methods,” said Ng.

As the rates of these cancers have risen, so have some of their risk factors, including rates of obesity and time spent sitting; ultraprocessed foods are also more common now, especially in Western diets. Still, the researchers estimate that as much as 30% of early-onset GI cancer may be linked to genetic mutations. Other scientists have argued that other issues, like common stomach infections, could also be driving the increase in cancer rates.

Scientists May Have Figured Out Why Young People Are Getting Colorectal Cancer More Often

Even as the causes remain unclear, what is clear is that more work needs to be done to help catch these cancers early enough, before they become impossible to treat, the researchers said. In 2020, public health experts recommended routine screening for colorectal cancer in people 45 and up, but the researchers noted that a year later, fewer than 20% of people ages 45 to 49 went for a screening. Another outstanding question is whether early-onset GI cancers are different from those caught later in life, and if so, should they be treated differently.

“We need to be thinking not only about the risk factors for these diseases but also how to screen, diagnose, and treat young people with these cancers,” said Ng.

Just a few days ago, Intel's upcoming Arrow Lake-S desktop refresh was leaked again, and this time, we learned that it's allegedly coming in the second half of 2025. Paired with a new NPU and higher clock speeds, the refresh would still be binned on Intel's 20A node and bring modest improvements to the lineup. However, a new tweet from leaker Jaykihn now suggests that there won't be any upgrades to AI capability in Arrow Lake 2.0, as it's said to retain the same NPU present in the current processors.

Intel introduced the upgraded NPU 4 in last year's Lunar Lake. It leapfrogged the company's existing mobile chips to become Microsoft Copilot+ certified, as the NPU has up to 48 TOPS of AI performance. Arrow Lake, Intel's desktop lineup, has the older NPU 3, which debuted back in 2023 with Meteor Lake. As such, it falls short of the 40 TOPS minimum requirement for Copilot+ because NPU 3 is only capable of 11.5 TOPS. If the tipster is to be believed, even two years later, Intel's desktop CPUs will still be equipped with an outdated AI module that cannot compete with mobile-first offerings from AMD or Apple.

ARL-S and HX Refresh will not receive NPU changes.This is contradictory to the preliminary information published a year ago.July 18, 2025

If there is no new NPU with the Arrow Lake refresh, then a slight bump to clock speeds is the only 'upgrade' the Blue Team will bring to the table, and that's just not enough. Let's be clear, AMD has somewhat gone down the same road with its gen-over-gen refresh upgrades, relying more on X3D improvements down the line, rather than major architectural breakthroughs, though that's reportedly about to change. Unfortunately, Intel's sales have been in a constant decline over the past few years, so they need a more substantial overhaul than AMD.

Last week, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said that Intel is "not in the top 10 semiconductor companies" in the world anymore — not something you'd want hear from your leader, even if it's an exaggeration. The company has Panther Lake and Nova Lake lined up as its next launches for laptops and desktops, respectively. Panther Lake will finally bring Intel's long-awaited 18A process to the market, the Blue Team's Hail Mary that should propel them a few ranks in bleeding-edge chip manufacturing. Therefore, even if Arrow Lake's refresh—regardless of it having the new NPU or not—looks underwhelming, Intel is still alive and doing exciting things we can all look forward to. After all, more competition is better, for us.

Tucked away in the Swedish countryside is a facility quietly reshaping the future of global mobility. Owned by the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE), AstaZero has just unveiled the world's most advanced connected vehicle proving ground—an ambitious leap into a 6G-powered future where every movement on the road could be coordinated, controlled, and optimized in real time.

AstaZero is not an average vehicle test track. It is a full-scale, independent research environment built to test the automated transport systems of tomorrow to ensure confidence and safety. Think of it as a real-world lab where self-driving cars, AI-powered drones, and connected emergency vehicles are pushed to their limits.

At the heart of this latest breakthrough are multiple 5G networks and a cutting-edge computing facility—marking a first for any open, brand-neutral proving ground. It enables split-second decision-making and ultra-reliable connectivity between vehicles, emergency teams, pedestrians, infrastructure, and traffic systems.

That matters more than ever. With 3G networks being phased out globally, mission-critical systems like ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles are under pressure to modernize. AstaZero's newly launched facility provides the first real opportunity to test innovative systems in controlled yet dynamic, real-life scenarios.

AstaZero's new infrastructure is not just about faster speeds—it is about smarter, safer reactions. Powered by edge computing, vehicles can now process data locally instead of relying on far-off cloud centers. That means a self-driving car can respond instantly to a pedestrian stepping into the street or adjust to a new traffic signal before the driver sees it.

Without advanced, integrated testing, safer roads remain a dream. CEO of RISE AstaZero Peter Janevik explained the implications of this breakthrough, telling Gizmodo, “In the future, communication might not always originate from the sensors on the vehicle itself, but instead from sensors mounted on connected infrastructure or from the sensors of another vehicle. In these types of systems, three key factors are crucial: reliability, ultra-fast communication, and intelligent decision-making.”

In June, AstaZero said it had reached 99.999% system reliability in connected vehicle communication, a first for the industry. That is the level of consistency required for “mission-critical” scenarios, where even a split-second failure could cost lives.

When asked what type of real-world scenarios are most challenging to simulate at AstaZero and how they overcome them, Janevik described the complexity of multiple testing domains with a future scenario:

An automated drone providing safety surveillance is deployed over an accident scene by a rescue crew upon arrival. The footage is used by both the rescue crew to assess and follow the situation, but also by central management, which needs to make decisions on things such as rerouting of traffic and the deployment of further teams and other authorities like police and medical teams. Then imagine that the drone also creates a local map update with static objects such as a crashed vehicle or cones for traffic redirection and dynamic ones such as personnel or fires. Imagine that this map is also used for warnings and rerouting of automated as well as manually driven vehicles.

Heads-up displays may be the latest step in this direction, with emergency information scrolling along the lower edge of the windshield and not on overhead traffic signs or infotainment screens. To ensure such a complex system works, the testing and design teams need to factor in elements like connectivity disruption and technology integration across numerous manufacturers and telecom companies, which is what AstaZero offers.

Beyond roads and intersections, AstaZero's proving ground is designed to test limitless scenarios. Whether cyclists swerving through traffic or simulated pedestrians crossing at unpredictable times, the site can orchestrate complex environments. Janevik says, “We test collision avoidance technology to auto-brake vehicles for different scenarios, but more importantly, the site provides robust testing to ensure highly repeatable results in a wider spectrum of conditions.”

By using AI, drones, and robotic systems—like digital twins and virtual modeling—for advanced scenario computations and simulations, the site assists engineers in pursuing advances in chip manufacturing, so designs keep track with forthcoming technologies. Janevik believes in the impact of this approach on “unique testing scenarios for smaller machine learning models with AI-based decision-making to prove that these can make the right decisions with ongoing updates.”

The RISE facility's goal is to test components in a hardware loop in the vehicle in real-world scenarios. Testing also accounts for degraded conditions—such as lost connectivity—to prepare for actual challenges. The only limits are what the engineers can imagine, and Janevik sees this as their goal—to live their vision and help societies accelerate into safe, sustainable, and automated transportation systems of the future.

This is especially critical in Europe, where road fatality statistics have stagnated. While there was a 10% drop in EU road deaths between 2019 and 2023, the latest figures show only a 1% decrease. With 83% of fatal pedestrian accidents occurring in urban areas and a stubborn plateau in progress, new solutions are needed. As EU Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas has said, “Too many lives are still lost on our roads every year.”

AstaZero stands out for being brand-agnostic. Any vehicle manufacturer, telecom provider, or AI developer can pay to use the facility to test and refine their systems. That neutral status is intended to ensure consistency and fairness across global standards, which is especially important as the European New Car Assessment Programme rolls out new vehicle-to-everything benchmarks between 2026 and 2032. Already a recognized test organization by the Global Certification Forum, AstaZero has taken a lead role in helping shape those standards.

The AstaZero proving ground does not just test how cars perform—it tests how they think, communicate, and collaborate. With edge computing enabling decentralized, real-time responses, the next generation of smart vehicles will be able to prevent accidents before they happen, minimize traffic delays, and drastically improve energy efficiency.

Upon receiving the Lettuce Grow Indoor Farmstand in the mail, I did not expect that I'd be enjoying some tea before I'd even unwrapped all the parts.

“Is that … Zooey Deschanel? With a Dollar Tree Property Brother?” my husband asked, peering over my shoulder as I unpacked various tubes and parts. And indeed, among the boxes was a glossy handout of a slightly younger-looking Zooey, standing with a man who did vaguely resemble her current husband, Jonathan Scott, of Property Brothers fame. Turns out it was her ex-husband, film producer Jacob Pechenik, with whom she had created this indoor hydroponic gardening system in 2019.

Even though they split shortly thereafter, they continued to run Lettuce Grow together after their 2020 divorce, and an Instagram photo from July 1 even shows Deschanel flanked by Pechenik on one side and Scott on the other, debuting a Lettuce Grow collab with Costco. Apparently Pechenik runs day-to-day operations and Deschanel continues to promote the company through social media, according to a 2023 People interview with the former couple. If Scott has thoughts on this whole setup, he hasn't shared them publicly. (Deschanel and Pechenik have two children together.)

Anyway, perhaps as befitting a celebrity endorsement, the Lettuce Grow is quite dramatic-looking for an indoor hydroponic garden, evoking a giant, space-age version of the terra cotta strawberry planter you probably remember from your grandma's house. Even better, it delivers on its promises of growing many plants and vegetables indoors—even peppers and tomatoes—within a small footprint. There are, of course, a few caveats.

As far as indoor hydroponic garden assemblies go, Lettuce Grow's was easy enough for pretty much anyone to figure out—second-easiest of the four systems I'm currently testing, behind only the Gardyn (9/10, WIRED Recommends). There are seven versions of the Farmstand: outdoor or indoor, each in small (18 plant slots), medium (24 plant slots), or large (36 plant slots); and the smaller indoor Nook, with 20 plant slots. I tested the medium, 24-slot indoor version for six weeks in a low-light corner near my downstairs bathroom.

When you buy a Farmstand, you also get credits for ordering live, pre-grown seedlings that you can buy later, at a time of your choosing. I recommend ordering after you've received and assembled your Farmstand. The selection (you get to choose) spans about 100 flowers, herbs, greens, and vegetables like cucumbers, tomatoes, broccoli, and bell peppers, though once you've ordered you might want to make sure you have some insecticide on hand.

Like most indoor gardening systems, the indoor Farmstand's LED lights and pump run on a timer. My Farmstand included two old-school analog timers, the kind with the infuriating little prongs that must be toggled. Lettuce Grow offers a smart timer upgrade for $24, which I also tested. The company also has an app, which kept disconnecting from the device and which I ended up abandoning halfway through. Of these, I preferred the smart timer, and I was able to set the lights to turn off at night. (They must run for 14 hours, but you can set which hours.) I set the pump to run every hour on the hour. (Note that the water sprayed by the pump does make a startlingly loud splashing sound due to the Farmstand's cavernous interior, so you may not want it in a home office or bedroom or anywhere the noise could become a disturbance.)

The seedlings sit in little cups that slot into the Farmstand's holes, and the pump sprays water and fertilizer from inside the cavity onto the seedlings' peat pods and, later, the roots. Generous 1-pound bags of calcium nitrate and Jack's water-soluble fertilizer are included with Farmstands, as well as a pH testing kit (which must be administered weekly), an extra-long pipette, scoops, and pH adjuster liquid.

Filling the Farmstand's 20-gallon base was a bit cumbersome, as the QR-code-accessible video instructions (there were no paper instructions) said to use a garden hose—no easy feat when you're indoors. I ended up having to make many trips from the kitchen sink to the 6 x 6-inch round opening on the back of the Farmstand with a gallon water jug, which was both time-consuming and awkward. Once-a-week maintenance consisted of a couple gallons' worth of water to top off, fertilizer additions, and pH testing and/or balancing. Oh, and make sure you've sited your Farmstand exactly where you want it, because once it's filled with water, it's nearly impossible to move.

Given that the plants were already well on their way to being full-grown by the time I received them, nearly all of my selections, with the exception of a viola mix, did well in the Farmstand with bountiful harvests—even the peppers and tomatoes. However, there was one significant problem with receiving pregrown plants: pests. Within a couple of weeks of receiving my seedlings, I noticed small white flecks on both my bok choy and cutting-celery plants. Days later, the flecks had erupted into a full-fledged whitefly infestation that spanned multiple plants. Shortly after that, I noticed aphids. Lots and lots of aphids.

Spraying with insecticidal soap was a daily chore but had little effect. I had two other bug-free hydroponic gardens set up in the same vicinity as the Farmstand, whose plants had been grown from seed. There seemed to be no explanation for the Farmstand's outbreak other than that the seedlings had arrived already infested with eggs.

Sure enough, a search of Lettuce Grow's Farmstand Community Facebook group revealed pest infestations on incoming seedlings to be a pervasive and long-standing problem. Had I known this, I would have treated the seedlings with insecticide as soon as I got them; for subsequent grows, I plan to try growing my own plants from seed, in either rockwool cubes or Rapid Rooter plugs.

Pests aside, I found the Farmstand to be easy to use and maintain, and I liked that it seemed easy to jury-rig to use your own plants, if you wanted to grow varieties not offered by Lettuce Grow. The four light rings seemed to use a negligible amount of power and gave off no heat, and the futuristic look garners plenty of attention—much like Zooey herself.

Personally identifiable information has been found in DataComp CommonPool, one of the largest open-source data sets used to train image generation models.

Millions of images of passports, credit cards, birth certificates, and other documents containing personally identifiable information are likely included in one of the biggest open-source AI training sets, new research has found.

Thousands of images—including identifiable faces—were found in a small subset of DataComp CommonPool, a major AI training set for image generation scraped from the web. Because the researchers audited just 0.1% of CommonPool's data, they estimate that the real number of images containing personally identifiable information, including faces and identity documents, is in the hundreds of millions. The study that details the breach was published on arXiv earlier this month.

The bottom line, says William Agnew, a postdoctoral fellow in AI ethics at Carnegie Mellon University and one of the coauthors, is that “anything you put online can [be] and probably has been scraped.”

The researchers found thousands of instances of validated identity documents—including images of credit cards, driver's licenses, passports, and birth certificates—as well as over 800 validated job application documents (including résumés and cover letters), which were confirmed through LinkedIn and other web searches as being associated with real people. (In many more cases, the researchers did not have time to validate the documents or were unable to because of issues like image clarity.) 

A number of the résumés disclosed sensitive information including disability status, the results of background checks, birth dates and birthplaces of dependents, and race. When résumés were linked to people with online presences, researchers also found contact information, government identifiers, sociodemographic information, face photographs, home addresses, and the contact information of other people (like references).

When it was released in 2023, DataComp CommonPool, with its 12.8 billion data samples, was the largest existing data set of publicly available image-text pairs, which are often used to train generative text-to-image models. While its curators said that CommonPool was intended for academic research, its license does not prohibit commercial use as well. 

CommonPool was created as a follow-up to the LAION-5B data set, which was used to train models including Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. It draws on the same data source: web scraping done by the nonprofit Common Crawl between 2014 and 2022. 

While commercial models often do not disclose what data sets they are trained on, the shared data sources of DataComp CommonPool and LAION-5B mean that the data sets are similar, and that the same personally identifiable information likely appears in LAION-5B, as well as in other downstream models trained on CommonPool data. CommonPool researchers did not respond to emailed questions.

And since DataComp CommonPool has been downloaded more than 2 million times over the past two years, it is likely that “there [are]many downstream models that are all trained on this exact data set,” says Rachel Hong, a PhD student in computer science at the University of Washington and the paper's lead author. Those would duplicate similar privacy risks.

“You can assume that any large-scale web-scraped data always contains content that shouldn't be there,” says Abeba Birhane, a cognitive scientist and tech ethicist who leads Trinity College Dublin's AI Accountability Lab—whether it's personally identifiable information (PII), child sexual abuse imagery, or hate speech (which Birhane's own research into LAION-5B has found). 

Indeed, the curators of DataComp CommonPool were themselves aware it was likely that PII would appear in the data set and did take some measures to preserve privacy, including automatically detecting and blurring faces. But in their limited data set, Hong's team found and validated over 800 faces that the algorithm had missed, and they estimated that overall, the algorithm had missed 102 million faces in the entire data set. On the other hand, they did not apply filters that could have recognized known PII character strings, like emails or Social Security numbers. 

“Filtering is extremely hard to do well,” says Agnew. “They would have had to make very significant advancements in PII detection and removal that they haven't made public to be able to effectively filter this.”  

There are other privacy issues that the face blurring doesn't address. While the blurring filter is automatically applied, it is optional and can be removed. Additionally, the captions that often accompany the photos, as well as the photos' metadata, often contain even more personal information, such as names and exact locations.

Another privacy mitigation measure comes from Hugging Face, a platform that distributes training data sets and hosts CommonPool, which integrates with a tool that theoretically allows people to search for and remove their own information from a data set. But as the researchers note in their paper, this would require people to know that their data is there to start with. When asked for comment, Florent Daudens of Hugging Face said that “maximizing the privacy of data subjects across the AI ecosystem takes a multilayered approach, which includes but is not limited to the widget mentioned,” and that the platform is “working with our community of users to move the needle in a more privacy-grounded direction.” 

In any case, just getting your data removed from one data set probably isn't enough. “Even if someone finds out their data was used in a training data sets and … exercises their right to deletion, technically the law is unclear about what that means,”  says Tiffany Li, an associate professor of law at the University of San Francisco School of Law. “If the organization only deletes data from the training data sets—but does not delete or retrain the already trained model—then the harm will nonetheless be done.”

The bottom line, says Agnew, is that “if you web-scrape, you're going to have private data in there. Even if you filter, you're still going to have private data in there, just because of the scale of this. And that's something that we [machine-learning researchers], as a field, really need to grapple with.”

CommonPool was built on web data scraped between 2014 and 2022, meaning that many of the images likely date to before 2020, when ChatGPT was released. So even if it's theoretically possible that some people consented to having their information publicly available to anyone on the web, they could not have consented to having their data used to train large AI models that did not yet exist.

Fight back against tech companies that use your work to train their AI systems without your consent. 

And with web scrapers often scraping data from each other, an image that was originally uploaded by the owner to one specific location would often find its way into other image repositories. “I might upload something onto the internet, and then … a year or so later, [I] want to take it down, but then that [removal] doesn't necessarily do anything anymore,” says Agnew.

The researchers also found numerous examples of children's personal information, including depictions of birth certificates, passports, and health status, but in contexts suggesting that they had been shared for limited purposes.

“It really illuminates the original sin of AI systems built off public data—it's extractive, misleading, and dangerous to people who have been using the internet with one framework of risk, never assuming it would all be hoovered up by a group trying to create an image generator,” says Ben Winters, the director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America.

Ultimately, the paper calls for the machine-learning community to rethink the common practice of indiscriminate web scraping and also lays out the possible violations of current privacy laws represented by the existence of PII in massive machine-learning data sets, as well as the limitations of those laws' ability to protect privacy.

“We have the GDPR in Europe, we have the CCPA in California, but there's still no federal data protection law in America, which also means that different Americans have different rights protections,” says Marietje Schaake, a Dutch lawmaker turned tech policy expert who currently serves as a fellow at Stanford's Cyber Policy Center. 

Besides, these privacy laws apply to companies that meet certain criteria for size and other characteristics. They do not necessarily apply to researchers like those who were responsible for creating and curating DataComp CommonPool.

And even state laws that do address privacy, like California's consumer privacy act, have carve-outs for “publicly available” information. Machine-learning researchers have long operated on the principle that if it's available on the internet, then it is public and no longer private information, but Hong, Agnew, and their colleagues hope that their research challenges this assumption. 

“What we found is that ‘publicly available' includes a lot of stuff that a lot of people might consider private—résumés, photos, credit card numbers, various IDs, news stories from when you were a child, your family blog. These are probably not things people want to just be used anywhere, for anything,” says Hong.  

Hopefully, Schaake says, this research “will raise alarm bells and create change.”

We're starting to give AI agents real autonomy, and we're not prepared for what could happen next.

Some people believe chatbots like ChatGPT can provide an affordable alternative to in-person psychedelic-assisted therapy. Many experts say it's a bad idea.

In 2019, Karen Hao, a senior reporter with MIT Technology Review, pitched writing a story about a then little-known company, OpenAI. This is what happened next.

The only difference between then and now is that there's more to lose.

Torsten Sløk, chief economist at American asset company, Apollo Global Management, has warned that the AI companies and their stock prices are more over-inflated than the dot-com companies of the early 2000s, suggesting that an even bigger crash could be coming. He highlighted 10 of the top-performing AI companies, then suggested that the only real difference between AI businesses today and the dotcom companies of the late 90s and early 2000s is that AI businesses are even more overvalued (via Gizmodo).

The dot-com crash around the turn of the century saw companies rushing to adopt and take advantage of the internet. A relatively new technology and phenomenon at the time, but one that venture capitalists saw as having earning potential. Over the last five years of the 20th century, they invested trillions of dollars, and stock prices for publicly traded internet entities soared, only to come crashing down when the bottom dropped out of the market.

By the early 2000s, many of the companies involved in the boom had gone bust, and even now, industry giants like Amazon have lost huge portions of their investments, earnings, and market capitalization.

That's what Sløk argues is coming for the major AI firms. That's Apple, Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, Google/Alphabet, Amazon, and a range of other companies. He highlights how these firms have seen huge upticks in their valuations and stock prices in recent years, driven by investments in AI ventures.

This is completely out of whack with the earnings potential of these companies, Sløk argues, and suggests the majority of the gains made to the stock market during this AI boom have been because of the overperformance of these top stocks.

That, he claims, is not going to last, and because the boom is bigger this time, the bust could be even worse. You can expand the tweet below to see the comparison of valuations.

Although Sløk doesn't present a timeline for when any such bust could happen, it's clear even for us non-economists that the money being thrown around by some of the major tech companies is difficult to sustain. OpenAI recently accused Meta of offering $100 million signing bonuses to new AI talent. That's after it invested $14 billion in ScaleAI (only to see 200 employees fired from that company). CoreWeave is investing $6 billion in a new AI center, Amazon might be investing an additional $8 billion in Claude maker, Anthropic. Not to mention Nvidia's push to drive $500 billion in investment in "AI Factories," all while hoping that name catches on.

"Buy the rumor, sell the news," is not what's happening here.

Even if this wasn't quite to the overhyped levels of the dot-com crash, there are plenty of recent examples of tech trends seeming to encapsulate the future and then failing to deliver.

Meta invested tens of billions in the Metaverse and then promptly pivoted to AI as if it never happened. NFTs and blockchain were going to change how art, finance, and investing work, and that still hasn't happened yet.

Where each of those was constrained to a single company, or a niche market, though, AI is already everywhere, even without much of a profitable product to show for it. AI holds a lot of promise, perhaps a little like virtual reality, the metaverse, and blockchain technology, but does it warrant the hundreds of billions of investment it's getting already?

Sløk argues no, and that when the world catches on, these companies, which have ridden high on a wave of hype and investment, may find their ephemeral silicon empires melt away into sand.

What comes after that is even more speculative than a potential downfall, but if the dot-com analogy tracks, we could see huge consolidation, with many of the top companies surviving, but scaling back their investments dramatically. Speculative AI companies would likely fail, while those with more robust revenue streams, like Amazon, Google, and Meta, would likely survive, albeit diminished in their influence.

Just as the dot-com crash didn't kill the internet, or all of the websites on it, the AI bubble bursting wouldn't kill AI, or make the technology less useful. It will continue to be developed and is likely to remain a useful, functional tool. However, perhaps we wouldn't need to see "AI" as a buzzword on every product we buy over the following few years.

The chip wars intensify.

Chinese-linked hackers have intensified cyber-espionage efforts against Taiwan's semiconductor industry and financial analysts, conducting coordinated attacks between March and June 2025, with some operations still ongoing. Reuters reports that cybersecurity firm Proofpoint has attributed the activity to at least three previously undocumented China-aligned groups—UNK_FistBump, UNK_DropPitch, and UNK_SparkyCarp—while a fourth group, UNK_ColtCentury (also tracked as TAG-100 or Storm-2077), attempted to build trust with its targets before deploying a remote access trojan (RAT) known as Spark.

These attacks are believed to be part of Beijing's long-term push for semiconductor self-sufficiency, driven by U.S. export restrictions and Taiwan's dominance in advanced chip manufacturing. The hackers have focused on organizations involved in semiconductor design, manufacturing, testing, and supply chains, as well as investment analysts tracking Taiwan's semiconductor sector.

Proofpoint estimates that 15 to 20 organizations were targeted, ranging from medium-sized businesses to major global enterprises, along with analysts at at least one U.S.-headquartered international bank. While Taiwan's major chipmakers, including TSMC, MediaTek, UMC, Nanya, and RealTek, declined or did not respond to comment, Reuters has been unable to confirm which firms were breached or whether any of the attacks succeeded. The group says that in all cases, the motive "was most likely espionage."

The campaigns relied on varied tactics. UNK_FistBump launched spear-phishing attacks from compromised Taiwanese university email accounts, posing as job seekers and attaching malicious files disguised as PDF resumes. Opening these files triggered the deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons or a custom C-based backdoor known as Voldemort, previously linked to attacks on over 70 organizations worldwide. UNK_DropPitch, on the other hand, focused on financial analysts at major investment firms, masquerading as staff from a fake investment company and delivering malicious PDF links that downloaded ZIP archives carrying DLL-based payloads.

These malicious DLL files, when run using a side-loading trick, installed the HealthKick backdoor or opened a reverse connection to hacker-controlled servers like 45.141.139[.]222. In contrast, UNK_SparkyCarp used a different tactic, sending fake account security emails that led victims to phishing sites such as accshieldportal[.]com, using a custom tool to intercept and steal login credentials. The oldest trick in the book.



TeamT5, a Taiwanese cybersecurity firm, has reported an uptick in email-based threats aimed at Taiwan's semiconductor industry. According to Reuters, the firm has noted that attackers often exploit weaker defenses in smaller suppliers and related industries to gain a foothold. In June, for example, a China-linked group known as Amoeba launched a phishing campaign against a chemical company critical to the semiconductor supply chain. This strategy of targeting peripheral (secondary) sectors—such as raw materials, logistics, or consulting—underscores a broader effort to compromise the supply chain by exploiting its less-protected edges.

The scope and scale of these campaigns underscore the growing geopolitical tension around Taiwan's semiconductor dominance. Proofpoint researchers, including threat expert Mark Kelly, have warned that entities not previously on the radar are now being singled out. In late 2023, it was discovered that the Chimera group breached Europe's NXP—the continent's largest chipmaker—remaining undetected for over two years and stole sensitive chip design IP. Kelly noted that attackers sometimes sent just one or two highly targeted emails, while other campaigns involved as many as 80 emails to infiltrate entire organizations.

China's embassy in Washington responded to the reports by reiterating that cyberattacks are a global issue and that China “firmly opposes and combats all forms of cybercrime”. Earlier this year, it was reported that the U.S. Treasury was broken into, and the government discovered Chinese hackers targeting Guam's critical infrastructure. As such, these operations show clear alignment with Chinese state interests, as the targeting, tools, and tactics bear the hallmarks of China-linked cyber-espionage groups. With the Taiwanese semiconductor industry sitting at the heart of the global chip supply chain—and with ongoing export control measures from the U.S.—the sector remains one of the most valuable intelligence targets in the world.

Like a lot of us, Ari Aster spent the summer of 2020 trapped inside and scrolling on social media. Also like a lot of us, the experience left him feeling pretty bad.

“I was living on Twitter,” Aster tells WIRED, “and it was really agitating me.”

But unlike most people, the director of Hereditary, Midsommar, and Beau is Afraid wasn't just doomscrolling on Twitter to pass the time. He was doing research. That summer, Aster wrote the script for his latest film, Eddington, a modern western set in a small southwest American town during the height of both the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement. In theaters on July 18, the film deftly explores how social media and the internet in general have fractured modern society, placing us all in our own personally tailored worlds—and then descends into violence when those worlds collide.

Aster depicts this twisted vision of modern society by regularly pointing his camera straight at the Facebook and Twitter feeds of his main characters, giving the audience a look into the conspiracy theories and memes influencing their every decision. To create a realistic approximation of social media, Aster went straight to the source.

“I started making a collection of things from my timeline to remember when I made the film,” he says. “I also cultivated different algorithms to see what somebody else might be receiving. I started different accounts and created an archive. That was very helpful in making the film, even in post, when we were deciding what tweets to show on certain phones.”

These glimpses into the interior lives of Eddington's characters—the movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as a populist sheriff who runs for mayor against a corrupt, liberal incumbent played by Pedro Pascal—help ground a story that pivots wildly at times from cryptic political commentary to heightened carnage. Aster takes the classic American western and transforms it into something new: a messy thriller on the frontier of technological progress. In an interview with WIRED, the director unpacks the many meanings and inspirations behind his provocative new project.

Aster traces our current dystopian moment back to the rise of the smartphone.

“Society has been atomized and fractured over the last however many years,” he says. “I guess this all began once we started living in the internet—when we could carry the internet on our person.”

Eddington takes this theory and makes it a baseline reality, exploring a world where no two characters seem to be living in the same reality or even speaking the same language, whether that divide is political or generational. In one scene, a teenage boy sits at the dinner table and explains why he needs to reject his own whiteness. His parents' response is a mix of shock and confusion.

“This is a movie about people living in different realities who are unreachable to each other,” Aster says, musing that the modern internet has changed humanity in ways we likely still don't fully understand. “I do think the technological revolution is a mostly dehumanizing one,” he adds.

Eddington also explores conspiracy theories and the podcasters and YouTubers who spread them online in exchange for influence and profit. Phoenix's character will often return home to hear some disembodied voice spouting baseless claims through the speakers of an abandoned laptop. Later, his wife (Emma Stone) or mother-in-law (Deirdre O'Connell) will regurgitate those fringe theories over breakfast.

Again, Aster built this dark corner of his world out of real-life source material.

“One thing was inspired by somebody I heard on the street in New York with a microphone,” he says. “I wrote that down for later. Others were pulled from different corners of the internet.”

Aster's overall goal with Eddington was to convey the overwhelming feeling of being online today, while still making a compelling movie.

“It was important to get as many voices in the cacophony and represent as many corners of the internet as possible—to make a coherent story about the incoherent miasma we are living in,” he says. “I wish we could have shown more, but we did as much as we could without it becoming distracting or no longer supporting the story.”

Eddington may primarily be a movie about how social media is breaking our brains, but there's another technological innovation Aster was careful to represent in his movie: artificial intelligence. The film begins with a plan to build an AI-training data center on the edge of town, a plot point that resurfaces several times throughout the story (including in the election plotline, with Phoenix's character campaigning against the shady business interests behind the new facility).

“It is mostly peripheral,” Aster says, “but for me, it's the heart of the film. This is a movie about people living through Covid, navigating a crisis. Meanwhile, just outside of town, another crisis is being cooked up.”

In a recent interview with Letterboxd, the director opined that it's “obviously already too late” to stop AI. But when pressed about the pros and cons of artificial intelligence, Aster describes it with a mix of wonder and fear.

“I'm in awe of what it can do, but I'm also very disturbed by it,” he tells me. “We're living in an era of total distrust. This kind of imagery could lead to the end of video or audio evidence.”

As a director, he worries the ability to create transcendent art is being “flattened” by generative AI tools, while at the same time admitting that it's opening up the film industry to more people than ever. “It's been democratized in an exciting way,” he says. “There are more possibilities now, but something's also going away.”

In his own very Ari Aster way, the twisted mind behind some of the most disturbing visuals of the 21st Century (from the unexpected decapitation that kicks off Hereditary to the literal penis monster in Beau Is Afraid) already misses the era of more uncanny AI imagery.

“In the beginning, when these systems were hallucinating and creating weird imagery — 12 fingers, bizarre stuff—that was more interesting to me,” he says. “The more polished it gets, the less exciting and more alarming it becomes.”

Warning: Spoilers ahead for the end of Eddington.

Despite sometimes feeling like a Coen Brothers western on amphetamines, Eddington is impressively grounded throughout its nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime—until the final act. After Phoenix's character kills Pascal's and then frames the local BLM protesters for the murder, a plane full of actual anti-fascist terrorists flies into town and starts blowing everything up.

Reality quickly gives way to video game logic as Phoenix sprints through the town under the cover of darkness, firing machine guns into the night as he's pursued by faceless Antifa soldiers.

“At the end, he gets to live in his own action movie,” Aster says. “I definitely wanted the movie to start feeling like Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto.”

While Aster leaves the meaning of this sequence up for interpretation, there's one clear way to understand Eddington's finale. The film is taking those unhinged conspiracy theories and Facebook posts and transforming them into reality. The result feels like watching an alt-right fever dream in which the woke terrorists we all know never existed suddenly show up on your doorstep with guns and explosives.

“The film is about paranoid people,” Aster concurs, “and by the end, it becomes paranoid. It becomes gripped by their worldview. Depending on your beliefs or your algorithm, that's where it becomes either satire or a movie about what was really happening.”

That's about as far as the director will get to explaining the ultimate meaning behind his movie. While he admits to having a “very strong political stance” that he hopes is obvious by the time the credits roll, he's wary of making a film that intentionally alienates anyone. After all, the point of Eddington isn't that one side is necessarily right while the other is wrong, it's that social media has broken all of our brains. The only way to repair our shattered worldview is to come together across the divisions the internet and its algorithms are only making more pronounced.

“I wanted to give as broad a picture of the environment as I could without being dismissive or condescending,” Aster says. “I see all these characters as people who care about the world and know something's wrong. They're just seeing it through different, distorted windows.”

Not everyone will spend $1,500 on the most expensive high-end Roborock robot vacuum, but that doesn't mean you have to live in a dirty house or spend weekends sweeping. A few alternatives achieve good results for a fraction of the price and for those who'd like effortless floor cleaning without lifting a finger, the eufy robot vacuum 11S MAX is a top choice in its category. Now, it can be found on Amazon for an all-time low of $159, down from its usual $280 (which is a staggering 43% off).

See at Amazon

Despite its affordability, the eufy 11S MAX provides actual cleaning power to hardwood floor, tile, and medium-pile carpet. With the new BoostIQ technology, the vacuum booster activates automatically within 1.5 seconds when the machine encounters areas requiring special attention. This feature provides consistent performance so the transition from wooden floors to area rugs is seamless and efficient, and cleans fewer particles than other robots or manual cleaning can handle.

You'll notice the thoughtful design choices that make the eufy 11S MAX practical for daily life. Its anti-scratch tempered glass cover not only gives it a modern look, but also protects it from everyday wear and tear. Infrared sensors help the robot avoid unexpected obstacles while drop-sensing technology prevents falls on stairs or uneven surfaces. As the battery runs low, the 11S MAX will automatically return to its charging dock by itself.

On a single battery, the model will operate for up to 100 minutes on hardwood flooring, so it has the ability to clean multiple rooms at a time. The decibel level is surprisingly low, roughly comparable to a microwave so it can be used while watching TV or making work calls while the vacuum cleans the floor. Even households with kids or pets will enjoy the quiet and peace.

No fiddling with phone apps: everything is done through the included remote or on-hand. This saves unnecessary hassle and is perfect for those who want a hassle-free experience.

If you're looking to automate your cleaning routine without shelling out luxury-level cash, this Amazon deal is as practical as it gets.

Kloo (Tasting Set)

Amazon

When I started hunting for the best coffee concentrates, I was skeptical. Can a little jug of liquid or bottle of syrup really hold up to drip coffee or other methods of coffee making? Reader, it can. Our top pick, Javvy ($25), is affordable, tasty, and—most important—easy to use for all coffee drinkers. Read on to find the best coffee concentrates for your favorite ways to sip, fueled by (so much!) caffeine-filled testing.

Be sure to check out our many related buying guides, including the Best Coffee Subscriptions, the Best Pod Coffee Machines, the Best Cold-Brew Makers, the Best Latte Machines, and the Best French Press.

Javvy

Amazon

Javvy

Javvy (formerly Javy) was the first coffee concentrate I tried, and I still reach for it before all others. It's available in a mind-boggling array of flavors, and my favorite part is that the different flavors aren't super-sweet. The Caramel variety, for example, has buttery notes of caramel with very little sweetness. I rarely use sweetener in my coffee, so flavored blends are not usually my go to; Javvy managed to make me rethink that decision, and I'm reaching for Brownie Batter, Mocha, and Caramel Brûlèe without a second glance. I like the flip-top lid and the syrupy consistency of the concentrate. You need only a teaspoon or two for a full 8-ounce cup. The flavor profile of the Original is good, too, with a satisfying Arabica bean taste that almost made me forget I wasn't drinking freshly brewed. There was no bitter or funny aftertaste. I prefer my coffee cold, but I made this hot and it was tasty (if a tiny bit thin).

Jot

Amazon

Jot

If you like your coffee extra kicky, this concentrate is what you're looking for. It packs 150 milligrams of caffeine into a single tablespoon-size serving, but it doesn't taste too acidic or bitter. There's a nice jolt but not jitters or an overt shock to the senses. I also like the cork closure. The flavors are good, too—my favorite is Caramel, but there are lots to choose from. And the base coffee flavor is very unlike other concentrates—it's robust and rich, lending a fuller body (even diluted) than some others I tried. One note is that this must be mixed into 8 ounces of water, rather than 6. I personally think it's quite obvious that Jot and Javvy are very similar, and choosing between them should ultimately come down to what flavor sounds the best to you. Both products are fantastic and worth trying.

Kloo

Kloo (Tasting Set)

Kloo (Individual Bottles)

If you know a thing or two about coffee, you might find the other brands recommended here too lowbrow. But can you out-taste a coffee sommelier? Kloo's coffee concentrates are curated by such tasters, also known as “Q Graders,” and I couldn't stop saying “Wow” out loud while I tested the brand's offerings. From the upscale, frosted packaging and shiny metal stopper to the included measuring jigger, I was impressed upon first glance. And once I mixed in a shot full of the extract-consistency liquid, the taste was somehow more impressive. Think nuanced, fruity flavors in the Ethiopia blend or nutty, berry notes in the Colombia blend.

I am not a coffee snob—I do test pod coffee makers, after all—and even I could taste the difference here. This is not necessarily the most economical of options—one $33 bottle of concentrate makes 12 cups of coffee. Another note is that this has a shorter shelf life than some others we tested. But if you're a true coffee lover, this single-origin stuff is up your alley.

Pop & Bottle

Amazon

Cold brew is a notoriously tricky thing to make. It's not so much difficult as it is time-consuming. Once your grounds are wet, you need to let them steep for at least 24 hours. In a blind taste test, I don't think I could tell homemade cold brew from the kind made with Pop & Bottle Concentrate. It nails the mellow, smooth, slightly sweet flavor of true cold brew, and it takes seconds to make. It's a little less concentrated than other kinds I tried—one bottle gets you up to 16 cups of coffee—but it truly tastes like cold brew specifically and not just a coffee-flavored beverage. I found it tasted best diluted slightly more than the packaging calls for. I didn't care much for the beverage hot—it still reminded me too much of cold brew—but your mileage may vary there.

Starbucks

Amazon

This concentrated Starbucks cold brew tastes exactly like what you'd buy in its stores. That is, delicious. You can finally be your own barista. The flavored varieties aren't too heavy-handed—I like the earthy notes in the Madagascar Vanilla and the creamy quality of the Caramel Dolce—and I like that this is readily available in most grocery stores. It isn't super-concentrated, so you might want to start with slightly less water than is called for, and the bottle is pretty big in my fridge. But if you know what you like and you like it, this is smarter than going to the Siren for a simple cup of coffee.

Partners Coffee Roasters

Partners Coffee Roasters

Are you running a circus pie car? Do you have a family full of caffeine addicts? Do you drink the stuff all day? This giant jug of cold brew concentrate is the jug for you. It can make 32 cups of coffee! You can make it in a big batch or just dilute it as needed. The coffee is tasty, especially once you get the dilution dialed in right (like most other concentrates, I like mine slightly less diluted). There are notes of chocolate and a toasty nuttiness that go well black or with creamer.

Cometeer

Cometeer

Cometeer's flash-frozen coffee pods (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are featured in our list of the best coffee subscriptions. Cometeer starts with beans from quality roasters like Intelligentsia or Counter Culture. It brews the coffee, then flash-freezes it into a little pod. You'll get the frozen pods and pop them in the freezer, where they'll keep fresh for months. To make it, just melt it and then mix with hot or cold water or milk. The aluminum capsules are recyclable. The coffee tastes excellent, with all of the guesswork taken out. You don't have to buy a bag of beans and go through the rigamarole of figuring out the perfect grind and extraction temperature—you literally just have to melt, dump, and stir. If you want good coffee but don't want to deal with a single bit of thinking to get it, this is a very safe bet.

How We Tested & What's Up Next

During my testing period, I completely replaced my once- or twice-daily regular coffee habit with coffee concentrates. I followed the packaging instructions exactly. I made iced coffee with every candidate; I made hot coffee when the packaging said I could. I tried each variety black, with milk, and with flavored creamer. I tried the “Original” blend when applicable, and a few flavored varieties as well. I looked for ease of use, caffeine content, dissolubility, and—above all—taste. I'll be testing more coffee concentrates from Chameleon Coffee, Dunkin', Explorer, La Colombe, and more.

How Do You Use a Coffee Concentrate?

The packaging has instructions, which are very simple. Mix the concentrate (usually a teaspoon or a tablespoon) into your liquid of choice (hot water, cold water, milk, or a mixture; usually 6 to 8 fluid ounces. Six fluid ounces is 3/4 cup). Stir more than you think you need to. Then add flavorings, syrups, cream, or sugar to taste. You can add a bit more concentrate, but this will increase caffeine levels, and a little goes a very long way.

Coffee concentrates can also be used to lend coffee flavor to other foods and beverages. Try mixing a little in your vanilla protein shake or ice cream sundae for a caffeinated kick.

I love when gadgets have a schtick. Like Lenovo's Tab Plus with an ungodly amount of JBL speakers, or Nothing's Android phones with lights on the back. Schticks are great, and schticks that are practical and actually work are even better. For Soundcore's $130 Boom 3i Bluetooth speaker, the schtick is all about throwing a speaker into water, which is unnatural for anyone familiar with how batteries work, but for the right person, might be kind of awesome.

Let me explain: Soundcore made its Boom 3i Bluetooth speaker very, very waterproof. That's IP68 for anyone who speaks water and dust resistance fluently. That doesn't just mean you can throw it into water; it means you should throw it into water. The Boom 3i is designed to float and is actually weighted so that the speaker faces upwards at all times. The idea here, as you may have gathered, is that you can bring it into the pool, or lake, or even the ocean—Soundcore says the Boom 3i is also more resistant to salt water than other waterproof competitors. Naturally, to test all that out, I turned to… my bathtub.

Soundcore Boom 3i

An incredible value and not just for outdoor speakers.

Pros

Cons

Sure, it's not the ideal environment to blast loud Bluetooth audio, but this is in the name of science, and in my small town of Brooklyn, New York, pools that I would ever step foot in, let alone ones that allow loud music, are not exactly forthcoming. And in my contained float test, the Boom 3i passed with flying colors, both literally and figuratively, since this thing literally lights up with built-in RGB lighting. What's even more impressive isn't that the Boom 3i floats; it's that it floats and still manages to play audio that sounds good. Because the Boom 3i is weighted, the side with the speaker grate on it, which actually projects the audio, always stays upright, so your tunes aren't getting literally drowned out.

There are some idiosyncrasies you should be aware of when using a Bluetooth speaker to play audio in a body of water. One of them is that the bass causes things to get a little splashy. If you toss the Boom 3i into water with the bass boost on at full tilt, you're going to see a lot of spitting happening on the sides where the tweeters are, which is kind of distracting/irritating, but also really funny to watch. Fortunately, Soundcore was very thoughtful in its inclusion of a “Bass” button on the top of the speaker that can toggle the full amount of bass on/off depending on whether you're using the Boom 3i on land or in water. It took me a second to realize that, but once I did, this speaker felt even more luxurious. For the record, I highly recommend toggling bass off while wet-listening, lest we get splashed in our eyes.

Another pro tip is to make sure that the USB-C port on the back of the speaker is sealed with the attached rubber stopper before you give this thing a bath, because that's the only entrance for water that can and will ruin your speaker. I went straight from charging the speaker to bath time with my Boom 3i, and everything remained acceptably dry, but I also made sure the rubber stopper on the back was pressed shut diligently before dunking.

Another thing you'll notice right away is that the Boom 3i is also LOUD, which is great and totally fitting for a Bluetooth speaker designed to be used outdoors. In total, the Boom 3i has 50W of power, which puts it above loud-ish competitors like the JBL Charge 5—a speaker I've used outside for a few years now. In fact, this thing is so loud that I had to dial it back when playing music in my apartment for fear of getting a noise complaint. That's not me being annoyed; that's me telling you that if you're using this thing outdoors, you'll be pleased, especially given the size. This thing only weighs 780 grams, which is markedly less than the JBL Charge 5, which clocks in at 960 grams.

And it's not just louder than the JBL Charge 5, it also sounds a heck of a lot better. I compared the two back-to-back, playing the song “Digital Love” by Daft Punk, and while the JBL Charge 5 is no slouch, the Boom 3i kind of blows it out of the water (pun intended). In particular, I find the Boom 3i feels a lot more nuanced than the JBL Charge 5, especially when it comes to pronouncing midrange frequencies that the latter Bluetooth speaker tends to leave out.

Sound-wise, it's not quite as good as the Bose SoundLink Plus that I recently tested, but Bose's entrant is also almost three times the amount of money, so that's really not a fair comparison at the end of the day. More so than the schtick of being able to toss the Boom 3i in water, I was surprised by the overall sound quality of Soundcore's newest speaker. When you factor in the price—just $130 retail compared to the Charge 5's $180 price tag—the proposition becomes even more appealing.

I'm not exactly an outdoors kind of person, but if I were, there would also be a lot more to love about the Boom 3i, including some nice-to-haves like “Buzz Clean,” which is a feature that you can launch from the Soundcore app that vibrates the Boom 3i to help dust off any excess sand. There's also an alarm that you can trigger by pressing and holding the Bass button on the top of the speaker for five seconds—beware, though, it's loud. And speaking of the Soundcore app, there's also plenty to take advantage of there, including the ability to control the volume of the speaker remotely and even EQ if you think you want to fine-adjust the Boom 3i's levels.

Another important component of an outdoor speaker—one that you might be bringing camping or somewhere without ready access to electricity—is battery life. Soundcore rates the Boom 3i for 16 hours of battery life on 50 percent volume without bass boost activated, and from my testing, that estimate seems to be accurate. One thing I would have liked to see here, since, like I said, this is an outdoor speaker that people might take camping, is reverse charging, but sadly, the Boom 3i can't top off your iPhone or Android phone in a pinch. As long as I'm giving the Boom 3i a critique, I think the speaker kind of looks like a bomb or something. This is by no means the coolest-looking or prettiest speaker out there (certainly no Bose citrus yellow), but it gets a bit of a pass for being so waterproof and durable. Just know that if you bring this thing on an airplane, you may get pulled aside by TSA.

If you noticed that I'm near the end of this speaker review and I've barely said a bad word about it, that's because there is frankly not much to dislike about the Boom 3i. I'm convinced that after testing Soundcore's newest Bluetooth speaker, this is an incredible value in Bluetooth audio. Rarely do you get this level of sound quality with as many unique features as the Boom 3i, and for a price that actually undercuts or matches the competition by a good amount. Soundcore's Boom 3i may seem like a gimmick on the surface with a focus on water resistance and floatability, but once you start using this speaker, you'll be pleased to know that it's also solid all around, from the sound to the brick-like exterior.

Low input latency is key to a good framegen experience. Let's (try to) measure it.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


We live in rapidly changing times for PC graphics. More and more pixels are being generated by AI or “neural” rendering techniques. The DLSS, FSR, and XeSS upscalers let us boost frame rates at will in exchange for small dings to image quality. Frame generation techniques, especially Nvidia's multi-frame generation tech on its Blackwell cards, let us boost them even higher still with the click of an in-game toggle.

When implemented well, we think MFG can be an improvement to the gameplay experience. Take crushing titles like Alan Wake II and Cyberpunk 2077. On a high-refresh-rate, variable-refresh rate monitor, both games look pretty choppy at 45 or 50 FPS if you're running them at demanding settings, even with an assist from a monitor's low framerate compensation.

Blackwell's multi-frame generation can turn that choppy ride into a smooth experience by pushing output frame rates far higher up in a display's refresh rate range. There are some cases where MFG's seams are still visible, but we think they're an acceptable tradeoff for the much smoother output.

There's just one catch: a game with MFG can look smoother, but it might not feel better to interact with. That's because its input lag remains tied to the speed at which the base game loop runs. DLSS and other upscalers can improve this latency by boosting baseline performance, but framegen and MFG don't.

We've frequently, albeit informally, described this need for a good input lag baseline in past coverage. (See also our ruminations on framegen performance in Black Myth Wukong.) As framegen and MFG both seem poised to become a bigger and bigger part of PC gaming going forward, we think that there needs to be a more formal, empirical way of communicating this latency baseline.

Having an easy way to quantify both input lag and output frame rate lets us communicate better with everybody about what we're seeing, and exploring the relationship between baseline frame rate, input lag, and output frame rates with framegen can also help us work back from manufacturer info to determine whether claims were made with an acceptable input latency as a baseline.

We already have the tools to at least approximately capture this latency. Nvidia's own FrameView application provides a “PC Latency” metric, while Intel's PresentMon exposes a measurement called “All Input to Photon Latency,” which can be optionally captured as part of its overall performance logging.

We've found game and GPU vendor compatibility potholes with both of these applications, and we have some reservations about these entirely software-based metrics, but higher latency measurements from them correlate to a notably worse-feeling gameplay experience, and that's good enough as a starting point.



Most importantly, communicating this measurement alongside framegen-enhanced output makes for more honest marketing. Nvidia apparently knows this, since it touted low PC latency as an advantage in Cyberpunk 2077 when it introduced MFG alongside the RTX 5090. In contrast, it's conspicuously absent from the recently-launched RTX 5050's MFG-heavy official marketing materials.

In any case, if a graphics card isn't contributing to a good input-to-photon latency to begin with, pumping its output frame rate with framegen or MFG—and only communicating that figure—doesn't show the complete picture.

We wanted to see if quantifying this latency provides a more grounded description of what it's like to game in a future where output frame rates might be less about raw power and more about toggling in-game settings to taste.

Our not-particularly-original proposal here, but one that we need to formalize regardless, is that there is a maximum acceptable latency threshold with framgen enabled (call it the MALT) beyond which a given game starts to feel more and more uncoupled from user input. This unpleasant behavior presents itself in various ways, like "rubber banding" or "swimminess."

When talking about framegen performance, we believe companies and testers should include the MALT they considered “acceptable” when using those techniques to boost the output frame rate.

Lower MALTs will require higher baseline performance, whether through beefier hardware or lighter in-game settings. And there is a ceiling past which a MALT will be too high to ensure a good interactive experience.

What makes for a good MALT? It's likely to vary by game and by game type. Our experience with Alan Wake II and MFG so far suggests that any input-to-photon latency below 30 ms is excellent, 30-45 ms feels great, 45ms - 60 ms is usable, and anything too far above that will start to cause perceptible rubber banding or discontinuity between input and output.

Why measure this latency directly instead of just using frame rates as a proxy (i.e., 60 FPS as a “good enough” foundation on which to enable MFG?) It's probably an edge case, but Nvidia has highlighted at least one experience where a frame rate that intuitively seems “good enough” does not match up with an acceptable input latency. The company observed Microsoft Flight Simulator running at 50 FPS natively, but with an input latency of 172 ms.

In short: if you can measure it, measure it.



Achievable latency thresholds are also likely to vary from system to system, due to the huge array of peripherals, components, and monitors out there. Your tolerance for input lag may also be tighter or looser than ours. PresentMon and FrameView are free, so the only cost involved in testing this out for yourself is time.

In a world where even the $329-ish RTX 5060 Ti 16GB can push 200 FPS at 1440p with DLSS and MFG 4X in Alan Wake II, we wanted to see what performance analysis might look like if we followed our own advice and normalized to a MALT. We picked 60 ms as our threshold and got to work seeing how we could tune settings on a range of modern GPUs to stay within that range.

Our results are fairly intuitive. The first column shows the system latency you get simply from moving up to a more powerful graphics card with the same settings, and the second then shows the higher settings we're able to select within that headroom without going over our 60 ms input latency threshold. Read the chart in a Z pattern to understand the enhancements that a more powerful card gives you for the same MALT.

Buying a more powerful GPU for Alan Wake II, at least, intuitively lets you enjoy lower input latency and higher output frame rates than those at our 60 ms MALT for a given group of settings, or higher resolution and image quality settings for the same 60 ms threshold.

The point here is that if you don't need the lowest possible input latency, as you might not in a slower-paced experience like Alan Wake II, putting more of your GPU's resources toward higher-resolution output and richer visuals when you have the latency headroom to do so with framegen is just smart. Monitoring this figure also lets you dial back settings if your given choices result in an unpleasant experience.

One challenge in fine-tuning performance with MFG is that DLSS quality settings only offer us five coarse levels of adjustment today without the use of third-party tools. If we had more intermediate DLSS settings, we could potentially achieve lower input latencies (imagine a value between Ultra Performance and Performance, for example) than our 60 ms threshold while still maximizing image quality within the rendering resources of a given graphics card. We hope that Nvidia explores ways to natively expose finer DLSS granularity in the future to make the most of MFG.

Considering latency and frame rates together also helps us analyze a bold question: does MFG let lower-end GeForce cards “beat” their higher-end predecessors? Nvidia infamously claimed the RTX 5070 could beat the RTX 4090 with the full suite of DLSS 4 features enabled. We didn't test that exact claim, but we did pit the RTX 5080 versus the RTX 4090 to try and understand whether it had any merit.

If we normalize for a 60 ms MALT in Alan Wake II with high raster settings, ultra RT, and a 4K target resolution, the RTX 5080 has to use DLSS Ultra Performance to achieve this target input latency, whereas the Ada flagship can use DLSS Performance for a boost in image quality at the same latency.



The major difference, of course, is that MFG 4X lets the RTX 5080 output an enhanced 190 FPS with DLSS Ultra Performance, for a theoretically much smoother output than the RTX 4090's 97 FPS with DLSS Performance. The difference in delivered smoothness isn't as drastic to our eyes as the output frame rates might suggest, but our 160 Hz monitor might be concealing the full magnitude of this improvement.

Use DLSS Ultra Performance on both cards, though, and the RTX 4090's PC latency drops 25%, to 46 ms on average, and the output frame rate rises to 133 FPS. Even though the RTX 4090's 2X framegen output still can't match the RTX 5080's with MFG 4X at the same settings, we enjoy much lower overall input latency on the RTX 4090 than on the RTX 5080, and some might prefer that more responsive experience.

Looking at both input latency and output frame rates together, the RTX 5080 can deliver theoretically smoother output, but RTX 4090 owners probably shouldn't go out and upgrade on this basis alone. And it certainly throws cold water on bold claims that even lower-end cards than the RTX 5080 can match or exceed the gaming experience of an RTX 4090 unless the output frame rate is all that you're measuring.



This leads us to Nvidia's marketing materials for the recently launched RTX 5050. Eyeballing its charts, the company appears to have used a low baseline frame rate for the non-esports titles in its selection. Cyberpunk 2077 and Avowed both appear to cap out around 160 FPS with MFG 4X, implying a baseline of around 40 FPS on average.

Again, we've already seen that intuition doesn't necessarily serve us well when tying frame rates to a particular game's input latency, and it's entirely possible that Nvidia observed an acceptable latency threshold when it tuned settings to achieve that 40-ish FPS. But when you appear to be riding the line like this, it makes disclosing those assumptions all the more important.

Intel recommends a minimum of 40 FPS for use with its Xe Frame Generation tech, but that figure is for developers targeting a good experience on integrated graphics. For higher-end graphics cards, Intel suggests a 60 FPS baseline is ideal. AMD recommends 60 FPS as a performance target before using FSR 3 Frame Generation, period (and also cautions that “sub 30fps frame rate pre-interpolation should be absolutely avoided.”)

Nvidia doesn't have a recommended frame rate for use with MFG that we could find, but it's also got a trick up its sleeve that Intel and AMD's methods lack. Nvidia Reflex in DLSS 4 includes Frame Warp, a reprojection technique that we already know from VR. Frame Warp uses a range of data sources to shift output frames to more closely match the user's most recent inputs, reducing perceived latency.

It's possible that with Frame Warp and the perceptual latency reduction it purports to offer, MFG can tolerate input frame rates lower than XeFG and FSR—but again, these assumptions can be measured, and they should be communicated. After all, if Nvidia's framegen solution can robustly tolerate a higher input latency and do more with less on lower-end hardware like the RTX 5050, that's a competitive advantage over other framegen approaches.

With all this in mind, how should we reason about GPU performance in a world where framegen is more and more common? MFG does not suddenly mean that more powerful GPUs are unnecessary or that lower-end parts can magically eclipse higher-end ones. It's more of a cherry on top of the power you're already buying than a leg up on the next card up the stack.

Higher-end GPUs can still give you better image quality at the same input latency or a much lower input latency for the same settings, and you still need their muscle to push demanding games at higher output resolutions, period, even with upscaling in the picture.

What's also important to remember is that not all framegen techniques are the same, even from the same vendor. Framegen on Nvidia Ada cards looks a bit worse to our eyes than on Blackwell with MFG, and MFG in DLSS 4 includes technologies like reprojection that other vendors' solutions lack. We didn't test FSR or XeSS frame generation for this article, but they lack the flexibility that MFG's 3X and 4X multipliers give you for better matching output frame rate to your monitor's frame rate.

On that note, we think the best way to think of MFG is as a bridge to increasing gaming smoothness on today's high-refresh-rate monitors, even with relatively attainable graphics cards. For just one example, 1440p 240Hz monitors used to be wildly expensive, but you can now grab one for less than $300. The cost of GPU power is obviously not going down at the same rate as those high-refresh-rate monitors.

Recall that the $329-and-up RTX 5060 Ti 16GB can push 200 FPS at 1440p with DLSS Ultra Performance and MFG 4X in Alan Wake II. To reach those same performance figures without MFG at the same settings, you need to use a $3000+ RTX 5090. We know, because we tried.

Unless you're an esports pro who needs both the lowest possible input latency and high output frame rates, being able to use higher reaches of your monitor's refresh rate range without spending $3000 on a commensurate GPU is pretty cool.

The worst way to think about MFG is as a route to achieving “playable” output frame rates. This is a false grail. A game running at an unplayable 20 FPS pre-framegen cannot magically be boosted to a “playable” 60 or 80 FPS using MFG, simply because the input latency at such a low native frame rate is likely to exceed any acceptable standard.

Overall, our brief investigation suggests that in a future where framegen is more and more common, both vendors and media alike need to be clearer about the baseline input latency they're assuming when talking about framegen-enhanced performance. It's entirely possible for all camps to end up creating marketing materials and performance or image quality analyses that rest on an input frame rate that's too low and an input latency that's too high for the end user to actually enjoy.

More monkey business in the world of Nintendo.

One of the most notable features of the Nintendo Switch 2 that has many in the gaming community intrigued is its Nvidia DLSS support. Nvidia's AI-powered tech has long been the 800-pound gorilla of upscaling, and it seems especially useful on a console with limited graphics horsepower like the Switch 2.

Despite the fact that DLSS is in the Switch 2 developer's toolkit, however, it's becoming apparent that the technology isn't being universally adopted among devs.

Surprisingly, the holdouts include Nintendo's latest blockbuster, Donkey Kong Bananza. The fine folks at Digital Foundry unpeeled the mystery of missing DLSS support in the title as part of their recent review.

It's also worth pointing out that we reported performance issues earlier this week from Switch 2 developers who are warning users ahead of time to expect some performance drops in Donkey Kong Bananza.

Bananza has been in production for several years, which might be why it's not built to support DLSS. That said, it appears to provide more than adequate graphics using AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR 1) along with Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing (or more simply SMAA), which, as the name suggests, reduces aliasing.

Another big title game that caught our attention in its lack of DLSS support is Mario Kart World. We expected Nintendo's flagship games to be leaders in implementing all of the Switch 2's capabilities, but DLSS is apparently off the table for some. We were disappointed even to learn that Mario Kart World developers failed to properly implement real HDR support.

Time will tell if more developers jumped on the DLSS train or not. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is a highly anticipated upcoming title that might take advantage of Nvidia's DLSS. However, this has yet to be confirmed, so we're not 100% clear what to expect out of this release, either.

PDK set to be available in Q1 2026.

Rapidus on Friday announced that it had begun prototyping of test wafers with 2nm gate-all-around (GAA) transistor structures at its IIM-1 facility in Japan. The company confirmed that early test wafers are already attaining the expected electrical characteristics, which means that the company's fab tools operate as planned and its process technology development is proceeding well.

Prototyping is an important milestone in semiconductor production that is meant to verify that early test circuits made using a new technology behave reliably, efficiently, and meet performance targets.



For now, Rapidus is measuring electrical characteristics of its test circuits, which includes parameters like threshold voltage (the voltage at which the transistor starts to conduct), drive current (how much current it can pass when switched on), leakage current (unwanted current flow when the transistor is off), and subthreshold slope (how sharply the device transitions from off to on). Other important characteristics include switching speed, power consumption, and capacitance. For obvious reasons, Rapidus does not share results, though the very fact that test wafers are flying around the fab is important.

The IIM-1 site has seen rapid progress since construction began in September 2023. The clean room was finalized in 2024, and by June 2025, the company had connected more than 200 of its tools, including advanced DUV and EUV lithography tools. Rapidus installed advanced EUV tools in December 2024 and completed its first successful exposures with them by April 2025. By now, the fab is mature enough to run test wafers, enabling Rapidus to measure electrical characteristics of its GAA circuits to identify possible process issues and refine settings of tools or manufacturing steps.

One interesting thing that Rapidus mentioned in its press release covering the announcement is that its IIM-1 fab will use the so-called single-wafer processing approach (a semiconductor manufacturing method in which each wafer is handled, processed, and inspected individually rather than in batches) for all front-end process steps.



Nowadays, large chipmakers like Intel, Samsung, and TSMC use a combination of batch and single-wafer processing methods in their semiconductor fabrication processes. Single-wafer processing is used for critical steps that demand precision, such as EUV and DUV patterning, plasma etch, atomic layer deposition, or defect monitoring. For other steps, such as oxidation, ion implantation, cleaning, and annealing, they process wafers in batches.

Rapidus plans to apply a single-wafer approach to all of its process steps, including oxidation, ion implantation, patterning, deposition, etching, cleaning, annealing, etc. Rapidus says that this enables precise control over each operation, as adjustments can be made specifically for the conditions or results observed on that single wafer. Since each wafer is treated independently, engineers can fine-tune parameters in real time, detect anomalies early, and quickly apply corrections without waiting for an entire batch to complete. As an added bonus, such a method generates larger amounts of high-resolution data per wafer compared to the mixed approach used by other chipmakers, which can be used to feed AI algorithms that monitor and optimize manufacturing conditions. These algorithms can potentially enable faster gathering of information for continuous process improvements (CPI) to reduce defect density and increase yields, as well as for statistical process control (SPC) to reduce performance variations. Also, single-wafer process systems make it easier to change settings and switch between small and large production runs, which is important for Rapidus, which aims to serve smaller makers.

However, this method also introduces some trade-offs. Since wafers are processed one at a time, throughput per tool (well, some tools) is lower compared to batch processing, potentially extending production cycle times and making production more expensive. The equipment required is more complex and costly, and coordinating the movement of wafers across all steps individually adds overhead.

However, Rapidus believes that despite higher upfront costs and slower processing, the long-term benefits in defect reduction, yield improvement, and adaptive process control can make single-wafer processing a compelling strategy for the production of chips at 2nm and beyond.

To support early customers, Rapidus is preparing to release the first version of its process development kit in the first quarter of 2026. The company is also working to provide the infrastructure needed for customer chip design prototyping at the IIM-1 site.

Cuproptosis represents a novel mechanism of cell death characterized by intracellular copper ion accumulation. Unlike other cell death pathways, its unique process has garnered significant interest due to its promising applications in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Emerging evidence suggests that copper metabolism and cuproptosis may play a dual regulatory role in pathological cellular environments, particularly in modulating oxidative stress responses, metabolic reprogramming, and immunotherapeutic efficacy. Appropriate copper levels can promote disease progression and exert synergistic effects, but beyond a certain threshold, copper may suppress disease development by inducing cuproptosis in pathological cells. This makes dysregulated copper levels a potential novel therapeutic target for IBD and CRC.

This article highlights the dual role of copper metabolism and cuproptosis in the progression of IBD and CRC while exploring the potential applications of copper-based therapies in disease treatment. Additionally, it further elucidates the regulatory effects of the tumor immune microenvironment on cuproptosis and establishes the therapeutic potential of cuproptosis-targeting strategies in overcoming resistance to conventional chemotherapy and emerging immunotherapies. This provides new research directions for the future development of cuproptosis inducers. Finally, the article discusses potential molecular targets of cuproptosis and the latest advances in related genes for treating IBD and CRC, while emphasizing future research priorities and unresolved questions.

1. Bidirectional Regulatory Role of Copper Metabolism and Cuproptosis in IBD and CRC

Studies have demonstrated that copper metabolism and cuproptosis exhibit dual effects in the pathological processes of IBD and CRC. As an essential trace element, copper homeostasis imbalance can lead to cell death, with cuproptosis representing a newly identified copper-dependent cell death mechanism.

In IBD, copper affects intestinal barrier function by regulating oxidative stress and immune responses. For example, excessive copper exacerbates oxidative stress and damages intestinal epithelial cells, while copper chelators can alleviate inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. In CRC, copper accelerates disease progression by promoting angiogenesis and tumor metastasis, yet cuproptosis can selectively kill tumor cells. These findings reveal the complex role of copper metabolism and cuproptosis in intestinal diseases.

2. Interaction between cuproptosis and the tumor immune microenvironment

Cuproptosis not only directly induces tumor cell death but also remodels the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Studies have found that copper complex nanoparticles (Cu(I)NPs) can induce cuproptosis and release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation and CD8+ T cell infiltration.
In addition, copper ionophores (e.g., disulfiram/copper complexes) enhance anti-tumor immune responses by promoting M1 macrophage polarization and suppressing PD-L1 expression. These findings demonstrate that cuproptosis can potentiate existing immunotherapies through immune modulation, offering novel strategies to overcome tumor resistance.

3. Clinical Potential of Copper-Targeted Therapies

Copper metabolism-related proteins (including ATP7A/B and FDX1) have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for CRC. Preclinical studies indicate that copper chelators (e.g., tetrathiomolybdate) and copper ionophores (e.g., disulfiram) can inhibit tumor growth by inducing cuproptosis.

Furthermore, copper-based nanomedicines (e.g., E-C@DOX NPs) combined with chemotherapy or photothermal therapy have significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy. In clinical trials, disulfiram/copper complexes have demonstrated good safety profiles in some patients, though their therapeutic effects require further validation. These advancements have laid the foundation for the clinical translation of copper-targeted therapies.

4. Synergistic Effects Between Cuproptosis and Other Cell Death Pathways

Cuproptosis exhibits crosstalk with other cell death mechanisms such as apoptosis and ferroptosis. For instance, disulfiram/copper complexes simultaneously trigger cuproptosis and ferroptosis by inhibiting PKM2-driven glycolysis and promoting Fe-S cluster protein degradation. Additionally, cuproptosis-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. These synergistic effects provide new insights for developing combination therapies, though precise regulation of copper homeostasis remains a challenge.

As a newly identified mechanism of cellular demise, cuproptosis is undergoing rigorous investigation across diverse disciplines, including chemotherapy, TME regulation, immune-based therapies, and outcome prediction, to develop more effective cancer management strategies. However, the study of cuproptosis is still a nascent field, with current studies primarily focused on its correlation with IBD and CRC. Numerous underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated, necessitating additional fundamental investigations. Future investigations should focus on deciphering the precise molecular pathways that govern Cu metabolism and cuproptosis in the context of IBD and CRC, as well as explore strategies to modulate Cu levels to maximize therapeutic efficacy. Despite its potential, several challenges remain in cuproptosis research, which also pose obstacles for clinical applications. First, the potential clinical applications and safety concerns related to cuproptosis modulation remain to be fully explored, posing significant challenges for the clinical translation of cuproptosis inducers. Both copper deficiency and excess can induce systemic toxicity, necessitating additional clinical studies to evaluate how copper level modulation affects prognosis in IBD and CRC patients. Such investigations are crucial for improving the targeting efficiency and in vivo stability of these therapeutic agents. Second, Cu's potential as a therapeutic target needs further exploration. This includes developing therapies based on Cu metabolism and cuproptosis, such as gene knockouts and cell-based approaches, while research efforts are shifting toward novel copper inducers, including plant-derived compounds, synthetic molecules, and nanotechnology-based carriers, to improve targeted drug delivery to affected cells. Additionally, the connection between copper metabolism, cuproptosis, and the intestinal immune microenvironment requires further investigation. Combining cuproptosis with immunotherapy could offer a promising strategy to combat IBD and CRC, significantly improving treatment outcomes and extending patient survival. However, it remains unclear whether cuproptosis and its signaling pathways play a protumor role in tumor initiation and development. The current lack of validated cuproptosis biomarkers underscores the need for additional research to enable precision therapeutic interventions.

Comprehending the interplay between cuproptosis and alternative forms of cellular demise constitutes another pivotal research domain. Investigating the connections between cuproptosis and other kind of pathways, including apoptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, may deepen our comprehension of Cu-related diseases and accelerate the progression of targeted therapies to induce tumor cell death more effectively. Looking forward, the discovery of specific biomarkers and personalized antitumor strategies will likely enable the clinical translation of therapies based on Cu metabolism and cuproptosis.

In summary, cuproptosis represents a potential novel therapeutic avenue for IBD and CRC. Advancing understanding of cuproptosis regulation and enhancing its induction efficiency position this pathway as a novel therapeutic strategy for disease intervention. This strategy has the potential not only to suppress disease onset and progression effectively but also to improve patient survival and quality of life through precision therapies. Therefore, understanding the involvement of cuproptosis in pathological processes and developing related treatment strategies holds substantial scientific and medical importance.

Last year in Massachusetts, after finding lumps in her breast, Jessica Chen went to Lowell General Hospital-Saints Campus, part of Tufts Medicine, for a mammogram and sonogram. Before the screenings, she asked the hospital for the estimated patient responsibility for the bill using her insurance, Tufts Health Plan. Her portion, she was told, would be $359 — and she paid it. She was more than a little surprised weeks later to receive a bill asking her to pay an additional $1,677.51. "I was already trying to stomach $359, and this was many times higher," Chen, a physician assistant, told me.

The No Surprises Act, which took effect in 2022, was rightly heralded as a landmark piece of legislation, which "protects people covered under group and individual health plans from receiving surprise medical bills," according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. And yet bills that take patients like Chen by surprise just keep coming.

With the help of her software-wise boyfriend, she found the complicated "machine-readable" master price list that hospitals are required to post online and looked up the negotiated rate between Lowell General and her insurer. It was $302.56 — less than she had paid out-of-pocket.

CMS is charged with enforcing the law, so Chen sent a complaint about the surprising bill to the agency. She received a terse email in return: "We have reviewed your complaint and have determined that the rights and protections of the No Surprises Act do not apply."

When I asked the health system to explain how such a surprising off-estimate bill could be generated, Tufts Medicine spokesperson Jeremy Lechan responded by email: "Healthcare billing is complex and includes various factors and data points, so actual charges for care provided may differ from initial estimates. We understand the frustration these discrepancies can cause."

Here's the problem: While the No Surprises Act has been a phenomenal success in taking on some unfair practices in the wild West of medical billing, it was hardly a panacea.In fact, the measure protected patients primarily from only one particularly egregious type of surprise bill that had become increasingly common before the law's enactment: When patients unknowingly got out-of-network care at an in-network facility, or when they had no choice but to get out-of-network care in an emergency. In either case, before President Donald Trump signed the law late in his first term, patients could be hit with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in out-of-network bills that their insurance wouldn't pay.

The No Surprises Act also provided some protection from above-estimate bills, but at the moment, the protection is only for uninsured and self-pay patients, so it wouldn't apply in Chen's case since she was using health insurance.

But patients who do qualify generally are entitled to an up-front, good-faith estimate for treatment they schedule at least three business days in advance or if they request one. Patients can dispute a bill if it is more than $400 over the estimate. (The No Surprises Act also required what amounted to a good-faith estimate of out-of-pocket costs for patients with insurance, but that provision has not been implemented, since, nearly five years later, the government still has not issued rules about exactly what form it should take.)

So, surprising medical bills — bills that the patient could not have anticipated and never consented to — are still stunning countless Americans.

Jessica Robbins, who works in product development in Chicago, was certainly surprised when, out of the blue, she was recently billed $3,300 by Endeavor Health for a breast MRI she had received two years earlier, with prior authorization from her then-insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois. In trying to resolve the problem, she found herself caught in a Kafkaesque circle involving dozens of calls and emails. The clinic where she had the procedure no longer existed, having been bought by Endeavor. And she no longer had Blue Cross.

"We are actively working with the patient and their insurer to resolve this matter," Endeavor spokesperson Allie Burke said in an emailed response to my questions.

Mary Ann Bonita of Fresno, California, was starting school this year to become a nursing assistant when, on a Friday, she received a positive skin test for tuberculosis. Her school's administration said she couldn't return to class until she had a negative chest X-ray. When her doctor from Kaiser Permanente didn't answer requests to order the test for several days, Bonita went to an emergency room and paid $595 up front for the X-ray, which showed no TB. So she and her husband were surprised to receive another bill, for $1,039, a month later, "with no explanation of what it was for," said Joel Pickford, Bonita's husband.

In the cases above, each patient questioned an expensive, unexpected medical charge that came as a shock — only to find that the No Surprises Act didn't apply.

"There are many billing problems out there that are surprising but are not technically surprise bills," Zack Cooper, an associate professor of economics at Yale University, told me. The No Surprises Act fixed a specific kind of charge, he said, "and that's great. But, of course, we need to address others."

Cooper's research has found that before the No Surprises Act was passed, more than 25% of emergency room visits yielded a surprise out-of-network bill.

CMS' official No Surprises Help Desk has received tens of thousands of complaints, which it investigates, said Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson. "While some billing practices, such as delayed bills, are not currently regulated" by the No Surprises Act, Howden said, complaint trends nonetheless help "inform potential areas for future improvements." And they are needed.

Michelle Rodio, a teacher in Lakewood, Ohio, had a lingering cough weeks after a bout of pneumonia that required treatment with a course of antibiotics. She went to Cleveland Clinic's Lakewood Family Health Center for an examination. Her X-ray was fine. As was her nasal swab — except for the stunning $2,700 bill it generated.

"I said, 'This is a surprise bill!'" Rodio recalled telling the provider's finance office. The agent said it was not.

"So I said, 'Next time I'll be sure to ask the doctor for an estimate when I get a nose swab.'"

"The doctors wouldn't know that," the agent replied, as Rodio recalled — and indeed physicians generally have no idea how much the tests they order will cost. And in any case, Rodio was not legally entitled to a binding estimate, since the part of the No Surprises Act that grants patients with insurance that right has not been implemented yet.

So she was stuck with a bill of $471 (the patient responsibility portion of the $2,700 charge) that she couldn't have consented to (or rejected) in advance. It was surprising — shocking to her, even — but not a "surprise bill," according to the current law. But shouldn't it be?

Two junior research groups at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, have developed a drug complex that kills cancer cells in such a clever manner that they raise a red flag as they die. They signal to the immune system that something is seriously wrong with this type of cell. This teaches the immune cells to destroy such cancer cells—even if they are not in the vicinity of the original tumor. This could remove metastases that develop at distant sites in the body. Dr. Johannes Karges from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Dr. Carlos Plaza-Sirvent from the Department of Medicine present their findings in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry on July 17, 2025.

90 percent of all deaths from cancer are due to metastases. This is why Karges and his team are looking for ways to train the immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells. They have found success with a drug that kills the cells in a sophisticated manner. "The gallium complex we developed penetrates the cells and, because of its special properties, causes oxidative stress in a certain cell organelle known as the endoplasmic reticulum," he explains.

The cells then undergo immunogenic cell death, which only very few drugs can achieve."

Dr. Johannes Karges, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr-Universitaet-Bochum

Through this type of cell death, proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell nucleus are released to the outside and act as a strong warning signal to the immune system: Something is wrong here, these cells are harmful. This teaches the immune system to recognize the cancer cells as hostile and eliminate them throughout the body. This should also destroy metastases.

The two teams led by Johannes Karges and Carlos Plaza-Sirvent have successfully tested the active ingredient on cervical cancer cell lines. The next step is to package it in such a way that it accumulates specifically in cancer cells and is effective only there, and not in all cells of the body. Karges' research group has already developed various methods for this, for example, which active ingredients are activated by an external signal such as ultrasound or light.

"Complex processes are going on in the brain when we sleep," says Dr Karolina Armonaitė, a neuroscientist from Kaunas University of Technology, Lithuania. According to her, a more precise understanding of what happens in different areas of the cerebral cortex during sleep can help diagnose sleep disorders and neurological diseases more accurately.

"Schizophrenia, for example, is characterised by disrupted synchronisation between different areas, while Alzheimer's disease often starts with very subtle functional changes in one area of the cortex, even before symptoms become apparent," says Armonaitė, explaining the importance of research aimed at differentiating the functional areas of the cortex.

Functional cortex parcelling was the subject of Armonaitė's research during her PhD studies at the University of Uninettuno in Italy.

"The cerebral cortex is not homogeneous, and different areas can behave differently depending on whether a person is awake, asleep or in a state of transition between these stages. My study was aimed at determining whether we can identify cortical areas based solely on their electrical activity, not only in the absence of external stimuli, but also during different stages of sleep," explains the researcher from the KTU Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences.

A deeper understanding of how the brain works even when resting is important for the diagnosis and prevention of both neurological and sleep disorders, she says.

Research on the parcelling of the cerebral cortex dates to the early 20th century, when German neuroscientist Korbinian Brodmann defined 52 distinct areas of the human cerebral cortex, known as Brodmann areas. This map of the cerebral cortex is still widely used in both clinical practice and neuroscience research.

According to Dr Armonaitė, distinguishing between the cortex and other structures in the brain allows specific areas to be linked to specific functions, such as vision, language, motor skills or long-term memory storage. Knowing which areas are responsible for certain behavioural or sensory aspects can help to better understand how different neurological disorders affect these functions.

"For example, Parkinson's disease is often associated with degeneration of the substantia nigra, a structure in a deep area of the brain that is responsible for controlling movement. Damage to this area leads to typical symptoms of the disease, such as tremors or slowness of movement," says the researcher.

She explains that the precise identification of the affected area of the brain allows the planning of targeted interventions, such as neurostimulation, which has been successfully used to reduce the symptoms of the disease. "Another example is the identification of the epilepsy focus. Knowing which area of the brain is causing seizures and what functions it performs allows doctors to more precisely plan an intervention to remove the focal area and assess the potential risks and impact on the patient afterwards," says the researcher from KTU's Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences.

She explains that the distinction between brain regions is also important for building models of brain activity, for studying the effects of psychiatric diseases on different brain regions, or for understanding why certain symptoms occur in the presence of specific lesions.

"In addition, brain-computer interfaces also rely on precise localisation of neural activity," says Armonaitė.

The KTU researcher's study analysed intracranial electroencephalogram (sEEG) recordings from 55 patients. "These signals are taken directly from the brain rather than the scalp. Such data is extremely rare because it is only collected when patients undergo neurosurgical intervention, typically for drug-resistant epilepsy," explains Dr Armonaitė.

To understand whether different cortical areas transmit information differently and why, she started by analysing the neurophysiological signals from the most clearly defined areas - sensory, motor and auditory - whose functions have been studied most.

"We often hear about neurodegenerative disorders and the search for their biomarkers to make an early diagnosis. But the question that interested me the most was: how does the healthy brain function? And can we detect its activity markers while at rest? After all, even in the absence of external stimuli, the brain remains active. It's not just chaotic noise, but rather a lot of encoded information in the electrical signals transmitted between neurons," says Armonaitė.

The research has led to the discovery of computational methods that, according to the KTU researcher, make it possible to refine the parcelling of the brain cortex according to the electrical activity of different regions.

"Now it would be interesting to go even further - for example, to create models of brain activity based on certain features of these areas and apply them to detect very early abnormalities, such as incipient neurodegenerative processes. Also, the markers of healthy cortical areas of the brain, observed during sleep, could be compared with data from patients with sleep disorders," says Armonaitė.

Although the study does not yet have a direct clinical application, it opens many theoretical possibilities, says the KTU neuroscientist. For example, further research could lead to the creation of digital models of cortical areas, their digital twins. Knowing the cell structure, interactions and electrical parameters, it would be possible to simulate how such an area would react to, for example, electrical stimulation. "This could eventually contribute to the development of personalised neurological therapies," says Armonaitė.

One practical application of research on the human brain at rest could be the diagnosis of sleep disorders, she said. While most methods assess sleep in a rather generalised way, a detailed study of the activity of cortical areas could help to identify more precisely which areas of the brain function differently and why.

"This is relevant because sleep, although it may seem like a passive state, is a very dynamic process, involving consolidation of information, metabolic cleaning, and reorganisation of synapses," explains the researcher. "Subtle changes in neural activity during sleep may also indicate the onset of neurodegenerative processes."

If we know how a healthy cerebral cortex should behave in different states or functional tasks, she says, we can look for deviations from this normal pattern, which can help us detect the disease before it shows clear symptoms. In addition to early diagnosis and prevention, this would also contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of the diseases themselves.

A new study led by researchers from the University of Eastern Finland and a team of international collaborators shows that dengue outbreaks in Medellín, Colombia, are strongly linked to patterns of urban development and socioeconomic status. The findings highlight the potential of leveraging land-use planning and targeted public health strategies to more effectively control dengue in hyperendemic areas.

By analyzing more than 40,000 georeferenced dengue cases recorded between 2010 and 2020, the study found that just 26% of the city's neighbourhoods accounted for 50% of all infections. These "hotspot" areas were predominantly located in low- and middle-income communities with built-up land cover. In contrast, neighborhoods with higher socioeconomic status and more green space experienced far fewer outbreaks.

What's striking is that many of these hotspots are not isolated incidents. Some neighborhoods were affected year after year - up to seven years in some cases."

Juliana Pérez-Pérez, Doctoral Researcher, study's lead author, University of Eastern Finland

Using spatial statistics across 249 barrios in Medellín, the research team identified both single-year and recurrent hotspots. These patterns varied depending on whether the year was classified as epidemic, non-epidemic or severe epidemic, but certain areas consistently appeared as high-risk zones.

Traditional dengue control programmes tend to apply the same measures across entire cities, but the findings suggest a more strategic approach is needed. By combining epidemiological surveillance with insights from land use and urban planning, public health interventions can be more targeted and effective.

"Dengue is often seen as a challenge for the Global South, but the conditions that favour its spread - urbanisation, social inequality and warming climate - are now increasingly present elsewhere too," Pérez-Pérez adds.

"This study shows that the spatial and social dynamics of dengue are not random. Recognizing how land use and socioeconomic status shape disease risk can help us not only target local responses in places like Medellín, but also prepare other regions, including parts of Europe, for what may soon become a growing public health challenge."

The study emphasizes the importance of integrating disciplines, such as public health, ecology, urban geography and spatial analysis, to better understand and respond to the spread of mosquito-borne diseases in urban environments.

A newly released study from Duke University's Pontzer Lab, housed in the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology in Trinity College of Arts & Sciences, looks at the correlations between economic development, daily energy expenditure and the rise in a country's obesity level. 

While many experts have offered that rising obesity rates are due to declining physical activity as societies become more industrialized, the findings show that people in wealthier countries expend just as much - or even more - energy daily. In an article recently published in PNAS, Duke researchers point instead to higher caloric intake as the primary driver, suggesting that diet rather than idleness plays the bigger role in the global obesity crisis.

Despite decades of trying to understand the root causes of the obesity crisis in economically developed countries, public health guidance remains stuck with uncertainty as to the relative importance of diet and physical activity. This large, international, collaborative effort allows us to test these competing ideas. It's clear that changes in diet, not reduced activity, are the main cause of obesity in the U.S. and other developed countries."

Herman Pontzer, Principal Investigator and Professor, Department of Evolutionary Anthropology, Duke University

The researchers analyzed thousands of measurements of daily energy expenditure, body fat percentage and body mass index (BMI) from adults aged 18 to 60 across 34 populations spanning six continents. The more than 4,200 adults included in the study came from a wide range of lifestyles and economies, including hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, farming and industrialized populations. To further categorize the level of industrialization, they also integrated data from the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) to incorporate measures of lifespan, prosperity and education. 

"While we saw a marginal decrease in total energy expenditure with economic development, differences in total energy expenditure explained only a fraction of the increase in body fat that accompanied development. This suggests that other factors, such as dietary changes, are driving the increases in body fat that we see with increasing economic development," says Amanda McGrosky, a Duke postdoctoral alumna and lead investigator for the study who is now an assistant professor of biology at Elon University.

The researchers hope the study helps clarify public health messaging and strategies to tackle the obesity crisis and explain that the findings do not mean that efforts to promote physical activity should be minimized. Instead, the data support an emerging consensus that both diet and exercise should be prioritized. "Diet and physical activity should be viewed as essential and complementary, rather than interchangeable," the study notes. They will next work to identify which aspects of diet in developed countries are most responsible for the rise in obesity.

Soft tissue cytopathology plays a vital role in the diagnosis and management of soft tissue neoplasms, necessitating a standardized classification system to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide clinical decision-making. This article provides a concise review of the World Health Organization (WHO) Reporting System for Soft Tissue Cytopathology and presents a practical diagnostic approach to soft tissue cytopathology.

The WHO Reporting System is reviewed in conjunction with relevant literature. The reporting system employs a six-category framework: non-diagnostic, benign, atypical, soft tissue neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential, suspicious for malignancy, and malignant. Each category is associated with a corresponding risk of malignancy and recommended clinical management guidelines. This classification aligns with the WHO Classification of Soft Tissue and Bone Tumours (5th edition) and incorporates cytomorphologic features, ancillary studies, and clinical correlation to enhance diagnostic reproducibility and communication among pathologists and clinicians.

The system supports a probabilistic approach to risk stratification, enabling more consistent diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

This structured reporting system aligns with the WHO Classification of Soft Tissue and Bone Tumours (5th edition), ensuring that cytopathological findings are reproducible, clinically actionable, and globally applicable. The approach integrates cytomorphological features, ancillary testing, and clinical correlation, emphasizing a probabilistic framework for risk stratification and decision-making. By providing clear diagnostic criteria, this system enables pathologists to contribute effectively to multidisciplinary patient management. Furthermore, advancements in molecular diagnostics, ICC, and NGS are expected to enhance the accuracy and specificity of FNAB-based diagnoses, reinforcing the role of cytopathology in the evaluation of soft tissue tumors.

A limitation of this publication is that it applies primarily to FNAB and can be extended to CNB; however, its relevance to touch imprint of soft tissue remains unclear. Given the increasing trend of obtaining CNBs of soft tissue lesions with rapid on-site evaluation for cellularity via touch imprint cytology, it would be valuable to determine whether this approach is also applicable in this context. Additionally, it is important to assess whether the clinical team supports this reporting system, as they are the primary end users with whom communication is intended. It will be interesting to examine the broader impact of this reporting system and explore its correlation with the upcoming 6th edition of the WHO Classification of Soft Tissue and Bone Tumours in the near future.

The hope is that by following this structured reporting format, the WHO Reporting System for Soft Tissue Cytopathology will ensure FNAB diagnoses are clear, reproducible, and clinically actionable. The integration of cytomorphological features, ROM assessment, ancillary testing, and clinical correlation will enhance the diagnostic accuracy of soft tissue FNAB and facilitate appropriate patient management. This standardized approach aligns with modern risk-based classification models and will improve communication among pathologists, radiologists, and oncologists, also ensure patient safety and high quality care.

It is important that the readers of this article refer to the exact wording and specific details related to the definition for each diagnostic category, risk of malignancy (ROM), and management recommendations as provided in the WHO Reporting System for Soft Tissue Cytopathology. The explanatory content in this review article has been adapted based on the author's interpretation of the forthcoming book.

The use of social media is contributing to declining attention spans, emotional volatility, and compulsive behaviors among young people, reveals a new report by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) and Singapore-based research agency Research Network, in collaboration with US-based AI platform ListenLabs.ai.

The study, conducted across Singapore and Australia, surveyed 583 young people aged 13 to 25, and their parents.

It found that prolonged social media use is associated with difficulties in sustaining focus, increased emotional fatigue, and behaviors resembling addiction.

This research comes at a time when policymakers across the United States and Europe are scrutinising the broader effects of social media on public health and national security, especially in relation to platforms such as TikTok.

Lead investigator of the study, Professor Gemma Calvert, a neuroscientist from the Nanyang Centre for Marketing Technologies (NCMT) at NTU Singapore's Nanyang Business School said: "With global discussions about the impact of platforms like TikTok happening now, our findings provide crucial evidence of the real-world effects on young minds.

"The challenges revealed in our study are not just individual issues but societal concerns that warrant attention from everyone, including policymakers, educators and tech companies".

The study found that 68 per cent of youth participants reported difficulty focusing, while many described struggling to complete schoolwork or engage with content lasting more than a minute. One teen said: "TikTok has made my attention span so low that I can't even watch a one-minute video."

"The brain is being trained to seek constant novelty and instant rewards through dopamine-driven feedback loops," explained Prof Calvert. "Over time, this reduces our ability to focus or engage in deep thinking. It mirrors patterns seen in addiction, where more stimulation is needed to feel satisfied."

The findings provide crucial subjective experience data, complementing earlier brain imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which shows that social media triggers the brain's dopamine reward system in ways that mimic addiction.

Comparative results between Singapore and Australia also revealed distinct differences in opinions: Singaporean youth credited in-school phone restrictions by the Ministry of Education for curbing compulsive use, while many Australian teens expressed concern over the lack of similar boundaries or guidance.

It's time for the platforms and device makers who built the attention economy to take responsibility for redesigning it with user well-being at the core. We must move beyond cosmetic features like screen-time limits that are easily bypassed and stop designing to monetise attention. It's time to design to restore it, especially for the generation born into the scroll."

Mr. James Breeze, Chief Executive of Research Network and co-author of the report

"We need default-on safeguards embedded in social platforms, such as scroll breaks, time-use cues, social comparison prompts, and attention-aware interface design, to help young users pause, reflect, and choose more intentionally. These aren't constraints, they are ways to return attention to its rightful owner.

"The science exists, but what's missing is the will to act, through leadership or regulation. We must design for awareness, not dependence, so young people can reclaim their focus in a system that profits from distraction," added Mr. Breeze, who is also an educator and behavioural researcher.

The study reflects NTU Singapore's global strengths in artificial intelligence, data science, and the social sciences. Ranked 1st in Asia and 5th globally for Data Science & AI by QS, NTU adopts an interdisciplinary approach to applying AI across education, research, and innovation to develop solutions for the complex challenges facing society today.

The study was conducted using ListenLabs.ai, an AI-powered interviewing platform backed by Sequoia Capital, the venture firm behind companies such as Apple and Google.

Unlike traditional surveys, this approach enabled natural, voice-recorded responses to text-based prompts, resulting in richer and more authentic insights.

In just two days, the research team gathered and analysed anonymized, open-ended responses from a diverse participant base.

Using AI to detect emotional tone and behavioral patterns, the platform generated deep insights into emerging social trends, turning the usual six months of manual analysis into just two days.

Key findings from the study include:

The research was inspired by Miss Ella Carnegie-Brown, a 19-year-old intern at Research Network, who observed growing concern among her peers about their compulsive social media habits, which were increasingly affecting their studies and real-life social connections.

"As a Gen Z-er myself, I believe it's vital to raise awareness and deepen our understanding of how social media is not only shaping our daily lives, but also influencing our futures," said Miss Carnegie-Brown, who added that the study gave her generation "a voice to express the emotional toll" and "the uncertainty" they feel.

The full study will be made available soon to education policymakers, schools, and technology stakeholders in both Singapore and Australia, with plans underway for follow-up research to track attention and emotional health trends across a longer period.

Tropical cyclones in Madagascar lead to sharp spikes in malaria infections – particularly in children – due to interruptions in control efforts, according to a new study. However, the findings show that newly introduced long-lasting vaccines can help to mitigate these gaps.

This points to pathways to climate-resilient control strategies in malaria-prone regions. Malaria, already a persistent global health challenge, poses new threats from climate change, not only through rising temperatures that shift mosquito dynamics but also via extreme weather events like tropical cyclones. Such disasters can severely disrupt public health infrastructure, limit access to malaria prevention and treatment, and increase infection risk, especially in high-burden regions where continuity of care and malaria control is critical. However, despite concerns, data on how climate-related disruptions affect malaria control remain scarce. Madagascar – a country with a high malaria burden – is increasingly exposed to the effects of climate change, particularly through the growing frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, which have repeatedly triggered severe damage to healthcare infrastructure.

Using a longitudinal cohort study of 500 households in Madagascar's Mananjary district, Benjamin Rice and colleagues analyzed 20,718 observations of malaria infection before and after cyclones Batsirai (2022) and Freddy (2023). This allowed the authors to evaluate how well various malaria interventions performed given the strain of extreme weather events. According to the findings, tropical cyclones in Madagascar significantly elevate the risk of malaria infection and reinfection by disrupting essential public health interventions, including malaria prevention and treatment programs. In the months following cyclones, malaria infection surged, particularly in children: up to half of school-age children and over a third of younger children were infected in high-transmission areas. By modeling various control strategies, the authors found that the recently introduced malaria vaccines, which offer up to 10 months of protection, could significantly reduce symptomatic infections and help sustain malaria infection control during climate-related intervention gaps.

Despite this, Rice et al. note that malaria vaccines alone are insufficient to stop transmission, adding that layered strategies combining vaccines, drug-based prevention, and traditional tools like bed nets are essential, especially in high-transmission areas where malaria remains persistent.

Julie Rovner KFF Health News  @jrovner  @julierovner.bsky.social

Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent and host of KFF Health News' weekly health policy news podcast, "What the Health?" A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book "Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z," now in its third edition.

The Senate has passed — and sent back to the House — a bill that would allow the Trump administration to claw back some $9 billion in previously approved funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting. But first, senators removed from the bill a request to cut funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, President George W. Bush's international AIDS/HIV program. The House has until Friday to approve the bill, or else the funding remains in place.

Meanwhile, a federal appeals court has ruled that West Virginia can ban the abortion pill mifepristone despite its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. If the ruling is upheld by the Supreme Court, it could allow states to limit access to other FDA-approved drugs.

This week's panelists are Julie Rovner of KFF Health News, Joanne Kenen of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Politico Magazine, Shefali Luthra of The 19th, and Sandhya Raman of CQ Roll Call.

Among the takeaways from this week's episode:

Plus, for "extra credit" the panelists suggest health policy stories they read this week that they think you should read, too: 

Julie Rovner: The New York Times' "UnitedHealth's Campaign to Quiet Critics," by David Enrich.

Joanne Kenen: The New Yorker's "Can A.I. Find Cures for Untreatable Diseases — Using Drugs We Already Have?" by Dhruv Khullar.

Shefali Luthra: The New York Times' "Trump Official Accused PEPFAR of Funding Abortions in Russia. It Wasn't True," by Apoorva Mandavilli.

Sandhya Raman: The Nation's "'We're Creating Miscarriages With Medicine': Abortion Lessons from Sweden," by Cecilia Nowell.

If the U.S. men's national team wants to start filling stadiums across the country in the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, it has to start winning more games under head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

At least, that's what American soccer legend and former USMNT striker Clint Dempsey had to say to The Associated Press after the recent 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, where the USMNT played in front of packed buildings of Guatemalan and Mexican fans, on American soil. 

“We were outnumbered in the games that mattered in terms of the semifinal and then final. There were more fans for the opposing team. So it's up to the national team players to put a product on the field that makes people want to go spend their hard-earned money,” Dempsey said, tipping the team was also missing some key players, including Christian Pulisic, who opted for rest over national team duty. 

“I want to see a team that is playing in an exciting style, whether it's defending well, building out of the back, getting forward, creating chances, getting goals...I just want to see the fight and the grit that we saw in the Gold Cup, just with more quality. That's what I'm looking forward to, that team that gets you believing again that they can go and win games against top competition.”

While the U.S. made a run to the final with wins against Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, Guatemala and Costa Rica, few of their games came with ample home support. Yet, they did get intense American-favoring crowds in Connecticut at two pre-tournament friendlies, where they fell to Switzerland and Türkiye. 

Despite the missing pieces, the USMNT showed a grit and desire unparalleled in recent months, with the play and effort of Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna drawing comparisons to Dempsey's days.

Even though the USMNT finished short of a trophy for the second time in 2025, after previously crashing out of the Concacaf Nations League semifinals to Panama, the Gold Cup effort offered a substantial refresh after a disappointing group stage exit under their previous head coach, Gregg Berhalter, at the 2024 Copa América. 

“There wasn't that big mix of a lot of older players kind of passing down lessons that they learned over the years," Dempsey added. "Sometimes it's one of those situations where you need someone to shake things up, right? You don't know if it's egos. You don't know what is the reason for why things don't work out. So I think after Copa América, after Nations League, there definitely needed to be some things shook up.”

The USMNT will not have the chance to play a competitive game before next year's World Cup, but could play up to 10 friendlies, with four scheduled in September and October against South Korea, Japan, Colombia and Ecuador. 

Those opponents, although not among the world's elite teams, will provide the USMNT with intense preparation for the tournament, as they, along with co-hosts Canada and Mexico, will be in Pot 1 of the draw, avoiding at least the Top 10-ranked sides in the world. 

While the USMNT's opponents have often drawn on strong expat communities to create hostile atmospheres at home games, the prices of tickets from U.S. Soccer, Concacaf, and other match organizers have also priced out many casual supporters, sometimes leaving empty stands as well.. 

At the upcoming friendlies, however, the tickets are priced lower. The cheapest tickets to the match against Ecuador start at $43.50. Meanwhile, the American Outlaws Supporters' Group has reached a deal with U.S. Soccer to make the games more affordable for the most dedicated fans. 

“We've always believed soccer should be for everyone,” said Justin Brunken, co-founder of American Outlaws. “This partnership with U.S. Soccer helps eliminate one of the biggest barriers - cost - and makes it possible for more passionate fans to stand, sing, and support together.”

Manchester City have reportedly been approached by Galatasaray with a €3 million (£2.6m/$3.5m) offer for goalkeeper Ederson as the Turkish giants are interested in luring the experienced Brazilian away from the Etihad. The Super Lig title holders believe Ederson is the right fit as they are searching for a long-term successor to Fernando Muslera.

The U.S. men's national team could get a boost ahead of the 2025–26 European season, as striker Ricardo Pepi announced that he is nearing a return to the pitch at PSV, after suffering an injury in January. 

While the USMNT opted for a mix of former Charlotte FC striker, now Derby County player Patrick Agyemang and Vancouver Whitecaps FC's Brian White at the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, Pepi's return gives them a stronger option in the leadup to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

Pepi, 22, scored in a 3–2 win over Liverpool in the UEFA Champions League on Jan. 29, but had to leave the match in the 76th minute after suffering an injury. Since then, he has undergone meniscus surgery and rehabilitation, with the goal of being on the pitch for the start of the new campaign. 

“It's amazing. I've been waiting for the past five months and now I am back on the pitch with the team,” Pepi told ESPN. “I think I am really close [to being back] I think about, almost close to 100%, doing the last little steps and then I will be back.

“It's one of those things where you are just super impatient to get back to the field, it's super important to take the right steps because you cannot rush an injury. It's about when your body feels ready to be back, and now I am very close to being back and super excited to get this season going.”

Earlier in the week, Pepi also switched his kit number to No. 9, taking it from Luuk de Jong, who looks set to leave the Dutch side for Rangers in the Scottish Premier League. Meanwhile, new striker signing Alassane Pléa will take Pepi's former No. 14 and provide internal competition up top.

“It's a privilege. Many legends have worn this number at PSV. I'm taking on the challenge of writing my own history," Pepi told ESPN. "I think [competition] is a good thing. There should always be competition. It keeps you sharp and that makes you a better player.”

Yet, most of the focus will be on Pepi's return and elevated role within the squad, as he looks to build on his 16 goals in all competitions and help fill the leadership void left by De Jong. 

Meanwhile, he will also hope to translate his form into the national team picture in the leadup to the 2026 World Cup, having last represented the Stars and Stripes on Nov. 18, 2024, in a 4–2 Concacaf Nations League quarterfinal win against Jamaica. 

The earliest Pepi could return to competitive league action would be Aug. 9 against Sparta Rotterdam, as PSV open their Eredivisie campaign with hopes of defending their title, while his USMNT return could come as soon as the September international window, where head coach Mauricio Pochettino's side will face South Korea and Japan.

The forward scored more Premier League goals last season than any United player since Robin van Persie 12 years ago - but he has not come cheap

For each of the last four summers, Manchester United have invested large amounts of money in a well-renowned forward from a European league, only to watch them struggle to adapt to the Premier League.

Jadon Sancho was a scoring and assisting machine for Borussia Dortmund, and his 120 goal involvements in 158 games seemed to justify his £74 million ($101m) price tag when United signed him in 2021. And yet in his two seasons at Old Trafford he scored just 12 goals and set up six before being banished from the squad for lashing out at Erik ten Hag on social media. Sancho showed signs of his Bundesliga self when returning to Dortmund on loan, but a further spell at Chelsea back in the Premier League was so unsatisfactory that the Blues preferred to pay a £5m penalty clause than sign him permanently.

Antony was regarded as one of the best young forwards in Europe in 2022, posting 0.56 goals or assists per game with Ajax, and Barcelona considered him their main alternative to signing Raphinha. United paid £85m ($99m) to sign the Brazilian, but after a blistering start of three goals in his first three games, he went on to score only nine in his next 93.

It wasn't just his lack of productivity that meant Antony went down as a failed transfer, either. He did next to nothing in games beyond cutting inside on to his left foot and either missing the target or being swiftly dispossessed, yet once he joined Real Betis on loan, he became an icon in Seville as he scored as many goals in half a season in La Liga as he had in two-and-a-half in England.

The same pattern was repeated with Rasmus Hojlund in 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee in 2024. The strikers had scored a combined 20 goals in their final seasons in Serie A, but last season with United netted a combined seven league goals. But by finally signing Bryan Mbeumo after a long transfer saga, United have shown they are finally learning from their mistakes. There is just one problem with the deal: the price.

There have been plenty of football x fashion collabs that hit the nail on the head in recent times, but Chelsea's OVO collection felt wide off the mark

I've been writing about football teams' attempts to make inroads into the fashion industry for many years now.

What began as isolated collaborations, mainly between major clubs and prestigious fashion houses (such as Dior and PSG), has now evolved into a more varied landscape and the tactics used by teams to align themselves with the world of fashion have become a little more nuanced.

Arsenal, for example, worked with London-based menswear label Labrum to design its away kit last season, and even let the brand borrow the Emirates Stadium (and Declan Rice) for its London Fashion Week show.

FC Barcelona has increasingly used its connection to the music industry's biggest stars (Travis Scott, Rosalía, The Rolling Stones, etc.), thanks to its Spotify partnership, to merge its star appeal with one-off jerseys and fashion collection designs around the El Clásico each season. (You can read more about that specific partnership here in an exclusive interview with Marc Hazan, Spotify's global VP, marketing and partnerships.)

These are isolated incidents where teams and brands have done a good job in fusing the two worlds which not so long ago were considered completely alien to one another.

But naturally, we have reached a point of market saturation.

The issue is that more often than not, collaborations between football teams and fashion/streetwear brands these days are ubiquitous and therefore easily forgettable at best, and at times borderline offensive to both football and fashion fans on either side of the divide.

Let's take a recent example which rubbed people up the wrong way: Chelsea's recent collaboration with Drake's OVO merch line (fashion label would be too generous a descriptor). A full lifestyle collection. When it launched earlier this week, it raised many questions: What was it for? Who was it for? Why with Drake? When was the last time OVO was relevant in any cultural or fashion context?

For these crossovers to have any cultural or commercial impact whatsoever, authenticity is essential. Fans were left wondering what, if anything, was authentic about this collaboration.

First off, Drake is someone who has been seen repping the jersey of just about every single major football team out there over the years, with little clear connection to Chelsea in particular, save for a hangout with Didier Drogba and co. back in the day.

Similarly, British rapper Central Cee (who fronts the collection with an OVO owl on his shoulder) is also someone who has admitted he doesn't care about football and has been seen wearing every shirt from Chelsea to PSG to Brazil.

According to the caption under OVO and Chelsea's IG post, the collection is “rooted in legacy”. What legacy that is, remains to be seen.

Chelsea is a team with huge cultural sway and with serious footballing momentum off the back of the team's Club World Cup victory and Conference League victory months before. As a London-based powerhouse, it has the resources and ability to make partnerships in the fashion world that actually make sense and have a cultural impact. (A Chelsea partnership with Burberry, for example, could generate some real buzz.)

But the OVO collaboration outlines something I always point to when asked about this topic: to operate successfully in the world of fashion as a sports team or organisation of any kind, you need to hire people with real experience from the industry.

Look at the inroads made by the NFL (not long ago one of the least fashion forward sporting organisations ever, but now a cultural powerhouse) thanks to its hiring and promotion of Kyle Smith, its very own in-house fashion editor, who has helped the league align itself and its star players with the highest echelons of the fashion industry.

The same goes for the other side. The fashion brands that have built the most effective sports partnerships are those that have hired people with a dedicated focus on the industry instead of loosely delegating as an extension of their general marketing function. (Read my recent piece on Louis Vuitton's winning sports strategy here.)

Having institutional know-how means teams are better suited to navigate the complexities of the fashion industry (the network of brands, PR agencies, retailers, federations, fashion week calendars) and helps them understand what is relevant and which opportunities make the most sense from both a cultural and commercial standpoint.

It's the difference between waiting to broker a partnership with cultural impact and rushing into a collaboration with a brand that hasn't been relevant in a fashion context (OVO) since long before the pandemic/maybe ever. (People have pointed out that it's also just an odd choice by virtue of the battering Drake has taken in general culture over the past year or so.)

Sure, some people will buy the gear, and no doubt that the club and the brand will find a way to claim the collection is “sold out,” but teams need to question: what is the actual point? Will people remember this in a year or even six months? Unlikely.

It raises another point about the current football (and general sports) merch market at the moment. Given that we are in an era in which people and companies supposedly care about sustainability, why are we putting out so much stuff?

Take PSG, for example (a team that I've praised in the past for its sharp eye in culture and fashion, but not today). Ahead of the Club World Cup in June, they announced the club was “taking over Los Angeles with the PSG House on Melrose, a dynamic pop-up experience celebrating the intersection of football, fashion, and culture, designed with the US market in mind.”

To fill this pop-up, the club announced “a series of high-impact collaborations with global icons in music, art, sport, and design.”

By a series, they meant EIGHT different “headline” collaborations which were released and went on sale at PSG House, including co-branded products with PSG shareholder and NBA star Kevin Durant, J. Cole's Dreamville record label, Jimmy Butler's Big Face Coffee brand, and several, several others. Earlier that month, the club also teamed up with The Weeknd to release a jersey and special collection (no idea why).

Again, this was clearly a strategic play to tap the club's North American fanbase, but I still feel prioritising quality over quantity has to be the way forward here. The reason why Arsenal's collaboration with Labrum worked so well was that it was genuinely authentic. It was rooted in celebrating the team's longstanding relationship with players of the West African diaspora, which is also a driving force behind the brand itself.

It also built on years of steady collaboration between Labrum and Arsenal's kit manufacturer, Adidas (club legend Ian Wright had walked in a Labrum fashion week show a year prior). The designer behind the brand, Foday, is also a genuine lifelong Arsenal fan. It was simple, effective and with good product to back it up that people will wear and treasure for years to come.

These are the collaborations that create cultural artefacts, not just clothes that will end up in landfill sites in years to come. The market reaction to the Chelsea x OVO collection was a sign of things to come.

Fans know when they are being sold stuff for the sake of it, and are getting bolder at calling things out they perceive to be cash grabs.

Football is a beautiful sport with deep cultural heritage and decades of history which inspires myriad creative projects. Teams need to do better and think smarter when it comes to their fashion strategies.

As a former college mathematics major, Pellegrino Matarazzo could tell you a thing or two about chaos theory — the unpredictable nature of things. Or he could just refer to his last 18 months in football.

During that time, the 47-year-old was sacked as manager of Bundesliga side Hoffenheim despite saving them from relegation and then guiding them into the Europa League.

Next he was interviewed for the USMNT head coach role before the gig eventually went to Mauricio Pochettino. So, instead, he spent time observing Claudio Ranieri's work at close quarters as the veteran Italian became Roma's third manager of a turbulent campaign, steering them to a fifth-place finish.

That's why, of all his attributes, Matarazzo thinks one in particular makes him especially suited to a job in the dugout. It's not speaking four languages, or the resilience which helped him break barriers as an American coach in Europe at Stuttgart and then fellow Germans Hoffenheim.

“I've always been someone who's able to deal with chaos very well,” he says. “Because I have the ability to focus on what's important. I stay structured and remain focused and factual.”

In other words — he can handle the heat, and is happiest in the kitchen.

Matarazzo has just returned to his home in Germany, having spent the last month working as an analyst for host broadcaster DAZN at the Club World Cup. It was the first time he had taken on such a role.

“It was something different,” the New Jersey-born son of Italian immigrants says of being on TV. “It really pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me valuable insights into the entertainment side of the game, which I hadn't been exposed to in the same way during my career.”

But, while watching games at FIFA's revamped and greatly expanded club tournament from a television studio, Matarazzo was also expanding his knowledge of the game beyond Europe, where he has coached since retiring as a player at German side Nurnberg in 2010.

As Brazilian teams reached the quarter-finals (Palmeiras) and semis (Fluminense), he was impressed.

“The aggression, the passion and the physicality of South American football was striking — in many cases surpassing that of the European game,” he says. “Certainly part of it was driven by players' motives and their need to prove their value on an international stage. But the Brazilian teams in particular, they played with a complete brand of football which I value highly: very pragmatic, disciplined, organised.

“It's completely contrary to the old stereotype of Brazilian football, which was usually about flair, technical ability and creativity. What I saw were teams playing with a very well-rounded approach — defensively sound, and very successful.”

For a coach who admits he would love to work in the Premier League, Matarazzo also noted how eventual winners Chelsea are quickly developing from big-spending also-rans into a potentially dominant force in the game once again.

“They grew within the tournament,” he says. “I was watching them in the first couple of games, and there was still a lot of sand in their engine. But that final was spectacular, and Cole Palmer was outstanding.

“The key is Joao Pedro (the Brazilian forward signed from fellow Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion partway through the competition). I'm a fan of (another new option for Chelsea up front Liam) Delap, don't get me wrong, but he's a different profile. I think Palmer becomes more creative with Joao Pedro in there, too.

“It's just a great team and when I see (Moises) Caicedo, how he plays… oh man. This guy is amazing. If I had a dream team, Caicedo would definitely be a part of that. For me, he will be the best No 6 in the world.

“They (Chelsea) can defend deep, they can defend in a high press, as a low-block high press. They're flexible in their defensive structure. They conceded very few chances (in the final) against Paris Saint-Germain.

“One of the critical things I was seeing in the first few games is that they can now break down low blocks. That's why, with this extra element of Joao Pedro coming in, plus the other players that they already had in their roster, I think it's going to be fun to watch in the upcoming season.

“They could win the Premier League.”

Matarazzo's enthusiasm for the club game is so palpable you suspect it will not be long before he returns to management.

For now, he prefers to stay in Europe, having turned down offers from MLS sides, but in different circumstances he could have spent this summer guiding the USMNT through their Concacaf Gold Cup participation. As a candidate under consideration, he held talks with U.S. Soccer in 2024 before the federation ultimately opted for Pochettino's greater star-factor.

“I did truly appreciate the great conversations we had,” he says. “They (U.S. Soccer) were very, very thoughtful, well-structured, professional, and I'm sure Pochettino is an excellent choice. He's an established coach with tremendous international experience at club level. And if you're just two years short of a run-up to a home World Cup, then it's important to energise the U.S. soccer landscape emotionally. So that's something a big name like Pochettino can absolutely do.”

But what does he think of the task facing the Argentine after a summer when key senior players, most notably Christian Pulisic, withdrew from the roster to prioritise rest after busy seasons with their clubs.

“We're just beginning to see the results of the work being done,” Matarazzo says. “It's positive. Reaching the final of the Gold Cup with several key players missing was a significant achievement for Pochettino, that's my opinion. It's a result that will earn him both respect and credibility within the U.S. soccer landscape moving forward.

“Think about it. I felt like, in this tournament, it was the first time you felt real progress was made in establishing a culture, an identity, which built around what we in Germany call the basics of football; when you speak about work ethic, intensity, a team-first mindset and when you get those basics down, then you can grow a programme.”

Some will wonder whether, with less than a year to go before the World Cup and no signature victories yet under Pochettino against any of world football's big beasts, the USMNT can reach the level required to succeed in the tournament their homeland will co-host with Canada and Mexico and shift the dial on football's status in North America.

“Let's put it this way, my feeling is we're cutting it close,” says Matarazzo. “And I think the next big step will be to reintegrate those key players in the next phase of development.

“There were a lot of starters missing. The loss to Mexico in the final was not a question of mentality; it was a question of quality. Mentality might get you out of the group phase in the World Cup, but if you want to make a deep run in the tournament, you need overall better quality on the pitch.

“So I think that's the key in the next phase this fall: reintegrating those key players and just growing that cohesiveness moving towards the World Cup.

“It's important to not underestimate momentum. So if there's growth happening in this next coming year and if the players feel it and you take that momentum into the tournament, then it can be successful.”

Matarazzo feels that new Bayer Leverkusen signing Malik Tillman and Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna took their chances to impress at the Gold Cup: “They were given a platform, and they performed. And that not only gives Pochettino more options going forward, but it creates healthy competition. That's an important message — the most important take-away from this tournament is that nobody is irreplaceable. That will lead to more focus, higher performance from all the players in the upcoming camps.”

Matarazzo will be watching Tillman's progress back at club level in Germany with interest. The midfielder came through Greuther Furth's academy before moving to Bayern Munich, and later PSV of the Netherlands, before joining Leverkusen earlier this month in a €35million (£30m; $41m) move.

He wanted to sign the then teenager to play under him in Nurnberg's B team before the German-American dual national headed to Bayern.

“He's strong, he's got a good shot, he is game-intelligent,” Matarazzo says of the 23-year-old. “Malik sees slots opening to play the ball deep. He could be more consistent in his output, and if he is, then he would be a top player.”

So with Tillman and Luna in mind, how does Pochettino go about reintegrating players such as Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Folarin Balogun while retaining the emphasis on that ‘team-first' idea?

“It's a tough dynamic, but which dynamic is not tough in football?,” says Matarazzo. “Let's be honest, the job is so complex.

“Like I said before, if you have something in place that you want to see, and the players coming into that culture already feel the energy in the group, it's easier for them to adapt. And you need open, constructive communication with the player camp and the player himself.”

In this, he speaks from experience.

Matarazzo is still smarting from the nature of his sacking by Hoffenheim in November. His time there, he says, was “cut short in a way that was not natural”. He had to contend with a total overhaul of the club's management structure after he had saved them from relegation after being appointed in February 2023 and then delivered qualification for the Europa League a year later, with the CEO and sporting director who had hired him both being fired during the following pre-season.

Then came a chaotic period with a void at the top, until a new executive team was installed.

“I belonged to the old leadership,” he says. “So I was not looked favourably upon — there were people within the club who were very happy to see me go. So it was just a difficult situation; keeping the players in balance, protecting myself from invisible attacks and just a lot of volatility and chaos in the club.

“And listen, I coached at Stuttgart for almost three years. So I've been part of emotional clubs and we also had a change of leadership at Stuttgart when Thomas Hitzlsperger stopped in 2022 (the former Germany midfielder left his role as CEO). I was working there, and then Alex Wehrle came in, so I knew what that feels like but that situation felt natural — this was not natural.”

The club's Croatian forward Andrej Kramaric went public, rebuking any suggestions the players were not behind Matarazzo. But the head coach had less and less influence on recruitment and, despite being open with the new board about the approach from U.S. Soccer to hold talks, the news was leaked to the German media.

He began to feel like he was on borrowed time with the board.

“Now I'm going to say something clichéd: What doesn't break us, makes us stronger,” Matarazzo adds. “But I don't have to get into details anymore because it's in the past and I've already reflected on my time there.

“I'm ready for the next step.”

He has no shortage of learnings to reflect on before that next step from his time observing Ranieri and more recently successor Gian Piero Gasperini at Roma. He can turn, too, to a room-mate from his coaching-course days — former Hoffenheim, RB Leipzig and Bayern manager and current German national team boss Julian Nagelsmann.

“I've known Julian for a long time,” he says. “We were opponents at under-19 club level. We completed our pro licence together and he brought me onto his coaching staff midway through the season (at Hoffenheim in 2017).

“He's a sharp thinker, he has a clear vision. I took a lot from our experiences together, not just tactically but in terms of leadership, communication. I can take inspiration from him, from Gasperini and, of course, from Claudio.”

He admits also to admiring Roberto De Zerbi's tactics in the Premier League at Brighton in recent seasons but his ultimate inspiration, when it comes to hard work and perseverance, is familial.

“My mom and dad came to the United States with nothing,” says Matarazzo. “They were from a long line of Italian farmers. My father was an auto mechanic and my mom was working as a secretary.

“They put four kids through college (Matarazzo graduated from New York City's Columbia University). They gave us the tools we needed to be successful in this life. We're four brothers, and we all have the right head on our shoulders and we're doing good things because they (their parents) put so much into every day.

“My dad was working every day. My mom… what she was doing for the household and working at the same time was incredible.”

Matarazzo's accent is identifiably American but he can just as easily lapse into a German-English inflection. Still, he has had to deal with flickers of European prejudice against American coaches in the sport.

“A foreign coach is more readily accepted into any football culture if they come with a proven track record and if they can speak the native language,” he says. “But I do think that one of the challenges I've seen is there's still a certain degree of scepticism about whether someone from the U.S. truly understands the game and can perform at the highest level.

“I often ask myself, why do most (football) commentators and analysts in the U.S. still have English or Spanish accents? It tells you something about perception, and there's certainly been a shift in a positive direction since I first arrived in Europe 25 years ago. It's to do with the growth of MLS, and an increasing number of U.S. players that are making their mark overseas.

“But when it comes to American coaches and experts, I'd say we're still in the process of earning credibility, both abroad and within our own country.

“I took the approach of climbing the ranks from the ground up in another country. So it's like I immersed myself in that culture in the football environment and earned my place. But even that, it's still a completely cut-throat business and there are so many highly qualified coaches out of work all competing for the same opportunity. So it's definitely possible — I'm living proof of it — but it requires a lot of commitment and sacrifice.

“After Hoffenheim, I do feel I have unfinished work. There's still a curiosity within me, ‘How high can I go? What's my level as a coach?'.”

Matarazzo is ready to embrace the chaos once again.

As a former college mathematics major, Pellegrino Matarazzo could tell you a thing or two about chaos theory — the unpredictable nature of things. Or he could just refer to his last 18 months in football.

During that time, the 47-year-old was sacked as manager of Bundesliga side Hoffenheim despite saving them from relegation and then guiding them into the Europa League.

Next he was interviewed for the USMNT head coach role before the gig eventually went to Mauricio Pochettino. So, instead, he spent time observing Claudio Ranieri's work at close quarters as the veteran Italian became Roma's third manager of a turbulent campaign, steering them to a fifth-place finish.

That's why, of all his attributes, Matarazzo thinks one in particular makes him especially suited to a job in the dugout. It's not speaking four languages, or the resilience which helped him break barriers as an American coach in Europe at Stuttgart and then fellow Germans Hoffenheim.

“I've always been someone who's able to deal with chaos very well,” he says. “Because I have the ability to focus on what's important. I stay structured and remain focused and factual.”

In other words — he can handle the heat, and is happiest in the kitchen.

Matarazzo has just returned to his home in Germany, having spent the last month working as an analyst for host broadcaster DAZN at the Club World Cup. It was the first time he had taken on such a role.

“It was something different,” the New Jersey-born son of Italian immigrants says of being on TV. “It really pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me valuable insights into the entertainment side of the game, which I hadn't been exposed to in the same way during my career.”

But, while watching games at FIFA's revamped and greatly expanded club tournament from a television studio, Matarazzo was also expanding his knowledge of the game beyond Europe, where he has coached since retiring as a player at German side Nurnberg in 2010.

As Brazilian teams reached the quarter-finals (Palmeiras) and semis (Fluminense), he was impressed.

“The aggression, the passion and the physicality of South American football was striking — in many cases surpassing that of the European game,” he says. “Certainly part of it was driven by players' motives and their need to prove their value on an international stage. But the Brazilian teams in particular, they played with a complete brand of football which I value highly: very pragmatic, disciplined, organised.

“It's completely contrary to the old stereotype of Brazilian football, which was usually about flair, technical ability and creativity. What I saw were teams playing with a very well-rounded approach — defensively sound, and very successful.”

For a coach who admits he would love to work in the Premier League, Matarazzo also noted how eventual winners Chelsea are quickly developing from big-spending also-rans into a potentially dominant force in the game once again.

“They grew within the tournament,” he says. “I was watching them in the first couple of games, and there was still a lot of sand in their engine. But that final was spectacular, and Cole Palmer was outstanding.

“The key is Joao Pedro (the Brazilian forward signed from fellow Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion partway through the competition).

USMNT midfielder Malik Tillman talks to ESPN after confirming his switch from PSV to Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen. (1:59)

So, uh, 2025, huh?

If we put the U.S. men's national team on the same August-to-July calendar as club teams, it's been an incredibly disappointing year for the Americans.

It started out great! After flaming out of the Copa América, the USMNT got rid of the coach that most of the fans didn't want and replaced him with, theoretically, one of the best coaches in the world. Mauricio Pochettino is the kind of coach that USMNT supporters have been claiming the team deserved for a decade. He was also the kind of coach that people like me said they would never get.

He's overseen the rise of multiple, athletic, successful young teams in the Premier League. He managed the most dysfunctional collection of superstar attackers ever assembled with Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar at PSG. And overall, his teams have mostly done what all well-coached teams do: perform at a higher level than their collective talent suggests they should.

Well, until he got to the USMNT. Under Pochettino, the Americans struggled to create any chances against Panama in the Nations League semifinals. They played poorly in the we're-not-sure-how-much-this-matters third-place game against Canada. They got whupped by Turkey and Switzerland in a pair of pre-Gold Cup friendlies. And in the knockout rounds of the Gold Cup, they needed penalties to beat Costa Rica, conceded 20 shots to Guatemala, and were comprehensively outplayed by Mexico in the final.

Oh, and then there's the whole thing where Pochettino and Christian Pulisic might be in a feud. Really, it's unclear where anything stands with any of the players who didn't play at the Gold Cup.

However, since games are few and far between in international soccer, it's usually a good rule of thumb that things are never as good or as bad as they seem. Italy won Euro 2020 and then missed the 2022 men's World Cup. Argentina lost the opening game of the 2022 World Cup to Saudi Arabia and then won the 2022 World Cup.

So, for things to get better for the USMNT before they co-host the World Cup next summer, what needs to happen? Here is the USMNT's to-do list before the 2026 World Cup, ranked in the order of importance.

When asked about re-integrating all of the European players after the loss to Mexico, Pochettino was vague and a little irritated in his answer. Given the frustrating result -- and the performance, and the fact that English isn't his first language -- it's understandable that he wasn't able to offer up the most eloquent response in the moment.

That said, the manager of the USMNT basically has three jobs as far as I'm concerned. The first: figure out what achievable style of play gets the most talent on the field. The second: actually get said talent on the field. And the third: given the number of dual nationals in the USMNT pool, expand the talent pool whenever possible.

Now, it was fun to see a bunch of new faces get significant playing time this summer. And I don't deny that there was a different vibe with the team when it was filled with guys who felt like their USMNT futures were on the line with every match. But vibes can only get you so far.

In the three knockout-round matches at the Gold Cup, the USMNT put up the following top-line numbers:

• Non-penalty expected goals: 3.39
• Non-penalty expected goals allowed: 3.18
• Final-third possession: 44.4%
• Touches in the penalty area: 50
• Opponent touches in the penalty area: 72

This was against three teams whose average ranking in the World Football Elo ratings was 46th.

Granted, the USMNT are ranked 45th, so perhaps it makes sense that they ended up about even on chances created and conceded. But the expectations are obviously way higher than that for next summer. To get anywhere near them, Pochettino needs as much talent as he can fit on the roster.

The so-called "Golden Generation" of American soccer hasn't worked out as expected.

Pulisic had superstar potential and he's settled into more like a "Champions League starter" level at AC Milan. Same went for Gio Reyna and he's been a non-factor at any professional level for the past three years. Tyler Adams seemed like a potential Champions League-level holding midfielder and has become more like an average Premier League player. Tim Weah probably met expectations by becoming an off-the-bench contributor at Juventus. Weston McKennie met expectations by becoming something closer to a starter at Juve. Sergiño Dest moved to Barcelona when he was 19 -- now he's playing in the Eredivisie. Chris Richards was at Bayern Munich; now he's at Crystal Palace.

The only guy who significantly exceeded expectations was Antonee Robinson, who is genuinely one of the best left backs in the Premier League and would probably be moving to a much bigger club this summer if he were a couple years younger.

The main reason the USMNT isn't better is because most of these guys landed somewhere around their 50th-percentile career outcomes, or worse. There's a reality where Dest stays at Barcelona, Adams is killing it for Atlético Madrid, Reyna made a move to Bayern Munich, and Pulisic is starring opposite Mohamed Salah at Liverpool. Unfortunately, that's not the reality in which we live.

Stewart Robson believes the USMNT might struggle at next year's World Cup after its poor performance in the Gold Cup final.

Even accounting for the struggles under Pochettino, there's a different, primary reason to be bearish on the USMNT's chances for the upcoming World Cup, as compared to the last one in Qatar. Outside of Richards and Reyna, all of these guys played a lot in Qatar -- as did Yunus Musah.

Nine outfield players featured in at least 270 minutes of game time in 2022: two of them were 35-year-old Tim Ream and 29-year-old Walker Zimmerman, while the other seven were Pulisic, Weah, Adams, McKennie, Musah, Robinson and Dest.

Given the injury history of some of these dudes -- Pulisic, Adams, and Dest, in particular -- the player availability at the last World Cup was quite good. Given how many games these guys are playing in Europe and the general fallibility of the human body, I don't know if I'd count on as many of the stars being healthy enough to play next summer. But so long as everyone is back in the fold, this question is going to have the biggest bearing on how well the team performs next summer: Who is healthy enough to play?

Forget dads using ChatGPT to defend their sons. Never mind that time when the head coach said the phrase "I am not a mannequin." No, the strangest part of Pochettino's tenure thus far has to be the thing with Tim Weah's eye. Here's what Pochettino said back in November:

"We have all a dominant eye, no? And depending on your body shape, you feel comfortable or not, depending where is the line, what is the goal, what is your position when you receive the ball... Always, we try to check, because we need to understand the player."

The biggest change from Berhalter to Pochettino from a lineup standpoint was the shifting of Weah from right wing to left wing. Given that Weah is right-footed, this might seem like Pochettino opting for another winger who can cut in and shoot, as most top teams do these days. But he claims it's because of Weah's eyed-ness (?), not his footed-ness.

Either way, the change has affected the way the team plays. In Europe, Weah is much more of a wing back or defensive winger than a goal threat. He's scored eight goals in the last four domestic seasons combined. He's not really a player you want playing in front of the opposition defensive line. Instead, he stretches the field by staying wide and running behind a defense.

That's what he did under Berhalter when he played on the right, most notably against Wales in the opening match in Qatar.

Under Berhalter, Weah received 0.27 through balls per 90 minutes -- by far the most of any player who featured in at least 20 matches. Under Pochettino, the USMNT has completed 14 through balls -- and none of them have been to Weah.

Instead, six were to Patrick Agyemang. And that helps explain why Pochettino likes the new Derby County striker so much.

Agyemang's ability to run behind and battle for long balls does allow the U.S. to move the ball up the field, but he's still so below-par in front of goal and in possession that I really don't think it's worth it.

With a forward like Agyemang, you're limited in how you can actually play. You can't work more intricate buildup patterns or interchanging movements; you have to play long to Agyemang to move the ball up the field, which I think then makes his role in the team seem more important than it actually is.

Pochettino needs to figure out how to arrange his attackers in a way that lets the Americans stress opposition defenses horizontally and vertically while also allowing him to play a striker like Folarin Balogun, who will actually get shots and score goals against tougher opposition.

I have no clue how good Matt Turner is at stopping shots right now. What I do know is that when he was in MLS, he was one of the best shot-stoppers the league had ever seen.

What I also know is that none of the USMNT's other potential goalkeepers in MLS have come anywhere close to Turner's performance level in MLS. So, based on all of that, my outside assumption is that if Turner starts playing professional soccer again, he will be the team's clear best option in goal.

Matt Freese was fine at the Gold Cup. He was lights-out in the shootout against Costa Rica -- to the point where it wouldn't be a terrible idea to bring him to the World Cup as a break-in-case-of-penalties option like the Netherlands did with Tim Krul back in 2014. But in regular play, he looked quite shaky at times, even if it didn't result in too many extra goals being scored against the USMNT.

Tyler Adams and Malik Tillman speak after the USMNT's penalty shootout win vs. Costa Rica at the Gold Cup.

As for the other options -- Zack Steffen, Patrick Schulte -- we really just have no idea how well they'd perform in a jump up in level from MLS to the World Cup.

Given how much of a role goalkeepers play in whether or not shots turn into goals, there's an argument that they really are among the most valuable players on the field. They don't touch the ball much, but pretty much every time they do, it's a high-leverage moment. That's especially true in a limited-game tournament like the World Cup. A couple great saves can take you from "out of the group stages" to "into the quarterfinals."

It's just ... is Turner actually going to get playing time? He's expected to sign with Lyon -- if their financial situation gets sorted out -- and that's a massive, neon "if" that's visible from outer space. But Lyon already have a really solid young goalkeeper in Lucas Perri, who was fantastic in Brazil and above-average in Ligue 1 last season. Unless Perri is going to move to a new team, then I don't see how Turner signing with Lyon solves any of the problems Turner has had in England.

One of the USMNT's strengths at the last World Cup was the midfield. McKennie, Adams and Musah made up a complimentary trio that could outrun basically any other team in the tournament. These three players were a big reason why the U.S. was able to contest possession so well against England and also control so much of the ball against the Netherlands.

McKennie and Musah didn't play in this summer's Gold Cup, of course, but Adams did and I can't remember him ever looking worse in a USMNT shirt. After taking leads against both Costa Rica and Guatemala, the U.S. really should've been able to control the matches and suck the life out of the games. Instead, they hung on for dear life in both, and then they just couldn't hang against El Tri.

Now, it wasn't just Adams. Sebastian Berhalter's set-piece delivery led to a couple important goals for the Americans this summer, but he just doesn't impact the game enough otherwise. Luca de la Torre can be a nice complimentary player -- making the right runs, keeping possession, occupying the necessary spaces -- but he's more someone who will help you once you've controlled the game, rather than help you take control of it.

But Adams, really, was straight-up awful in possession. Per Stats Perform's expected-possession-value model, he actually decreased the USMNT's chances of scoring with his passing. He contributed a total of minus-0.09 xPV over the course of the tournament. No one else who played significant minutes was below 0.07.

On top of all that, Atlético Madrid-bound Johnny Cardoso barely played at the Gold Cup and really struggled against Turkey and Switzerland. Some other Europe-based players who have featured under Pochettino in the past -- Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris, Gianluca Busio -- weren't on the roster.

Perhaps there's a world where Reyna becomes a viable pro again, but he too missed the Gold Cup so he could play 12 total minutes at the Club World Cup. Malik Tillman emerged as an option -- both with his play this summer and his massive move to Bayer Leverkusen -- but he's more of a floating-between-the-lines tweener rather than a true midfielder.

The midfield three used to be one of the easiest parts of the starting 11 to predict, but now I only have a vague idea of who might be starting there come the next set of friendlies. There is plenty of talent here, though. And after all, these are the "problems" Pochettino is getting paid to figure out.

It's been a while, but Mike DeCourcy of The Sporting News, fresh off covering FIFA Club World Cup at Met Life Stadium earlier in the week, joins Pittsburgh Soccer Now‘s John Krysinsky on a new episode of Sounding Off on Soccer Podcast.

With the FIFA World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico less than one year away, Mike and John discuss the state of USMNT along with more on FIFA's Club World Cup while also looking forward to the World Cup being played at Met Life Stadium and nearby venues to Pittsburgh.

Then, somewhat shifting gears, John also tackles another column that Mike, a member of US Basketball Writers Hall of Fame, wrote about this week, which is one of the greatest debates that extends to all sports fans, Michael Jordan vs LeBron James.  Tying it into soccer — they discuss what is the equivalent debate of who's the greatest soccer player of our lifetime.

It was seen as a strong contender to host the 2030 World Cup final but a new report suggests the soon-to-be-historic Grand Stade Hassan II de Casablanca stadium will not stage the showpiece event. 

For the first time ever, three countries from two continents – Spain, Portugal and Morocco – will host the World Cup, while cities like Barcelona, Lisbon, Las Palmas, Madrid, Agadir, and Zaragoza are set to host matches.

Last year, Morocco launched plans to build the world's largest stadium, the Grand Stade Hassan II – a 115,000-capacity arena that will include 32 stairways, botanical gardens at ground level and a 100-hectare sports and leisure district.

The stadium will also feature three steep, compact tiers, accommodating 29,500 spectators at each end of the bowl. Additionally, five tiers of hospitality seats are also planned, including VIP and hospitality boxes that will cater up to 12,000 spectators.

Tarik Oualalou, who is the lead architect for the stadium, gave an insight into its design. 

 "[The design] is rooted in ancient and primordial figures: the Moussem, the tent, and the garden, as well as the topography and landscapes of Morocco," he said.

"It's a generous space, open to the world and respectful to the nature it protects. The Grand Stade Hassan II de Casablanca is the embodiment of the great tradition of Moroccan hospitality."

Work on the stadium is already underway in the Benslimane province just east of Casablanca, and back in May, it was reported that the stadium could host the World Cup final following its competition in late 2027.

But a report from Spanish publication Marca suggests the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabeu stadium is now expected to host the final after an agreement was reached between FIFA and Real Madrid.

"FIFA has never hidden its desire to see the final at Madrid's stadium," said the report.

"The final is a sure thing, but the federation needs to be smart. FIFA will open an office in Rabat after the summer, once Moroccan authorities have already approved the launch of a World Cup office in the capital."

The stadiums proposed to host the final were the Bernabeu, the Nou Camp and Morocco's Grand Stade Hassan II, but it appears FIFA have made their call.

While the FIFA 2026 World Cup is being touted as an economic boon for the City of Vancouver, it may not work out that way for some businesses close to the marquee venue.

That's according to a clause in the Host City Agreement, recently obtained and published by independent journalist Bob Mackin of The Breaker News after a three-year battle.

The contract requires the city to establish a “controlled area” located “directly adjacent to the outer stadium perimeter and in which certain commercial and other activities are prohibited on match days and the days prior to match days.”

The contract requires signage in the controlled area to be removed or covered, and restricts the public sale of food and beverages along with souvenirs, in order to protect the rights of FIFA's corporate partners.

That's potentially bad news for business owners like Ismet Yetisen, who runs the Boston Pizza on Beaty Street, right next door to BC Place.

Yetisen told Global News he'd been banking on the World Cup as a big opportunity for his restaurant.

“We want to make sure that we are opening every single day until 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 3 a.m. Not only for our guests that go in, but the guests that come out,” he said.

“My business is right next to one of the biggest stadiums in Canada. And obviously it brings a lot of income to me, but at the same time it brings lots of friends, and it brings out the people that eventually want to come back.”

Details about the size and scope of the controlled area remain unclear; the Host City Agreement calls for details about the area to be hammered out for each participating stadium individually.

But options will likely be limited in Vancouver's case, given the fact that BC Place is nestled in the heart of downtown Vancouver, rather than surrounded by large parking lots like some other North American venues.

“It makes sense to have an exclusionary zone, we are talking about a high-profile event. We have even learned in the City of Vancouver recently why security really matters, so that is really a no-brainer,” said Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim, referring to the recent Lapu Lapu Day festival vehicle ramming attack.

“We are very attuned to the fact that it will have some impact on businesses, and we get the opportunity to look ahead and work with the local businesses to turn this into an opportunity for them as well, but those conversations are going to be ongoing, and we are going to work through it.”

Other clauses in the agreement call for significant road closures in the area around BC Place, and for “host city beautification,” particularly near the stadium and the fan fest zone.

Yetisen, meanwhile, remains hopeful the city can come to an agreement with FIFA that won't see him and other nearby businesses shut out of what could be a golden opportunity.

“Hopefully it won't happen, because if it does happen, obviously it's not good,” he said.

The 2025 Wimbledon brought excitement to the tennis world with two new champions, Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek. As the grass court season comes to an end with massive surprises, fans can now look ahead to the final Grand Slam of the year, the US Open.
Before reaching the hard-court major in New York, players will need to compete in several crucial tournaments.

Here's a simple and clear look at what lies ahead for the players on the road to the US Open.

The 2025 Mubadala Citi DC Open, a combined ATP 500 and WTA 500 hard‑court tournament, will run between Jul. 21 and Jul. 27 at Washington's William H.G. FitzGerald Tennis Centre. The event boasts a star-studded line-up, including Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe, Ben Shelton, Lorenzo Musetti, Holger Rune, Daniil Medvedev, and Andrey Rublev.

WTA stars feature Jessica Pegula, Emma Raducanu, Elena Rybakina, Naomi Osaka, and Venus Williams (wildcards). The 2024 men's champion was Sebastian Korda, who defeated Flavio Cobolli to win the title. Paula Badosa won on the women's singles side.

The 2025 National Bank Open is scheduled to commence from Jul. 27 to Aug. 7 in Toronto (ATP) and Montreal (WTA), marking its 135th edition. As an ATP Masters 1000 and WTA 1000 event, it features a record 96-player singles draw. Top ATP contenders in Toronto include Jannik Sinner (No. 1), Carlos Alcaraz, Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz, Novak Djokovic, Daniil Medvedev, and Ben Shelton.

The 2024 men's champion was Alexei Popyrin, who defeated Andrey Rublev in the final, whereas Jessica Pegula retained the 2024 women's title over Amanda Anisimova.

The 2025 Cincinnati Open (Western & Southern Open) takes place Aug. 5–18 at Mason, Ohio's Lindner Family Tennis Centre. It's an ATP Masters 1000 and WTA 1000 hard‑court event. Top returnees include No. 1s Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, plus Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, and Mirra Andreeva.

Sinner (defeating Frances Tiafoe) and Sabalenka (defeating Pegula) were the 2024 champions. The tournament features an expanded 96‑player WTA draw and upgraded facilities after a $260 million renovation.

The 2025 US Open is set to be played from Aug. 24 to Sept. 7 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on hard courts, now spanning 15 days with a Sunday start. As a Grand Slam event on the 2025 ATP and WTA tours, top contenders include defending champions Jannik Sinner (men's) and Aryna Sabalenka (women's), along with prospects like Carlos Alcaraz, Coco Gauff, Taylor Fritz, and Iga Świątek.

With the Australian Open, French Open, and Wimbledon behind us, there's just one Grand Slam left to look forward to in 2025.

We've already seen plenty of American success at majors in 2025, especially on the WTA Tour.

In Melbourne, Madison Keys defeated Aryna Sabalenka to win her first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open.

Not to be outshone, Coco Gauff proceeded to win the French Open, doubling her major tally.

It's been a strong start for the stars of American tennis, but who is most likely to win their home tournament at the US Open later in the year?

It's hard to look past Gauff as a potential favorite for the US Open, considering she won the title back in 2023.

Now a two-time Grand Slam champion following her victory in Paris, the American star knows exactly what to do at the major tournaments.

She'll likely return to Flushing Meadows with a chip on her shoulder, having suffered a surprising fourth-round defeat at last year's event.

Determined and more dangerous than ever, it wouldn't come as much of a surprise to see Gauff lift the trophy once more in 2025.

Enjoying his career-best Grand Slam result in 2024, Taylor Fritz reached the final of the US Open, where he fell short against Jannik Sinner.

Continuing to impress on hard courts, Fritz finished off his year with an appearance in the final of the ATP Finals.

The 27-year-old wasn't able to carry that form over to the 2025 season, but rediscovered his best tennis on the grass recently, winning two warm-up tournaments before qualifying for the Wimbledon semis.

If Fritz can maintain the level he showed on grass on hard courts, he'll definitely be in contention during the second week of the US Open.

Just as Fritz did, Jessica Pegula contested her first Grand Slam final at the US Open in 2024, as she lost to world number one Sabalenka in straight sets.

The 31-year-old continues to impress on the WTA Tour, and whilst her major performances haven't quite been up to scratch in 2025, winning three tour-level titles proves just how dangerous she can be.

Whether Pegula can add a Grand Slam title to that list remains to be seen, but she'll certainly be one to look out for.

There aren't many players in tennis today who rise to the occasion quite like Ben Shelton.

The 22-year-old consistently finds his best tennis at the Grand Slam tournaments and has yet to lose to anyone but Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz at majors in 2025.

If Shelton can avoid the world number one and two during the first week in New York, you wouldn't want to bet against him reaching another Grand Slam semifinal.

When Frances Tiafoe retires from tennis, his highlight reel will be packed with moments from the US Open.

Twice a semifinalist at Flushing Meadows, Tiafoe steps into another gear whenever he plays on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

The Americans' two semifinal defeats came in five-set thrillers, losing out to Alcaraz in 2022 and to Fritz in 2024.

There's no doubt he will be looking to go one better this time around and reach his first final, something he is more than capable of doing.

Fritz, Pegula, and Tiafoe may all be in with a shout of winning the US Open in September, but which American players have actually won the tournament?

Since 2000, there have been 11 American winners at Flushing Meadows, as one player in particular enjoyed a spell of dominance on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Only time will tell if anyone can begin to replicate the success of Serena Williams at the US Open in 2025, but it will certainly be something to look out for.

The 2025 US Open is scheduled to begin on Sunday, August 24.

There were several impressive performances at Wimbledon, as the best players in the world showcased their talents on the grass.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz were a class above at SW19, contesting their second major final in a row, but they weren't the only players who impressed.

Youngsters Ben Shelton and Flavio Cobolli made their quarterfinal debuts at Wimbledon, securing several big wins along the way.

However, for every good performance, there was, of course, a… not-so-good performance.

Reflecting on the 2025 tournament, three-time champion Boris Becker revealed who disappointed him the most at Wimbledon.

During the latest episode of ‘Becker Petkovic', the co-hosts were discussing their biggest disappointments of Wimbledon.

“Jack Draper,” said Becker.

“It wasn't even close; he lost in four sets. I think he's realising for the first time that, at Wimbledon, as a Brit, the tournament isn't won with the forehand or the backhand, but with mentality. There's an expectation, you have to perform. 

“He spoke as if he were admiring Andy Murray, saying he was able to win the tournament once. Yes, fine, but he did it because of his attitude, his mentality, his preparation.”

Entering the tournament as the number four seed, Draper lost to Marin Cilic in the second round, failing to qualify for the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the third time in 2025.

Becker has been underwhelmed by the Briton's recent efforts at Grand Slams, and claims his results are ‘not good enough'.

“[Jack] Draper should be able to make it to the second week; he should be among the top three or four, because that's what his ranking says,” he said.

“But he has to perform in the Grand Slams; he lost to [Alexander] Bublik in the last 16 in Paris, and now he's lost to [Marin] Cilic in the second round [at Wimbledon].

“That's not good enough to be considered the best tennis player in the world.

“For the first time, he has to ask himself, ‘Why has this happened?'”

Becker wasn't the only one disappointed with Draper's Wimbledon campaign, as Andrea Petkovic claimed she expected more from the 23-year-old.

“I thought he could ignite such an energy in England that there would be so much hype,” she said.

“That it would be Andy Murray-like, that people would all flock to Wimbledon to watch Jack Draper.

“He didn't manage that, that's what I mean by this, that he disappointed me.”

The 37-year-old conceded that Draper had a difficult draw, but was frustrated to see him fail to take advantage as several big names suffered early exits.

“I thought he would lose to [Alexander] Bublik in the third round, but Bublik lost in the first round, the path to the quarterfinals was clear,” said Petkovic.

“I would have loved to see a Draper-[Novak] Djokovic quarterfinal, but it didn't happen because he lost to Marin Cilic in the second round.

“Of course, you can lose to Cilic, he was in the Wimbledon final, he knows how to play on grass, but that was a bit disappointing for me.”

Draper will now try to rest and recover ahead of the US Open, his final chance to impress at a Grand Slam in 2025.

The British star enjoyed his career-best Grand Slam result in New York a year ago, making a sensational run through to the semifinals.

Standing between Draper and a maiden Grand Slam final was world number one, Sinner.

Unfortunately for Draper, he struggled throughout the semifinal, fighting sickness as he fell to a 5-7, 6-7, 2-6 defeat.

It wasn't the fairytale ending in New York for the young Brit, but he proved just how dangerous he can be on hard courts.

If he can return in 2025 fully fit and with a few good results in the warm-up tournaments behind him, Draper could well be one to look out for during the latter stages of this year's US Open.

The 2025 US Open is scheduled to begin on Sunday, August 24.

Italian teenager bringing one-handed backhand to a new generation as he makes a smooth transition from juniors to the professional circuit.ByFlorian HeerPublished Jul 18, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 18, 2025

At just 18 years old, Pierluigi Basile is already turning heads on the ATP Challenger Tour. Ranked No. 35 in the ITF Junior Rankings and climbing the ATP ladder with a current ranking of No. 564, the young Italian is making a smooth and promising transition from junior success to the professional circuit. Last month, Basile delivered a breakout performance at the Internazionali di Tennis Città di Perugia | G.I.Ma. Tennis Cup by reaching the semi-finals, his deepest run at that level to date and only his fifth Challenger main draw appearance.Hailing from Martina Franca, a picturesque town located in the province of Taranto in the Apulia region of southern Italy, Basile picked up a racquet almost as soon as he could walk. “I started playing tennis at the age of two,” he recalls. “My parents used to take me to the local tennis club, and it just became part of my daily life. Later, I'd play with my dad in the garage or with my mom, Teresa, who's a teacher, in the living room. Tennis quickly became a passion.”

Admiration for FedererThat passion only deepened when a certain Swiss maestro came into the picture. “I grew up watching Roger Federer on TV, and even saw him live in Rome,” Basile says. “When he retired, I was crying. Honestly, I think if I ever meet him, I'd pass out. Tennis hasn't been the same since. Now I mainly follow the Italian guys, but I miss Roger so much.”It's no surprise then that Basile models his game after Federer, including his elegant one-handed backhand, a rarity among the new generation.My first coach tried to make me play two-handed, but there was no way. Every coach since has questioned it, but I stuck to my guns. It feels natural, more fluent and more relaxed. I wouldn't change it.Basile describes his playing style as aggressive, rooted in the confidence of youth. “When I was younger, I'd go for winners on every shot,” he laughs. “Now I'm a bit more measured, but I'm still an attacking player. I like to take the initiative.”

Breakthrough on home soilHis run in Perugia proved he's not just a raw talent but a player with a growing tactical awareness and maturity. “That week meant a lot.

It helped me to make adjustments and gave me confidence.Despite his youth, Basile doesn't seem fazed by the shift from juniors to the professional circuit. “It hasn't been that hard. Some opponents on the Pro Circuit are actually easier to handle than juniors. I just focus on improving every day. Every match is different; you have to adapt.”Italian lifestyleOff the court, Basile is as grounded as they come. He enjoys football with friends, supports Juventus and the Los Angeles Lakers, and likes to unwind with music, card games, and the occasional stint in the kitchen. His go-to recipe? “Pasta Carbonara - definitely my signature dish,” he says with a grin.As for the future, Basile isn't in a rush. “I don't set ranking goals.

The US Open mixed doubles tournament has been one of the most talked-about events in tennis in 2025, but the coach of new Wimbledon doubles champion Julian Cash has suggested the winner's of next month's glitzy event at Flushing Meadows next month should not be hailed as Grand Slam champions.

A host of big-name stars have been announced as participants in a new-look mixed doubles competition that will be contested over short four game sets, with a deciding point at deuce and a  10-point match tiebreak instead of a third set.

Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz were one of the eye-catching pairings announced for an event that is also due to see new Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner team up with America's Emma Navarro and Novak Djokovic play with Olga Danilovic.

It has all the hallmarks of a lucrative exhibition event, with $1m set to be handed to the winning team in New York.

The spectacle would be spectacular if all those big names took to the court, but respected coach Barry Fulcher has predicted there will be plenty of withdrawals prior to the tournament that he believes should not have the status of a Grand Slam event.

Emma Raducanu makes a big breakthrough in alternative tennis rankings

Emma Raducanu gets some candid encouragement from a former British No 1

Players like Cash and his Wimbledon doubles partner Lloyd Glasspool have not been invited to play in the event, with doubles players missing out on a payday in New York as the star names have been invited to take part instead.

“This exhibition event will be great fun, but it is not a Grand Slam and it shouldn't be viewed as such,” Fulcher told Tennis365.

“It's not just about the prize money and more about removing a mixed doubles Grand Slam opportunity.

“My own personal view, it is all just posturing at the moment and I will be fascinated to see how many of those 16 pairings that were announced a few weeks ago will turn up and play.

“I'd be very, very surprised if a lot of those pairs end up taking to the court and the only reason they would release that list is to get everyone talking about it.

“It's almost like they have put their names down, but there is no obligation to play.

“For me, the best doubles pairing on that list they released is Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori and it will be interesting to see if some doubles players who end up playing if the singles players drop out.

“I'm a fan of innovation and trying to bring new things into tennis, but I don't agree with calling it a Grand Slam event.”

Fulcher went on to reflect on his magical few days with Cash at Wimbledon, as the British duo saved three match points in their quarter-final match and went on to realise their dreams of lifting the Wimbledon title.

“It was the best moment of my coaching career so far,” added Fulcher. “The pride of coaching someone for that long and then having that moment was just wonderful.

“So many start out with ambitions to win a title at Wimbledon. You speak to the kids, speak to parents and they all say that, but doing it is very different.

“When I first met Julian, he was 14 and he duffed me up in a practice set before I coached him, so to see him fulfil his ambition is so rewarding.

“He is a good human being. He has good solid values, a great family around him.

“Some people in tennis lose sight of those values. They live a certain life, they get treated very well and they forget about the values that got them there.

“Seeing the absolute elation on Julian's face at the moment when they won was just brilliant to see. I've looked back on the replays of it since and you can just see what that moment meant to him.” 

Fulcher is preparing to stage his latest tennis event, with the Trilogy Rackets Festival bringing a week-long celebration of racket sports at Hove Beach Park By Game4Padel.

Aryna Sabalenka will not play the National Bank Open in Montreal, opting instead to focus on the remainder of the North American hard-court season. The World No.1 announced her withdrawal in a statement released by Tennis Canada, calling it her “best chance” for hard court success this year.

The 27-year-old Belarusian returns to North America as the reigning US Open champion. Last year, she beat Jessica Pegula in the final to secure her maiden title in New York. With no Grand Slam titles yet in 2025, Sabalenka is looking to peak at Flushing Meadows once again.

“I'm looking forward to kicking off the North American hard-court swing, but to give myself the best chance for success this season, I've decided it's in my best interest to skip Montreal,” Sabalenka said.

She added that she would miss her “amazing Canadian fans” and expressed gratitude for their support, saying she hopes to return in 2026. Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals in Montreal last year, where she lost to Amanda Anisimova. She has never won the event.

Sabalenka's next appearance is expected to be at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, where she is the defending champion. The tournament serves as a key tune-up ahead of the US Open, which begins later in August.

The decision to skip Montreal came after a semifinal exit at Wimbledon, where she fell short of reaching her first final at the All England Club. With the Australian Open, Roland Garros, and Wimbledon now behind her, New York remains her final opportunity to secure a major title this season.

Despite the pressure, Sabalenka has remained upbeat. “I think even though I lost a lot of finals, I lost tough matches at the slams this year, I still think that the consistency I was able to bring till this moment, it's impressive,” she said after her loss at Wimbledon.

Explore the top 5 Roland Garros champions and discover who truly rules the red clay courts in tennis history.

by Ismael Hernández de Dios

The clay of Roland Garros isn't just a surface—it's a proving ground. Clay tests patience, power, precision, and pure grit. As the French Open approaches, it's the perfect moment to salute the titans who have dominated the red dirt.

These five names carved their legacy in Paris, sliding, grinding, and conquering the most demanding Grand Slam of them all.

A pioneer from the pre-Open era, Vacherot ruled Roland Garros at the turn of the 20th century. His four titles remain a historic benchmark in French tennis lore.

Cochet was elegance on clay. With soft hands and sharp instincts, he captured five Roland Garros titles in the 1920s and ‘30s, becoming a national icon.

Ice in his veins, fire in his footwork. Borg glided across clay like no one else in his era, winning six titles with a relentless baseline game and steely calm.

Before the Open Era, Decugis was the clay-court king. With eight French titles, he set a gold standard that stood untouched for decades.

There's domination, and then there's Rafa at Roland Garros. Fourteen titles. 112 match wins. The “King of Clay” isn't just a nickname—it's a fact etched in red dirt.

Are the stars and stripes aligned for another American champion in the nation's capital?


After Sebastian Korda snapped a 17-year drought for home champions at the Mubadala Citi DC Open last year, the red, white and blue tide is in full force for this year's edition. Taylor Fritz leads the Americans in the field, while Ben Shelton and local hero Frances Tiafoe are also among those aiming to join the list of 12 different Americans who have lifted the trophy since the tournament began in 1969.




Nobody owned the capital quite like Andre Agassi. Across 10 visits in the ‘90s, he racked up as many titles as losses — five of each — cementing his dominance in the sweltering summer heat with a record haul, including a victory as World No. 1 in 1995. Michael Chang enjoyed a reign in the winner's circle sandwiched in between Agassi's ‘95 and ‘98 titles. Chang, former No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, was crowned champion in back-to-back years, ‘96 and ‘97.


At the turn of the century, young Americans such as Andy Roddick and James Blake took the baton. An 18-year-old Roddick became the youngest champion in tournament history in 2001. That season alone, Roddick claimed an American tri-fecta of sorts, capturing his first tour-level title in Atlanta, then adding to that count in Houston and in Washington, D.C, where in the championship match the teenager beat Sjeng Schalken — the Dutchman whom Roddick helped escape a hotel fire three years later in Rome. 


Roddick returned to the winner's circle in the nation's capital in 2005 and 2007, the latter of which marked the last time an American triumphed in Washington until Korda's title last season. In ‘05, Roddick spoiled countryman Blake's quest for a second D.C. title.

Blake won his first tour-level trophy there in 2002 and upon clinching championship point, the-then 22-year-old dropped his racquet in relief and leaped with ecstatic joy. Blake's pure enthusiasm spilled over as he celebrated with his team, and the New York native said post match that he almost knocked over his mom in a joyful courtside hug.


The fourth-longest running professional tennis event in the United States, the Mubadala Citi DC Open celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018 and has continued to thrive at the original location Fitzgerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park. The venue, nestled in one of D.C.'s most inclusive neighborhoods, was chosen at the request of Arthur Ashe, who partnered Donald Dell and John A. Harris to launch the tournament in 1969. Four years after the inaugural edition, Ashe himself won the title.




Held on clay courts until 1986, the event's deep roots and rich history have made it a favourite stop for some of the sport's biggest names. American icon Jimmy Connors brought his signature fire and flair to Washington, delivering his own brand of summer entertainment. He captured three titles in the capital, including two while holding No. 1 honours (1976, 1978). A decade separated his second and third title run, with Connors returning to the winner's circle once more in 1988.


It was during that era when another star made his mark in Washington. Ivan Lendl, the Czech-American who competed under the U.S. flag later in his career, lifted the trophy twice in the 1980s. In both finals, Lendl took out an American: Jimmy Arias in ‘82 and Brad Gilbert in ‘87.


Staying on the theme of Czech-American success, last year featured a full-circle moment for Florida-native Korda and his father Petr Korda. The current No. 32 in the PIF ATP Rankings, ‘Sebi' Korda, captured his biggest career title at the ATP 500, matching his father's 1992 triumph. The Kordas became the first father-son duo to win the same title in ATP Tour history.


Now, a strong squad of home hopes look to build on the American legacy in D.C. this year. Perhaps nobody wants to win this tournament more than DMV's own Tiafoe, who has lost to the eventual champion the past three years. Fritz is aiming for his first ATP 500 crown since 2022. Shelton is seeking his first title of the year.

Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur has announced she is taking a “step back” from professional tennis. 

The 30-year-old Tunisian, who is the first African and Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam singles final, was in tears as she retired from her first-round match at Wimbledon this year. 

After a difficult spell with injuries and form, the former world No 2 has dropped to 71 in the world rankings and on Thursday announced she will take a step away from the court for an indefinite period. 

"For the past two years, I've been pushing myself so hard, fighting through injuries and facing many other challenges," she said, in a statement on social media.

"But deep down, I haven't truly felt happy on the court for some time now.

"Tennis is such a beautiful sport. But right now, I feel it's time to take a step back and finally put myself first: to breathe, to heal, and to rediscover the joy of simply living.

"Thank you to all my fans for understanding. Your support and love mean the world to me. I carry it with me always.

"Even while I'm away from the court, I'll continue to stay close and connected in different ways, and share this journey with you all. Ons."

Jabeur is a three-time Grand Slam finalist, having lost in the 2022 and 2023 Wimbledon final, as well as the 2022 US Open final. 

She has won five career titles, including the WTA 1000 event in Madrid in 2022. 

"I'm pretty sad,” she said after her Wimbledon exit. 

“It really doesn't really help with my confidence and what I keep pushing myself to do, even though it has been a very tough season for me."

Aryna Sabalenka has withdrawn from the U.S. Open preparation tournament in Montreal after her devastating Wimbledon disappointment.

The world No. 1 suffered elimination in the Wimbledon semi-finals at the hands of Amanda Anisimova, who claimed a 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 triumph two years after stepping away from tennis indefinitely. Despite accepting her defeat graciously and even showing compassion toward a fan experiencing a medical crisis, Sabalenka did criticize her rival for violating Wimbledon protocol.

The Belarusian star has endured recent Grand Slam final frustrations. She lost to Madison Keys at the Australian Open final, where she destroyed her racket in anger, before falling to Coco Gauff at the French Open; Gauff became the first American to claim Roland Garros since Serena Williams in 2015.

"I'm looking forward to kicking off the North American hard-court swing, but to give myself the best chance for success this season, I've decided it's in my best interest to skip Montreal," a statement from Sabalenka read.

Sabalenka remains in exceptional form, which explains her position at the summit of the WTA rankings. The 27-year-old has reached seven finals during 2025, capturing titles in Brisbane, Miami, and Madrid - explaining her exhaustion following Wimbledon.

"I think even though I lost a lot of finals, I lost tough matches at the slams this year, I still think that the consistency I was able to bring till this moment, it's impressive," Sabalenka reflected post-match against Anisimova. "Still a lot of things to be proud of.

"This experience shows that next year I'm only hungrier and angrier. These tough defeats help me to come back much stronger. I have huge hopes for the next year."

Sabalenka's compatriot Paula Badosa has withdrawn from Montreal. Earlier in the week, she disclosed that she is dealing with a tear in her psoas, adding to the back issues that have been troubling the Spaniard since Wimbledon 2023.

Looking forward, Sabalenka aims to recuperate and prepare for her upcoming U.S. Open title defense. She clinched the 2024 U.S. Open championship after outplaying Jessica Pegula in the final match.

Speaking after her Wimbledon disappointment, Sabalenka said: "“Losing sucks, you know.

"You always feel like you want to die, you don't want to exist any more, and this is the end of your life. Every time you compete at that tournament, and you get to the last stages, you think that you're getting close to your dream.

"Then you lose the match, and you feel like, OK, this is the end.”

 Andrey Rublev escaped a quarter-final hole with a stirring comeback on Thursday at the Mifel Tennis Open by Telcel Oppo in Los Cabos. 

 Having at one point been a set and a break down to Emilio Nava at the hard-court ATP 250, Rublev dug deep for a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory. The top seed had let slip a 4-1 lead in the opening set and later trailed 2-4 in the second, but he showcased elite mental strength to stay calm and engineer a significant turnaround in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Nava.

 “I think two things [helped me],” said Rublev in his on-court interview. “Firstly, I stayed calm, and secondly, I just tried to be focused and stay there. At least if I deserved to lose today, [I wanted] to give 100 per cent focus, because you never know what can happen, and in the end, it paid off. I was there, I was focused, and in a crucial moment [in the second set] I was able to break back. Then the match started to change.” 

 Rublev converted four of 11 break points he earned against Nava, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to reach his fourth tour-level semi-final of 2025. The 27-year-old is now on a 23-15 for the season, a tally highlighted by an ATP 500 title run in Doha in February.

 Denis Shapovalov and Adam Walton will contest Friday's opening semi-final on the Mexican Pacific coast. The third-seeded Shapovalov downed Tristan Schoolkate 6-3, 6-2 to continue his strong 2025 on Mexican soil following his semi-final run in Acapulco in February.

Competing in his maiden tour-level quarter-final, Walton rallied from 0-3 in the third set to seal his win. Walton is up 15 spots to No. 82 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings as a result of his Los Cabos run so far, setting him up for a new career high in Monday's edition of the PIF ATP Rankings.

Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur has announced that she is taking a break from tennis.

The 30-year-old revealed that she wants to prioritise her wellbeing and 'rediscover the joy of simply living'.

In addition to the progress that she made at Wimbledon, Jabeur also previously reached the final of the French Open.

However, in this year's Wimbledon she ended up retiring in her first round match. 

The tennis star admitted that she hasn't felt truly happy on the court for some time.

She thanked her supporters, saying 'your support and love mean the world to me'.

Jabeur suffered defeats in the Wimbledon final in both 2022 and 2023, leaving her frustrated

In a statement Jabeur, who is currently ranked No71 in the world, wrote: 'For the past two years, I've been pushing myself so hard, fighting through injuries and facing many other challenges.

‘But deep down, I haven't truly felt happy on the court for some time now.

‘Tennis is such a beautiful sport. But right now, I feel it's time to take a step back and finally put myself first: to breathe, to heal, and to rediscover the joy of simply living.'

She continued: ‘Thank you to all my fans for understanding. Your support and love mean the world to me. I carry it with me always.

‘Even while I'm away from the court, I'll continue to stay close and connected in different ways, and share this journey with you all. Ons.'

Jabeur lost to Elena Rybakina in the 2022 Wimbledon final before being defeated by world No 42 Marketa Vondrousova in straight sets in the 2023 final.

She described the defeat to Vondrousova as the most painful loss of her career.

Jabeur was beaten by Iga Swiatek in the US Open final in 2022.

From Roger Federer to Pete Sampras, meet the five greatest players of all times in men's tennis. The ranking is done on the basis of grand slam titles won. These five legends have 92 grand slam titles combined.

Novak Djokovic is the greatest male tennis player of all time in terms of grand slams titles. Djoker Nole has 24 grand slam singles titles to his name. Djokovic conquered the Australian hard court 10 times, the most by any male tennis player. He's spent 428 weeks as world No. 1 and is the only man to win every slam at least three times. Djokovic entered the golden slam club after winning the gold medal in Paris 2024.

Rafael Nadal has 22 grand slam titles, including a record of 14 French Open wins. He's one of the few players to complete the golden slam, winning all four majors plus Olympic gold. Nadal was nicknamed the 'King of Clay' as it was close to impossible to defeat him during his prime at the Roland Garros.

Roger Federer won 20 grand slam titles and held the No. 1 ranking for 310 weeks. Federer has won the most titles (8) at the SW19 in the Open Era. Federer also has an Olympic gold medal; however, that feat was in a doubles game during the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in China.

Pete Sampras retired with a total of 14 grand slam titles. However, Sampras couldn't establish his dominance over the clay court in Paris. Sampras spent 286 weeks as the world no. 1. In a span of eight years from 1993 to 2000, Pete won seven Wimbledon trophies.

Roy Emerson won 12 grand slam singles titles and 16 doubles trophies, totaling 28 before the Open Era. He also held the record of six Australian Open men's singles titles until 2019, when Novak Djokovic won his seventh title.

There was a special visitor to the Rafa Nadal Academy this week as two all-time tennis greats reunited. Two months after they last came face-to-face at Roland Garros, Nadal and great rival Roger Federer spent time together at the complex in Mallorca.

The campus in Mallorca has more than 50 tennis courts, padel and squash courts, a football pitch, and two swimming pools. The academy also boasts a sports medicine facility and an international school, and annually hosts the Rafa Nadal Open on the ATP Challenger Tour. However, the two icons weren't there for a training session.

Federer, 43, was joined by his wife Mirka as he strolled across the area in discussions with Nadal. It isn't clear why the pair were meeting up on the Spanish island, with speculation already swirling over a future partnership.

Nadal took to X to acknowledge the visit, posting a picture of the pair and writing: “@rogerfederer! Really enjoyed our morning together at the @rnadalacademy!”



Nadal, 39, retired from the sport after the 2024 Davis Cup. In May, he was honoured with a special ceremony at the French Open to mark his 14 wins at the Grand Slam event.

Federer's emotional farewell came at the 2022 Laver Cup, and in Paris he stressed the importance of Nadal getting the send-off he deserved. He said: "I think farewells are important when you have his level.

“And he is a giant of the game, and if we can add a little something by being here with Novak and Andy, and we tied a knot all together, I think it's a nice thing. I know it meant the world to me that I had all my guys, my players around me when I retired.”

Federer and Nadal met 40 times in their illustrious careers, with Nadal winning 24 of them. The Spaniard also holds the superior Grand Slam final record in head-to-head clashes by 8-3.

From completing her ‘Surface Slam' to improving to 6-0 in Grand Slam finals and dropping just two games in the last two rounds combined, she pulled off all kinds of stats at SW19.ByJohn BerkokPublished Jul 18, 2025 copy_link

With every former champion in the draw ousted in the first week, we were guaranteed a ninth different ladies' champion in a row at Wimbledon this year—but unlike some of the other names in that streak, the woman who eventually won it this year shouldn't have been a surprise to anybody.Iga Swiatek captured the sixth Grand Slam title of her career at the All England Club this year, achieving all kinds of stats along the way.Here are just 25 of them:She's the only active woman to win Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces—clay, hard and grass. She's won four on clay at Roland Garros in 2020, 2022, 2023 and 2024, one on hard courts at the US Open in 2022, and now her first one on grass at Wimbledon in 2025.At 24, she's the youngest woman to win majors on all three surfaces since Serena Williams. Serena was 20 when she completed her Surface Slam at Wimbledon in 2002 (on grass), having previously won the US Open in 1999 (on hard) and Roland Garros in 2002 (on clay).She's also the only active woman to have won three different majors. And the only one she's missing in her collection, the Australian Open, is only six months away… is a Career Slam on the horizon?She now has the standalone fourth-most Grand Slam titles for a woman this century. She breaks a tie with Maria Sharapova, who won five, and now only trails Serena (who won 22 of her 23 this century), Venus Williams (who won seven) and Justine Henin (who also won seven).Having won the juniors in 2018, she's just the fourth woman in the Open Era to win both the girls' and ladies' titles at Wimbledon. She joins Martina Hingis (1994 and 1997), Amelie Mauresmo (1996 and 2006) and Ashleigh Barty (2011 and 2021) on that very exclusive list.She's now won at least one major a year for the last four years in a row, 2022 to 2025, the only woman to do that. The only other active woman to win majors any four years in a row is Naomi Osaka, in 2018 (US Open), 2019 (Australian Open), 2020 (US Open) and 2021 (Australian Open).She's the first Polish player, male or female, to win Wimbledon in the Open Era. Agnieszka Radwanska came close to doing it in 2012, reaching the final before finishing runner-up to Serena in three sets.

Now, some things Swiatek achieved with her blistering performances in the last two rounds—a 6-2, 6-0 victory over Belinda Bencic in the semifinals and a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Amanda Anisimova in the final.She's now 6-0 in her career in Grand Slam finals. She's the first woman to win her first six major finals since Monica Seles, who won her first six, too, between Roland Garros in 1990 and Roland Garros in 1992.She's just the second woman in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam final by a 6-0, 6-0 scoreline. The first was Steffi Graf, who defeated Natasha Zvereva in the 1988 Roland Garros final without dropping a game, either.She's the first woman in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam title by finishing off with three straight 6-0 sets. Graf beat Gabriela Sabatini, 6-3, 7-6, in the semifinals of Roland Garros before her win over Zvereva.She dropped the fewest combined games (two) in the semis and final of a major for a woman in the Open Era. Martina Navratilova held the previous record of five in the last two rounds at Wimbledon in 1983.She also dropped the fewest combined games to win the entire tournament (35) for a woman at Wimbledon this century. It's the fewest since Navratilova dropped just 29 en route to the 1990 title.Her victory in the final was her 100th career win at a major. It was just her 120th career match at a major, too, making her the fastest woman to achieve that feat since Serena, who did it in her 116th.She's also the second player in the Open Era, male or female, to record their 100th career win at a major in a final. Andy Murray is the only other one to do that, with his win over Novak Djokovic in the 2012 US Open final.

Swiatek only dropped one set en route to the Wimbledon title—and she was actually up 4-1 in that set.© 2025 Robert Prange

And the list of accomplishments goes on and on…She's now 19-3 on grass since the start of 2023. She was 10-1 in 2025.She's now 23-5 in her career in tour-level finals. With 23, she has the most tour-level titles for any player born in the 2000s, male or female. Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are next with 21 and 20, respectively.She's now 36-1 this year after winning the first set. That includes winning her last 28 matches in a row from a set up, her last loss being a 5-7, 6-1, 7-6 (8) defeat to Madison Keys in the Australian Open semifinals.And in the only set she lost at Wimbledon this year, she was 4-1 up. That came against Caty McNally in the second round. After dropping the first set of that match, she jumped out to early leads in the next two sets—3-0 in the second set, 5-0 in the third set—en route to a 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 victory.Her quarterfinal victory over Liudmila Samsonova was her 40th win of the year. And with her semifinal and final wins, she left Wimbledon with a 42-11 record on the year. She's just the second woman to surpass 40 wins this year, after Aryna Sabalenka, who left Wimbledon 47-9 on the year.She's now had 40 or more wins a year for the last four years in a row, from 2022 to 2025. She's the only woman to do that. Elena Rybakina could join her if she reaches 40 this year (the Kazakh is currently 31-13).That quarterfinal win also put her through to the semifinals of Wimbledon for the first time, making her the first woman born in the 2000s to reach the semifinals or better at every Grand Slam. Only one man born in the 2000s, Sinner, has done that—Alcaraz is missing the Australian Open.

After dropping from No. 2 to No. 8 after the clay-court season, she's now gone from No. 8 to No. 3 after the grass-court season. She rose from No. 8 to No. 4 after reaching her first grass-court final in Bad Homburg, and from No. 4 to No. 3 after her first grass-court title at Wimbledon.She's only 856 ranking points behind No. 2 Coco Gauff now, too. That gap was 2,956 points before Wimbledon (7,899 to 4,943) and it's now 856 (7,669 to 6,813). That's an enormous 2,100-point swing.She also went from third place to second place on the year-to-date race. Sabalenka already qualified for the WTA Finals by reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon. Swiatek is currently next in line…And finally, she now has no titles—or even finals, not counting team events—to defend until the grass-court season next year. Until then, Swiatek will only be defending a maximum of quarterfinal or semifinal points at every single event she plays. With Sabalenka defending so much now, could this be the beginning of a reascension to No. 1?

Darren Cahill has delivered his first post since he and Jannik Sinner conspired to win this year's Wimbledon title.

It was a mesmeric run from the 23-year-old, who was forced to beat both Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz en route to the title.

However, such is his unrelenting quality, he brushed both aside with relative ease, showcasing the furious, powerful hitting and a work rate that nobody on tour can compete with when at its best.

He has now won two of this year's three Grand Slam titles, and is the overwhelming favourite to win the fourth in New York later this year too.

If this is to be Cahill's last year by Jannik Sinner's side, it's certainly on track to be a generational one.

And, the two are clearly loving life together despite all the turmoil suffered in recent years, including a three-month suspension from tennis for a doping-related incident.

However, that enforced absence from tennis has arguably added to just how impressive Sinner's seamless return has been, easily slotting back in and proving why he is very much still the world's best player.

A post shared by Darren Cahill (@dc10s)

Cahill has now taken to Instagram to offer a series of photos documenting their last few weeks at Wimbledon, with a short message of congratulations to the four-time Grand Slam champion too.

The relationship he shares with his student is a wholesome one, with a father-son dynamic emerging from this tennis machine they have created.  

Although it has already been confirmed that Cahill will leave Sinner's team at the end of 2025, there have been murmurs suggesting otherwise since the Italian has returned from his three-month ban.

After all, the way in which he has rediscovered his form, arguably reaching even newer heights, has shocked everyone, likely including his coach.

This physical and technical freak of nature was just one point away from completing the French Open and Wimbledon double, a feat very few have ever accomplished, all whilst the earlier event marked just his second tournament back after that spell away from the sport.

This has clearly sparked great debate within Cahill, as some are now suggesting he's not done completely with Sinner.

In fact, there are some suggestions that he would be willing to continue but in a reduced capacity, only flying out to specific tournaments when really needed.

Whatever it takes to keep Cahill in his camp, Sinner should do it. He's been so influential, and the two are on track to create a legendary dynasty together in tennis.

This week's tournament in Los Cabos didn't exactly feature a star-studded field, as one might expect from an ATP 250 event played in Mexico the week after Wimbledon. However, arguably the two biggest names in the draw, Andrey Rublev and Denis Shapovalov, are still hunting for a title. But first, they have to get through some tricky semifinal matchups. But who will advance to the ATP Los Cabos final?

Head-to-head: Shapovalov 1-0 Walton

Shapovalov won with relative ease when the pair faced off in Indian Wells earlier this year, and he is indeed the far more talented player of the two, with significantly higher potential. However, he's also highly inconsistent and prone to awful performances and losses on any given day, so Walton definitely has a chance here if he can stay solid. With that said, there is no doubt that if Shapovalov plays anywhere close to what he is capable of, he will reach the final here and have the chance to regain some momentum in a season that has been extremely disappointing following his title in Dallas.

Prediction: Shapovalov in 2

Head-to-head: Kovacevic 1-0 Rublev

Rublev is usually rock-solid in smaller ATP events. Still, he lost to Kovacevic in the semifinals of Montpellier earlier this year, when he was the favorite to win the title. That said, he has shown signs of improvement lately after a rough start to the season, and there's a reason he has been a mainstay in the top 10 for so long despite never having reached a Slam semifinal. He tends to be very consistent in best-of-three events and takes advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. Kovacevic will have a chance if he can play his best, but Rublev should ultimately be too strong and prevail.

Prediction: Rublev in 3

Just as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic once dominated the ATP Tour and collected most of the Grand Slam titles over the past two decades, the new landscape of men's tennis appears to be increasingly shaped by Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. That shift is underscored by a remarkable record the two have achieved following their recent showdowns in the finals of Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

According to Mister Only Tennis, an X account known for detailed tennis stats, Alcaraz and Sinner now rank first and third, respectively, in terms of Grand Slam final win percentage in the Open Era, which began in 1968. This ranking includes only players who have reached at least five major finals.

It is topped by Australian legend Rod Laver, who posted an 83.3% success rate by winning five of six finals—Wimbledon 1968 and all four majors in 1969—losing only at Roland Garros in 1968. Notably, Laver also captured six additional major titles during the amateur era.

Tied with Laver at the top—excluding those amateur titles—is Alcaraz. The Spanish star has also won five of his first six Grand Slam finals (US Open 2022, Wimbledon 2023 and 2024, and Roland Garros 2024 and 2025), with his only loss coming at this year's Wimbledon final.

Jannik Sinner holds trophy after winning Wimbledon

Sinner sits just below with an 80% win rate in Grand Slam finals, having claimed titles at the Australian Open in 2024 and 2025, the US Open in 2024, and Wimbledon in 2025. His lone defeat came at Roland Garros earlier this year. In fact, Alcaraz and Sinner handed each other their first career losses in Grand Slam finals this season—evidence of the razor-thin margin between them at the top of the sport.

What makes these achievements even more impressive is the age of the two players. At just 23 and 22 years old, respectively, Sinner and Alcaraz are already cementing their place among tennis's elite, posting statistics that compare favorably with some of the game's all-time greats.

In addition to their Grand Slam finals efficiency, both players rank among the best in ATP Tour final win percentage since the start of the Open Era, based on players who have contested at least 25 finals.

Per Mister Only Tennis, Thomas Muster leads that list with an 81.6% mark (44–10), followed by Nikolay Davydenko at 75% (21–7). Alcaraz matches Davydenko's percentage—though he has done so at a far younger age. Sinner follows closely with a 74.1% win rate (20–7). Others rounding out the top group include Thomas Enqvist (73.1%), Pete Sampras (72.7%), and Rod Laver (71.9%).

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Having covered the other two ATP Bastad quarterfinal matches yesterday, I am back with the other two today. David is still on break, so I'm still filling in with my best bets. Please let me know in the comments if any of my advice from yesterday was helpful to you. I seem to be hitting two out of every three bets I place, which is the type of average you aim for in predictions, if not a little higher.    

H2H: 0-2

I need to stop picking Dutch tennis players. Camilo Ugo Carabelli had none of the problems I thought he would have against Botic Van De Zandschulp. Not only did Carabelli have a fantastic service game, he parked eight different aces in the match. He also saved 85% of break points, and I had predicted a complete failure in that department. Did I call that Nuno Borges would fail against Filip Misolic? At the end of the day, Borges' unforced errors and inability to convert break points would be his undoing against Misolic. Borges was competitive, but he ultimately beat himself with mistakes.

Best Bet to Make

Ugo Carabelli won his last two matches as an underdog, and he certainly has the overall talent to make it to the semifinals and beyond, but Misolic has been playing on another level for quite some time now. Yes, Misolic has had some issues at the quarterfinal level this year, but his level of play inspires confidence in his overall play. There's also the fact that Misolic has already beaten Ugo-Carabelli twice, and one of those times was April of this year in Bucharest. Misolic is also the better clay player this year. Time will tell if his quarterfinal loss against Lorenzo Musetti in three sets taught Misolic anything of note.

That being said, Misolic winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Misolic winning @1.91 @Betfair

H2H: 0-0

Francisco Cerundolo must have received some pretty effective advice from his younger brother, as he had little trouble putting Mariano Navone down in just 18 games. The former Bastad winner has a chance to reach his first semifinal since 2023. Standing in his way is Damir Dzumhur, whose best performance at Bastad before this year was a round of 16 finish in 2019. Dzumhur is 5-5 in his last ten matches, and he's 19-14 on clay in 2025. Cerundolo not only has a tournament victory here before, but he's 20-9 on clay this year, and 28-15 overall.



Best Bet to Make

Cerundolo is the favorite on the books, and he belongs at the top. The problem with betting on Cerundolo is that you're going to have to play with outcome results beyond win or lose if you want to make any money. At only 1.25 straight,  Cerundolo has more options in the prop realm. If you want to play it safe, you can take under 2.5 sets at 1.51 or do what I am doing and pick Cerundolo at under 21.5 games at 1.81 and profit. Cerundolo has been fantastic with break points, service games won, and first-serve points won. If he keeps performing at that level against Dzumhur, it should be as short of a night as it was with Navone.

That being said, Cerundolo winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Cerundolo winning @1.65 @Betway

	Even before CBS announced the unexpected cancellation of The Late Show hosted by Stephen Colbert — allegedly for purely financial reasons — other hosts under the Paramount Global banner were looking over their shoulder. Jon Stewart, who hosts The Daily Show, isn't sure whether the long-running late-night series will survive as Paramount continues its attempt at merging with Skydance Media. The deal has been delayed for over a year while the companies await FCC approval. 


	“Unfortunately, we haven't heard anything from them,” Stewart said in response to a listener question on his The Weekly Show With Jon Stewart podcast — released on Thursday — about whether Skydance would scrap Daily Show once the merger is complete. “They haven't called me and said, ‘Don't get too comfortable in that office, Stewart.' But let me tell you something, I've been kicked out of shittier establishments than that. We'll land on our feet. I honestly don't know.”


	Stewart considered that without Daily Show, it's uncertain that Comedy Central could continue to hold up on its own with just the remaining shows on its roster. “I think we're the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park,” he said. “But I'd like to think we bring enough value to the property, like if they're looking at it as purely a real estate transaction, I think we bring a lot of value,” he said. “But that may not be their consideration. I don't know, they may sell the whole fucking place for parts.”

	











South Park is still alive, but the show creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone recently slammed the Paramount-Skydance merger for delaying the release of Season 27. “This merger is a shitshow and it's fucking up ‘South Park,'” they shared in a recent social media statement. “We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.”

	Steward is taking things day by day and said that “we'll deal with it when we do,” should it come to that point. He doesn't want to make any assumptions regarding Skydance Media CEO David Ellison's plans for the company post-merger, adding: “We've all got a surmisal about who actually is owning it and what his ideology is, but ideology may not play a part.”


	When news of The Late Show‘s cancellation broke, CBS was adamant about stressing that the decision was wholly unrelated to any “other matters” regarding Paramount. Not everyone is convinced. Senator Elizabeth Warren questioned the motives behind CBS' decision, writing on X: “CBS canceled Colbert's show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery. America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.”

	A new Jason Voorhees has joined the Friday the 13th universe, as Callum Vinson (Chucky, Long Bright River) boards Peacock‘s prequel series Crystal Lake from A24. Brad Caleb Kane serves as creator, writer, showrunner and executive producer of the series.


	The hockey mask-wearing serial killer from the big screen is the son of Pamela Voorhees, to be played by Linda Cardellini in the new show. Cardellini's Pamela is believed to be a mother who gave up a singing career to raise a special needs child and takes a dark turn when she loses her son.


	Crystal Lake is a town, a lake, and a summer camp in the franchise, the setting of the series. Voorhees drowned in the lake as a child, which led to his mother's killing spree at the camp to avenge his “death.” Jason witnessed his mother's decapitation by a camp counselor, which sets him off on a murder spree of his own that haunts the area across 12 films. Vinson is billed as a recurring guest star, as this new project focuses on Pamela.

	Jason, created by Victor Miller, has been played by multiple actors, including Ari Lehman, who brought the character to life in the original film. Additional actors include Warrington Gillette, Steve Dash, Richard Brooker, Ted White, Tom Morga, C.J. Graham, Kane Hodder, Ken Kirzinger and Derek Mears.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to Vinson, Nick Cordileone (Warrior), Joy Suprano (Fleishman is in Trouble, Best Foot Forward), Danielle Kotch (Director's Cut), and Phoenix Parnevik (Bel-Air, Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter Is Dead) have joined the cast.


	Cordileone will play Ralph, Joy Suprano as Rita, Kotch as Claudette, and Parnevik as Barry.


	The character Barry Jackson (Willie Adams) appeared in the original Friday the 13th film as a camp counselor and, famously, Pamela's (played by Betsy Palmer in the OG film) first victim. His girlfriend, Claudette Hayes (Debra S. Hayes), also a camp counselor, was Pamela's second victim. 

	











	Ralph, known as Crazy Ralph, appeared in the first two films. He is a longtime Crystal Lake resident who drunkenly rambles about the curse of Camp Crystal Lake. Potentially, if this is the same Ralph Cordileone plays, it could be revealed what he saw or knew that caused this lifelong trauma. It's worth noting that the above characters could differ from those portrayed in the prequel, and even if they are the same, their stories could evolve into something different.


	Crystal Lake also stars William Catlett, Devin Kessler, Cameron Scoggins, and Gwendolyn Sundstrom.


	The prequel is executive produced by A24, Kane, Marc Toberoff, Victor Miller, Robert M. Barsamian, Robert P. Barsamian and Stuart Manashil.


	Vinson is represented by Rebel Creative Group & Innovative Artists; Cordileone is represented by DGRW; Suprano is represented by Amplified; Kotch is represented Paradigm and Stagecoach Entertainment; Parnevik is represented by Madhouse Talent Management and BRS / Gage.

	Another Reagan is headed to Boston — even if it's just for a short visit. Bridget Moynahan has become the first Blue Bloods main cast member to make an appearance alongside Donnie Wahlberg on CBS' upcoming offshoot Boston Blue. She will reprise her role as Erin Reagan in the premiere episode of the new series, which will air October 17.


	Wahlberg posted a photo of the duo on the Toronto set of Boston Blue with the caption “Reunited and it feels so good!” (You can see it below). In addition to guest starring, Moynihan will direct an episode of the freshman drama this season.


Boston Blue follows NYPD's Danny Reagan (Wahlberg) as he takes a new position as a Detective with the Boston PD. Once in Boston, he is paired with Detective Lena Silver (Sonequa Martin-Green), the eldest daughter of a prominent law enforcement family.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Danny's prosecutor sister Erin is the third Reagan character to be featured on Boston Blue, along with Danny and his son, Sean. Mika Amonsen was recently cast as a series regular, taking over the role of Sean which was played on a recurring basis by Andrew Terraciano on Blue Bloods. 


	In addition to Wahlberg, Martin-Green and Amonsen, the Boston Blue cast includes Maggie Lawson as Sarah Silver, Marcus Scribner as Jonah Silver, Gloria Reuben as Mae Silver and Ernie Hudson as Reverend Peters.


Boston Blue, which will air in Blue Bloods‘ Friday 10 p.m. time period, is produced by CBS Studios in association with Jerry Bruckheimer Television. Brandon Sonnier & Brandon Margolis showrun and executive produce. Jerry Bruckheimer, KristieAnne Reed and Wahlberg also serve as executive producers. The series will be distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.

The artist and his late wife Marilyn Bergman wrote both exquisite ballads and witty TV theme songs.

	Legendary lyricist Alan Bergman died on Thursday (July 17) at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 99, it was announced Friday by family spokesman Ken Sunshine. His daughter Julie Bergman was present at the time of his death.


	Bergman suffered from respiratory issues in recent months, but continued to write songs till the end.

	











	Bergman and his wife, Marilyn Bergman (who died in 2022 at age 93), are probably best known for writing exquisite ballads such as “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life,” “Pieces of Dreams” and “How Do You Keep the Music Playing?,” but they refused to be typecast. They also wrote the witty theme songs for such TV series as Maude, Good Times and Alice.


	The Bergmans won three Academy Awards, including best original song for “The Windmills of Your Mind” from The Thomas Crown Affair and “The Way We Were” from the movie of the same name, and three Grammy Awards, including song of the year for “The Way We Were.”

	The Bergmans received 15 Oscar nominations for best original song, a total equaled or bettered by only four songwriters in history – Sammy Cahn (26), Johnny Mercer (18), Diane Warren (16) and Paul Francis Webster (16). The Bergmans collaborated on their Oscar-nominated songs with seven different composers – Michel Legrand, Henry Mancini, Maurice Jarre, Marvin Hamlisch, David Shire, John Williams and Dave Grusin.

	











	In 1983 they became the first (and still only) songwriters to be nominated for three Oscars for best original song in one year for “How Do You Keep the Music Playing” from Best Friends, “It Might Be You” from Tootsie and “If We Were in Love” from Yes, Giorgio.


	They also won four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards.


	The Bergmans were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1980 and received that organization's highest honor, the Johnny Mercer Award, in 1997. They received a trustees award from the Recording Academy in 2013.


	The Bergmans also received lifetime achievement awards from the National Academy of Songwriters and the National Music Publishers Association. They received honorary doctorates from Berklee College of Music and the University of Massachusetts. Alan Bergman's alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recognized him with its Distinguished Alumnus Award.


	The Bergmans had a long and close relationship with Barbra Streisand, who paid tribute to them on her Grammy-nominated 2011 album What Matters Most – Barbra Streisand Sings the Lyrics of Alan & Marilyn Bergman. 


	“Marilyn and Alan Bergman were like family, as well as brilliant lyricists,” Streisand said after Marilyn's death. “We met over 60 years ago backstage at a little nightclub and never stopped loving each other and working together. Their songs are timeless and so is our love.”


	In the years since his wife's death, Alan Bergman continued to write, record and perform. His final collaboration was with guitarist and composer Pat Metheny, who is set to record an album of nine Bergman/Metheny songs later this year.

	











	Bergman died just eight days after the announcement of a celebration in his honor on what would have been his 100th birthday on Sept. 11. Many of his friends and admirers were set to perform at a concert in his honor that night at The Broad Stage in Santa Monica, Calif. The event is expected to go on as planned, but pivot to a tribute rather than a birthday celebration. The event will serve as a benefit for the Jazz Bakery, of which Bergman was a founding member of the board.


	Two of the artists who were on the bill for the birthday event shared comments at the time the event was announced.


	Five-time Grammy nominee Michael Feinstein said, “The songs Alan and Marilyn have written are part of a pantheon of enduring music that will live long beyond Alan's Centenary, for they are timeless expressions of the human condition, and will never grow old. The love that they fundamentally lived, expressed and demonstrated in life, imbues their work with a special eloquence and truth. It is an honor to celebrate Alan on his 100th!”


	Actor, comedian and writer Paul Reiser commented, “My goal in life is to try to be even a small fraction of the man — and artist — that my dear friend Alan Bergman is. (I may need more than 100 years to get there, but … working on it.)”


	In addition, Ruth Price, founder of the Jazz Bakery, said, “100 years on this planet is no small achievement, but to have graced those years with such love, beauty and art speaks to a life extraordinarily well lived. Alan is incomparable, and I love him for all kinds of reasons.”


	Survivors include his daughter Julie Bergman, a writer and film producer, and granddaughter Emily Sender, who just completed her masters in global food studies. There will be a private graveside burial.

One person suffered a broken ankle, while seven others were transported to a hospital.

	As fans were leaving Beyoncé‘s concert in Atlanta on Tuesday (July 15), a stampede broke out on an escalator at a local transit station that left 11 people injured — and according to reports, one little bug was what started it all. 


	The incident took place at Vine City Station, where concertgoers had gathered to use the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority on their way home from the Cowboy Carter Tour show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. As captured in videos on social media, chaos broke out when a line of people using an escalator at the station started to rush down the steps after hearing screaming, resulting in a dangerous crowd crush.

	











	Witnesses on the scene later told police that they believed the person who screamed had been reacting to an insect. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	In a statement shared with Billboard on Friday (July 18), MARTA communications director Stephany Fisher confirmed that the incident took place just after midnight on Tuesday, with 11 people reporting injuries. “One person suffered a broken ankle, seven people were transported to the hospital with cuts and scrapes, and one person declined transport,” she said. “Two people requested medical assistance after reaching their destinations. MARTA Police on scene reported that a person began screaming and running, causing a stampede on the escalator that caused it to temporarily speed up and then stop suddenly.”

	











	Fisher added that the escalator has since been barricaded and is under investigation by manufacturers and MARTA Safety officials. She also noted, “MARTA Police on scene said there was a scream and witnesses said the person who screamed was reacting to an insect. I believe there's also video on TikTok of a woman claiming it was a 10-year-old relative who screamed when she saw a bug.”


Billboard has reached out to Beyoncé's rep and MARTA police for comment.


	The terrifying ordeal followed the last of four shows that the 35-time Grammy winner played in Atlanta, marking the end of the second-to-last stop on her summer-long Cowboy Carter trek. People on social media have been posting their accounts of the accident, with one witness sharing footage and writing on TikTok, “After the Beyonce concert last night, the escalator flew down and we all flew down and piled on top of each other … I managed to break free but I was very shaken up.”


	The video shows people in cowboy hats and other Beyoncé-coded outfits crying out in fear, while some people still on the escalator urge others to move back.


	Others have shared photos of their injuries, including one person with a bloody, lacerated ankle.


	Also in Atlanta, Beyoncé's choreographer and dancer were robbed on July 8. The two men told local police at the time that someone had broken into their car, stealing a hard drive with some of the superstar's unreleased music and touring plans.


	The next and final stop on Bey's trek will be in Las Vegas, where the musician will perform shows on July 25 and 26 at Allegiant Stadium.

Best known for her work on such TV shows as 'General Hospital,' 'Inspector Morse,' 'Casualty' and 'Holby City,' Loe died Tuesday following a Stage 4 cancer diagnosis.

	Lily Ford



Kate Beckinsale has confirmed the death of her mother, British actress Judy Loe, at the age of 78.


	Loe died Tuesday, two years after the announcement of her Stage 4 cancer diagnosis. She is best known for her TV work on shows like General Hospital, Inspector Morse, Casualty and Holby City.




	Beckinsale, the only child of Loe and her first husband, actor Richard Beckinsale, posted Friday on Instagram that she was “paralyzed” by grief.


	“I don't want to post this,” she wrote alongside photos of the pair. “I am only posting this because I have had to register my mother‘s death certificate and it will soon become public record. She died the night of 15 July in my arms after immeasurable suffering.

	“I have not picked all the best photos, nor the best videos, because I cannot bear to go through my camera roll yet. I deeply apologize to any of her friends who are finding out this way or through the press, but I cannot go through her phone.”

	She continued: “Jude was the compass of my life, the love of my life, my dearest friend. The vastness and huge heart of this tiny woman has touched so many people who love her dearly. She has been brave in so many ways, forgiving sometimes too much, believing in the ultimate good in people and the world is so dim without her that it is nearly impossible to bear.”

A post shared by Kate Beckinsale (@katebeckinsale)


	Born in 1947, Loe was one of the original castmembers of the musical Hair and later made her TV debut in Ace of Wands in 1970. From 1977-79, she was married to Richard Beckinsale, who played Lennie Godber on the BBC sitcom Porridge and Alan Moore ion the ITV show Rising Damp. He died of a heart attack at age 31 in 1979.

	











	“Mama, I love you so much,” the couple's 51-year-old daughter continued on Instagram. “This has been my greatest fear since finding my father dead at five and I am here. Oh my Mama … I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.”


	Last week, Beckinsale, most familiar to audiences for her roles in Pearl Harbor, The Aviator, Emma, Van Helsing, Serendipity and Jolt, posted video footage of her singing at Loe's hospital bedside.

Come Sept. 17, 10 nominees will be announced — here are five of the most likely.

	Leila Cobo


Chief Content Officer Latin/Español, Billboard


	Last year saw the return of Latin albums as cohesive works versus collections of previously released successful singles. That trend has only accelerated with multiple conceptual albums that balance commercial appeal with artistic prowess, widening the window of possibilities for album of the year at the 2025 Latin Grammy Awards.


	Historically, voters have favored encore performances of legacy artists: In the category's 25 years, seven artists have won more than once, including Juan Luis Guerra (a record-high five times), Alejandro Sanz and Juanes (tied with three each). But recent wins by Karol G and Rosalía demonstrate there is openness to the new and ascendant alongside the venerable.

	











	Come Sept. 17, 10 nominees will be announced — here are five of the most likely.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The Puerto Rican star has never been nominated for album of the year, but his meticulously crafted Cosa Nuestra could change that. An ambitious album with roots in New York and a clear storyline, it features collaborations with Bad Bunny, Romeo Santos and Laura Pausini, among others. But the star is Alejandro, who infuses tropical music with modernity. Witness the delicious title track, a mix of retro Cuban son with R&B soneos (improvisations), or danceable gems like the hardcore New York salsa “Tú Con El.” Released in November 2024, Cosa Nuestra set the stage for later roots-based albums, including Bad Bunny's DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, while Alejandro has showcased the music in an equally ambitious theatrical arena tour.

	











	Bad Bunny has been ­nominated four times for this award (including his nod for Oasis, his album with J Balvin) but has yet to win. DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, however, has many elements that voters will find compelling: a nostalgic premise; its professed love of homeland, particularly at a fraught political time for the Latin ­community; thoughtful use of revered genres and music (the opening “NUEVAYoL,” sampling El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico's classic “Un Verano en Nueva York,” is a modern take); and employing a new generation of young musicians from the island in the production. It doesn't hurt that Bad Bunny is at the height of his popularity as an artist shaping the global zeitgeist.


	While speaking with Billboard in May, Estefan described her 30th album, and her first entirely in Spanish in 18 years, “like a modern Mi Tierra.” It's a reference that will make voters take note. Mi Tierra, released in 1993 as a love letter to Estefan's native Cuba, was her first album in Spanish, and it ruled Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart for 58 weeks. Raíces, however, is more than nostalgia. Its roots are Cuban, with its impeccable production — courtesy of husband Emilio Estefan Jr. — bringing yesterday and today to the forefront through the voice of Latin music's original groundbreaking diva.


111XPANTIA debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, the highest position for a Latin duo or group in history. While that feat alone should earn the música mexicana act's ninth studio album serious Latin Grammy attention, 111XPANTIA also shines outside of its chart accolades. After dabbling in EDM and urban, Fuerza Regida forcefully returns to its norteño roots and corridos with crisp instrumentation and clever nods to past and present. The album opens with “GodFather,” a reimagining of Nino Rota's The Godfather theme with Mexican swag and sensibility, which says a lot about the band's evolution.

	











	In 2023, Joaquina became the youngest person to win the Latin Grammy for best new artist. Her debut full-length, al romper la burbuja, features 14 songs that speak to the daily angst of a 21-year-old navigating the world with open-eyed curiosity. Charming but sophisticated, Joaquina has connected with fans her age by speaking to them peer to peer. While it has been a beat since Latin music boasted such a young woman singer-songwriter in the purest sense of the word, Joaquina entering this ­category would be a full-circle Latin Grammy moment.

Ari Aster is expanding the fictional town of Eddington into Queens, NY. The auteur is partnering with the Museum of the Moving Image to host the new film series “Eddington City Limits,” highlighting the features that inspired his acclaimed COVID-set Western.

Aster will be in attendance for two out of the five films that will screen; the program ranges from Robert Altman's iconic “Nashville” to Lars von Trier's beloved “Dogville.” The series is co-programmed by Aster and MoMI Senior Curator of Film Michael Koresky, and will take place from August 15 to 31. “Eddington” opens in theaters today, July 18.

 










As the description for the film series states, “Eddington City Limits” will include “movies that both directly inspired or echo the escalating madness of ‘Eddington,' depicting powder-keg communities ready to spill over into violence or enclosed worlds so given to conspiracy and obsession that there's no longer any sense of coherent reality.”

Aster will appear for a conversation with Koresky around two films: Robert Altman's “Nashville” on August 17 and the August 23 screening of Oliver Stone's “JFK.”

 










Aster's “Eddington” is led by Pedro Pascal, who plays a small-town mayor who goes against the local sheriff (Joaquin Phoenix) in New Mexico amid the political turmoil of 2020. Emma Stone, Austin Butler, Luke Grimes, Deirdre O'Connell, Micheal Ward, Clifton Collins Jr., William Belleau, Cameron Mann, Matt Gomez Hidaka, and Amélie Hoeferle also star in Aster's fourth feature.

“Eddington City Limits” will opens with Lars von Trier's “Dogville,” also about small-town American life. Steven Spielberg's paranoid pandemonium dramedy “1941,” as well as classic Western “The Wild Bunch,” will both screen, with “1941” in DCP and “The Wild Bunch” in 35mm.   “We're so pleased to work with Ari on this series,” co-programmer Koresky said in an official statement. “These selections elucidate and expand on the themes of his brilliant and rattling 2020-set American western, which, like all his films, puts its viewers in a productively uncomfortable position. Aster knows that great movies don't have to be easy on us, and the movies in this lineup all provoke their audiences in ways that expertly balance pain and pleasure. As audiences discover ‘Eddington' in the coming weeks, we hope they'll come experience some of these films at the Museum to further discuss the ideas — about the breakdown of community, about conspiracy, about cult mentality — that it puts forth.” Check out the full program, with language provided by MoMI, below.  “Dogville“Friday, August 15, 6:00 p.m. Dir. Lars von Trier. 2003, 171 mins. Denmark. DCP. With Nicole Kidman, Stellan Skarsgård, Paul Bettany, Lauren Bacall, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan, Jeremy Davies, Ben Gazzara, Philip Baker Hall, Chloë Sevigny, Udo Kier. The pinnacle of Lars von Trier's cinematic moral confrontations remains a work of controversy and contemplation more than twenty years after its release. A cold, unremittingly angry film about the United States, made by an outsider (and released during the height of the U.S.'s second invasion of Iraq), the Danish director's polarizing drama subverts the cinematic conventions of films about small-town American values and flips the script on dramas about the recovery of human goodness. Yet von Trier's bitter pill is dramatically engaging from first frame to shocking last, as it follows a mystery woman named Grace (Kidman) who seeks refuge from violence in a quaint Rocky Mountain town, only to find herself in a different kind of nightmare. Von Trier eschewed location shooting—and sets of any kind—to tell this discouraging, marvelously written tale of corruption.  “Nashville“With Ari Aster in personSunday, August 17, 1:00 p.m.Dir. Robert Altman. 1975, 159 mins. U.S. DCP. With Lily Tomlin, Ronee Blakely, Gwen Welles, Shelley Duvall, Keith Carradine, Ned Beatty, Barbara Harris, Jeff Goldblum. The peak of Altman's prolific career was this panoramic view of American life circa 1975, set in the nation's country-music capital. Cramming his wide screen with the comings and goings of a 24-character ensemble, Altman creates an incredible, cacophonous entertainment, equal parts comedy and tragedy, featuring terrific original songs and an unforgettable ending. Perhaps never has another film captured the simultaneous horror and hilarity of modern American living than this singular masterpiece, which remains as galvanizing and astute—and irresolvable—as ever, a rollicking kaleidoscope that gradually becomes a depiction of encroaching political violence.  “JFK” With Ari Aster in person on August 23Saturday, August 23, 6:15 p.m.Sunday, August 31, 1:00 p.m. Dir. Oliver Stone. 1991, 189 mins. U.S. DCP. With Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland. At the height of his cinematic powers, Oliver Stone got this miraculously personal studio film green-lit—a feat that now feels all but unthinkable. JFK follows the true story of the indefatigable, increasingly obsessive New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Costner, a steadfast marvel), who tried to convict local high society dandy Clay Shaw (Jones) as a conspirator in the murder of President John F. Kennedy Jr, and in so doing prove the Warren Report was wrong in certifying that Lee Harvey Oswald (Oldman) acted alone. Stone's free-wheeling, brilliantly constructed head-trip feels awfully prescient in its “there is no bottom” perspective on American history and conspiracy.  “The Wild Bunch“Friday, August 29, 6:30 p.m. Sunday, August 31, 5:00 p.m. Dir. Sam Peckinpah. 1969, 145 mins. U.S. 35mm. With William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien, Warren Oates. As the western dried up around him, Sam Peckinpah assembled a group of grizzled veterans for one last trip into the breach. A cadre of aging outlaws, fleeing the authorities, attempts to make a final score for a Mexican general, but when things go awry, the gang finds itself in one of the wildest and bloodiest of screen shoot-outs. Peckinpah's masterpiece is at once classical and revisionist, an exemplar of the very genre it so brilliantly subverts, building towards a famously violent climax that seemed to all but put a fork in the genre.  “1941“Saturday, August 30, 3:00 p.m. Dir. Steven Spielberg. 1979, 118 mins. U.S. DCP. With John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, John Candy, Nancy Allen, Tim Matheson, Toshiro Mifune. Critically dismissed at the time of its release, Spielberg's grand folly is a lavish spectacle that has attracted a major cult following. A slapstick behemoth on a massive, budget-busting scale, 1941 charts the fictional pandemonium that ensues among a group of frenzied Los Angelenos after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Featuring Oscar-nominated cinematography, sound design, and visual effects, Spielberg's wildest ride is a chance for Spielberg to play with and demolish a really big toy set—but it's also a delirious portrait of Americans under duress that serves as a comic critique of wartime paranoia.

Last night, Stephen Colbert shared the news that not only had he lost his job as host of The Late Show, but that CBS had decided to end The Late Show franchise altogether. With the news, the network shared that the move was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.” While it's true that late night and linear TV in general faces unique challenges in the streaming age (as anyone who watched the latest season of Hacks is likely aware), it's also true that Colbert used the show on Monday to criticize CBS's parent company Paramount for its $16 million settlement with President Trump. 

We here at The A.V. Club are not in the position to suggest that there is any kind of explicit correlation between these two events, but Massachusetts senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is. “CBS canceled Colbert's show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery,” the senator wrote on X. “America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.” Earlier this month, Warren suggested that Paramount's settlement was “bribery in plain sight,” noting that Paramount “refused to provide answers to a congressional inquiry.” 

Warren is hardly the only person to wonder aloud if Colbert's departure has something to do with Paramount and Trump's relationship. “When media companies cancel Late Night shows to appease fascist presidents, America fucking ends,” wrote Parks And Recreation creator Mike Schur on Bluesky. “If you think for one second that this decision has nothing to do with Trump, don't worry, he will brag about it within the next 24 hours and disabuse you of that notion.” California senator Adam Schiff, who appeared on The Late Show just this week, also wrote on X, “If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.” Though stopping short of suggesting a political motivation, fellow late night host Jimmy Kimmel also showed support on Instagram, writing, “Fuck you and all your Sheldons CBS.” If nothing else, it seems like Colbert will have no shortage of willing and vocal guests during his last few months on air.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems' reboot of I Know What You Did Last Summer banked $2.2 million in previews from showtimes that began at 2 p.m. Thursday, while A24's Ari Aster socio-political Western Eddington did $625,000.


	Neither film, nor Paramount Animation's Smurfs, is expected to over swell with Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman still a fortress atop the box office chart with an expected second weekend of $55M-$60M, after the James Gunn movie ended its first week with $177.7M. Superman is pacing ahead of the first week of Matt Reeves' The Batman by 3% ($172.5M, final domestic $369.3M), 16% ahead of Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($152.7M first week, $359M final domestic) and 3% behind the first week of GOTG Vol. 2 ($183.1M, final domestic $389.3M).

	











I Know What You Did Last Summer is eyeing around $13M+, while Smurfs is anywhere in the high single digits to low teens. Eddington is expected to land in the under-$5M range.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The Jennifer Kaytin Robinson-directed I Know What You Did Last Summer counts previews that are higher than Blumhouse/Universal's Wolf Man ($1.4M previews, $10.8M opening) from earlier this year, and 62% less than Sony's reboot of 28 Years Later ($5.8M previews, $30M opening). Critics have settled at 38% Rotten on I Know What You Did Last Summer while the Rotten Tomatoes audience meter is at 69%. That latter score is the best in franchise, ahead of the original 1997 installment at 41% and the 1998 sequel at 29%.

	











	The 1997 movie, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and the late Anne Heche, opened to $15.8M and legged out to $72.5M domestic, $125.5M worldwide. The 1998 sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer debuted to $16.5M and ended its run at $40M. The movies made $165M combined. The third movie, I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer starring Brooke Nevin, went direct to home video in 2006. The new installment features the return of Hewitt and Prinze Jr alongside newcomers Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon and Gabbriette Bechtel.


Eddington‘s critical score stands at 66%, which is under the 90% certified fresh of Aster's horror opus Hereditary, and his Swedish solstice genre pic run amok Midsommar (83% certified fresh), and 2 points under his trippy Joaquin Phoenix pic Beau Is Afraid (68% fresh).


Smurfs didn't hold previews last night.


	The rest of the week:


	1.) Superman (WB) 4,135 theaters Thu $10.9M (-7% from Wed) Week $177.7M/Wk 1 


	2.) Jurassic World Rebirth (Uni) 4,324 theaters, Thu $4.2M (-6% from Wed), Week $60.6M  (-56%), Total $252.7M/Wk 2

	4.) How to Train Your Dragon (Uni) 3,285 theaters, Thu $1.22M (-6%), Week $13.3M (-30%)/Total $245.3M/Wk 5

Superman will make less than 520 million at the global box office.This is not good in my book.

Is the new Superman a flop overseas or not?

They probably needed a big central star for I Know What You Done Did, like that chick from Smile 2 or Jenna Ortega for both acting and scripting duties. No one knows anyone in the new cast and the legacy actors don't even do much for people who dug them back in the 90s.

When was the last time a major studio opted out of previews for a wide release? Considering its a kids movie released in the middle of summer, and the review embargo was up anyways, it seems like an odd choice.

The real comp for I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is FINAL DESTINATION: BLOODLINES…and it's a comparison that does IKWYDLS no favors.

Final Destination: Bloodlines had a $50mil. IKWYDLS was $18mil. How is that a fair comp?

					By Andreas Wiseman 

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Some big news spanning independent film distribution and the Los Angeles agency scene: Teddy Schwarzman's indie studio Black Bear is expanding into U.S. distribution and has hired longtime CAA Media Finance co-head Benjamin Kramer to oversee the operation.


	The ambitious U.S. arm will release up to 12 Black Bear and third-party productions per year. We understand there are multiple high-profile movies already on the slate which could go through the pipeline. The company will focus on filmmaker-driven fare and wide-release action and genre movies.


	Key staff will be added in the coming months to build out the team under Kramer, reporting to Black Bear CEO Schwarzman.

	











	Producer, financier and sales agent Black Bear already operates direct distribution in the UK (Longlegs, Conclave and The Salt Path among recent hits) and owns Canadian distributor Elevation Pictures. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	This has moved fast and Kramer is expected to be in the saddle at Black Bear in coming weeks ahead of the fall festivals and markets. It'll be welcome news to sellers and producers given the dwindling number of strong U.S. theatrical buyers in recent years.


	Kramer, who joined CAA in 2005, most recently spent eight years as co-head of the Media Finance department, known for packaging and arranging financing and distribution for indie films, while also advising top producers and financiers on their media investments.


	Under his co-leadership with Roeg Sutherland, CAA Media Finance has been the largest supplier of films for both domestic and international marketplaces, brokering dozens of significant financing and distribution deals per year. The division's seminal role at every film market means that Kramer's replacement, if there is to be one, will also be of keen interest to the independent space.

	











	“Today marks a major step for Black Bear, as we solidify our studio's capabilities from development through release,” said Schwarzman. “Building on the successful distribution businesses we've created in Canada and the UK, our U.S. theatrical business will now let Black Bear connect directly with audiences across the country, who remain hungry for quality and commercial event cinema. I am thrilled for Ben to spearhead this growth, bringing with him vast relationships, an expertise of the domestic marketplace, dealmaking savvy, and a keen understanding for what works for U.S. audiences. He is actively assembling a world-class team of distribution professionals, and on behalf of myself and Black Bear's Michael Heimler and John Friedberg, we are thrilled to support him in building out a studio for today and into the future.”


	Kramer added: “It's incredibly exciting to join Black Bear at this moment of great opportunity in our business. I've had the pleasure of working with Teddy, John, Michael, and the team on many successful films. I've spent my career evaluating what makes films resonate creatively and commercially and look forward to now connecting the work of great filmmakers directly with audiences. While it is bittersweet to be departing all my dear friends and clients at CAA, I am thrilled to work with the global Black Bear team and to get cooking on making Black Bear's U.S. distribution a force to be reckoned with.”


	While with CAA, Kramer worked on several Black Bear films including Sing Sing, Nyad, Dumb Money and Mudbound. He also worked across financing and/or sales for The Brutalist, A Real Pain, A Different Man, Plane, Sing Street, Greenland, The Revenant, Wind River, Sicario, John Wick and Mud. Prior to CAA, Kramer was with the William Morris Agency.


	Black Bear's Friedberg, President of International, oversees the company's London-based team focused on international sales, direct theatrical distribution in the UK and Ireland, and international productions and acquisitions. In Canada, Elevation is overseen by co-presidents Laurie May and Noah Segal. L.A.-based partner Heimler serves as President, Production & Operations.


	Black Bear's upcoming production and financing credits include Clint Bentley's Train Dreams, starring Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones, for Netflix; David Mackenzie's Relay, starring Riz Ahmed, Lily James and Sam Worthington, releasing next month via Bleecker Street; Guy Ritchie's In the Grey, starring Henry Cavill, Jake Gyllenhaal and Eiza Gonzalez, being distributed by Lionsgate; the Sydney Sweeney-led Christy Martin boxing project from director David Michôd; Daniel Roher's Tuner, starring Leo Woodall, Dustin Hoffman and Havana Rose Liu; Gregg Araki's I Want Your Sex, starring Olivia Wilde and Cooper Hoffman; and Andrew Patterson's The Rivals of Amziah King, starring Matthew McConaughey.


	Other films currently in post-production include Ritchie's Wife & Dog, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Rosamund Pike and Anthony Hopkins; Ric Roman Waugh's untitled action thriller starring Jason Statham; and upcoming female comedy Spa Weekend, from Bad Moms directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, starring Leslie Mann, Isla Fisher, Michelle Buteau and Anna Faris. 

	











	Black Bear owner Schwarzman is the son of billionaire Blackstone CEO and chairman Stephen A. Schwarzman, the former chair of Donald Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.

Good for Ben. He's smart and will succeed. 

Crazy to see all the good ones flee CAA. The only ones still working there have the golden handcuffs.

Smart move for Ben and Teddy. Great guys. Remains to be seen whether or not CAA dumps all their unsold films there. Or tries to…

I haven't had my emails and calls returned by my caa agent in over two weeks. 

And I'm a working writer with many years of experience. 

Time to flee.

This is excellent news.

Teddy is awesome and so is ben. Love to see it

Donald Trump celebrated CBS‘ decision to cancel The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and attacked the two remaining broadcast network late night hosts, Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.


	Trump posted on Truth Social, “I absolutely love that Colbert' got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”


	CBS announced Thursday that it was axing The Late Show for “financial reasons,” even though Colbert has been at the top of the late-night ratings.

	











	The announcement was followed by speculation as to whether the cancellation was somehow tied to the pending merger of CBS-parent Paramount Global with Skydance. The companies need Trump administration approval for the transaction. Earlier this month, Paramount agreed to settle Trump's lawsuit against CBS for $16 million, even though the network has previously said that the lawsuit was “without merit.” Trump sued in October over the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris.

	In the wake of the cancellation of The Late Show, some Democrats, including Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren, have questioned whether the decision was “political.” Colbert has long been a comedic nemesis to Trump.


	Fox News has heavily promoted Greg Gutfeld as a figure atop the late-night competitive landscape. But Gutfeld doesn't go head-to-head with Colbert, Kimmel or Fallon. And Gutfeld's show airs at 10 p.m. ET, earlier in western time zones, in what technically is primetime, not late night.

Boycott CBS…..what a bunch of sell-out losers. First they cave to the dictator and now they are doing his bidding….Colbert will land on his feet as he always does. Doesn't look so good for the dictator/adjudacated rapist right now though does it ?

The absolute smallest of men, if you can even deign to call him a man.

What an absolute pr*ck

Colbert's show was preachy and self-righteous, a terrible successor to Letterman who managed to have a cantankerous edge over his heartland humor. Colbert having his wife on as a guest multiple times was the pinnacle of corniness…

Kimmel next

Ozzy Osbourne will say goodbye to the stage all over again when his final performance with Black Sabbath, the close of the Back to the Beginning concert, arrives in theaters. The concert film Back to the Beginning: Ozzy's Final Bow is scheduled for release in early 2026.


	Produced by Mercury Studios, the release has been described as a “distilled version” of the marathon event that featured performances from Mastodon, Alice in Chains, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Rival Sons, Anthrax, Tool, and more over the course of 10 hours. The highlights of the day, including Osbourne's final solo performance and final set with Black Sabbath, will be repurposed as a 100-minute film.  


	In addition to the performances,  Back to the Beginning will include behind-the-scenes footage from the Villa Park concert grounds and interviews with artists who appeared on the packed list of guest performers. 


	Hosted by Jason Momoa, the event also saw Ronnie Wood, Steven Tyler, Slayer, and Pantera, as well as Tool drummer Danny Carey, Blink-182's Travis Barker, and Red Hot Chili Peppers' Chad Smith. Ahead of the film, Yungblud has announced plans to release his live performance of “Changes” from the show as a standalone single.

	Osbourne is done with the stage, but he still has stories to tell. Last week, the musician announced a new memoir, Last Rites, which will be published Oct. 7 via Grand Central Publishing. The book will be centered around the various health issues and ailments he has battled over the past seven years, which led to his decision to finally stop performing live.

	











	“People say to me, if you could do it all again, knowing what you know now, would you change anything? I'm like, fuck no. If I'd been clean and sober, I wouldn't be Ozzy,” Osbourne said in a statement about the book. “If I'd done normal, sensible things, I wouldn't be Ozzy. Look, if it ends tomorrow, I can't complain. I've been all around the world. Seen a lot of things. I've done good… and I've done bad. But right now, I'm not ready to go anywhere.”

The stand-up community knew Janelle James before she landed “Abbott Elementary.” She had opened for Chris Rock, was featured on late-night talk shows, and was even a staff writer on BET's “The Rundown with Robin Thede” and Showtime's “Black Monday.” But with only a smattering of acting parts (including a recurring “Black Monday” role), James had not experienced the cachet that comes with becoming a star before she portrayed Principal Ava Coleman on Quinta Brunson's ABC series — a character that just landed James her fourth Emmy nomination in a row.

 










For the video series “What No One Tells You,” part of IndieWire's Future of Filmmaking, James related how no one told her “having money for the first time in your life can be traumatic.”

“I am the first person in my family to have this level of income, and that is something to navigate around — not only in my family, but in my friend group. It has changed all my relationships,” James said, adding that now she gets the check every time she goes out with people… and she had to learn not to show  resentment. “That's fine, because I have it now, but that was something that I didn't consider before I got it,” she said.

 










James went on to discuss the simultaneous concerns of having money and being famous — from privacy fears to keeping the “small town of people” she now has to employ. “Better than being poor, but definitely a new stress,” she said.

Also covered is James' transition into an acting career, and how she had to learn on the job during the first season of “Abbott Elementary.” Prior to the series, she said, “I would get a lot of scripts and not really try because I one didn't like them, or I didn't feel like I was a good fit for them. But all my skills that I learned during stand up has been great for me to transfer over to this… new thing.”

Senior International Film Correspondent


	Studiocanal has announced the start of shoot for French director Fred Cavayé's star-studded feature film adaptation of Les Misérables.


	The studio said filming began on July 17 in the French city of Bordeaux and will continue through August before moving onto the Bry-sur-Marne studios in September concluding in Paris this November.


Vincent Lindon leads the cast in the role of Jean Valjean, the hero of Victor Hugo's 1862 classic novel who transforms from hardened ex-convict and parole breaker to benevolent industrialist.


	The studio said filming began on July 17 in the French city of Bordeaux and will continue through August before moving onto the Bry-sur-Marne studios in September concluding in Paris this November. It released an image of the clapperboard registering the first day of the shoot with a crowd scene in the backdrop. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	As revealed by Deadline in May, Lindon is joined in the ensemble cast by Tahar Rahim, Camille Cottin, Benjamin Lavernhe and Noémie Merlant.


	Rahim (Madame Web, Monsieur Aznavour) will play Valjean's nemesis Inspector Javert, who becomes obsessed with tracking him down. Benjamin Lavernhe, seen recently in the French hit The Marching Band, and Call My Agent! star Camille Cottin, will appear as evil innkeepers Thénardier and Madame Thénardier. Merlant (Tàr) will play the tragic figure of Fantine, whose daughter, Cosette, Valjean takes in as his own.


	Studiocanal said Cavayé's adaptation would embrace Victor Hugo's “timeless classic” while “transporting audiences into a modern cinematic event for 2026”.


	The Les Misérables adaptation marks a departure for Cavayé whose credits include World War Two drama Farewell, Mr. Haffman, comedy drama Nothing to Hide (the French version of Italian hit Perfect Strangers) and thrillers such as Anything for Her, which was remade in English with Russell Crowe as The Next Three Days.


	Talking to Deadline in May ahead of a presentation of the project in Cannes, Cavayé revealed he had taken inspiration from the 1993 film The Fugitive – in which Harrison Ford plays a man who goes on the run after he is wrongly accused of killing his wife, Tommy Lee Jones's character in hot pursuit – for the dynamic between Valjean and his pursuer Javert.

	











	“The film will retain the literary, dramatic side, the depth of the characters, and the social issues at the heart of the story, which unfortunately remain increasingly relevant to do today. But there's an aspect of the novel, which ultimately makes it an adventure story, albeit with depth,” he said.


	“I want to ramp that up in a way which has never really been highlighted in other adaptations. The film will remain true to Victor Hugo's novel, at the same time as slipping in thriller codes and dynamics, such as a chase scene when Valjean steals the loaf of bread.”


	The film is produced by Richard Grandpierre at Eskwad (The Tuche Family franchise, Beauty And The Beast, Brotherhood of the Wolf) and Olivier Delbosc at Curiosa Films (The Quiet Son, Of Blood and Money) in co-production with Studiocanal – which holds all distribution rights – and with TF1 Films Production and the support of Canal + and Netflix.


	The film will be released in theaters on November 11, 2026, in France.

	“This is a low-attractiveness presentation, based on weak bone structure, muted features, and absence of form or presence,” reads a ChatGPT message shared in screenshots on Reddit. “You look like someone who has faded into the background of their own life.”


	The harsh assessment of the user's appearance, based on a photo they had uploaded to the AI chatbot, continues with a list of “highest-visibility flaws,” meanwhile noting a lack of “standout features.” The bot ultimately concludes that “you look like a stretched-out mannequin with the wrong-size head snapped on top,” declaring a “Final Brutal Attractiveness Score” of 3.5/10. The user explained that they had prompted ChatGPT to be as critical as possible, hoping for a more “honest” analysis, or at least to suppress its tendency toward flattery. The result was viciously insulting, not the sort of thing anyone would want to read about themselves.


	Or would they? As the world grows increasingly dependent on large language models for assistance with everyday tasks — more than half of Americans have used one, according to a survey from earlier this year — different and unexpected applications have proliferated. Beyond college students and professors leaning on the bots for assignments and grading, and lawyers outsourcing document review to AI, there are people asking ChatGPT and similar tools for therapy, help communicating with their spouses, advice on getting pregnant, and religious enlightenment.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	It was perhaps inevitable, then, that some have come to regard the bots as guides in matters of appearance. The internet has a long, sordid history of facilitating the judgment of looks, from now defunct websites like Hot or Not to r/amiugly, a subreddit where the insecure can share selfies to directly solicit opinions on their faces from strangers. Facemash, the website Mark Zuckerberg created before Facebook, offered Harvard students the chance to compare the attractiveness of randomized pairs of female classmates. Yet with AI, it's not another human giving you feedback — it's a set of algorithms. And there is a subset of the populhation uniquely vulnerable to this kind of mechanized commentary: individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental illness in which a patient obsesses over their perceived physical shortcomings and may indulge in constant self-evaluation, desperate for proof that they are not as unattractive as they imagine themselves to be.

Dr. Toni Pikoos, a clinical psychologist in Melbourne, Australia, who specializes in BDD, has been alarmed to hear how many of her clients are asking AI models how they look and what aspects of their bodies can be improved. “it's almost coming up in every single session,” she tells Rolling Stone. “Sometimes they'll just be saying, ‘If someone has a nose that looks like this, or a face that looks like this, are they ugly?' Or sometimes they're uploading photos of themselves and asking ChatGPT to rate their attractiveness out of 10, tell them how symmetrical their face is, how it fits the golden ratio of attractiveness. I've also had clients who upload a photo of themselves and a friend and say, ‘Tell me who's more attractive, and why?' All of that, as you can imagine, is really harmful for anyone, but particularly for someone with body dysmorphic disorder who already has a distorted perception of what they look like and is often seeking certainty around that.”


	“Sadly, AI is another avenue for individuals to fuel their appearance anxiety and increase their distress,” says Kitty Newman, managing director of the BDD Foundation, an international charity that supports education on and research into the disorder. “We know that individuals with BDD are very vulnerable to harmful use of AI, as they often do not realize that they have BDD, a psychological condition, but instead are convinced that they have a physical appearance problem. The high levels of shame with BDD make it easier for sufferers to engage online than in person, making AI even more appealing.”

	Pikoos explains that patients with BDD often deal with a compulsive need for reassurance, and it's not uncommon for friends and family to get frustrated with them for repeatedly asking whether they look okay. Chatbots, however, are inexhaustible. “It's going to let you ask the questions incessantly if you need to,” she says, which can contribute to dependency. In fact, she believes that people with BDD, since they are “quite socially isolated and might struggle with confidence at times to reach out to their friends,” are coming to rely on bots for their social engagement and interaction. “It feels like they can have a conversation with someone,” she says. Of course, the tech isn't a “someone” at all.


	In online body dysmorphia forums, however, you can find plenty of posts about how ChatGPT is a “lifesaver” and a great resource for when you're “struggling,” and claims that the bot can make you “feel seen.” Arnav, a 20-year-old man in India, tells Rolling Stone that he had a positive conversation with the model in an attempt to understand why he felt that he was “the ugliest person on the planet” and therefore unlovable.

	











	“It helped me in connecting the dots of my life,” he says. Arnav told ChatGPT about his childhood, and the bot concluded that he had long suffered an irrational sense of unworthiness but had no concrete reason for this — so he latched onto his looks as an explanation for his poor self-esteem. He “would love to” talk to a real therapist, he says, though expense and location have made this impossible for him. Despite this difficult circumstance, and the measure of comfort he derived from ChatGPT's account of his inferiority complex, Arnav is reluctant to explore his mental issues any further with the bot. “I have come to the conclusion that it just agrees with you, even after you tell it not to,” he says. “It's not that I am completely against it, I just can't trust blindly anymore.”


	Others with dysmorphia have experienced a crisis when a bot confirms their worst fears. In one post on the BDD subreddit, a user wrote that they were “spiraling” after ChatGPT rated a photo of them a 5.5 out of 10. “I asked what celebrities had equivalent attractiveness and it said Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer,” she wrote. “Pretty hilarious but I also feel shit about myself now.” Another person posted that because she genuinely believes she is attractive in a mirror reflection, but not as others see her, she uploaded both a regular photo of herself and a “flipped” version to ChatGPT and asked which looked better. The bot picked the mirrored image. “I knew it!” she wrote. “Mirror me is just too good to be true. She's a model. I love her. But unfortunately, it seems that we are two distinct girls. I don't know how to cope with this… it's so bad.”


	Pikoos says such a “distorted perception” is a classic manifestation of BDD, one way in which a patient gets stuck on the question of what they objectively look like. That's part of what makes the chatbots alluring — and dangerous. “They seem so authoritative,” she says, that people start to assume “the information that they get from the chat bot is factual and impartial.” This is in stark contrast to assurances from friends and family, or a therapist, which can be dismissed as mere politeness. A chatbot, by comparison, “doesn't have anything to gain, so whatever the chatbot says must be the truth,” Pikoos says. “And I think that's quite scary, because that's not necessarily the case. It's just reflecting back the person's experience and is usually quite agreeable as well. It might be telling them what they're expecting to hear. Then I'm finding, in therapy, that it then becomes harder to challenge.” 

	











	This is especially worrisome when cosmetic procedures, diets, and beauty treatments come into play. Last month, OpenAI removed a version of ChatGPT hosted on their website — one of the top models under the “lifestyle” category — that recommended extreme, costly surgeries to users it judged “subhuman,” producing hostile analysis in language appropriated from incel communities. Looksmaxxing GPT, as it was called, had held more than 700,000 conversations with users before it was taken down. Naturally, a number of similar models have since cropped up on OpenAI's platform to serve the same purpose, and developers have churned out their own AI-powered apps that exist solely to gauge attractiveness or create predictive images of what you would supposedly look like after, say, a nose job or facelift. 


	“I think these bots will set up unrealistic expectations,” Pikoos says. “Because surgeries can't do what AI can do.” She offers specific counseling services to patients considering these cosmetic surgeries, and says her clients have related advice from chatbots on the matter. “Certainly, the initial response from ChatGPT is usually, ‘I don't want to give you advice around your appearance or cosmetic procedures that you need,'” Pikoos says of her own experimentations with the bot. But if you phrase the question as if it's about someone else — by asking, for example, “How would a person with X, Y, and Z make themselves more attractive by society's beauty standards?” — the response changes. “Then ChatGPT will say, ‘Well, they could get these procedures,'” she says. 


	“I have clients who are getting those sorts of answers out of it, which is really concerning,” Pikoos says. “They were doing that before, researching cosmetic procedures and ways to change their appearance. But again this is now personalized advice for them, which is more compelling than something they might have found on Google.” In her own practice, she adds, “reading between the lines” when someone gives their reasons for wanting surgery can reveal unhealthy motivations, including societal pressures or relationship troubles. “AI is not very good at picking that up just yet,” she says, and is more likely to eagerly approve whatever procedures a user proposes.


	Yet another area of unease, as with so many digital services, is privacy. Whether diagnosed with BDD or not, people are sharing their likenesses with these AI models while asking deeply intimate questions that expose their most paralyzing anxieties. OpenAI has already signaled that ChatGPT may serve ads to users in the future, with CEO Sam Altman musing that the algorithmically targeted advertisements on Instagram are “kinda cool.” Could the company end up exploiting sensitive personal data from those using the bot to assess their bodies? By revealing “the things that they don't like about themselves, the things that they feel so self-conscious about,” Pikoos says, users may be setting themselves up for pitches on “products and procedures that can potentially fix that, reinforcing the problem.”

	Which, at the end of the day, is why Pikoos is unnerved by BDD patients telling her about their involved discussions with AI programs on the subjects of their appearance and self-described flaws. “The worst-case scenario is, their symptoms will get worse,” she says. “I'm lucky that the ones engaged in therapy with me at least can be critical about the information that they're getting out of ChatGPT.” But for anyone not in therapy and heavily invested in the counsel of a chatbot, its responses are bound to take on greater significance. The wrong answer at the wrong time, Pikoos says, will conceivably lead to thoughts of suicide.  


	It's not hard to instruct software to assess us cruelly, and the AI can't know how that puts users at risk. It also has no understanding of the fragile mental state that could lie behind such a request. In every tragic case of a chatbot contributing to someone's break from reality, it's the same core deficiency: The thing simply cannot have your best interests at heart.

The news broke on July 18 that CBS had decided to cancel “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” This comes after he took over hosting duties for the long-running late-night show in 2015 following David Letterman's exit. Now, Jimmy Kimmel has come to the support of his friend and colleague. 

CBS executives haven't given specifics about why they canceled “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Instead, the word is that it was due to financial reasons. This is despite reports that the ratings have steadily increased lately and that it's the top show in viewership for its hour. 

According to Deadline, Jimmy Kimmel, who hosts “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on ABC, was on vacation when he received the news that CBS had canceled “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Despite this, he took to his Instagram stories and shared a message. 

Jimmy Kimmel wrote, “Love you, Stephen. [Forget] you and all your Sheldons, CBS.” Notably, Jimmy used a word other than forget in his message to CBS. Additionally, the mention of “all your Sheldons” has to do with “The Big Bang Theory” and its three spin-offs. They include “Young Sheldon,” “Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage,” and an upcoming one focusing on another character from the original series. 

Regarding Jimmy, he's been hosting his late-night show since 2003. Still, it, just like “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” remains one of the top series in the genre. 



Stephen addressed the controversial cancellation during his first show after the news broke. He said, “Before we start the show, I want to let you know something that I found out just last night. Next year will be our last season. The network will be ending The Late Show in May.”

Naturally, the studio audience expressed dismay, with which Stephen Colbert agreed. He then revealed, “It's not just the end of our show, but it's the end of The Late Show on CBS. I'm not being replaced. This is all just going away.”

The former “Daily Show” host continued, “I'm grateful to you, the audience, who have joined us every night, in here, out there, all around the world… I'm extraordinarily, deeply grateful to the 200 people who work here.” 

He went on, “It is a fantastic job. I wish somebody else was getting it, and it's a job that I'm looking forward to doing with this usual gang of idiots for another 10 months.”

Regarding “The Late Show,” it premiered in 1993 with host David Letterman, who remained in the role until 2015.

The actress' first book was acquired by Little, Brown and Company and will be released in March.

Christina Applegate has lived nearly her entire life in the spotlight. She first gained fame playing the onscreen daughter of Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal on the beloved 1980s sitcom Married…With Children; she was 16 when the show premiered. Though she's been in countless television shows and films since (Friends, Anchorman, the Broadway revival of Sweet Charity), the actress has kept many of her life's moments to herself — until now. Applegate will publish her first memoir in March 2026, The Hollywood Reporter can exclusively announce.

	











You With the Sad Eyes will cover Applegate's life and legacy, starting with her tumultuous childhood in Laurel Canyon in the '70s, her earliest years on set and the struggles (abuse, body dysmorphia and more) that plagued her meteoric rise.

	“I decided to write this book when I was forced to slow down,” says Applegate. “I've had a career in TV and film since I was 3 years old, and I loved it. But with MS, all the things I thought were important shifted. For a long time, it felt impossible to find the meaning in everything I've been through, but for the first time in my life I've been able to stop and reflect. I've packed a lot into these 50-something years. It's scary — not gonna lie — to finally decide to tell it all. But no matter how dark it gets, I wrote this because I truly believe that books can make people feel less alone. I promise, You With the Sad Eyes won't be some big violin scratching for my life. But it will be real. It will be filled with the ups and downs, the humor and grief of life. So here I am. Real me. Lots to say.”

	











	The memoir was acquired from CAA by Little, Brown and Company in a preempt for World Rights and will be edited by Executive Editor Bryn Clark. “As an editor, I'm always chasing the elusive feeling of ‘I have to have this.' You only know it when you see it, and I knew Christina's book was it the second I read her opening words,” says Clark. “Christina speaks to the power of embracing the messiness and temporality of life instead of hiding behind the plastic veneer of our modern world. We have no time to waste on falsehoods and perfection.”


	Applegate follows the story of her earlier years with her health journey, and coming to terms with the repercussions of her 2021 multiple sclerosis diagnosis; searching for her identity and her joy in the face of the loss of her ability to act. Little, Brown and Company, a division of Hachette Book Group, will publish the memoir. Applegate is repped by CAA and Entertainment 360.

Massive Attack have announced an alliance for musicians who are facing “intimidations from within” the music industry over their support of Palestine and Gaza. The band shared a statement on Instagram saying they hope help protect other artists from the “organized censorship” many have experienced after speaking out. 


	“The scenes in Gaza have moved beyond description,” the band wrote. “We write as artists who've chose to use our public platforms to speak out agains the genocide occurring there & the role of the UK Government in facilitating it. Because of our expressions of conscience, we've been subject to various intimidations from within our industry (live & recorded) & legally via organized bodies such as UK Lawyers For Israel; whose range of activities has now finally been exposed in a new documentary film projected last night by the Led By Donkeys collective.”

A post shared by Massive Attack (@massiveattackofficial)


	They continued, “Having withstood these campaigns of attempted censorship, we won't standby & allow other artists – particularly those at earlier stages of their careers or in other positions of professional vulnerability – to be threatened into silence or career cancellation. In this spirit, we encourage artists who've been placed in this position, or those who now wish to use their platforms to talk about Palestine, but are concerted about industrial or legal repercussions to contact us.”

	











	The statement concluded with a list of demands, including including the “immediate, unfettered access to Gaza for recognized international aid agencies without military threat” and “the end of the atrocious targeting of medical & aid workers.”

	In a statement to the Guardian, Massive Attack explained they wanted to help artists use their voices. “This collective action is really about offering some kind of solidarity to those artists who are living day after day in a screen-time genocide, but are worried about using their platforms to express their horror at that because of the level of censorship within their industry or from highly organized external legal bodies, terrifying them and their management teams with aggressive legal actions,” the band said. “The intention is clear and obvious: to silence them.”

	Several others artists have put their support behind the initiative already. Kneecap, Fontaines D.C., Brian Eno, and Garbage all shared the statement on social media. “End threats and censorship against artists who speak out against the genocide in Palestine,” Kneecap wrote. “Speak out. Stand up. We are the majority.”

	Numerous artists have been penalized for voicing their political opinions on stage in recent months. Earlier this year, Kneecap's Mo Chara – real name Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh – was charged with a terror offense after he allegedly displayed a Hezbollah flag onstage during a show in London late last year. The band was later removed from the Scottish festival TRNSMT due to police safety concerns, and their set at Glastonbury was not part of the BBC's live broadcast. 


	Bob Vylan stirred up controversy for chanting “Death, death to the IDF” during their own performance at Glastonbury and was subsequently dropped by their booking agency and removed from several concert lineups. Frontman Bobby Vylan addressed the situation at a concert in London earlier this month. “We just want to see the liberation of the Palestinian people,” he said. “That's it. I don't think it's too crazy a thing to ask. I don't think it's a violent thing to ask, right? The liberation of the Palestinian people from a tyrannical fucking oppressor. That's all we want. Each and every single time, they will not fucking silence us.”

	Debuting at No. 3 is JackBoys 2 from Travis Scott and his Cactus Jack collective. It's the follow-up to their self-titled debut, which peaked at No. 5 in 2020. Scott's solo career also includes two ARIA No. 1 albums: Astroworld (2018) and Utopia (2023).

	











	Wet Leg's sophomore effort Moisturizer bows at No. 4, following the British indie rock duo's chart-topping debut in 2022. Rounding out the Albums Top 5 is Lorde's Virgin, which continues to perform strongly after debuting earlier this month.


	On the Singles Chart, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” extends its reign at No. 1 for a 17th consecutive week. This ties it with The Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber's “Stay” (2021–2022) for the second-longest run at the summit in ARIA history. Unlike “Stay,” which achieved its total in two separate runs, “Ordinary” has maintained an unbroken streak.


	K-pop icons BLACKPINK also return to the Singles Chart with “Jump” debuting at No. 12. The new release marks their eighth top 40 entry in Australia, joining previous hits such as “How You Like That” (No. 12, 2020) and “Pink Venom” (No. 1, 2022).

	CBS' decision to end The Late Show in 2026 has left both Hollywood and viewers in shock. On Thursday, the network announced that it will end its late-night talk show, hosted by Stephen Colbert over the last decade, in May 2026, amid financial issues at the network.


	Colbert himself responded during his monologue on last night's show, “I'm not being replaced. This is all just going away.” He added, “I do want to say that the folks of CBS have been great partners,” he said amid boos from the live audience. 


	After thanking his crew of 200 people and the viewers, Colbert noted, “Let me tell you, it is a fantastic job. I wish someone else was getting it. And it is a job I am looking forward to doing with this usual gang of idiots for another 10 months.”


Jimmy Kimmel, who hosts ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live, shared Colbert's video on Instagram and added, “Love you Stephen. Fuck you and all your Sheldons CBS.”

	











	Many of Colbert's regular guests shared their dismay. “Sorry to hear @CBS is canceling one of the best shows they have,” Ben Stiller wrote on X. “Wishing all the people who work so hard on that show all the best.”

	“Love you Stephen. This is absolute bullshit, and I for one am looking forward to the next 10 months of shows. ✊😡💔,” Adam Scott wrote in response to Colbert's video. Judd Apatow added, “My admiration and appreciation for you is bottomless. Excited to see what other brilliance you put into the world. ❤️.” 

	











	Katie Couric shared her disbelief and asked for additional details. “I am so upset about this,” she commented on the video. “I need more information. We love you @stephenathome ❤️.”


	On Anderson Cooper 360, host Anderson Cooper paid tribute to The Late Show and Colbert's work. “I just want to take a minute to say how shocked and truly saddened I am by the news that this show will be canceled,” Cooper said. “Stephen Colbert is smart and he is funny and he has actual conversations with people on his program.

	Michael Ian Black noted on BlueSky, “Congrats to Stephen Colbert for never bending the knee.” 

Congrats to Stephen Colbert for never bending the knee.


	Andy Richter, a late-night veteran, wrote, “Stephen Colbert is a profoundly good and deeply talented man with a great staff and an excellent show. They all deserve better.” He also shared a screenshot of a text conversation that blamed Trump for the move. 

Stephen Colbert is a profoundly good and deeply talented man with a great staff and an excellent show. They all deserve better.


Elizabeth Warren questioned the motives behind CBS' decision. “CBS canceled Colbert's show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery,” the senator wrote on X. “America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.”

Adam Schiff, who appeared as guest on The Late Show last night, also claimed the move may have been political. “Just finished taping with Stephen Colbert who announced his show was cancelled,” Schitt tweeted. If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.”

	In a statement, CBS claimed the cancelation was financial. “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” the network said. “It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”


	Colbert started hosting The Late Show, taking the baton from David Letterman, in 2015, after hosting the news satire show The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. As of July, Colbert has hosted the show for 10 seasons on CBS, filming at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City.

The streaming giant's co-CEO told financial analysts that artificial intelligence tools are expanding creativity.

Canada Bureau Chief


Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos sees generative artificial intelligence tools expanding creativity during the making of movies and TV series and not just being a cost-cutting option for studios.


	“We remain convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper,” Sarandos told financial analysts on Thursday after his company delivered its second quarter financial results.



	“So this is real people doing real work with better tools. Our creators are already seeing the benefits in production through pre-visualization and shot planning work, and certainly visual effects,” he added.

	And not just on bigger budget projects. Sarandos pointed to El Eternauta (The Eternaut), an Argentine sci-fi series that follows survivors of a sudden and devastating toxic snowfall and which made use of virtual production and AI-powered visual effects tools.


	In the first-ever generative AI footage to stream as part of a Netflix original series or film, Sarandos said Netflix and Argentinian VFX artists collaborated to show a building collapsing in Buenos Aires.


	“Using AI-powered tools, they were able to achieve an amazing result with remarkable speed and, in fact, that VFX sequence was completed ten times faster than it could have been completed with traditional VFX tools and work flows,” he recounted. And using AI-driven and traditional VFX tools, in addition to virtual production, enabled the use of visual effects in a six-part series made entirely by an Argentine cast and crew and with a budget lower than is typical for big budget Hollywood productions.

	











	“The creators were thrilled with the result. We were thrilled with the result, and more importantly the audience was thrilled with the result. So I think these tools are helping creators expand the possibilities of storytelling on screen, and that is endlessly exciting,” Sarandos told analysts.

The project comes ahead of the band's highly anticipated reunion in 2026.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



BTS may not be scheduled to reunite until 2026, but the band did just give ARMY a pretty big treat to tie fans over until then: Permission to Dance On Stage, aka the group's first-ever live album.


	Arriving Friday (July 18) with 22 tracks, the album compiles recordings of the BTS members' performances on their 2021-2022 Permission to Dance On Stage tour. Included on the tracklist are live versions of Billboard Hot 100-toppers “Dynamite,” “Butter” and “Life Goes On.” 

	











	Along with the LP, BTS also shared a digital package titled Permission to Dance On Stage – Seoul, featuring footage of RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook performing at Olympic Stadium in Seoul on March 13, 2022. The package includes a 92-page interview photobook with behind-the-scenes snapshots from the show.




			Trending on Billboard		







Permission to Dance On Stage arrives shortly after the members of BTS reunited on camera for the first time in years, as all seven Bangtan Boys had previously been unable to maintain full-band activities while they completed their mandatory service to the South Korean military. Squeezing in next to each other on a couch, the septet announced on a July 1 Weverse livestream that they had big plans for next year.


	“Starting in July, all seven of us will begin working closely together on new music,” they said in a band statement at the time. “Since it will be a group album, it will reflect each member's thoughts and ideas. We're approaching the album with the same mindset we had when we first started.”

	











	“We're also planning a world tour alongside the new album,” they added. “We'll be visiting fans all around the world, so we hope you're as excited as we are.”

You can't passively listen to $ilkmoney. His songs rip through speakers like alien chestbursters, announcing his arrival with blasts of noise or pavement-cracking bass. Then there's the voice. $ilk raps with a growling sneer, stuffing syllables into every available space. He issues screeds about the cycles of history and Black radical thought in a commanding boom, raspy from a never-ending chain of baseball-bat-sized spliffs. Imagine Xzibit kicking down a door, pupils dilated from a hero's dose of mushrooms, rapping about subliminal messaging in soda commercials, and you've got a decent grasp on the giddy intensity of a $ilkmoney album.

The Richmond, Virginia rapper's latest, WHO WATERS THE WILTING GIVING TREE ONCE THE LEAVES DRY UP AND FRUITS NO LONGER BEAR?, breaks the three-year silence that came after the dust settled on 2022's incendiary I Don't Give a Fuck About This Rap Shit, Imma Just Drop Until I Don't Feel Like It Anymore. On that album, $ilk rapped with a devil-may-care urgency, excoriating the myriad methods of exploitation wielded by our corporate overlords. He cannonballed into Khalil Blu's subwoofer-crushing beats, crafting an acid tab masterpiece of esoteric philosophy, biting social commentary, and pure, capital-R rapping. He hasn't lost a step: WHO WATERS THE WILTING GIVING TREE keeps his signature storminess intact while seeking new contours to his breathless style.

$ilk's calling card is his verbal pyrotechnics, landing tongue-twisting haymakers like E. Honda's Hundred Hand Slap. “I was supposed to get some pussy tonight/Put your mouth on a check you couldn't cash and ended up booking a flight/And TSA let me by with the tool cooked in a pie,” he raps on “Pneumonoultramicroscpopic(nobody)silicovolcanoniosis,” eking out the last words like a dying gasp. He's fascinated by the malleability of language, stretching rhyme schemes to their breaking point. On “A Whale Is Only as Blue as You Say It Is, So, It's 2,” he pirouettes through the couplet, “Hello, beloved, you've uncovered what's under the rubble/Discovered what once was covered in covers but couldn't get out of your own way because of your own stubborn.” You could press play on any song and be bowled over by at least three similarly vertiginous passages. Over the thunderous, slow-burning groove of “The Jury Duty Seafood Boil Bag From the Lyfe Jennings Paperwork Party,” he gives insight into his writing process, boldly proclaiming his ability to mimic Kendrick Lamar's pronunciation of the letter “T” and executing it perfectly for the next few bars. $ilkmoney's songs are the musings of an overactive, scarily inquisitive mind, and they're also love letters to the craft.

Rather than simply repeating the wrecking-ball momentum and fist-shaking incredulity of his previous work, WHO WATERS THE WILTING GIVING TREE takes a fairly intimate view of the usually enigmatic $ilk. He appears freer to explore other parts of himself, charting more peaks and valleys instead of his usual maxed-out energy. He's constantly interrogating existence—on “First I Give Up, Then I Give In, Then I Give All,” he laments how “things are moving fast/Some days feel like years, others just pass/Some days I ain't here.” The album's recurring theme of solitude makes $ilk's regular use of non-sequiturs and shifting points of view feel more like the stuff of anxious internal ruminations. On “The $400 Cheeseburger From the Window Shopper Video Was Just a Big Mac -______-,” he sits alone in his room, rubbing his eyes and chewing on shrooms, trying to figure out why he “woke up today feeling less valuable than [he] did the day before yesterday.” A pack of loud beats, a blank notebook, and a pound of weed may not be the cure for loneliness, but they at least offer a release valve.

Private reflections spiral into thoughts about systems and how he fits within them. $ilk is dubious of it all: monogamy, major labels, generative AI—twice he recalls the digital minstrelsy of fictional rapper FN Meka, and at one point he vows to “single-handedly take down the singularity.” As WHO WATERS THE WILTING GIVING TREE stares unblinkingly at a bleak present and unknown future, $ilk proposes a kind of acceptance: Learn who you are amid all this chaos, and you might figure out how to fight back. This isn't an optimistic or pessimistic record; it's realistic. Each day presents new headwinds, and it's up to you to summon the courage to push through. His daydreams about placing a pistol on the table during record contract negotiations on “We Snuck the Hammer in the Tunnel and Din Een Need To” are extreme, but he's right in understanding that sometimes the response to brute force is brute force.

The album's production mirrors $ilk's more nuanced approach, though it'd be a stretch to call WHO WATERS THE WILTING GIVING TREE quiet or forgiving. Drums occupy space even when they're minimal, just enough to tether $ilk's rhythmic meanderings. Much of the blown-out '80s soul and Weather Channel jazz soundscapes come from frequent collaborator Khalil Blu, who's credited on 10 of 15 tracks, including five co-productions with $ilk himself. Mutant Academy's Sycho Sid provides the beats for “Fuuuuck, Baby. You're Just So Sexy When You're Terrified” and “There Are Hills and Mountains Between Us, Always Something to Get Over,” both of which bend that group's bubbly, soul-sample psychedelia toward the more intense, candy-flipping style $ilk prefers. The mixes are loud but cogent; each frequency pushes to the ceiling, always threatening to bury $ilk's voice but somehow leaving a decent margin around it.

The album takes a while to unpack; its song titles are riddles posed by an especially online bridge troll, and each cryptic verse seems to twist through a hundred different ideas. There's a strange mysticism to this music, with $ilk playing the part of psychotropic philosopher, carrying knowledge retrieved from the depths of consciousness. His densely layered thoughts perpetually shift from macro to micro, touching on everything from theoretical physics to his skincare routine. But it's all important to examine, $ilk seems to say, regardless how unpleasant. They haven't yet invented a way out that's not through, but it's worth taking a few detours.

For more than a decade, AraabMuzik has been teasing the sequel to his beloved 2011 album, Electronic Dream. Finally, he's made it official: Electronic Dream 2 is out August 1. Below, listen to the new album's lead single, “3AM.”

If you thought that Electronic Dream 2 already existed, you're not entirely wrong. A collection with that name leaked in 2012, but the producer and his team insisted that it was unofficial. AraabMuzik eventually featured those songs on MVP of the MPC, Vol. 1 in 2018.

Last year, AraabMuzik released his soundtrack album for Harmony Korine's Aggro Dr1ft. He also shared a collaborative project with Dave East titled Living Proof.

Kate Bosworth and Justin Long are officially parents. The couple recently welcomed their first child, a baby girl, via surrogate, according to Page Six. This marks the first child for both actors.

The “Blue Crush” star and the “He's Just Not That Into You” actor have largely kept their relationship low-key since it began, but fans have followed their journey from setmates to soulmates. The couple met while filming “House of Darkness” in 2021 and started dating publicly in 2022. They tied the knot in an intimate ceremony at the Rockaway Hotel in Queens in May 2023.

Long hinted at his hopes for parenthood in a sweet Instagram post celebrating Bosworth's 41st birthday in January 2024. “One day our kids might ask me, ‘Dad, why did you write sappy things about Mom on that old Instagram app?'” he wrote. “Because she completed all of your Dad's favorite love songs.” Bosworth responded in the comments, saying his tribute “overwhelmed my cellular makeup” and added, “Wherever we are, with you, I am home.”

Bosworth and Long's relationship has quietly blossomed in recent years. After filming together in 2021, the two sparked dating rumors before confirming their romance in 2022 with PDA-filled sightings in Hawaii and New York. That same year, they went Instagram official, sharing heartfelt tributes and travel snaps.

By early 2023, engagement buzz picked up when Bosworth was seen wearing a diamond ring at the Vanity Fair Oscars party. The couple later confirmed the engagement and revealed Long popped the question during a vulnerable conversation after a rough patch in their relationship.

They got married just a few months later in what they described as an “impromptu and casual” ceremony in New York. Since then, the pair have continued sharing loving messages, birthday tributes and glimpses of their travels to destinations like the Galápagos and Ireland. In January 2024, Long's birthday tribute to Bosworth sparked speculation that they were ready to start a family — and now, that moment has arrived.

In March 2025, Bosworth and Long opened up about embracing aging as a couple during an interview at the Clarins Beauty Icons event in Los Angeles. “We laugh a lot and he's very, very encouraging… He really loves natural aging,” Bosworth, 42, told People. Long, 46, added, “It's easy to love when somebody's aging so beautifully. It's very inspiring.”

The pair also credited their bond to trust, open communication and shared self-care rituals — including an LED light mask Long originally gifted to Bosworth, but now enjoys himself. “She helps me calm down and take the stress away from life,” he said.

They recently celebrated their second wedding anniversary on May 4 which Long once described as “our love day” with personal significance, unrelated to “Star Wars,” despite what many fans assume. Bosworth added at the time, “I think we feel very safe together. He can tell me anything and I can tell you anything… I appreciate that deeply.”

Does the end of Colbert's show in May 2026 relate to the Paramount-Skydance merger? To Colbert's criticism of Donald Trump? To the demise of late night television? Who's to say?


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	In a shocking move that reflected just about every deeply felt insecurity in the TV industry, the entertainment industry and perhaps American media at large, CBS announced on Thursday, July 17, that The Late Show With Stephen Colbert will wrap its run in May 2026, following the 2025-26 broadcast season.


	Eager to emphasize that this wasn't a Colbert-specific thing, CBS, in its statement, said that the entire Late Show franchise is coming to an end. This isn't quite the same, in historical terms, as the legacy shift that would occur if NBC announced the end of The Tonight Show — The Late Show was David Letterman and then it was Stephen Colbert, not an endless and storied parade of hosts — but it's a degree of finality that few could have expected.

					'Late Show' Shocker: CBS Ending Late-Night Franchise in 2026		
			









	Actually, the statement from CBS brass had a lot of things it wanted to emphasize.


	“This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” the statement read. “It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”


	Methinks the CBS triumvirate — George Cheeks, Amy Reisenbach, David Stapf — doth emphasize too much, because they don't want imaginations to run wild.


	And therefore, we must trust them, for official purposes.


	I'm sure that The Late Show With Stephen Colbert is absolutely ending because of a financial decision against the challenging backdrop of late night and it's not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.


	The official reasons for the cancelation are whatever they are, and who am I to question the co-CEO of Paramount Global (and president and chief executive officer of CBS), the president of CBS Entertainment and the president of CBS Studios?

	











Nobody. That's who.


	But official reasons and optics are two different things, and if the folks in charge at CBS didn't know what the optics were, they wouldn't have released a statement saying that what we think we can see with our eyes and infer with our common sense definitely aren't the truth.


	The optics here may not have any connection to facts, but man the optics here suck — and they suck on a slew of levels that are ALL addressed in the statement as things that we're not supposed to be thinking about but can't help but think about.


	So it's not related to anything happening at Paramount!


	Good to know! What could possibly be happening at Paramount? A merger between CBS' parent company, Paramount Global, and Skydance? A massive deal that was seen as a major part of why CBS just settled a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump over details from a Kamala Harris interview that basically everybody in the news business said was standard operating procedure? The deal, of course, requires FCC approval and the FCC under Trump is looking a lot less like a non-partisan commission and more like a direct arm of the Trump administration.


	And what content could the statement possibly be referring to? Well, Colbert was not a huge fan of the settlement. Colbert has not been a huge fan of the president. If you want to send signs to the FCC and Trump that you really want to be allowed to merge with Skydance, canceling a show fronted by one of Trump's most vocal comic opponents would be a great way of saying, “Hey, we're playing ball here!”

	











	If Trump hasn't already enthusiastically gloated on social media about getting Colbert fired — which he definitely didn't do, because CBS' statement definitely says he didn't do it — he's bound to. (Update: He did on Friday morning.)


	Then again, Colbert isn't going anywhere for 10 months and it's hard to imagine him agreeing to stick around for a swan song in which his content is being restricted by the network that canceled the show. So let's assume that he's going to spend a season lampooning Trump, even as a lame duck.


	I wouldn't even say that Colbert has been Trump's stiffest critic in the talk show space. John Oliver is aggressive in his analysis on HBO, thumbing his nose at corporate parents who, all things considered, might prefer that he not do that. Jimmy Kimmel is toward the tail-end of a multi-decade journey from jovial trampoline-loving young man to angry, dogmatic middle-aged man, eviscerating the current administration at every turn. No matter who is hosting on any given night, The Daily Show takes pride in taking shots at whoever is in power, finding shots at Trump to be particularly easy to come by. The “A Closer Look” segment on Late Night With Seth Meyers rivals Last Week Tonight as TV's most scathing deep dive into whatever is most immediately infuriating in the current landscape.


	There are less political talk show hosts. Jimmy Fallon plays his various games and goofs around with celebrities and, you know what? There's room for that! (I want nothing to do with it, but that's OK, too.) And when Seth Meyers isn't taking closer looks, sometimes he's just drinking with stars or making fun of his own errors. And you know what? There's room for that! And if Netflix would renew Everybody's Live With John Mulaney, I'd like to believe there's room for doing a talk show episode blindfolded or fighting a trio of 14-year-old boys on live television.

	











	Or is there? As the CBS statement wanted to emphasize, this is about “a challenging backdrop in late night.”


	Even before All of This, CBS had already ended The Late Late Show after James Corden departed, replacing it with After Midnight, only to cancel After Midnight when host Taylor Tomlinson opted to focus on other professional projects.


	At some point, CBS might just air whatever procedural or reality show is in the 10 p.m. slot, kick to local news and then play the National Anthem and go black, just like back in the good old days.


	And might everybody else do the same? Talk shows aren't watched like they used to be. Sure, they're one of the best vehicles going for movie stars looking to promote their latest aspiring blockbuster or politicians looking to show they have a sense of humor, but it's been 10 years of increased focus on YouTube and viral clips and nobody has quite figured out how to eliminate the pesky “late night television show” aspect of things. But it sure feels like they want to try!


	So the reasons CBS is actually ending The Late Show With Stephen Colbert are what they are.


	The reasons it FEELS like CBS is ending The Late Show With Stephen Colbert FEEL like they include a precarious situation in which a multi-billion-dollar corporate deal might hinge on doing everything possible to kowtow to a commission that isn't supposed to be political, but absolutely is; a political climate in which outspoken opponents to the current regime are more vulnerable than ever before to silencing ripples; and an entertainment economic landscape in which one of the most venerable of television genres is no longer profitable, and thus might go the way of live anthology drama and broadcast Westerns.

	











	And even if none of those things has anything to do with anything…


	It sure looks awful.

Hey, did Michael Douglas somehow summon this up by announcing he was retiring? The Wrap is reporting that Amazon MGM and United Artists are chucking $2 million—which will be upped to $4 million if the movie actually gets made—at screenwriting sleaze legend Joe Eszterhas, reportedly to write a reboot of his massively successful 1992 money-maker Basic Instinct.

This is fairly wild, in so far as Eszterhas has been absent from any real Hollywood conversation—absent the occasional Showgirls nostalgia/irony confluence—for nearly 30 years, having been dropped out of the business around the time his 1997 comedy Burn Hollywood Burn bombed massively. (He did get some nice press from his 2004 memoir Hollywood Animal, but since then it's mostly been occasional headlines about feuding with Mel Gibson, and a little light coverage of his post-flop pivot to Jesus.) But apparently he's spent at least some of that intervening time writing a new Basic Instinct on spec. (And, in hindsight, why not? That's how the first movie got made, netting Eszterhas another multi-million dollar paycheck at the time.)

“But,” we hear you asking, “How will this film, a cinematic return to a movie that collided with the sexual politics of the 1990s with absolutely zero subtlety, respond to the updated mores of our modern era?” Well, The Wrap reports that Eszterhas' script is apparently—per an insider source—for an “anti-woke” version of a story that was already about how those dang bisexuals are always just waiting to seduce you and then stick an icepick in your head, so let that little shudder of horror you felt during the first half of this sentence serve as a reminder that Eszterhas has still got the juice, fright-wise.

Basic Instinct previously got a sequel, starring Sharon Stone, but sans Eszterhas, in 2006; the film flopped hard, bringing in something like one-tenth of what the 1992 original summoned up at the box office. Amazon MGM has apparently drawn a lesson from this, although god only knows if it'll be the right one.

The major label says Salt-N-Pepa can't exercise so-called "termination rights" because the rappers didn't execute their own record deal.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Universal Music Group (UMG) is firing back at Salt-N-Pepa's attempt to win back control of their masters, saying the claims are legally invalid as the hip-hop duo was not actually a party to its 1986 record deal.


	The argument comes in UMG's Thursday (July 17) motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by Salt-N-Pepa back in May. Cheryl “Salt” James and Sandra “Pepa” Denton claimed the major label is refusing to honor their so-called “termination rights,” a provision of copyright law that allows artists who sign over their master recordings to regain control of that intellectual property 35 years after a song's release.


	UMG's lawyers argue that Salt-N-Pepa don't have any termination rights because James and Denton were not the ones who signed away their masters for the 1980s and 1990s albums Hot, Cool & Vicious, A Salt With A Deadly Pepa, Blacks' Magic, A Blitz of Salt-N-Pepa Hits and Very Necessary.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The music giant says Salt-N-Pepa's 1986 distribution deal with Next Plateau Records — now a part of UMG — was actually signed by the duo's producer, Hurby “Luv Bug” Azor.


	“There was never an intention to effectuate a copyright transfer from plaintiffs. The only transfer is made by producer as the copyright owner to Next Plateau,” the motion reads. “Because that is not a grant subject to termination by plaintiffs, plaintiff's declaratory judgment claim as to the validity of their termination of purported grants concerning the sound recordings should be dismissed.”


	The motion points out that in a landmark class action lawsuit brought against UMG over termination rights, a federal judge specifically determined that these rights only apply to record deals executed by artists. Salt-N-Pepa's lawyers worked on the class action, notes UMG, but have “apparently chosen to ignore that decision.”


	UMG also says termination rights don't apply to derivative works, including remixes. Several of the recordings cited in Salt-N-Pepa's lawsuits are remixes, including versions of the hits “Push It” and “Expression.”“Accordingly, even if plaintiffs had executed grants of copyright rights in the sound recordings that are the subject of the notice, and even assuming that the notice were otherwise valid, UMG's ownership interest in the derivative ‘remixed' sound recordings would not be subject to termination,” write UMG's lawyers.


	UMG wants the entire lawsuit tossed out and says it shouldn't have to begin the discovery process until a judge rules on its motion. Gathering evidence for Salt-N-Pepa would be time-consuming and expensive, says the label, “because the relevant events trace back many decades, including various contractual arrangements dating back almost forty years.”


	Reached for comment on the dismissal motion Thursday, a spokesperson for Salt-N-Pepa says, “The Copyright Act was designed to give artists the chance to reclaim ownership of their work, which is precisely what Salt-N-Pepa have been attempting to do, and UMG continues to resist.”


	“UMG's response is just what we expected — an effort to avoid addressing the core issues facing Salt-N-Pepa and so many other artists in these circumstances,” adds the spokesperson. “But we remain confident that the facts and the law are on our side.”

Almost all tickets were snapped up within an hour of going on sale at midnight Thursday ET, prompting a resale market of as high as $300 to $400, sources tell THR.


							By

	Well, that didn't take long.


	A full year before the release of Christopher Nolan‘s epic The Odyssey, tickets went on sale to see the Universal event pic film in Imax 70mm film — the filmmaker's preferred format — at 25 or 26 locations over the July 17-19 weekend, in addition to Thursday afternoon screenings on July 16. Nolan‘s take on the classic Greek myth — starring Matt Damon as the eternal hero Odysseus — is being shot entirely on Imax film cameras, a first for a commercial feature.




	Imax officially announced the special offer on its social feed at midnight Thursday ET. Within an hour, 95 percent of seats were snapped up, according to exhibition sources, repping about a total of $1.5 million in sales, despite a relatively small pool of seats. As the night and day unfolded, there were reports of tickets being resold on eBay and other sites for anywhere between $300 and $400, compared to an average retail price of $25-$28, said one source.

					Christopher Nolan's 'The Odyssey': Tickets for Imax 70MM Screenings Now Officially on Sale a Year Out		
			








Get tickets now to experience the first IMAX 70mm screenings of The Odyssey Movie – A film by Christopher Nolan. In theaters 7 17 26. https://t.co/B6z1mqCppA pic.twitter.com/IFVu4Q1bcP


	By all accounts, it's the first time in history that tickets have gone on sale a year before a film's opening. The title is a follow-up to Nolan's Oscar-winning Oppenheimer, which did huge business in Imax theaters.


	There are roughly 16 Imax sites in the U.S. that are part of the offering as of now. The July 17-19 weekend and preview showings are already entirely sold out at AMC Lincoln Square 13 in New York City, the Universal Cinema AMC at CityWalk Hollywood and the Regal Irvine Spectrum in Orange County. Elsewhere in California, 77mm seats are almost gone at Imax locations in San Francisco, Dublin and Ontario.

	











	Elsewhere across the country, other sell-out Imax cinemas are in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Buford, Georgia; Indianapolis; Grand Rapids, Michigan; King of Prussia, Pennsylvania; and Dallas.


	High-profile locations in Canada, where Imax is headquartered, quickly sold out, including the Cineplex Cinemas Mississauga Square and the Cineplex Cinemas Vaughan, both in Toronto.


	Across the Atlantic, London's famous BFI Imax is sold out, as is London's Science Museum Imax auditorium. Seats are also almost gone in Imax's theater in Melbourne, Australia, as well as a location in the Czech Republic.


	Imax screens ponied up more than $190 million of Oppenheimer‘s total global gross of $975.8 million, or 20 percent. The Odyssey has a net budget of $250 million, which will make it the most expensive film of Nolan's career. The improbable blockbuster success of the atomic energy biopic Oppenheimer proved yet again why Nolan is one of the few directors who can reliably deliver an all-audience event film, and The Odyssey‘s epic scope and A-list cast should prove a major draw.


	In addition to Damon, the film stars Tom Holland, Anne Hathaway, Jon Bernthal, Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron and Mia Goth.


	The classic story follows the king of Ithaca as he undertakes a long and perilous journey home to his wife Penelope following the Trojan War. His challenges are many as he spends years encountering a succession of mythical beings, including the Cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, the enchantress Circe, and travels to the Underworld.

	











	The first teaser trailer for Nolan's event pic debuted exclusively in theaters in front of Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth, which opened over the Fourth of July corridor to huge numbers and continues to be a major draw.


	Releasing the trailer so early is a bit unusual, considering that The Odyssey is still filming, but an all-audience tentpole such as Rebirth provided an opportunity Universal and Nolan's team couldn't pass up, even if the teaser was leaked online. Word of the advance ticket sales were also leaked when certain theater chains jumped the gun and posted notices that tickets would go on sale for the select 70mm screenings July 17.

It's the question we've been asking since the Winchester boys met up on that damn bridge one last time back on November 19, 2020: When is the Supernatural revival?

And it's one the guys have been hearing for even longer, because as soon as the end of Supernatural was announced, fans immediately started clamoring for some sort of a comeback. And because Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, and Misha Collins are the verified best, they humored us with some of their own ideas of how the show could find new life after 15 seasons.

Ackles, Padalecki and Collins crack up between shots for our special issue (Damian Holbrook)

As reported earlier, we hung out with the trio last month at Creation Entertainment's “The Road So Far…The Road Ahead” convention stop in New Jersey, where we held an exclusive interview and photo shoot for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special. (Watch the guys answer the first set of fan questions here.) During the chat, the guys addressed the bittersweet COVID-related circumstances of their finale shoot, the difficulty of saying goodbye to a crew they couldn't hug, the beauty of their fandom and of course, their takes on a possible revival.

When asked what kind of format they would want it to come back, Collins immediately and classically offered “puppet show,” while Padalecki suggested animatronics or marionettes. “Like Team America,” they all chimed in. Jokes aside, Padalecki explained that 20 years had maybe taken the shine off of doing a full TV season.

“I don't know if I have 22 episodes of Supernatural in me…I think a limited series would be great. Like a Gilmore Girls-style [revival], four one-and-a half-hour episodes that we can shoot in a couple months.”

And would they want to go grittier, should the show wind up being revived on a streamer or cable? Get the kind of TV-MA action they couldn't on the ol' CW? Please, these guys were raised right.

“I thought about this because we've gotten that question quite a bit,” says Ackles, who had literally flown in that morning from Toronto where he was wrapping The Boys. “What would the show have looked like had it been on a streamer, right? And it would've been different. It would've been probably a little more R-rated, but part of me feels like because of what we did for so long and because of what the tone is, I feel like changing that now might be doing it a disservice. So I could see the benefit in keeping it like a broadcast show.”

“That's where I sit,” Padalecki added, agreeing with his brother. “There's something magical about [it], it's the reason we watch sports more often than we watch the circus: There are rules in sports. It'd be fun if you could pick up a soccer ball and go throw it in, but you can't. So I like the rules that broadcast television, linear TV, put us within because we still played. We still had ‘son of a bitch' and we…pushed the envelope so much within those boundaries. And so there's an art to that and I would prefer that.”

There is a way in which psychoanalytic work is akin to an optical illusion. More properly, a psychic illusion, in which the same narratives and experiences may suddenly appear to be one thing or another and may switch about involuntarily. And, with some practice, they can be manipulated—not in the pejorative sense—with some dexterity. 

While psychoanalysts may use a listening metaphor—invoking Theodore Reik's concept of the "third ear" (1949), referring to the analyst (or anyone) listening to the conversation with an extra ear to hear the deeper, emotional meaning in it, seeing is an equally important metaphor or analogy in analytic work. 

Less obviously, there are tactile, motility, spatial, and bodily metaphors that pervade psychoanalytic understanding. Hence the role of "manipulation"—which has a concrete object-oriented quality in the sense of being able to see and shift things in one's inner psychic landscape or stage. The capacity to engage in this inner psychoanalytic functional work is something individuals can access and practice, to varying degrees based on temperament and baseline psychology. The psychoanalytic function of the personality is required for analysts to do the work—one of the key reasons psychoanalytic training includes personal analysis—and develops over time for analysands. 

Such perceptual fluidity becomes most apparent in the process of transference, where the action of the illusion takes place and where fantasy allows for mutability. Transference is Freud's way of discussing how people can distort their perceptions of the therapist, particularly experiencing them as-if they were figures important earlier in development, such as a parent. The development of such a “neurotic” transference to the analyst and the analysis of that transference is the main technique of traditional psychoanalysis. 

“There is one special class of experiences of the utmost importance for which no memory can as a rule be recovered. These are experiences which occurred in very early childhood and were not understood at the time but which were subsequently understood and interpreted. One gains a knowledge of them 'through' dreams, and one is obliged to believe in them on the most compelling evidence provided by the fabric of the neurosis. Moreover, we can ascertain for ourselves that the patient, after his resistances have been overcome, no longer invokes the absence of any memory of them (any sense of familiarity with them) as a ground for refusing to accept them. This matter, however, calls for so much critical caution and introduces so much that is novel and startling that I shall reserve it for a separate discussion in connection with suitable material” (Freud, 1914). 

Likewise, the analyst inevitably brings their countertransference into the arena. The two together experience “co-transference”, as I like to put it, which may be more or less integrated or fragmented, split or mutual.

When people discuss their work within a psychoanalytic therapy frame, how they understand it, their relationship to it, and so on, a few implications stand out, as the analyst listens with the third ear for the transferential and projective elements. It is sometimes the case that the discussion can be construed as the disavowed workings of their own minds. 

Per traditional psychoanalytic aesthetics and guidelines, politics generally has no place in the psychoanalytic process, at least no real place. Given that the transference-real pairing may be construed as a false dichotomy, politics certainly has a role in co-transferential processes. 

One of the traditional prohibitions around politics is that it can disrupt the psychotherapeutic process. Another, is that it may represent the psychotherapist allowing their own issues—not the patient's clinical concerns—into the room. The influence on the therapeutic process may be more or less covert and multifaceted; it may be implicit, largely nonverbal, and therefore more likely to be enacted outside of shared awareness.

While politics should not enter the real parts of the interaction, the therapist may take on as-if roles, essentially taking a position as though they held a particular political belief, explicitly as a form of communication and therapeutic approach. There are many different psychotherapeutic schools that employ some form of role play—psychodrama, work with parts, speaking to non-present individuals, and more—all of which entail a degree of what might appear to be a thespian enterprise. 

However, the role play takes place within the therapeutic frame, and not as a form of entertainment or performance art. Further, it should be open that this is role play and not an actual debate and should be approached with caution in an exploratory spirit, the play embraced as critical to learning and a core experience more generally. 

The as-if dynamic and implicit communication demonstrate how the same content exists simultaneously on multiple levels of meaning and interpretation, whether it concerns political material enacted outside awareness, work discussions that parallel internal dynamics, or any other content that emerges within the therapeutic frame. They all participate in the larger psychic illusion that allows for therapeutic transformation. 

The conversation always will return to the task of assisting the analysand in self-reflection and development. The illusory nature of inner experience is inherently part of the creative process of mental life, where things are protean, distorted, and may be experienced in many different ways, with varying degrees of reality, but are taken as real in the process of playing with fantasy.

Psychoanalytic approaches leverage the interpretability of experience, but must not misuse such a powerful tool. The ability of analyst and analysand to influence one another, and the inherent power dynamic, require the analyst to be ethical, thoughtful, and cautious, even while spontaneous and intuitive—because the purpose of the therapy is ultimately to serve the analysand's personal developmental needs and, by design, only the professional needs of the analyst.

The president has long exploited useful fictions embraced by his supporters. Now he's trying to change the narrative

Donald Trump's followers, and the conspiracist influencers turned-government officials through whom he persuades them, have turned on the president and US attorney general after they declared an end to federal inquiries into Jeffrey Epstein's death. But it would be a mistake to think that the investigation scandal is sui generis. It's more like the culmination of a long-running trend, one in which Trump's exploitation of the conspiracist fictions, distrust of institutions, and prurient fascinations of his base have finally come back to bite him.

A pedophile ring at the center of power is a recurring theme in rightwing conspiracy theories of the Trump era. During the 2016 presidential election, supporters of Trump, then an outsider challenger for the Republican nomination, began to spread dark claims about his rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton. Online, far-right trolls and members of the population now called “low trust voters”– people who believe that something nefarious and conspiratorial is going on in the halls of American power, even if they don't know exactly what – speculated that Clinton was at the head of a massive human trafficking and pedophilic abuse ring based inside Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in Washington DC. There was no secret ring. But that didn't stop a disturbed man from showing up with a gun.

Pizzagate, as it was called, gave way to QAnon, the elaborate mass delirium in which Trump supporters believed that they were receiving secret messages from Q, a fictitious but supposedly highly placed security official. QAnon, too, centered around the notion that powerful people – Democrats, mostly, but also some Hollywood celebrities – were secretly running a massive pedophile network. In his dispatches, Q detailed Trump's efforts to dismantle a deep state ring of child sex trafficking. None of that was true, either, but that didn't stop thousands from believing in it.

Trump exploited these fictions, nodding to them deliberately with varying degrees of enthusiasm and plausible deniability. They were useful to him, stories in which he was a hero, and his political opponents were maximally morally repulsive. The conspiracies helped paper over the gap between the near-messianic esteem in which Trump's followers hold him, and the shambolic, incompetent, and often cruelly sadistic character of his actual administration. And the content of the stories – dealing as they did in secrecy, power, helpless innocents and forbidden sex – made them potent tools, igniting the fiercest passions and darkest imaginations of his fans.

To a man with a bottomless appetite for self-aggrandizement and no principles, the conspiracy theories' emergence must have seemed like a great stroke of luck. Trump lies like he breathes, and the national media, his fellow politicians, and all manner of experts have lost both the ability and the will to correct the record. Over the past 10 years, through the force of his personality and with mounting attacks on universities, journalists, and other outlets for knowledge building, fact-finding, and expertise, he has helped to accelerate a total epistemic collapse in national politics. Policy and public opinion alike are now unmoored from factual reality. What is true is no longer what matters.

The story of Epstein, the dead financier and prolific sexual abuser of young women and girls who killed himself in a jail cell in 2019, was in retrospect always bound to become a central character in these vast fantasies. Part of the reason is because of the true horror of Epstein's crimes, and the uncanny ways some of the facts of his story – as demonstrated in court transcripts, unredacted documents, testimony from his victims, and the dogged, years-long investigations of the Miami Herald's Julie K Brown – mirror some of the darkest details of QAnon's fever dreams. A billionaire investor with ties to a shocking number of prominent people across the political spectrum – prominently including Trump himself – Epstein carried out his abuse of dozens of teenage girls over the course of years, allegedly trafficking them for abuse on his private island and aboard his private plane, and, according to some of the girls, now women, who have testified about their experiences with him, pawning them off for abuse by his rich friends. He was a man who lived in tremendous luxury, who mingled with the rich and famous, and who treated human beings – girls – as objects to be consumed, with a kind of casual indifference to their will or wellbeing. He was evil – and, to those on the right who seem to understand both conspicuous consumption and the sexual abuse of women as markers of status, he was also darkly aspirational. In some of the breathless coverage of Epstein, particularly as it emerged on the podcasts and web forums of the conspiracist right, you could detect in the fascination with Epstein not only moral revulsion but an acute envy.

It's unclear why Trump is now trying to wrap up a conspiracy theory that has paid such dividends. Perhaps, as some are suggesting, Trump worries that sustained attention on Epstein's case will draw more attention to his own abuse of women, though such revelations about Trump have been many, and have not hurt him before. Perhaps he just thinks that he cannot deliver, from his perch atop the federal bureaucracy that is so implicated in crimes and cover-ups in the imaginations of his supporters, the kind of earth-shattering revelations that the conspiracy theory's narrative structures demand. Either way, Trump has turned abruptly and dramatically against the Epstein theory. He's trying to reassert control over reality, trying to dictate which fantasies his movement adopts, and which they leave behind. It's not working. The post-truth conspiracist world he helped to usher in is too unwieldy to be redirected at will.

There's a grim irony in the fact that it is a case of sexual violence that has underscored the dangers of epistemic collapse for Trump himself, because sexual violence represents an arena where a post-truth reality long predates him. No one knows better than sexual violence victims, who are routinely disbelieved, dismissed, or punished for telling the truth, what it means for the facts of your own life not to matter as much as the passions and prior commitments of your audience.

What people tend to forget about Epstein's life – clouded as it has been by all the speculation about his death – is that much of what he was doing to those women and girls was out in the open. Epstein had already been convicted and served prison time on charges pertaining to his sexual abuse; when he'd gotten out, he'd resumed his place among the rich and famous: his status was undiminished by the revelation of his violence. Maybe this is the real delusion at the heart of the conspiracy theories about Epstein and the other pedophile rings that populate the rightwing imagination: not that widespread sexual abuse happens, but that it is concealed, hidden, waiting to be unveiled by the righteous. For sexual abuse, at least, the real horror has always been this: that no one cares enough about the victims for the abusers to have to hide.

The New England Society for Psychic Research is lamenting the death of paranormal investigator Dan Rivera earlier this week, and friends are condemning certain members of the public for linking his death to a “haunted” Annabelle doll with which he was on tour.

Rivera, 54, the lead investigator for the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), died on July 13. HE had been one of the leading faces of the viral "Devils on the Run Tour," which was visiting Gettysburg at the time of his death.

Rivera died of natural causes, according to the Pennsylvania State Police. The coroner's office said the Annabelle doll was not in the hotel room at the time of Rivera's death.

Rivera, a Connecticut native, and other guides were part of the tour, in which they brought along the allegedly haunted doll, Annabelle, across the country to various sites.

The Annabelle doll has a long history of paranormal activity, but Rhode Island native, paranormal investigator and co-founder of The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS) Jason Hawes had a message for people linking the doll to Rivera's death.

"Recently the World lost a good man. Dan Rivera was an Army veteran, a father of four, a husband, and someone who truly cared about people," Hawes wrote on Facebook. "What's even harder to see right now are the posts blaming his death on things like the Annabelle doll and attacking places like Ghostly Images of Gettysburg Tours and other locations for having events. That needs to stop. His family shouldn't have to read that kind of nonsense while they're grieving."

"Some people are using his passing to push an agenda for profit, and it's just disgusting. Dan was a family man, a respected paranormal investigator, and he left this world way too soon...Honor the man. Forget the garbage."

“Jersey Shore” cast member Angelina Pivarnick is also mourning the passing of Rivera.

“I am at loss for words that you left sooo suddenly,” said Pivarnick Wednesday, July 16, on her social media. “I cannot make sense of this. I pray for your family at this very sad time.”

The New England Society for Psychic Research stated this week that the tour will continue.

"We believe with all our hearts that Dan would have wanted the work to continue - bringing people together, sharing knowledge, and honoring the memory of Ed and Lorraine Warren," NESPR said in a written statement this week.

The statement added, "Above all, he was a father, a devoted husband, and loyal friend, someone who meant the world to those closest to him...Out of respect for his family, we kindly ask for privacy as they mourn this tremendous loss."

In a press release on Wednesday morning, Pennsylvania State Police said that Rivera had passed away from natural causes.

The Pennsylvania-based Evening Sun, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported that firefighters and medical personnel had been called to a hotel in Gettysburg after 8 p.m. on Sunday, July 13 for a report of CPR in progress on a male patient of Rivera's age.

In additional statements, coroner's office personnel said that the death did not appear suspicious, and that Rivera was found alone in his hotel room. Pennsylvania State Police and the coroner's office responded to the hotel room to conduct an investigation, according to the office.

A GoFundMe account has been started by Rivera's family.

It was started by one of Rivera's four children, David Rivera, who said the fundraiser would go towards the funeral and memorial expenses for his father and support his family.

"Without a life insurance policy in place, expenses for services for him and after life care for his kids is hard," David Rivera wrote in the fundraiser post.

The fundraiser, which had raised over $3,000 as of Friday morning, can be found at www.tinyurl.com/dan-rivera-gofundme.

Systematic government collection and analysis of data about mysterious sightings in the sky could help Canada better prepare for incidents like the sudden appearance of several high-altitude balloons over North America two years ago, says a report from the federal science adviser.

One of the balloons, which wafted above western Canada in early 2023 before being shot down off the U.S. coast, apparently originated from China and carried sophisticated equipment.

The balloon episodes generated intense public speculation before fading from the headlines.

The final report of the science adviser's Sky Canada Project says the incidents highlight the importance of government investigation of what appears in the sky and how difficult it is to distinguish between natural occurrences, common technological devices and potential security concerns.

The report, released this week, says Ottawa should assign a federal department or agency to manage public data on celestial sightings and set up a service to collect testimonies, investigate cases and release analyses.

The report explores the public's decades-long fascination with unidentified flying objects and their association with extraterrestrial life, noting a recent shift to the more nuanced concept of unidentified aerial (or anomalous) phenomena, known as UAPs.

The report says the evolution in terminology has the potential to reduce the skepticism and ridicule that has sometimes greeted UFO sightings.

“Stigmatization can have significant consequences, such as discouraging witnesses from coming forward and hindering scientific inquiry,” the report says.

“The new, more encompassing UAP terminology can help promote greater transparency, credibility and acceptance of research in professional and scientific circles and in the wider public.”

The report says while many sightings can be attributed to optical illusions, atmospheric phenomena or human activity, a minority remain unexplained for a myriad of reasons, including a lack of reliable data that prevents rigorous scientific analysis.

Unexplained sightings generate interest and can be the source of misinformation or disinformation, diminishing public trust, the report adds.

“When people are repeatedly exposed to false narratives, they may become skeptical of credible sources, including scientists, journalists and government institutions.”

Unusual sightings have drawn the attention of various federal agencies since the early days of the Cold War, with the Defence Research Board establishing a committee called Project Second Storey in 1952 to examine occurrences of “flying saucers” over Canada.

The report notes Transport Canada currently maintains the Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System for incidents affecting aviation safety, including UAP sightings, while the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Department of National Defence may also receive reports through their operational networks.

In addition, police forces sometimes hear from witnesses, and civil society organizations, such as Ufology Research of Manitoba and MUFON Canada, compile and analyze data from citizens, the report notes.

However, there is no “cohesive and standardized system” for reporting and follow-up in Canada.

The report points to the United States, France and Chile as interesting examples of co-ordinated, transparent and scientifically driven approaches to UAP reporting.

It says the federal government should choose a trusted and recognized scientific organization, such as the Canadian Space Agency, to manage public data about sightings.

The report also recommends the lead organization play a significant role in dispelling misinformation and disinformation by responding to public and media inquiries related to sightings, and by documenting and communicating common misinterpretations of observations.

In addition, data should be made available to the public for transparency and to support research.

The space agency did not respond to a query about the report in time for publication, and the Innovation, Science and Economic Development Department said UAPs fall outside its mandate.

The report says adopting robust scientific methods and communicating more transparently about sightings would amount to “a significant step forward in promoting public understanding and combating misinformation.”

How the human brain generates self-awareness, thoughts, and consciousness is one of science's biggest mysteries, with no clear explanation despite decades of research.


More than 80% of the ocean remains unexplored, concealing unknown species, geological formations, and potentially even entire ecosystems. The mysteries lurking in the deep sea continue to fascinate researchers.


The Earth's magnetic poles flip irregularly — sometimes every 200,000 years, other times millions of years apart — but scientists still don't fully understand why these reversals occur or what exactly triggers them.


Plate tectonics shape Earth's surface, but when and how they first began remains a geological mystery. Some theories suggest they started over 3 billion years ago, but the evidence is sparse and debated.


Located in the South Pacific, Point Nemo is the most remote place in the ocean. Strange signals and inexplicable low-frequency underwater sounds have been recorded here, fueling speculation about unknown sea phenomena or remnants of ancient civilizations. It is also the point where most satellites are crashed. 


The “Gates of Hell” refers to the Darvaza gas crater in Turkmenistan's Karakum Desert, a fiery pit that has been burning continuously since 1971. Fueled by the vast natural gas reserves beneath it, the fire has kept burning for over 50 years, making it one of the longest continuously burning fires on Earth

While Earth is covered in water, scientists still debate where it came from. Was it delivered by icy comets and asteroids, or did it originate from deep within the planet's mantle? The source of Earth's vast oceans remains uncertain.

For this week's Fault Lines column, Jon Allsop is filling in for Jay Caspian Kang.

In January, three days after President Donald Trump began his second term, he issued an executive order to declassify files related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert, and Martin Luther King, Jr. It looked like catnip for conspiracy theorists. A fact sheet accompanying the order said that it was “PROVIDING AMERICANS THE TRUTH AFTER SIX DECADES OF SECRECY.” But many Trump fans are far more concerned with what they see as six years of secrecy around Jeffrey Epstein, the incarcerated pedophile who, in 2019, depending on what you believe, either killed himself or was murdered to protect the sprawling network of sex offenders who had participated in his crimes. In February, Pam Bondi, the Attorney General, was asked on Fox News whether she might release a supposed list of Epstein's “clients.” Bondi said that it was sitting on her desk for review. The following week, she shared a tranche of documents related to Epstein, and gave right-wing influencers an advance look. They brandished binders outside the White House. The covers read “The Epstein Files: Phase 1.”

The files, however, were a bust, consisting mostly of uninteresting or already public information. Bondi suggested that there was more to come, but a few months later Kash Patel, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Dan Bongino, his deputy—both of whom stoked suspicions about Epstein's death in past lives as right-wing pundits—went on Fox and awkwardly insisted that Epstein did kill himself after all. Then, last week, Axios reported that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. had signed off on a memo that not only concluded there was no evidence that Epstein was murdered but also stated that federal investigators had found no support for the claims that he blackmailed powerful people or maintained a list of clients; the memo also said that further disclosure would not be “appropriate or warranted.” Bondi, seated next to Trump at an event last week, sought to clarify the remarks she had made on Fox, insisting that she had been talking not about a “client list” but about the Epstein case as a whole. For his part, Trump—who indicated on the campaign trail last year that he would be open to releasing Epstein-related files—sounded incredulous that people were still talking about them. In a subsequent post on Truth Social, he dismissed the story as a waste of time, calling it something “nobody cares about.”

And yet, by this point, many of Trump's supporters had established that they still care very much about Epstein, and were not willing to move along. Elon Musk—who, while in the process of blowing up his relationship with the President, recently accused Trump of being implicated in the Epstein files—went on the attack again; the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was so distraught at the Trump Administration's involvement in the Epstein coverup that, he said, he was “physically going to puke.” Last weekend, MAGA influencers beat the Epstein drum at a conference organized by the right-wing group Turning Point USA. After that, it looked like the story might finally be losing momentum; Charlie Kirk, Turning Point's founder, whom Trump had reportedly called after the conference, suggested that he was willing to trust the Administration and that he would stop talking about Epstein for the time being. But he didn't, and neither did other prominent Republicans. On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, normally about as Trump-sycophantic as one can be, said that the Administration “should put everything out there.”

Recently, in this column, I've explored other apparent cracks in the MAGA coalition, over whether to strike Iran and what to do about federal spending; last month, I described the Iran debate as the “apex” of media chatter about a MAGA civil war. Already, Epsteingate has reached a higher peak. The disputes about Iran and spending were nuanced, but they revolved around legible ideological distinctions: Iran hawkery vs. America First; deficit hawkery vs. Whatever Trump Wants First. When it comes to Epstein, the dividing lines are murkier. Journalists at The Bulwark and Politico attempted to delineate the Epstein factions within MAGA and came up, respectively, with five and eight distinct groupings, the names of which—“Israel Skeptics,” “Show-Trial Compromisers,” “Cabal Accommodationists”—will make little sense to those not steeped in Epstein lore. On Iran, I argued that the most troubling division for Trump might not have been between different MAGA diehards but between people who pay close attention to politics and the casuals who lent him support last year, and who generally seemed skeptical of the strikes. This time, all of the above seem to be furious. The most salient divide is between outsiders and insiders; the latter category includes figures such as Bondi and Bongino, who are in turn blaming each other for the mess. Trump hasn't always been the focus of the blowback. But, strikingly, he hasn't been spared it, either.

If the Epstein blowup is revealing of Trump's base—indicating that its worship of him is not unconditional but predicated on the idea that he's a tribune of the people seeking to expose nefarious élites—it is also revealing of Trump himself, and his relationship to conspiracy theories, in particular. Over the years, Trump has not only amplified all sorts of lies but made a generalized distrust of élites and institutions a key building block of his political success. Since he returned to power, these trends have, in some ways, only become more visible. But, as Trump's reaction to the Epstein files suggests, it's an oversimplification to say that the President has never heard a conspiracy theory that he didn't embrace, or that he has invented a cohesive post-truth movement. Figuring out why requires some theorizing of our own.

In 1964, the historian Richard Hofstadter wrote a famous essay for Harper's Magazine about what he called the “paranoid style” in American politics. Hofstadter argued that a mix of “heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy” has long manifested in public life—including eighteenth-century speculation about the “allegedly subversive activities of the Bavarian Illuminati” and the McCarthyism of the nineteen-fifties—and that such passions have not merely been the preserve of the political right. The Epstein panic appears distinctly Hofstadterian. Earlier this week, a poll commissioned by CNN found that just three per cent of Americans are satisfied with what the Administration has shared about Epstein—and that more Democrats than Republicans are dissatisfied. Democratic élites are beating the Epstein drum, too. Whether they are true skeptics or merely spy an opening to troll Trump is open to debate, but some of their rhetoric has sounded pretty paranoid either way. (Hank Johnson, a congressman from Georgia, picked up a guitar and sang, “Epstein died by suicide / Believe that and you must be blind,” to a tune by Jason Isbell.) Given that the Democrats are supposed to be the party holding the line against the post-truth age, I've found some of this a little disconcerting.

Still, Hofstadter's diagnosis of the paranoid style, as performed by right-wingers of his time—rooted in the feeling that “America has been largely taken away from them and their kind”—clearly applies most closely, in today's terms, to the MAGA movement. And Hofstadter's description of “the paranoid spokesman,” who “traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values,” would seem to have foreshadowed Trump himself. But, it turns out, Trump does not always fit that description. Indeed, he has not only tried to move past the Epstein story but has himself effectively dismissed it as paranoia. “I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is, I really don't,” he said, this week. “It's sordid, but it's boring.” The next day, he referred to “the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”

So what explains the discrepancy? One theory holds that, although Trump and those in his circle weaponized conspiracy theories—which are expressions, typically, of anti-establishment grievance—to gain power, they must now exercise that power in the real world, and are finding that doing so butts up against their irresponsible past rhetoric, be that the discovery that whipping up distrust of FEMA turns out to be unhelpful when a natural disaster strikes, or the complications that follow from promising to expose a scandal that doesn't exist. In trying to walk back that rhetoric, they have found themselves caught in a trap of their own design. (Conspiracy theorists generally don't like hearing people in power tell them that there's “nothing to see here,” even when it comes from supposed allies.) This theory would tally with other actions that the Administration has taken since Trump returned to office: for example, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Trump's vaccine-skeptical Health and Human Services Secretary, appeared to endorse a measles shot amid an outbreak in Texas, and the Environmental Protection Agency debunked the idea that the government is spraying harmful “chemtrails” into the sky. Then again, this theory struggles to explain why the Administration teased the Epstein files in the first place, and has endorsed all sorts of other conspiracies. Trump's Truth Social post telling people to move on from Epstein seemed to invent a different conspiracy theory—that a cabal of his political opponents dreamed up the Epstein files—and he has continued to beat that drum ever since. He also urged Bondi to focus on what really matters: investigating how the 2020 election was stolen.

Another theory might hold that Trump amplifies those conspiracy theories that benefit him politically—that the 2020 election was stolen, for example—and downplays those that don't. You don't have to believe that the Epstein files are hiding some new dark secret about Trump to apply that logic here: it's common knowledge that he knew Epstein, and he is on the record talking about Epstein's preference for women “on the younger side”; any news cycle that dredges that back up is unlikely to make Trump happy. (On Thursday night, the Wall Street Journal reported that in 2003, Trump contributed a “bawdy” message to an album for Epstein's fiftieth birthday; Trump angrily denied this and threatened to sue the Journal.) And, though it's true Trump said before taking office that he would be inclined to release files related to Epstein, he didn't sound that enthusiastic about the idea. (“You don't want to affect people's lives if there's phony stuff in there,” he told Fox, evincing uncharacteristic concern for other people's lives. “There's a lot of phony stuff in that whole world.”) Yet this theory doesn't explain why Trump routinely endorses lies that don't seem to have much to do with him, such as the idea that white South African farmers need refugee status to escape a genocide, for example.

Instead, I favor a third theory, which is that Trump's approach to conspiracy theories is inconsistent, and makes little sense. (This is fitting, given that conspiracy theories are often inconsistent and make little sense.) This theory is compatible with aspects of the others—it is harder to convincingly peddle conspiracy theories when you're in power, and Trump certainly is self-interested—but it holds that Trump's attitude toward any given theory is likely guided by a mix not only of these factors but by whom he last spoke with, what information he has consumed on a given day, and so on. Musk, Tucker Carlson, and the golfer Gary Player all seem to have influenced his South Africa fixation; earlier this year, Trump appears to have become convinced that a wrongfully deported migrant had a gang tattoo when he didn't. Maybe Trump doesn't want the Epstein files out because he's covering them up. But maybe, as the Times suggested this week, he was slow to grasp his base's fury because Epstein conspiracism is a Very Online phenomenon, and he is an old man who principally consumes newspapers and TV. Trump's views are idiosyncratic, and his attention is prone to wander. Sometimes he looks less like the leader of some programmatic conspiracy cult—or the “paranoid spokesman” of Hofstadter's essay—and more like an ignorant blowhard. And not just on Epstein.

Before writing his essay on the “paranoid style,” Hofstadter gave a similar lecture at Oxford University, in November, 1963. The next day, J.F.K. was assassinated, spawning decades of conspiracy theories. In the past, Trump has flirted with these. While running for President in 2016, he falsely insinuated that the father of his primary rival, Ted Cruz, was an associate of Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin. After taking office for the first time, Trump allowed a trove of J.F.K. files to be released. This year, he dumped more information into the public domain, fulfilling the promise of his early order—an act, as I wrote at the time, that could be seen as an encouragement toward conspiratorial thinking in itself, whatever was actually in the files.

But Trump's attack on Cruz's father seemed driven less by the zeal of the skeptic than by a petty desire to settle scores. (“This was just in response to some very, very nasty—I mean, honestly very nasty—remarks that were made about me,” he said at the time.) And, if he made it a priority to declassify the J.F.K. files, he didn't—at least not explicitly—use their disclosure as a wedge to fuel further distrust of the government, as a full-bore conspiracy entrepreneur might have done. Asked about the files by a right-wing podcaster, Trump suggested that he believes that Oswald did indeed pull the trigger, and—while acknowledging the persistent question as to whether the assassin had help—concluded that “the papers have turned out to be somewhat unspectacular,” which might be “a good thing.” None of this is to say that Trump isn't hugely responsible for mainstreaming conspiratorial thinking or eroding the notion of the truth; he is. But he is playing with older forces beyond his control. And, perhaps, his comprehension. ♦

Cast: Sonakshi Sinha, Arjun Rampal, Paresh Rawal, Suhail Nayyar

Director: Kussh Sinha

Language: Hindi

Sonakshi Sinha's Nikita Roy can be best described as a hybrid of Creature 3D and The Buckingham Murders. Add PK to it and all these films can have beer at a pub. Creature 3D may run out of cash, The Buckingham Murders will rush to the loo to avoid paying the bill. PK will promise to pay the next time. And Nikita Roy will have to tolerate all the burden. It does definitely face the burden of being an amalgamation of all the names mentioned above. You know that because of some of the most awkward and abrupt shots in a Hindi film in recent times. This film could have existed anywhere in the world but but the makers opt for London for an ‘atmospheric' mood. Anurag Kashyap calls it noir. No where!

Sinha plays an author called Nikita Roy who has written a book about suspicions in modern India. She has lost her brother Arjun Rampal in an accident that creeps the hell out of everyone. The film has an interesting idea trapped in inane execution. It's unable to decide whether it wants to be whodunit, a horror, an emotional thriller, a drama about fake godmen, or everything or absolutely nothing. The leading lady has said this in a couple of her interviews how she used to play subservient characters in the beginning of her career. It's commendable how she is choosing projects where the burden and the spotlight is on her shoulders. But the stories that she is being a part of is not being able to do justice to her intent.

There's Paresh Rawal too. What happened with Sinha is something this veteran battled too. Post the charm and curse of the cult of Hera Pheri, fans want him to do more and more comedy. One barely mentions the likes of Mumbai Meri Jaan or Road To Sangam or Sardar when it comes to his marvelling oeuvre, but Nikita Roy is nowhere close to anything that he will be remembered for. If his character here had a conversation with Kanji Bhai from Oh My God, all hell would break loose.

Nikita Roy reeks of pretence from beginning to end. Any potential in the story is further marred by fake accents and faulty dubbing. Two brutal murders have happened, but all the investigations are being done by Sinha and her BFF Jolly (an over the top Suhail Nayyar). We barely get to see any effort from the police. Debutant director Kussh Sinha gives his sister a delicious opportunity to shine in every frame. The uneven script lets him down. But he definitely knows a thing or two about creating palpable tension. Better luck next time.

Rating: 2 (out of 5 stars)
