                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Momoa was preparing for his role in “Chief of War,” the first major TV series featuring the language and culture of Hawaii's Indigenous people. His passenger, Kahoʻokahi Kanuha, connected with Momoa years ago while they were both protesting against a giant telescope on a mountain summit held sacred by some Native Hawaiians. He wound up living with the Hawaiian Hollywood superstar for nearly a year as his personal language coach. The word they kept working on during the drive can mean “warrior” or “army.” It was one of many to get right. Like many Native Hawaiians in Hawaii and elsewhere, Momoa didn't grow up speaking Hawaiian. They worked with coaches like Kanuha to pronounce the vowel-laden sounds. Kanuha was at Momoa's side 24/7, with a binder in hand of the actor's lines to practice any chance they had — while driving, eating, working out. The final product of the Apple TV series that premiered in August isn't perfect, Kanuha and other Hawaiian language experts say, but it's a successful global-scale contribution to revitalizing and normalizing a language that has endured erasure attempts amid colonization. They say it's too early to quantify but that it can only help spark interest, especially among young Hawaiians who now have a mainstream representation of their language and culture. “This is a moment where we're showcasing our people, our language on a scale that says, we're here ... we are amazing and our language is beautiful and thriving,” said Moses Goods, an actor in the series who said he “grew up largely without the language.” Hawaiian was his mother's first language, but her parents forbade her from speaking it as a child, he said. That resulted in a systemic devaluing of Hawaiian and forbidding children from speaking it, Damas said. “Writing on the blackboard 500 times, ‘I will not speak Hawaiian.' It's difficult to count how many are fluent today, Damas said, noting that recent Census data showing more than 30,000 speakers includes a wide range of proficiency. As a family, it can feel like they live in a Hawaiian bubble until they leave home and everything is mostly in English, he said. With the show, his children can enjoy entertainment in Hawaiian — when they're not closing their eyes during violent battle scenes. Before acting in the show, New Zealand-born actor Luciane Buchanan said she had barely heard Hawaiian spoken. She recalled having to also learn other characters' lines with her coaches so she could react appropriately — “so it's not like we're giving blank faces.” Actor Cliff Curtis drew on his identity being Maori from New Zealand as a way to make connections with Hawaiian language, but said there were also challenging differences. “There's a fluidity to the way that it flows in Hawaiian,” he said. Puakea Nogelmeier, a former professor of Hawaiian language at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, helped translate the script. He said he was nervous about the show's outcome knowing how few of the cast were fluent in Hawaiian. Nogelmeier isn't Hawaiian, and he learned the language after moving from Minnesota to Hawaii in 1972. He said the show helps prove it's a “functional, viable world language.” “I was pleasantly surprised,” he said of the actors' performances. “I'm afraid that even Apple doesn't know how well they did.” Before “Chief of War,” it was normal not to have any mainstream entertainment in Hawaiian, Kanuha said. Now he can't imagine a world without it. He and others eagerly await news on whether there will be a second season. AP journalist Leslie Ambriz in Los Angeles contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Nationwide protest: Crowds are growing at rallies in major cities and smaller demonstrations across the country for “No Kings” protests against President Donald Trump's administration. • Why they're protesting: Organizers say Trump is leading an increasingly militarized and authoritarian regime. Sweeping ICE raids and troop deployments in Democrat-led states have intensified the outrage since the original “No Kings” protests in June. “It's resistance – part of the resistance,” one protester told CNN in New York City, speaking from the clear window in her inflatable pink unicorn costume. A 24-year-old demonstrator in an inflatable frog suit named Hailey said, “I think the inflatables really show that we're not violent, we're just trying to support our community.” The costume, she added, was a little bit hot. “I think it's hard to see a country that you love descend into fascism,” Hailey, who says she works for an AI startup, said. She told CNN that she was inspired by  Portland, Oregon, where demonstrators have faced off for weeks against federal law enforcement. Protesters have donned inflatable costumes at rallies outside an ICE facility – in part to dispute President Donald Trump's characterization of the Democrat-led city as “war-ravaged.” “It's kind of hard to spin that narrative, calling us like terrorists and stuff, when we're just out here in funny costumes dancing,” Dustin Ragsdale, a demonstrator in Portland, previously told CNN. We've been talking about the growing scale of the “No Kings” protests today in major cities — here's a little perspective on that. A large — and still growing — crowd has made its way into Grant Park in Chicago. Bobbie Castillo traveled miles from her hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska, to the “No Kings” protest in Washington, DC, for her first protest ever. “I feel like there's a lot of overreach in the federal government, specifically in like the executive branch,” he said. Castillo also expressed concern over what she feels is a threat to freedom of expression. “It doesn't seem like we're able to peacefully or safely (express ourselves) right now, without fear of repercussions” from the government, work or families, she said. “I just see all of our institutions changing, and I don't want us to change as a country and as a people,” said DC resident Lee Ayres, sporting a coat, wig and hat. Some top Republicans like House Speaker Mike Johnson have accused the protesters of being “anti-American” in recent days. Bob Hoeft, who described himself as a former Republican voter from Burke, Virginia, called such accusations “ridiculous.” “There's a lot of lot less truth coming out of the Republican Party than there is just vitriol, trying to gain political favor, trying to anger Americans for their benefit,” Hoeft said. She described feeling “very sad, a sense of loss, fear” under the Trump administration. “I'm hoping together, we can all save democracy,” she said. “We take the security and safety of our demonstrators very, very seriously, and we have to do so in light of growing political violence,” Cattaneo told CNN. “We want to take extra assurances that people can come and protest safely.” We have had nearly daily security briefings and training for volunteers across the country,” she said. A march outside Madison Square Garden has featured a large banner reading, “No Kings” and “People Over Billionaires.” Protesters are chanting slogans into megaphones, including, “This is what democracy looks like,” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” There are signs referencing everything from yesterday's George Santos pardon to workers' rights (that placard says it is endorsed by the Writer's Guild of America), and a variety of costumes, including various animals and unicorns. Bagpipes and beating drums are making for a cacophony of sound, along with the constant chanting. A section of California's Interstate 5 will be closed today “due to extreme life safety risk and distraction to drivers, including sudden unexpected and loud explosions,” as the United States Marine Corps celebrates its 250th anniversary at Camp Pendleton, the California governor's office said. “Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn't just wrong — it's dangerous,” Newsom said in the statement. Vance is the first Marine to serve as vice president. He shared photos on X showing him shaking hands with attendees. “We will not back down to Donald Trump—protest is what this country was founded on,” McGovern wrote. What a crowd for the first stop in Haydenville! We will not back down to Donald Trump—protest is what this country was founded on. At protests across the US, some demonstrators are wearing yellow – a symbol of unity and a reference to other nonviolent resistance movements, according to organizers. “Throughout history, people who have come together in protest against authoritarian regimes have utilized a color that is easy to see among a sea of thousands,” reads a flyer on the “No Kings” website. “Yellow is a bright, unmistakable reminder that millions of us stand together in the belief that America belongs to its people, not to kings.” In South Korea, after the Sewol ferry tragedy left hundreds dead in 2014, yellow ribbons “evolved from memorial tokens into protest symbols demanding government transparency and justice,” according to the “No Kings” website. “Yellow Ribbon” activists have led nonviolent resistance movements in areas occupied by Russia. Along with the larger events we're monitoring today in major cities, we're seeing small pockets of “No Kings” protesters crop up along busy thoroughfares, in small town squares and elsewhere around the US. That's the case in Silver Spring, Maryland, a town outside Washington, DC, where a group is waving their signs for passing traffic on an overpass over the Capital Beltway. We've also been keeping an eye on demonstrations in Europe this morning, where groups have held events in solidarity with the Americans attending today's “No Kings” protests. Crowds gathered outside landmarks and US embassies in Berlin, Paris, Rome and Sweden holding signs denouncing fascism and dictatorships, with some suggesting US President Donald Trump does not uphold the values of democracy. Here are a few scenes from protests we're monitoring: Schiff said the day marks a grassroots stand against authoritarianism and in defense of democratic values. In a video shared ahead of the events, Schiff praised attendees for “standing up. “If those grievances sound familiar, they should, because the man who would rule America today has done all of that and more,” Schiff said. He reminded Americans that their role as citizens is not passive, but active, and that democracy is not inherited, but earned and protected by each generation. “We have a people brave enough to govern themselves and wise enough to know that democracy only survives if we defend it,” he said. Keep in mind: Schiff's parallel between today's demonstrations and the country's founding principles comes as Republicans have attacked the protests as “anti-American.” Press told CNN she was driven to attend by what she described as President Donald Trump's threats to abortion rights, health care access and social security. Asked for the message she hopes to send, Press said: “We're a democracy. And that we are not going to be silenced.” Organizers tell us the rally in Atlanta will be followed by a protest march. CNN's Maxime Tamsett and Matt Meyer contributed to this report. In New York City, a march is planned to begin around 11 a.m. That will be followed by a rally in Washington, DC, at noon ET and a rally and march in Chicago at 1 p.m. Of course, those are just a few key cities we're watching, as there are more than 2,500 events planned in all 50 states. The report, which was obtained by CNN, did not indicate national security officials were aware of any specific and credible threats, nor did it identify any planned protests by name. DHS said police should look out for certain indicators, including attendance by demonstrators “with a history of exploiting lawful protests to engage in violence” and attendees who have received paramilitary-like training. The report recommended that local law enforcement communicate with transit agencies to be aware of increased travel to a particular area from people outside the region, and to consider establishing separate areas where protesters and counter-protesters can demonstrate at a distance from one another. It also recommended that law enforcement work with liaisons from the protest organizers and any counter-protest groups to help establish legal guidelines. The group, which says the events will be attended by a broad coalition of participants of various ages and backgrounds, has said peaceful protests will serve as a contrast to the Trump administration's show of force in Democrat-led cities. Go deeper: CNN spoke to attendees at the last “No Kings” protests. Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the Indivisible Project, spoke on our air this week about Republican criticism against the “No Kings” demonstrations his organization is helping lead. Ahead of the second iteration of the “No Kings” protests scheduled nationwide today, North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson urged people to protest peacefully and safely in a statement yesterday. “Peaceful protest is one of the most important rights we have as Americans. It's how people make their voices heard and stand up for what they believe in,” Jackson said. Peaceful protest strengthens our democracy; violence undermines it,” he added. President Donald Trump responded to the second round of “No Kings” demonstrations, scheduled today, in an interview with Fox Business Network that aired yesterday. “I mean, some people say they want to delay (reopening the government) for that — the king — this, this is not a king,” Trump said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch live from New York and Washington as protesters join a “No Kings” demonstration against U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration's policies. This is the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House and comes against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services, but is testing the core balance of power as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that organizers warn are a slide toward American authoritarianism. Many protesters were especially angered by attacks on their motives. In Bethesda, Maryland, one held a sign that read “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting.” In nearby Washington, Brian Reymann carried a large American flag and said being called a terrorist all week by Republicans was “pathetic.” Trump himself is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. More than 2,600 rallies are planned Saturday in cities large and small, organized by hundreds of coalition partners. Top Democrats such as Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders are joining in what organizers view as an antidote to Trump's actions, from the administration's clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids. “There is no greater threat to an authoritarian regime than patriotic people-power,” said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, among the key organizers. Before noon, several thousand people had gathered in New York City's Times Square, chanting “Trump must go now,” and waving sometimes-profane signs with slogans insulting the president and condemning his immigration crackdown. Retired family doctor Terence McCormally was heading to Arlington National Cemetery to join others walking across the Memorial Bridge that enters Washington directly in front of the Lincoln Memorial. “I really don't like the crooks and conmen and religious zealots who are trying to use the country” for personal gain, McCormally said, “while they are killing and hurting millions of people with bombs.” Americans abroad held smaller rallies in major European cities, waving U.S. flags and chanting slogans. Republicans have sought to portray Saturday's protesters as far outside the mainstream and a prime reason for the government shutdown, now in its 18th day. “I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. “Let's see who shows up for that,” Johnson said, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism” and “Marxists in full display.” “It's a rally of millions of people all over this country who believe in our Constitution, who believe in American freedom and,” he said, pointing at the GOP leadership, “are not going to let you and Donald Trump turn this country into an authoritarian society.” Democrats have refused to vote on legislation that would reopen the government as they demand funding for health care. The situation is a potential turnaround from just six months ago, when Democrats and their allies were divided and despondent, unsure about how best to respond to Trump's return to the White House. Schumer in particular was berated by his party for allowing an earlier government funding bill to sail through the Senate without using it to challenge Trump. In April, the national march against Trump and Elon Musk had 1,300 registered locations. In June, for the first “No Kings” day, there were 2,100 registered locations. “What we are seeing from the Democrats is some spine,” Levin said.</p>

Protesters in Atlanta, New York City, Washington, DC, and other major cities gather for demonstrations marking a "day of defiance" against Trump's administration. Millions of people are expected to gather across thousands of locations in the United States on Saturday for a nationwide "No Kings" protest challenging President Donald Trump and his GOP priorities. Some Democratic members and candidates for Congress are expected to attend. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not provide a clear answer when asked if he would attend one of the rallies Saturday, telling reporters he hasn't "finalized" his schedule. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as well as House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., both told the press they would be in attendance Saturday. Republicans have argued that this second mass "No Kings" protest event scheduled for Saturday is simply an effort to distract from the current government shutdown battle and appease their base. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told FOX Business he hoped that Democratic leaders who attended would be more willing to accept the GOP's plan after the demonstrations were over — but he did not sound overly optimistic. "It'll be a collection of wild leftist policy priorities, and that'll be on display for the whole country. After that's over, I hope there's a few Democrats over here who will come to their senses and return to governing the country," Johnson said. "Right now, I don't think — it's my assumption and all of ours that they would not make that concession before that rally's over because they don't want to face the angry mob. I mean it's sad, but that's where we are." "My guess is if they don't want a primary from the left, they'll probably find a way to sneak [attending a rally] into their schedule," Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, told Fox News Digital earlier this week. By noon, significant crowds were seen in places like Carrollton, Texas, Charlotte, North Carolina, Arlington, Virginia and the U.S. Embassy in London. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other House GOP leaders are using Saturday's "No Kings" rallies as a political cudgel amid the government shutdown. Glenn Youngkin mobilized the National Guard to help with any potential chaos. "I want to be clear that Virginians have a fundamental right to free speech and peaceful assembly, but that right does not include the destruction of property, looting, vandalism, disruption of traffic or violence of any kind — for which there will be zero tolerance," Youngkin said, according to The Virginia Pilot. Virginia-specific protests are expected to take place in Hampton Roads, Chesapeake, Virginia Beach, Newport News and Williamsburg, according the official No Kings website. "No Kings" protests against the Trump administration are expected to be held in cities nationwide on Oct. 18, 2025. Protests are also planned for outside the U.S., including in multiple European countries, and there is at least one rally planned in Mexico.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a locator map for Yemen with its capital, Sanaa. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A Cameroonian-flagged ship caught fire Saturday in the Gulf of Aden off Yemen after possibly being struck by a projectile, officials said, with at least one mariner missing and another still likely aboard the burning tanker after the rest of the crew abandoned the vessel. U.K. and European Union officials offered differing opinions about what sparked the blaze on the Falcon, with the British suggesting a projectile hit it, while the EU said that it appeared to be “an accident.” They warned ships in the area that the vessel could explode, because it was “fully loaded” with liquefied petroleum gas. The incident comes as Yemen's Houthi rebels have been attacking ships through the Red Sea corridor. However, the rebels didn't immediately claim to have been involved, though it can take them hours or even days to do so. The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, or UKMTO, center issued an alert about the Falcon, describing the incident as taking place around 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of Aden. “A vessel has been hit by an unknown projectile, resulting with a fire,” the UKMTO said. “Initial indications suggest that 15% of the ship is on fire and the fire was caused by an accident,” the EU naval force said, without elaborating. The Falcon previously had been identified by United Against Nuclear Iran, a New York-based pressure group, as operating allegedly in an Iranian “ghost fleet” of ships moving their oil products in the high seas despite international sanctions. The ship's owners and operators, listed as being in India, couldn't be immediately reached for comment. The Houthis have gained international prominence during the Israel-Hamas war over their attacks on shipping and Israel, which they said were aimed at forcing Israel to stop fighting. The Houthi campaign against shipping has killed at least nine mariners and seen four ships sunk. It upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which about $1 trillion of goods passed each year before the war. The rebels' most recent attack hit the Dutch-flagged cargo ship Minervagracht on Sept. 29, killing one crew member on board and wounding another. Meanwhile, the Houthis have increasingly threatened Saudi Arabia and taken dozens of workers at U.N. agencies and other aid groups as prisoners, alleging without evidence they were spies — something fiercely denied by the world body and others.</p>

Donnie Wahlberg told Fox News Digital his wife Jenny McCarthy did not get jealous of his New Kids on the Block fan base. Donnie Wahlberg is reflecting on his 11-year marriage to Jenny McCarthy. In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the "Boston Blue" star — who is currently starring in the "Blue Bloods" spinoff — detailed how his past romantic mistakes helped shape his relationship with McCarthy. "Well, we've both been divorced before, so we did a lot of individual therapy and when we got together we decided, let's do some together, sort of preemptive, because no matter what, every new relationship brings on new challenges and sometimes we don't even know what activates us, what causes us to react to certain things and brings out vulnerabilities in us," said Wahlberg. "Boston Blue" star Donnie Wahlberg admits past mistakes shaped his marriage with Jenny McCarthy. "But intimate new relationships are usually where they surface," he continued. "Some of us are really good at working in a work environment or with friends. We can give advice, and we can handle things, but sometimes you get into a romantic relationship and suddenly things bother you that don't bother you in other parts of your life. And it's because it's the most vulnerable relationship you're going to be in, and that's where those vulnerabilities pop up." Wahlberg has two sons from his previous marriage to Kimberly Fey, and McCarthy has one son, Evan, from an earlier marriage to John Asher. The former Playboy model and Asher got divorced in 2005. At the time, the couple had been married for 6 years and were grappling with their son's autism diagnosis. McCarthy shares a 23-year-old son, Evan, with her ex, John Asher. In 2008, McCarthy told Oprah Winfrey that the diagnosis took a toll on their marriage. "I felt very alone in my marriage," she said at the time. "He never sat down and said, 'What did you find out on Google?' For the second attempt at marriage, Wahlberg said he and McCarthy make it a priority to "put the relationship first." "I think both of us [put kids before our marriage] in our first relationships and we're not going to make that mistake again." "That means doing work to protect and fortify the relationship," he said. "And we put faith in the center of our relationship too, and that is such a foundation for us, and it's just huge for us. "It's hard to always reconcile that, especially when you're a parent, but they say on an airplane, if something happens, put your mask on first before your children. And I always thought that was the craziest thing. We have to do our kids first. But the theory is, if you don't put your mask on first, you can't help your children. It's easy to put the kids before everything and forget your partner. "I think both of us did that in our first relationships and we're not going to make that mistake again," he added. Wahlberg said it's imperative to "put the relationship first." We just tend to stop because we start to trust that the relationship's solid and it's there. A post shared by DONNIE WAHLBERG (@donniewahlberg) During an interview with Fox News Digital, Wahlberg said his wife of over a decade never got jealous of his female fan base, even when he would kiss a different fan at the end of every show. My fans are going to be there. When I walk into a hotel with you, for example, and you know there are 50 screaming fans outside, I can't just duck by and run into the hotel.'" "'I got to stop and take pictures. I got to stop and say thank you. I got to stop and sign autographs.' And I said, ‘All right, are you going to be good with that?' She said, 'Yeah, I'll take the pictures with you. He continued, "Like, I knew right then. In 2023, McCarthy shared her husband's sentiments on what makes a relationship work. Finding date nights and doing the work," McCarthy told Fox News Digital. Anything that you need to work on will come out in your relationship. And we were both always willing and still willing to do the work when things come up. Throughout their marriage, the two have made a point to support each other on a professional level as well. Wahlberg said his latest show, "Boston Blue" — which premiered on Oct. 17 on CBS — presents a "great opportunity to keep faith and family and tradition on TV." It's a lot of things, but I think first and foremost, it's a great opportunity to keep the ‘Blue Bloods' world and the Reagan legacy alive," said Wahlberg, who portrayed Detective Danny Reagan for 14 seasons. "Blue Bloods" aired its final episode in December 2024. "Of course, it's a new family, a new world, a new city, and Danny's facing new challenges and being a dad on the police department for the first time in his life," he continued. "But it creates a lot of opportunities to explore the character in new ways that I've never gotten to before." "Of course, we have some surprise guests already in the show," said Wahlberg. So, hopefully, this show is a tremendous opportunity, as I said, for a lot of things, but it's certainly an opportunity to keep the Reagan legacy alive. And that would mean, of course, any chance I could work with any of the original cast, I would take it." Christina Dugan Ramirez is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palestinians watch members of the Hamas militant group searching for bodies of the hostages in an area in Hamad City, Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025. Mourners gather around the bodies of Palestinians, killed by Israeli fire after crossing the ceasefire line according to the Hamas-run Civil Defense, as they brought to Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025. The bodies of Palestinians, killed by Israeli fire after crossing the ceasefire line according to the Hamas-run Civil Defense, are brought to Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025. CAIRO (AP) — The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will reopen Monday for people returning to Gaza, the Palestinian embassy in Egypt said Saturday, but the territory's sole gateway to the outside world will remain closed to people trying to leave. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement within minutes, saying that the Rafah crossing wouldn't reopen “until further notice,” adding that it would depend on how Hamas fulfills its role in returning all the bodies of the dead hostages. Israel's foreign ministry on Thursday had said that the crossing would likely reopen Sunday — another step in the fragile ceasefire. It has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side. A fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Gazans to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt, home to tens of thousands of Palestinians. Newly recovered bodies brought the Palestinian toll above 68,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Thousands of people are still missing, according to the Red Cross. But the ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack on southern Israel that sparked the war on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel on Saturday said that the remains of a 10th hostage that Hamas handed over the day before were identified as Eliyahu Margalit. The handover of 28 hostages' remains is among key points — along with aid deliveries into Gaza and the devastated territory's future — in the ceasefire process meant to end two years of war. His remains were found after bulldozers plowed up pits in the southern city of Khan Younis. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that he would greenlight a resumption of the war by Israel, if Hamas doesn't return the remains of all dead hostages. The group has told mediators that some remains are in areas controlled by Israeli troops. In a statement, the hostage forum that supports the families of those abducted said it will continue holding weekly rallies until all are returned. As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel on Saturday returned the bodies of a further 15 Palestinians to Gaza. Hamas again accused Israel of continuing attacks and violating the ceasefire, asserting that 38 Palestinians had been killed since it began. On Friday, Gaza's Civil Defense, first responders operating under the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, said nine people were killed, including women and children, when their vehicle was hit by Israeli fire in Gaza City. Israel's army said it saw a “suspicious vehicle” crossing the so-called yellow line and approaching troops. It said it fired warning shots, but the vehicle continued to approach in a manner that posed an “imminent threat.” The army said it acted in accordance with the ceasefire. There are continued closures of crossings and Israeli restrictions on aid groups. U.N. data on Friday showed 339 trucks have been offloaded for distribution in Gaza since the ceasefire began. Under the agreement, about 600 aid trucks per day should be allowed to enter. COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid in Gaza, reported 950 trucks — including commercial trucks and bilateral deliveries — crossing on Thursday and 716 on Wednesday, the U.N. said. Throughout the war, Israel restricted aid to Gaza, sometimes halting it altogether. International food security experts declared famine in Gaza City, and the U.N. says it has verified more than 400 people who died of malnutrition-related causes, including over 100 children. Israel has long said it let in enough food and accused Hamas of stealing much of it.</p>

Among those disappointed with the quarterback's comments was his former head coach, Alabama legend Nick Saban. Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa reacts after the game against the Los Angeles Chargers at Hard Rock Stadium. Saban, who coached Tagovailoa en route to a national championship during the 2017 season, said he was shocked to hear some of the remarks his former quarterback had made. "One of the things that I always try to tell our players is you never criticize another player and, in my entire coaching career, you never ever saw me criticize one of our players. I think everybody's got to take responsibility for what they can control, and if you start worrying about things you can't control, that's going to start affecting things you can control," Saban said Friday on "The Pat McAfee Show." "I was really shocked that Tua did what he did, when he threw some guys under the bus. Maybe they're not playing the way they should play, I'm not taking up for the guys, but you don't say that about your teammate." Alabama Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban speaks with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa (13) during the College Football Playoff National Championship Game between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Georgia Bulldogs at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. "We have guys showing up to player-only meetings late. Guys not showing up to player-only meetings. Do we have to make that mandatory? Do we not have to make that mandatory? It starts with the little things like that." "As a leader of this team, of the Miami Dolphins, the comments that had been said, I've made a mistake," he said Wednesday, "and I'm owning up to that right now. I've talked to guys on the team about it, talked to the leaders about it, and they know my heart. But no matter the intent ... when things get misconstrued or however the media wants to portray it, that leaves a void of silence and a lot of questions for the guys on our team." Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa speaks at a news conference after the Los Angeles Chargers defeated the Dolphins 29-27 in an NFL football game Sunday, Oct. 12, 2025, in Miami Gardens, Florida. Tagovailoa looked at the incident as a learning opportunity, and Saban commended his former player for publicly acknowledging the mistake. "I really was proud of the way he came back and took accountability for making a mistake." Follow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley joins 'Fox & Friends' to weigh in on Attorney General Pam Bondi warning against inciting political violence amid the rise in online rhetoric. After Charlie Kirk was assassinated at Utah Valley University in the city of Orem last month, American academics across the country have taken to social media to lambast the conservative leader and brand him as dangerous. "Professors were subject to political violence because of Kirk and the culture he ushered in, the culture that is being whitewashed," he said in a Sept. 13 post on the left-leaning social media platform Bluesky. Law enforcement tapes off an area after Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was shot at Utah Valley University, Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025, in Orem, Utah. Reznicek's objection, like that of many of his colleagues, stemmed from an opinion piece called "Charlie Kirk Was Practicing Politics the Right Way," by Ezra Klein, published in the New York Times. "The thing about memorializing Kirk as the Socrates of our era, willing to debate me bro anywhere anytime, is how he was also a know-nothing," said Reznicek. Chris Lamb, a journalism professor emeritus of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, who brags about being on Turning Point's "Professor Watchlist," also made claims that Kirk and Turning Point caused violence. I know professors who were harassed and threatened after appearing on the list. But let us not praise Charlie Kirk. Lamb declined to provide evidence of this claim. "I am not going to give you the name of a college professor or instructor who was harassed and threatened after being targeted by TPUSA, and, in giving you that name, put the person in harm's way (again)," he told Fox News Digital. He pointed Fox News Digital to a documentary called "Surviving Turning Point USA," produced by an Arizona academic. Other academics who are on the Professor Watchlist are interviewed in that documentary, but none provide proof of threats or violence stemming from the list. "I don't believe in instant Karma but this kinda feels like it for Texas. He later doubled down, suggesting that residents of Florida who voted for President Donald Trump deserved the same fate. Attendees hold up posters of Charlie Kirk during a Turning Point USA event at Northrop Auditorium on the University of Minnesota campus on Monday, Sept. 22, 2025 in Minneapolis, Minn.  (Stephen Maturen/Getty Images) He received threatening voicemails that are played in the film. "I am saddened about Charlie Kirk's murder," he said. He was a bigot who perpetuated bogus conspiracies. This is confirmed by his own words. He exploited the politics of hate and division." "But there was more to him than other provocateurs. He was married with two small children. Maybe that would have motivated him to become a better version of himself if he had lived," Lamb said. America really needs someone who can engage us—rather than further divide us. Maybe he could have become one of those people. Jeremy Littau, who teaches journalism at Lehigh University, also shared the sentiment of his colleagues in response to Klein's think piece. "I have two professor colleagues who have faced threats and harassment due to the organization Charlie Kirk built, and they were not alone," he said on social media the day after Kirk's murder. "We can denounce and loathe political violence without hagiography for its victims. Erika Kirk speaks during the memorial service for her husband, political activist Charlie Kirk at State Farm Stadium on Sept. 21, 2025, in Glendale, Arizona. "The big problem is that a large swath of America had never heard of Kirk until yesterday," he continued. "Every piece in major media about him is an introduction for many, and so conferring the sense of sainthood on him in the long run creates permission for the dangerous response I fear is coming." Reznicek and Littau did not return requests for comment seeking proof of their claims of threats, violence and harassment. In 2023, an Arizona State University professor named David Boyles was confronted by two Turning Point activists on campus. Boyles eventually swatted the camera from his face, leading to a physical confrontation. Stacey Patton is a communications professor at Howard University. In the five weeks since Kirk's death, she has trashed him multiple times on her personal blog. A photo of Charlie Kirk, his children and wife, Erika, is seen after an all-member memorial service in the U.S. Capitol's Statuary Hall. In one piece called "'I Am Charlie Kirk' Is the New Way to Confess You're a Racist. Thanks for the Warning," she compared people who use that phrase to the head of the Nazi youth Baldur Benedikt von Schirach, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi SS leader, George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of America's Nazi party, as well as segregationists and KKK members. Patton explained that her piece wasn't meant to be taken literally. "Saying ‘I am Charlie Kirk' is a literary device, an historical analogy tracing the ideological lineage of fascism, not a literal equivalence." An image of slain conservative commentator Charlie Kirk is placed at a memorial in his honor, at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The State Department said it has revoked the visas of several foreigners over negative comments about Kirk's assassination. She further explained that she "drew a historical throughline between Goebbels' techniques and the rhetorical tactics of modern demagogues." Peter D'Abrosca joined Fox News Digital in 2025.

Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin reports from clashes outside a Broadview, Ill., immigration facility where anti-I.C.E. protesters are being arrested on ‘Special Report.' Solicitor General D. John Sauer, Trump's top Supreme Court lawyer, urged the justices to step in immediately after a judge ruled last week that National Guard troops sent to Illinois by President Donald Trump to combat crime can remain in the state but can't patrol or deploy to protect federal property. A federal appeals court had refused to put the judge's order on hold. U.S. District Judge April Perry said she found no convincing evidence that a "danger of rebellion" exists in Illinois amid Trump's immigration enforcement push. The Trump administration argues in its filing that the case represents a "disturbing and recurring pattern" in which federal officers enforcing immigration law are met with "prolonged, coordinated, violent resistance that threatens their lives and safety and systematically interferes with their ability to enforce federal law." The filing says, "resistance succeeds to an alarming degree in its aim of obstructing federal agents from enforcing federal immigration law." "Federal agents are forced to desperately scramble to protect themselves and federal property, allocating resources away from their law enforcement mission to conduct protective operations instead," the filing states. "Receiving tepid support from local forces, they are often left to fend for themselves in the face of violent, hostile mobs. The plea to the nation's top court comes as 11 protesters were arrested Friday outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, a west Chicago suburb that has become a frequent flashpoint for demonstrations against federal agents in recent weeks. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker is opposed to federal deployments in Chicago. The filing also further escalates Trump's standoff with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have staunchly opposed deploying troops. Pritzker fired back at the filing on X, accusing Trump of trying to "invade Illinois with troops" and vowing to defend the state's sovereignty. "Militarizing our communities against their will is not only un-American but also leads us down a dangerous path for our democracy," Pritzker wrote. Trump has already deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and Memphis, Tenn., to help curb violent crime. He has said the moves caused crime to plummet in those areas. I could use it — that's a very simple answer. I'm allowed to use the Insurrection Act," Trump said, after the question was put to him by a reporter aboard Air Force One. The Insurrection Act of 1807 gives the president authority to deploy active-duty military or federalized National Guard troops inside the country in limited circumstances, such as to suppress civil disorder, rebellion or obstruction of federal law. It has been invoked about 30 times by roughly 10 presidents, most recently by George H. W. Bush during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, according to The Associated Press. But on Monday, Trump said he didn't have to "go there yet" because his administration is "winning on appeal." President Donald Trump wants the National Guard to protect federal personnel and federal property amid protests over immigration enforcement in Illinois. The conservative-dominated court has handed Trump repeated victories in emergency appeals since he took office in January, after lower courts have ruled against him and often over the objection of the three liberal justices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A series of public statements from the Department of Homeland Security during its migrant crackdown in Chicago and across the country has been contradicted or undermined by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing. Last week, a federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, saying its statements about protests were “not reliable.” The administration had highlighted several arrests for carrying weapons and assaulting federal agents – but the judge responded that federal grand juries had refused to indict at least three of those arrested, indicating a lack of probable cause. “In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor by these affiants, it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” US District Court Judge April Perry wrote in her order of those incidents. Chase involving federal agents led to a crash and angry community response in Chicago A judge openly questioning the credibility of law enforcement reflects a larger problem and raises questions as to what recourse ordinary citizens or immigrants have when accused. “A lawyer's credibility isn't just about personal integrity; it's a factor judges are required to consider when ruling,” said Elliot Williams, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. “Simply put, parties lose when courts find their lawyers untrustworthy. DHS's problem is how alarmingly consistent judges have been with their questions about the department's work and its attorneys' trustworthiness.” DHS has said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst,” and its agents are facing a surge in attacks against them. To understand this credibility issue, CNN took a closer look at DHS statements about the three high-profile incidents involving federal immigration enforcement. Asked about the contradictions between the DHS statements and other evidence, a spokesperson said, “We stand by everything we have previously said.” Thomas said he did not witness Brockman's interaction with the agents before she was detained. Brockman was released without charges – either for obstructing justice or assault – after about seven hours of detention, according to her attorneys. After the video spread on social media, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X that the arrest came as US Border Patrol was driving around conducting immigration enforcement. “Deborah Brockman, a U.S. citizen, threw objects at Border Patrol's car and she was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer,” McLaughlin said. In a statement, her attorneys disputed McLaughlin's version of events and said she was attacked by federal agents while on her morning commute. Brockman and her legal team adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone. DHS's statements about the shooting of a 30-year-old US citizen have been undermined by a criminal complaint and by an attorney who watched body-camera footage of the incident. Marimar Martinez, the US citizen, was arrested and shot multiple times by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago on October 4. The criminal complaint, though, does not mention a semi-automatic weapon or that Martinez was armed. Instead, the complaint alleges Martinez drove into and side-swiped a CBP vehicle. In court Wednesday, Assistant US Attorney Aaron Richard Bond said Martinez “forcibly impeded Border Patrol agents,” and that the case involved a dangerous weapon – a motor vehicle. “(It was) never brought out in this incident,” he said. Parente has disputed the government's account generally as well. Then, “within seconds,” an officer jumped out of his vehicle and fired at Martinez, Parente said. “I think anybody who sees what's going on today is going to question these indictments coming out of the Department of Justice,” he added. The arrest took place October 9 when police called Josiele Berto, the mother of 13-year-old Arthur, to say her son had been arrested. The teenager was then detained by ICE and moved to Virginia, she soon learned. The Berto family is from Brazil and have had a pending asylum application since arriving in the US in 2021, Berto said. Credibility questions have long trailed law enforcement agencies, whether federal or local, and police statements immediately after an arrest have occasionally proved to be incorrect or misleading. The murder of George Floyd, for example, was initially described by Minneapolis Police as, “Man dies after medical incident during police interaction.” Juliette Kayyem, CNN senior national security analyst and former DHS executive, said misleading claims can be exposed in the modern age. “In an era where everyone has a camera in their pocket, social media has been flooded with videos of immigration operations,” she said. “DHS must seriously understand that any blatantly misleading claim about tactics can often be easily disproved in this new digital age, especially if they're happening frequently.” Federal judge demands answers from Trump admin on following order to avoid violent encounters with Chicago protesters On Thursday, a federal judge in Chicago questioned whether federal law enforcement agents are following an earlier order and said she will require all agents with body cameras to have them on during encounters with immigration protesters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Carolina's leading cities have systemically embedded diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives into their master plans, sparking outcry from top officials. Columbia, Charleston, Greenville, and Spartanburg are among the cities that have incorporated extensive DEI measures into foundational blueprints, including economic development, safety, transportation, housing, cultural, police, and fire department plans, according to an investigation by the Washington Examiner. Upon reviewing those measures, several South Carolina lawmakers, including Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), who is campaigning to become the state's next governor, are speaking out, saying DEI has “no place” in the state. Pamela Evette, also a GOP gubernatorial candidate, has added her voice to the fray, arguing that such policies are “dangerous and undermine public safety.” And the Justice Department said it is on “high alert,” warning that “DEI initiatives, such as these in South Carolina, risk violating citizens' constitutional protections of fairness and equal treatment under the law.” “Taxpayer dollars should never be used to enforce policies and initiatives that give preferential treatment based on unlawful racial discrimination,” Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice Harmeet Dhillon said in a statement. “This Division will be on high alert to ensure all American cities respect our nation's civil rights laws.” While South Carolina is a solidly red state, Judge Glock, director of research at the Manhattan Institute, said he's not surprised DEI programs are active in its cities. This encouraged DEI's spread nationwide, “even in more conservative areas,” Glock said. “The current administration is aware of the concerns raised and is working closely with its legal team to ensure that all city practices comply fully with state and federal law,” Deja Knight McMillan, Charleston's Chief Communications Officer, said. When pressed on DEI embedded in Greenville's blueprints, spokeswoman Beth Brotherton said the city is “committed to ensuring” it complies “with local, state, and federal laws while fostering a community that fairly serves all residents and businesses in alignment with civil rights requirements.” “We are committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in all its forms. DEI is playing a key role in developing Greenville's Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Master Plan. Agency, the firm the city hired to carry out the PRT plan, says on its website that it holds a “mission-driven practice dedicated to addressing social equity,” adding that “diversity and inclusion are foundational to how we see, understand, and, ultimately, shape” public spaces, parks, and streets in cities. The 2036 plan's cultural resources component states that stakeholders “advocated for embracing diversity and dismantling inequitable systems by examining unconscious bias in the allocation of public resources dedicated to supporting arts and culture;” and notes “a desire to invest in inclusion” so Columbia can create a “more equitable future.” Spartanburg did not respond to a request for comment about DEI elements in planning documents, including the county's 2025 report on its recovery plan for fiscal funds, which states goals “to promote equitable outcomes.” The latter document contained eleven recommendations to “increase diversity and inclusion” in the business community; another ten recommendations for implementing “equity” overall, including by requiring DEI training for “staff at all levels to hold everyone accountable;” and applauded the city-run One Spartanburg Inc. and its Inclusion Council as a “model,” naming “the major initiative of Diversity and Inclusion as a core focus.” During a meeting about the Safety Action Plan, the City Council said that making residents safer “cannot succeed without a focus on equity and identifying communities that have disproportionate traffic safety impacts.” The plan says “equity is integrated throughout” the safety blueprint; identifies impacts on “historically disadvantaged communities to set a foundation for equitable actions;” and calls for “Equitable Transportation Communities” that identify census tracts as “disadvantaged”  based on “social vulnerability, transportation insecurity, health vulnerability, environmental burden, and climate and disaster risk.” The plan calls for an “Equity Analysis Framework” to identify communities that have “disproportionate safety.” The analysis holds “the express purpose of influencing the decision-making.” Recognizing that traffic violence holds “disproportionate impacts on people of color, low-income households, and other communities that have been marginalized, focusing interventions and improvements to serve these communities advances equity,” it says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki and catcher Will Smith celebrates their win against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 4 of baseball's National League Championship Series, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, in Los Angeles. Milwaukee Brewers center fielder Blake Perkins celebrates their win against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 4 of baseball's National League Championship Series, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, in Los Angeles. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki throws against the Milwaukee Brewers during the ninth inning in Game 4 of baseball's National League Championship Series, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, in Los Angeles. Members of the Milwaukee Brewers watch during the eighth inning in Game 4 of baseball's National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, in Los Angeles. “That was probably the greatest postseason performance of all time,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “There's been a lot of postseason games. The Dodgers will have a chance to become baseball's first repeat World Series champions in a quarter-century after this mind-blowing night for the three-time MVP, who emphatically ended a quiet postseason by his lofty standards. “This time around it was my turn to be able to perform,” he said through his interpreter. After striking out three in the top of the first inning, Ohtani hit the first leadoff homer by a pitcher in major league history off Brewers starter Jose Quintana. He added a third solo shot in the seventh, becoming the 12th big league player to hit three homers in a postseason game. His three homers traveled a combined 1,342 feet. Ohtani also thoroughly dominated the Brewers in his second career postseason start on the mound, allowing just two hits during his first double-digit strikeout game in a Dodgers uniform. He didn't give up a hit until the fourth, and he fanned two Brewers in the fourth, fifth and sixth. “Sometimes you've got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he's not just made of steel,” said teammate Freddie Freeman, last season's World Series MVP. It'll probably be remembered as the Shohei Ohtani game.” Los Angeles is back in the World Series for the fifth time in nine seasons, and it will attempt to become baseball's first repeat champs since the New York Yankees won three straight World Series from 1998 to 2000. “We've just been playing really good baseball for a while now, and the inevitable kind of happened today — Shohei. Los Angeles will have a week off before the World Series begins next Friday, either in Toronto or at Dodger Stadium against Seattle. Los Angeles is the first team to sweep a best-of-seven postseason series since 2022, and the first to sweep an NLCS since Washington in 2019. “Let's get four more wins and really ruin baseball!” Even after setting a franchise record for wins this season, Milwaukee is still waiting for its first World Series appearance since 1982. “We were part of tonight an iconic, maybe the best individual performance ever in a postseason game,” Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. “I don't think anybody can argue with that. A guy punches out 10 and hits three homers.” The Brewers had never been swept in a playoff series longer than a best-of-three, but their bats fell silent in the NLCS against the Dodgers' brilliant starting rotation. Los Angeles' four starters combined to pitch 28 2/3 innings with two earned runs allowed and 35 strikeouts. “I really think that to beat us four games in a row, you've got to do a lot of things right,” outfielder Blake Perkins said. We hit a lot of balls at people. But either way, Ohtani did great today. But he sure seemed like it tonight.” The Dodgers added two more runs in the first after Ohtani's tone-setting homer, with Mookie Betts and Will Smith both singling and scoring. Jackson Chourio doubled leading off the fourth for Milwaukee's first hit, but Ohtani stranded him. Struggling Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen allowed two more baserunners in the eighth, and Caleb Durbin scored when Brice Turang beat out his potential double-play grounder before Anthony Banda ended the inning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story will appear in CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. That's not making the market any less, um, bubbly. Just this week, the Financial Times wrote that 10 AI startups — not a dollar in profit among them — have gained nearly $1 trillion in market value over the past 12 months. (That is, to use a technical term, bananas.) Even as Wall Street analysts and tech media increasingly question the hype, drawing uneasy comparisons to the late 1990s, the AI industry's response has been to shrug and watch their valuations tick higher and higher. There are plenty of skeptics countering the AI hype machine, though few professional market analysts have done so as stridently as Julien Garran, a researcher and partner at the UK firm MacroStrategy Partnership. That is, needless to say, a bold claim about a phenomenon that is famously hard to predict. I sat down (virtually) with Garran earlier this week to talk bubbles and why he thinks the AI fervor is, to quote his report, not just “a bit bad” but rather “the antithesis of socio-economic progress.” The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Nightcap: Your latest AI report made a lot of waves among finance and tech media junkies like myself. Can you walk me through the top lines? At the heart of the note is a golden rule I've developed, which is that if you use large language model AI to create an application or a service, it can never be commercial. What they've learned from — the coding that's out there, both in and outside the public domain — means that they're effectively showing you rote learned pieces of code. There's a real problem at a certain point in terms of how much you have to spend to improve them. I'd say it's definite that (developers) have hit a scaling wall. Otherwise they'd be releasing demonstrably better and better models each time they came to came to market with a new product. And since ChatGPT 4 came out in March of 2023, they haven't actually raised the bar significantly. Nightcap: What about the argument that ChatGPT, while not perfect, is capable of doing some low-level grunt work could increase productivity? Garran: There are certain bullsh*t jobs out there — some parts of management, consultancy, jobs where people don't check if you're getting it right or don't know if you've got it right. So you can argue that you can replace bullsh*t with bullsh*t, and, yes, OK, I'm prepared to accept that you probably can, but that doesn't really make it more broadly useful. Nightcap: So how should regular people think about all the huge sums of money churning through the industry? Garran: The AI ecosystem can't really sustain itself. Consequently, to maintain the process, you need to have a continued funding, which is why it looks like a permanent funding tour. But despite all of this, there's no obvious way that they actually turn this around to a profit. It's hope over realistic expectation … When you run out of investors, then the whole thing is going to roll over. Garran: The amount of (venture capital) willingness to fund some of these startups, especially the software developers, is beginning to diminish because they're valued so highly. That leaves you with with basically SoftBank, which has had to raise a lot of debt against its shares to fund the first tranche of the OpenAI commitment that it made, and it's still got a bigger second tranche to fund. You've got foreign states like, say, Saudi Arabia. But there aren't many countries who have unlimited spending power. And that then leaves Nvidia as sort of last man standing. Garran:  With AI, I can't say it's starting to deflate. We're just a week past all-time highs, so it'd be kind of arrogant to say that was definitely the top. Nightcap: I have to ask, because I ask myself this all the time: What if you're wrong? Garran:  Well, there are two ways I'd be wrong. One is, it just takes longer to break than I thought. If it carries on for another year or another two years because they managed to persuade someone to provide funding, the more people are doing stuff that's not going to make a return. The future is not going to be as bright. Future (gross domestic product) will be lower than it would be if they didn't do this stuff, and they just went about doing some mundane things that people actually valued. We could be in a utopia of sorts, or we could be in “Brave New World.” Or we could be in a utopia like “Player Piano,” the Kurt Vonnegut book where everyone's employed, apart from some people living in their ivory towers. To be honest, I think that is beyond our current capability as an industrial society to pull it off. If that starts changing, then I'll change my mind very quickly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump administration officials have privately acknowledged that the intensifying US pressure campaign is aimed at ousting Maduro, a goal that was also a target of Trump's first term in office when the White House recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of the country in 2019. Then on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he'd authorized the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela and said the United States was considering strikes on Venezuelan territory. “We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,” the president told reporters Wednesday. Maduro has claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops' training. On his Truth Social account last month, Trump mocked a video of women, some who appeared to be overweight, running with guns during a purported training for the Venezuelan militia. The Trump administration has been quietly laying the groundwork for potential military action inside Venezuela for months by tying Maduro to drug traffickers and cartels that officials have designated as terror groups who pose an imminent threat to the US. But to date, there is no indication that Trump has decided to take that step or target the Venezuelan leader directly. Instead, the goal has been to pressure Maduro to step down on his own, sources told CNN, in part by establishing a credible threat of US military action if he does not. Trump said Wednesday that he authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on the flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation, but stopped short of saying they would be attempting to remove Maduro. In a televised speech Wednesday, Maduro denounced what he described as the CIA's record of regime change and coups d'état around the world. They have the means to once again defeat this open conspiracy against the peace and stability of Venezuela,” he said on state television. Trump's moves against Venezuela sound familiar for a reason “Venezuelans live in anxiety thinking about what might happen,” said Ivonne Caña. Caña, who is a cook, said she lives in uncertainty and, worried about her family, has been buying a little more food than usual to stock up at home. The fear, she said, is felt most at night: “We don't sleep well.” Some Venezuelans are cautiously showing their support for the US pressure on Maduro. In recent days, banners bearing messages such as “It's happening… freedom loading 95%” have been displayed on at least 10 university campuses across the country — a form of peaceful protest in spaces where political issues are seldom addressed due to fear of government reprisal. Meanwhile, Maduro has further cracked down on civil liberties in Venezuela. The state of emergency decree would allow Maduro to restrict constitutional guarantees and, according to analysts, would grant him broad political, social and economic powers. Three US Air Force B-52 bombers flew off the coast of Venezuela for more than four hours on Wednesday, according to open-source flight data reviewed by CNN. The bombers took off from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana before dawn. Two of them kept their location beacons activated inside Venezuela's flight information region (FIR), at one point coming within 53 miles of La Orchila Island, where Maduro's forces carried out drills last month. The bombers remained in a part of Venezuela's flight information region that is international airspace but controlled by the country's aviation authority. Multiple sources told CNN that the recent US military strikes on drug boats are just the beginning of a larger effort to rid the region of narcotics trafficking and potentially dislodge Maduro from power. The Justice Department opinion also includes a secret and expansive list of groups the Trump administration argues can now be treated as enemy combatants, rather than criminals, and thus summarily killed without due process at the president's direction. The opinion is significant, legal experts said, because it appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of groups and potentially offers a pretext for unilateral US military action against a broad array of targets in the region. But multiple Pentagon lawyers previously told CNN that internal dissent is unlikely to dissuade the Trump administration from continuing its military campaign in the region. The latest indication of internal concerns over these strikes emerged on Thursday when the admiral overseeing US Southern Command, which has responsibility for forces in the Caribbean, announced he is retiring just one year into his tenure. Tensions had been simmering between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Adm. Alvin Holsey for weeks before the admiral announced he was leaving, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Then, on Friday, the US military detained two survivors of its sixth known strike of alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. This is the first time an American strike has not immediately killed everyone on board, and the two survivors, CNN has reported, are currently detained on a US Navy vessel, raising a host of new legal questions to an already murky picture.</p>
