                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two months ago, Ekaterina Alexandrova suffered a heartbreaking three-set loss to Diana Shnaider on a rain-soaked night in the Monterrey final. But that was a different Alexandrova -- the one who had come so close but hadn't yet cracked the top 10. The new version, fresh off her top 10 debut earlier this week, wasn't about to let this match slip away. On another rainy Saturday night, this time in Ningbo with the benefit of indoor play, Alexandrova earned her revenge in straight sets. She defeated Shnaider 6-3, 6-4 in 1 hour and 32 minutes to reach to the final of the 2025 AUX ¬∑ Ningbo Open, where she will face Elena Rybakina. ‚ÄúHonestly, I have no expectations,‚Äù Alexandrova said after the match. I'll try to do my best because she's a great player and she has a really tough serve, so it'll be super difficult. But Alexandrova held firm, especially in key moments. After Shnaider broke her trailing 5-1 in the first set, she nearly did so again down 5-3 before Alexandrova put an abrupt stop to the rally. In the second set, Shnaider again tried to mount a charge. A FOURTH FINAL OF THE SEASON ü§©Ekaterina Alexandrova overcomes Shnaider in straight sets 6-3, 6-4 to reach the final in Ningbo üëè#NingboOpen pic.twitter.com/EFkZAd1xz2 Shnaider converted just two of 10 break points on the night, while Alexandrova went 4-for-7. 10 dominated on serve, outperforming Shnaider across the board: It's the kind of performance that makes Alexandrova tough to beat -- one she'll need to replicate in Sunday's final against Rybakina, one of the few players on tour with a serve as strong, if not stronger, than her own. What's next: When she takes the court against Rybakina, Alexandrova will do so with a head-to-head advantage, having won three of their four career meetings. If she can beat Rybakina again and capture the trophy in Ningbo, it would give Alexandrova her second title of 2025 and the sixth of her career.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner and Alexander Bublik could reignite their see-saw 2025 rivalry next week at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna. Top seed and 2023 champion Sinner and eighth seed Bublik would face off in the quarter-finals at the indoor hard-court ATP 500 if they both make it that far. Bublik is one of just three men to have defeated the No. Either side of that defeat on the German grass, Sinner eased to straight-sets victories against Bublik at Roland Garros and the US Open. Before thinking about a potential rematch with the Kazakhstani, Sinner will first concentrate on a first-round clash with Daniel Altmaier, who previously upset the Italian in a five-set thriller at 2023 Roland Garros. Sinner won their most recent meeting in Shanghai earlier this month to earn a 2-1 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Tomas Machac and Flavio Cobolli are potential second-round opponents for Sinner in a stacked top half of the draw in Vienna. Bublik opens against Chengdu champion Alejandro Tabilo, while third seed Alex de Minaur plays home wild card Jurij Rodionov. De Minaur is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and well placed to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the second consecutive year. Still in with an outside shot at reaching Turin, seventh seed and 2020 Vienna champion Andrey Rublev opens against Cameron Norrie. The winner of that match will take on a big-hitting righty: Alexei Popyrin or Matteo Berrettini. Lorenzo Musetti, who is eighth in the Live Race, seeks a deep run in Vienna to maintain his push for a Nitto ATP Finals debut. A potential quarter-final opponent for Musetti and Tsitsipas is sixth seed Daniil Medvedev, who on Sunday will contest his second ATP Tour final of the season when he meets Alex Michelsen or Corentin Moutet at the Almaty Open.

The 2022 champion when the event was held in Antwerp, Auger-Aliassime can first gain another 65 points on the Italian if he beats Belgian wildcard Raphael Collignon in Saturday's semifinals.Read more: Which bubble player is most likely to qualify for the ATP Finals?The 25-year-old is bidding for his first appearance at the ATP Finals since 2022, when he reached his career-best ranking of No. He is the second player to reach nine semifinals this season, alongside world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz, and is the fourth man to earn 30 hard-court match wins.His haul has included title runs in Adelaide and Montpellier, a semifinal appearance at the US Open, and two Masters 1000 quarterfinals in Cincinnati and Shanghai.
