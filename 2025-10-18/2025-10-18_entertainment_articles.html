                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It must be the season of the witch, as Bette Midler is summoning her inner Sanderson sister for another round of Hocus Pocus. The 2x Oscar nominee recently revealed that a script has been completed for Hocus Pocus 3, but the producers are working out “all those logistical things” before they can return to complete the trilogy. “Well, you know, they sent a script. And a lot of it was brilliant,” she told host Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live. “So, I got very excited,” added Midler. After starring as Salem witch Winifred Sanderson in the original Hocus Pocus (1993), Midler reunited with her onscreen sisters Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy for the long-awaited 2022 sequel, which set a streaming record for Disney+ with 2.7 billion minutes of viewing in a week. Following the sequel's success, Sean Bailey, President of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, confirmed a third movie was in development. In July, Parker said there are “no more developments other than we would like to do it. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As he finally makes his directorial debut with Good Fortune, Aziz Ansari still hopes to revisit the scrapped project that was meant to be his first outing behind the camera. Following the misconduct allegations against star Bill Murray that led to production on their movie Being Mortal being suspended indefinitely in 2022, the Golden Globe winner recently said he “would love to finish” the project. I have some of the stuff edited. There's so much stuff in it that we're all really proud of,” he told Entertainment Weekly. Although plot details were kept under wraps, Being Mortal is based on the 2014 #1 New York Times bestseller by Dr. Atul Gawande, which tackles the hardest challenge of his profession: how medicine can not only improve life but also the process of its ending. “I think we just have to wait and see,” said Ansari, noting that he has “a bunch” of projects he hopes to tackle in the future. But I would love to finish that,” added Ansari. “The project is something that means a lot to all of us, and it definitely comes up. Maybe there's a world where we'll finish it at some point.” After Ansari set Being Mortal as his directorial debut in February 2022, also set to star alongside Murray, Deadline reported exclusively that April that Searchlight Pictures had suspended production following allegations of inappropriate behavior against Murray. It was later reported that Murray allegedly kissed and straddled a “much younger” female crew member. Before the details of the accusation were revealed, Murray called the incident a “difference of opinion,” explaining: “I did something I thought was funny, and it wasn't taken that way. I don't want to be that sad dog and I have no intention of it,” added Murray. “What would make me the happiest would be to, you know, put my boots on and for both of us to go back into work and be able to trust each other and work at the work that we've both spent a lot of time developing the skill of, and hopefully do something that's good for more than just the two of us, but for a whole crew of people, a whole crew of movie makers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diane Keaton's daughter, Dexter White, is honoring her late mother in a heartfelt way following the Oscar winner's death at 79. In her first Instagram Story since Keaton's passing, White shared a touching message that reflected her mother's lifelong love of animals and advocacy for rescue causes. Together we can help save animals' lives,” the message read. A post shared by Los Angeles Wedding Gowns (@saintclarkbridalsuite) Dexter's first post is a fitting tribute to Keaton's compassion and lifelong advocacy for animals. Keaton left behind not only an extraordinary film legacy but also a lasting message of love and compassion. Reggie, whom Keaton adopted in 2020, was far more than a pet; he was her constant companion and daily source of comfort. In her final Instagram post, shared on National Pet Day, Keaton posted a photo of Reggie with the caption, “My heart on four legs.” Entertainment journalist Rob Shuter told AOL, “Reggie was her world. Sources close to the actress said Keaton made careful arrangements for Reggie's future, ensuring he would be cared for by trusted handlers and continue living in comfort. “It's the most Diane thing ever — kind, generous, and full of love.” A post shared by The Tonight Show (@fallontonight) “The Keaton family are very grateful for the extraordinary messages of love and support they have received these past few days on behalf of their beloved Diane, who passed away from pneumonia on October 11,” the family said. She rose to fame in the 1970s with her role as Kay Adams in The Godfather films and her collaborations with Woody Allen. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Annie Hall in 1977 and later starred in beloved films, including “The First Wives Club”, “The Family Stone”, “Because I Said So”, “Book Club”, and “Finding Dory”. Her career was marked by humor, authenticity, and a timeless individuality that made her one of Hollywood's most admired figures. “Today I was thinking, I'm the only one in my generation of actresses who has been a single woman all her life,” she told People in 2019. Her daughter's heartfelt tribute, and the immense public outpouring of love reflect the impact she made both on-screen and in life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It sure seems like Donald Trump isn't a big fan of any of this, as he repeatedly suggests that media outlets who report on him should be prosecuted, and as his administration takes steps to crack down on nonprofit organizations and others who demonstrate against him. Trump put it bluntly last week while signing an executive order aimed at punishing anyone who chooses to protest by burning an American flag. Republicans have cast “No Kings” protesters as antifa extremists and anti-American “terrorists” — but few things are more patriotic than exercising one's right to free speech to protest authoritarian rule. Taylor Swift Donates $100,000 to Young Fan Battling Cancer Who Calls Star ‘My Friend' What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong “[We] want to be out there carefully, peacefully speaking our minds,” Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen, one of the organizations participating in the protest, told Rolling Stone this week. “The one thing we cannot be in this moment is cowed by what [Trump] is threatening, and we won't be bullied into fear and silence in this moment.” Music has been an integral part of protests movements across generations, the present one being no exception. We released our Top 100 Protest Songs of All-Time earlier this year — chronicling how artists from Woody Guthrie to Public Enemy have inspired millions to stand up for their rights — and ahead of this weekend's “No Kings” demonstrations we've put together a playlist fit for the moment, filled with anti-authoritarian anthems in which some of our favorite artists put their foot down and give an emphatic middle finger to the idea of a king.

If you asked every Kelly Reichardt fan to blindly predict how the auteur would follow the 2022 release of “Showing Up,” nobody would have guessed she'd make an art heist movie set in New England. But watch a few minutes of “The Mastermind” and you'll see that it's a Reichardt film in every sense, even if it externally seems like a departure from the themes and locales she usually prefers. Loosely inspired by a 1970 news story in which an art museum in Worcester, Massachusetts, was robbed while two teenage girls did homework in the gallery, the ironically titled film stars Josh O'Connor as a working-class family man who ruins his life in record time after making the impulsive decision to rip off his own local museum. Unsurprisingly, the film is far more interested in exploring the psyche of O'Connor's J.B. Mooney than dazzling you with art heist spectacle, and Reichardt's long, meditative takes pair beautifully with the lonely moments in which Mooney slowly realizes that he can't go home — and wouldn't have much waiting for him if he could. Related Stories ‘No Other Land' Actually Did Have a Distribution Offer, but Its Filmmakers Rejected a Deal from MUBI Other Israel Film Festival Announces 2025 Lineup, Featuring Work by Israeli and Palestinian Filmmakers Save for her 1994 debut “River of Grass” (which was set in her native Florida), and her 2016 masterpiece “Certain Women” (which moved the action a whopping two states over to Montana), all of Reichardt's previous films have been set in Oregon. But Reichardt, who spends most of her time on the East Coast due to her teaching job at Bard College in upstate New York, was itching for a change of cinematic scenery. “Being from New York and originally from Florida, Oregon was so unique to me and so inspiring and exciting because it just was so different than flat Miami or New York City, where I lived. A lot of those stories were written with Jon Raymond, and we built a little world out there to work from. And Oregon's a really diverse state, so you have forest and desert, and we never really made use of the ocean, but I needed a change. “I really wanted to shoot something on the East Coast. And this size of city, the industrial town that has little museum, that the sort of middle class residents are keeping going, that's Massachusetts to me,” she said. The role of Mooney wasn't written for O'Connor, but Reichardt was inspired to work with him after being drawn to his “timeless face” and meeting him through a mutual friend. There was an instant chemistry on set (along with O'Connor's co-star Alana Haim, who gives a brilliantly understated performance as Mooney's fed-up wife trying to hold the family together amid his antics). What does a filmmaker like Reichardt, who has spent her entire career making delicate, unapologetically uncommercial films, think about the current indie film landscape? The auteur is as stressed as any of us, but she's not convinced that it was ever much better. I mean, AI is a threat on every level. That makes life feel precarious, much less filmmaking,” she said. When you're putting a film out, you have to compete in this realm with films that are just cranking in so much money that it just makes the smallest film so expensive. But I don't know, to be honest, the whole world seems so precarious. I mean, the state of independent filmmaking is probably not our biggest problem. But I kind of always have a feeling when I'm making a film like, ‘Well, this is probably the last one. Can't believe we're getting another one done. Reichardt might enjoy a bit of gallows humor about her own career longevity, but she's hoping that “The Mastermind” isn't anything close to her last film. She doesn't need filmmaking — her day job as a teacher is a lot less stressful — but Reichardt said that she has enough film ideas to keep her band of repeat collaborators like cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt, assistant director Chris Carroll, and production designer Anthony Gasparro busy for the rest of their lives. And just the idea of visual storytelling is forever interesting to me. A MUBI release, “The Mastermind” is now playing in theaters.

A small circus coming to rural England turns out to open up new opportunities and perspectives for a young woman in Calif Chong's feature film High Wire, which world premiered at the 69th edition of the BFI London Film Festival (LFF), which wraps on Sunday. “Go-Wing's future feels predetermined,” reads a synopsis for the movie, which Chong co-wrote with Jackie Lam. “Days are filled with working at her father's Chinese takeaway and studying. So, when an acrobatic circus comes to town, with a little accidental blackmail, Go-Wing is able to join them and finds the promise of community, artistic release, and a fulfilling future lived on her own terms.” NMIXX Thrives on Change With Their First Full-Length Album, 'Blue Valentine' Isabella Wei, Dominic Lam Kar Wah, and Jose Palma star in High Wire, a Silent D Pictures production in association with Make a Difference Films and Ajamax Productions. She, Wei, and Scott talked to the press at a LFF afternoon tea event this week. “I was in Hong Kong at the time, but it was really nice to be telling the story of someone from Hong Kong, or ethnically Hong Kong, in the U.K., which is where I spend some of my time,” she said. Before she found Wei, Chong realized the challenges of casting for a circus performer role. The bilingual ability was one thing,” she recalled. As Chong's partner, Scott had the advantage of being part of planning discussions, which allowed him to be ready for many scenes. “But, technically, probably the hardest scene was the final high wire act, because it's very hard on set doing that much visual effects work,” he told THR. “Because we needed that relationship between me and my dad, and I think creating that relationship or dynamic to make it look like we have been living together and coexisting in this really tight, narrow space for so long was quite a challenge.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Dancing with the Stars” professional dancer and Season 34 judge Derek Hough has shown a vulnerable side to himself recently as he bravely revealed the childhood bullying he has endured and the tremendous impact it had on him, and, more recently, he has opened up about his loss. Fans have loved witnessing their pregnancy journey, which the couple has chosen to share publicly, but many people would not have realized that this is their rainbow baby. The couple is opening up about a miscarriage that happened before this pregnancy and how they are navigating their emotions going into this new chapter of their life. In the video, the text reads, “Although we are so excited to be welcoming our rainbow baby so soon, we honor our baby that never made it Earthside.” As we are now in October, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, we share this part of our story to honor our baby that never made it earthside. As we share this, know that there's a rainbow not far behind.” This is something Hough and Erbert had not spoken about publicly before, but doing so now helps to raise awareness for miscarriage. It may also be of some solace to those going through similar experiences. Fans have flooded the comment section with messages of support, but one of the messages that stands out is one from Hough's sister, professional dancer and DWTS co-host, Julianne Hough. “Witnessing your journey and how you have moved through each life-changing moment in the last few years has been the greatest testament of resilience and the power of love – I'm forever in awe of your strength and vulnerability in loving completely! I love you so much,” Julianne commented on the post. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the summer of 2015, Carly Rae Jepsen was looking to the future: “My desire now,” she told an interviewer, “is to see how far I can stretch pop.” Her latest moves had evolved from the good-enough charm of Kiss—the album that contained her unexpectedly planet-dominating hit “Call Me Maybe”—into glossier, vintage-inspired territory: gated drums, squealing synths, a couple saxophone solos. '80s pop rehashed for the new millennium feels staid in its omnipresence today—but remember when it actually felt like a bold new idea, when embracing that moment, in all its schmaltz and sentiment, could represent a genuinely surprising artistic turn? In countless interviews, she has rejected the notion that pop music—hers or anyone else's—ought to be considered a “guilty pleasure,” and E•mo•tion is, fittingly, a record of full-on pleasure: unselfconscious, effervescent, no irony to be found. These are songs about big feelings, matched by big-budget production, evincing a shameless devotion to pure pop: uptempo, tightly structured, stuffed with singable hooks and lyrics that don't exactly hold up perfectly under scrutiny yet nonetheless scan as immediately relatable. “Boy Problems” is neon and buoyant with its groovy bassline, chorus of na na nas, and percussion stabs like the kind of text you send with 15 exclamation marks. She doesn't just like you—she really likes you, repeating that word five times in a row to indulge the absurdity of infatuation. On “Your Type” and “Gimmie Love,” she's begging to cross the line from friendship into romance; on “When I Needed You,” she sings like she's still trying to convince herself to leave an ex in the past. Jepsen always sounds like she means it, her voice all full-on dedication—and rather than rendering her rigid, she only comes across more ebullient. Sure, she claimed she vaped for a week straight to get some rasp in her delivery on “Your Type,” but her voice is still irrefutably sweet; her lyrics are loaded with odd come-ons—“Here I come to hijack you,” or, “Who gave you eyes like that/Said you could keep them?”—but she knows how to land them convincingly. (No overlap here, it should be noted, with E•mo•tion: Side B, the first edition in Jepsen's ongoing series of album sequels.) As for as-of-yet unheard material: There's two “Run Away with Me” remixes (one aqueous, courtesy of Kyle Shearer; one stadium-sized, courtesy of Rostam) and four previously unreleased tracks. The singer said she worked on more than 200 songs to make E•mo•tion, and while these cast-offs are conventionally Carly Rae, hearing them after E•mo•tion proper makes their absence from the original tracklist self-evident: “More” sounds like it could have landed on Disco Sweat, an album Jepsen wrote and scrapped after E•mo•tion in the midst of an ABBA phase (she claims that record “will probably never be released, and shouldn't”); “Guardian Angel” and “Back of My Heart” are a touch too cute; “Lost in Devotion” is a lovesick but lesser ballad. Still, stans hoping for E•mo•tion: Side C will be well-fed. In writing those supposed 200 songs, Jepsen spent numerous sessions with a range of producers. Big-name hitmakers like Max Martin and Jack Antonoff could have perhaps helped her parlay the success of “Call Me Maybe” into continued virality or commercial domination, but neither producer made it into the final cut. “This time we wanted to stop worrying about singles and focus on having a critically acclaimed album.”) The producers and co-writers Jepsen stuck with for E•mo•tion—Ariel Rechtshaid, Dev Hynes, Rostam Batmanglij, a pre-Olivia-and-Chappell Daniel Nigro—had bragging rights of a different sort: They'd made their reputations by helping knit together underground and pop sensibilities for artists like Haim, Solange, and Sky Ferreira. Maybe that's why there was so much critical anticipation around E•mo•tion, the kind of major-label pop record that didn't ordinarily get fawning blog coverage a decade ago. This very publication did not review Taylor Swift's 1989 at the time of its release—which was both a massive commercial success and a clear zeitgeist companion to E•mo•tion's '80s-inspired pop—but not only reviewed E•mo•tion; it designated one E•mo•tion song Best New Track and dedicated a 1300-word roundtable to another. What made Jepsen catnip for music journalists: the verified indie cred of her producers? Was it that the boys' club of music criticism was being proudly infiltrated by a new generation of writers from the demographics best suited to take this kind of music seriously (especially if it came with the signoff of tastemakers): young women and queer listeners? Was it that the record emerged at a time when “poptimism” still felt fresh—before the concept was downgraded to its role as a misunderstood weapon of clickbait; when that idea could still be challenged, debated, and perhaps even embraced among true music nerds; when it felt thrillingly possible to reimagine “pop” not as a lowest-common-denominator commercial category, or the manufactured result of a studio system, but as a lineage of sharp, smart songwriting that didn't have to be watered down to have broad appeal? Despite the critical enthusiasm, E•mo•tion did not make Jepsen a mega-star. “I Really Like You” was her last song to hit the Billboard Hot 100, and the album only reached No. And despite her intention of pushing pop music past its limits, it's hard to believe that, after E•mo•tion, Jepsen truly committed to her vision, especially when you consider the freaky pioneers and international sounds and chart-topping regional styles and unexpected crossovers that have fallen under the “pop” umbrella in the last decade. Though she wasn't the first to chart this kind of path, she did so before it was common knowledge that being dubbed royalty by a small army of very online fans could more or less keep a career afloat—a sort of godmother of the khia asylum. The record's lack of commercial success provided Jepsen with an underdog identity that left her fans fiercely hungry, as has the fact that her later releases haven't quite matched E•mo•tion's technicolor glow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For instance: Have you ever asked yourself what one of the single funniest scenes of HBO's Succession would look like with a little plastic Matthew Macfadyen and a little plastic Zack Robidas facing off? We speak, of course, of the frequently passed-around sequence from the show's second-season episode “Panic Room,” in which Macfadyen's typically feckless Tom Wambsgans is forced to try to vet news network anchor Mark Ravenhead for possible Nazi ties, and finds that his quarry fails to bat away even the softest of softballs. That scene, like many before it, has now become the subject of animator Trevor Carlee, who has very successfully rendered the sequence into a more blocky form, as he has with shows ranging from Abbott Elementary to It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia‘s famous “The Implication.” Carlee isn't using actual LEGO pieces here, obviously, instead animating the scene in Blender. Above all, it's a strong reminder of just how good Macfadyen—placed in a rare straight man role—is here, his expertly timed delivery coming through in either flesh or plastic. Wait, are we going to fall back into a Succession re-watch because of an online LEGO video?!)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the second year in a row that Clarkson has been upset in this category (which she won the four years before that). This year, Live With Kelly and Mark won outstanding daytime talk series, ending (or at least interrupting) The Kelly Clarkson Show's four-year hold on the category. Neither Barrymore nor Ripa and Consuelos attended the ceremony, a sign perhaps that they didn't expect to win. In 2000, she co-starred with Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu in Charlie's Angels, which spawned Destiny's Child's smash single “Independent Women Part I,” which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 11 weeks. In 2018 she was the subject of Bryce Vine's Hot 100 hit “Drew Barrymore.” General Hospital won seven awards, tops for the night, followed by The Drew Barrymore Show, The Secret Lives of Animals and Secret Lives of Orangutans (three awards each), and Black Barbie, Days of Our Lives, Delicious Miss Brown, Disney Parks Magical Christmas Day Parade, Entertainment Tonight and The Kelly Clarkson Show (two awards each). Entertainment Tonight won outstanding entertainment news series for the sixth consecutive year, while the host team (Cassie DiLaura, Denny Directo, Kevin Frazier, Rachel Smith and Nischelle Turner) won outstanding daytime personality – daily. But an ET-branded program remembering a TV legend, Bob Newhart: A Legacy of Laughter, An Entertainment Tonight Special, surprisingly lost outstanding daytime special to Disney Parks Magical Christmas Day Parade. Sir David Attenborough, 99, won outstanding daytime personality – non-daily for the Netflix program, Secret Lives of Orangutans. In so doing, he set a new record as the oldest person to win a Daytime Emmy, beating Dick Van Dyke's record by one year. Van Dyke won outstanding guest performer in a drama series last year at 98 for his performance on Days of Our Lives. Selena Gomez's Food Network series Selena + Restaurant was nominated for outstanding culinary instructional series, but lost to Delicious Miss Brown on the Food Network. Other Billboard Presents segments include cover videos with A$AP Rocky, Tyler, The Creator and Charli XCX. If it seems like more than a year has gone by since the last Daytime Emmys, you're right.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long-running wrestling outfit the WWE has revealed its intention to enter a new era of “AI-based storytelling.” Per a report in the Wrestling Observer, the entertainment company recently hired former Buzzfeed guy Cyrus Kowsari to serve as its new senior director of creative strategy, i.e., the guy whose job it will be to cram artificial intelligence into every inch and crevice of WWE's creative singlet. Kowsari—who also spent several years at MMA company ONE—was introduced to WWE staffers back in September by chief creative officer Paul “Triple H” Levesque, who called him someone who would lead the company into an “inevitable” “transition into AI-based storytelling,” as well as fronting a push to “integrate AI into creative services like video and graphics.” The latter of which, we can kind of get: If you're not that worried about things like quality, respecting copyright, or the environment, AI can crap out a lot of graphics really quickly. Among other things, the Wrestling Observer piece cites reporting from the site's own Dave Meltzer, who wrote in his regular wrestling newsletter that recent attempts by WWE to use writing AI to generate storyline ideas produced unusable nonsense, with the models having little ability to keep track of, say, which wrestlers actually worked for the company. Again, you probably could filter through the massive amounts of garbage you'd get with this approach to find a usable idea created by jamming together five old ones. Which feels ridiculously harder than just stocking a writers room with a small collection of people who actually know the company's output.
