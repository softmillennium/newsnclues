                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian forces are still edging forward along several parts of the long front line in Ukraine – despite yet another call from US President Donald Trump for a combat freeze along existing lines. Both sides “should stop where they are,” Trump said on social media Friday, after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington DC. These bombs, which carry a payload of up to 1,500 kilograms (3,307 pounds), largely target Ukrainian forces and infrastructure close to the front lines. In recent days, the Ukrainians have acknowledged that about 20% are not being intercepted. “Moscow has developed fresh ways of using drones to find and kill Ukrainian soldiers and to destroy Ukrainian assets, turning what was once an area of weakness into an area of strength,” writes long-time Russia analyst Dara Massicot in Foreign Affairs. It is giving junior commanders more freedom to plan,” Massicot adds. One town where Ukrainians are under growing pressure is Kupiansk, in the northern region of Kharkiv. Russian troops have advanced to the north and east of the town, which has been under siege for more than a year. A well-known Russian blogger, War Gonzo, said Saturday on Telegram that there was also fighting in the center of Kupiansk. One Ukrainian military blogger – Bohdan Miroshnikov – said this week that the Russian tactic “may lead to control (if reinforcements can arrive and consolidate their positions).” He added that while the situation was very complicated, “full occupation of the city is still a long way off.” In Donetsk, heavy fighting continues around Pokrovsk, with a Russian military blogger claiming Saturday that Russian troops are advancing to the northwestern outskirts of the city. “Ukrainian warriors have ceased the enemy's spring-summer offensive campaign,” Syrskyi added. Russia has gained about 120 square miles of territory in the past four weeks, about half of what it seized in the previous four weeks, according to the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. As many as 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, according to an estimate in June by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US-based think tank. Nearly 14,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the Pokrovsk area alone since late August, according to Ukraine's military command. Trump seeks to build on momentum from Gaza deal in a busy diplomatic week In recent weeks, Russian regions have begun paring back the generous sign-on bonuses used to attract recruits. For its part, Ukraine is betting on long-range strikes targeting Russian energy infrastructure to persuade the Kremlin to accept negotiations. It has stepped up production of its own cruise missiles, although it has been unable as yet to persuade Trump to supply Tomahawk missiles. Since the beginning of the year, successful strikes haved been carried out against 45 facilities in Russia's fuel and energy sector, according to Syrskyi. Industry analysts estimate that one-fifth of Russia's refining capacity has been disrupted. But despite the casualties and damage to Russia's economy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of agreeing to a ceasefire or negotiations with Ukraine. More than 1,300 days since the full-scale Russian invasion began, as one expert puts it, “Ukraine cannot destroy Russia's war capacity, while Russia appears unable to militarily defeat Ukraine.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following high-level talks between Ukrainian and U.S. officials in Washington this week, European leaders are renewing calls for a peace plan to end Russia's invasion, after an apparent shift in U.S. support for Kyiv. "Following his meeting with President (Donald) Trump, we have coordinated and will accompany the next steps. What Ukraine needs now is a peace plan," Merz wrote on X. Merz also reportedly said that the meeting had not gone as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had hoped, according to German media outlet n-tv. The statements come after an intense week of diplomacy culminating in a planned bilateral meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the failure of a Ukrainian delegation to clinch U.S. approval to purchase Tomahawk cruise missiles. The Ukrainian team had been hoping to capitalize on improved relations. President Trump has grown increasingly frustrated in recent months by Putin's refusal to end the war against Ukraine. Using domestically manufactured drones, Ukraine has conducted repeated long-range strikes on Russian oil refineries in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin. He did, however, signal openness to a weapons deal with Kyiv that could involve U.S.-made missiles and Ukrainian drones. Several European leaders held a conference call with Zelensky after the closed-door meeting, including NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. According to an Axios source who was on the call, Starmer suggested teaming up with the U.S. to shape a Ukraine peace plan inspired by Trump's Gaza proposal. NATO chief Mark Rutte then pushed for European security advisers to hold a rapid follow-up meeting over the weekend, Axios reported. He was previously a research analyst at Bruegel, a Brussels-based economics think tank, where he worked on Russia and Ukraine, trade, industrial policy, and environmental policy. He holds a BA honors degree in economics and Russian from McGill University. The Ukrainian Air Force reported downing 136 drones launched by Russia overnight. An electrical substation in Russia's Ulyanovsk Oblast is in flames following a reported Ukrainian drone strike, Russian Telegram media channels reported on Oct. 18. "Hopefully, we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks," Trump told reporters before closed-door talks with Zelensky.</p>

With President Donald Trump floating potential military action within Venezuela and authorizing operations by the Central Intelligence Agency after launching several deadly strikes on boats near the South American country, three lawmakers from both sides of the aisle on Friday said they would force a new vote on blocking the White House from carrying out an attack there. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) last week introduced a measure to rein in Trump's bombing of boats in the Caribbean, which the White House has claimed are being used to traffic drugs into the US and present an imminent threat. Kaine and Schiff on Friday were reportedly hoping that a new bipartisan measure, introduced with Paul, would garner more support from the Republicans. They said they would force a vote on a war powers resolution to block the use of force by US troops “within or against” Venezuela unless it was “explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.” And we must assert our authority to stop the United States from being dragged — intentionally or accidentally — into full-fledged war in South America,” said Schiff. The lawmakers announced the resolution as it was reported that two survivors of the military's most recent drone strike on a boat have been detained by US forces, with legal experts questioning whether they are prisoners or war or criminal suspects. Venezuela is not a significant source of drugs that are trafficked into the US — a fact that Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed when a reporter brought it up soon after the military began bombing boats, at least six of which have been struck so far. At least 27 people have been killed, and the grieving family of one victim spoke out Thursday and said they had not been involved in drug trafficking. Even if the vessels were carrying illegal substances, legal experts and critics in Congress have stressed in recent weeks that they should be dealt with, as in the past, by federal law enforcement agencies, as Congress has not authorized military action against Venezuela or drug cartels. “The American people do not want to be dragged into endless war with Venezuela without public debate or a vote,” said Paul. “We ought to defend what the Constitution demands: deliberation before war.” Meanwhile, Trump has suggested this week he could further escalate attacks on Venezuela, saying the Caribbean Sea is “very well under control” — even though Vice President JD Vance has joked that the US could accidentally strike fishing boats in its operations there. Kaine said he was “extremely troubled that the Trump administration is considering launching illegal military strikes inside Venezuela without a specific authorization by Congress.” “Americans don't want to send their sons and daughters into more wars — especially wars that carry a serious risk of significant destabilization and massive new waves of migration in our hemisphere,” said Kaine. “If my colleagues disagree and think a war with Venezuela is a good idea, they need to meet their constitutional obligations by making their case to the American people and passing an authorization for use of military force.” “I urge every senator to join us in stopping this administration from dragging our country into an unauthorized and escalating military conflict,” said the senator. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

No one was hurt in the incident when a wing from one plane struck the tail of another United aircraft

A United Airlines plane heading for its gate clipped the tail of another United aircraft at Chicago's O'Hare airport, authorities said.

No one was hurt in Friday's incident, and the 113 passengers on flight 2652 from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, were able to leave the plane normally after a delay, United officials said in a statement.

Runway collisions like these could add to worries about aviation safety in the wake of recent crashes and near misses – including the deadliest plane crash in the United States in decades, when an army helicopter collided with an airliner preparing to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National airport in January.

Earlier in October, two Delta Air Lines regional jets collided at the intersection of taxiways at LaGuardia airport in New York, injuring a flight attendant.

In Friday's case, the second United plane had its horizontal stabilizer struck and was not moving when the planes hit, officials said.

Bill Marcus, a passenger on the flight from Wyoming, said he didn't even realize anything happened until the pilot said there would be a delay to document something and passengers on the plane saw a number of people gather around the right wing.

“I was shocked that I didn't feel something more, although when they separated the planes there was some shuddering,” Marcus told CBS News Chicago. It took about 40 extra minutes for the plane to get to the gate, he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For some, it represents the end of an era. Others, such as the musician Hannah Diamond, suggest that era may have been over some time ago. “It hasn't been part of the conversation for such a long time that it really doesn't surprise me that they're ending it.” As an independent artist, she says, YouTube has always been the primary platform for music video releases. Jennifer Byrne, head of development at Academy Films – the famed production company that launched the careers of film-makers such as Jonathan Glazer through their music video work – says that “labels aren't as willing” to invest heavily in videos as they once were. “The number of times I'll come up with an idea that, to me, seems easy, and people are like: ‘No, that's gonna be 50 billion pounds,'” she says. “I'm like, that's funny, because it's in one house with four people. Neither Luz nor Byrne believes that the end of MTV will significantly impact music videos overall. In Luz's mind, videos now are less promotional tools than “vehicles for relatability and branding that makes [a viewer] want to buy into the artist,” she says. So a video is designed to convey that immediacy – where they're at in one moment – rather than make a big splash like 15 years ago.” There are also still barriers to entry for smaller artists, says Diamond. “The music videos I have made have been made through sheer luck, grafting or multiple years of work put into one thing,” she says. Directors are feeling the pinch too: Byrne says that where “back in the day, an artist would have been like, ‘I like what Glazer's doing, I'm going to talk to him,' now, you're pitching [to an artist] against [maybe] 10 different directors, and that's free labour on the director's part, creating this amazing treatment.” Plus, she says, “no one makes money out of these videos. Production companies don't – but we still do them because they're really important and a vital part of a director finding their own voice.” “Content can be an added facet to the [musician's] world,” she says, citing her work with the band Confidence Man, which she says is “on par with their shows and music videos because they have fun with it.” Despite everything, videos can still be a pipeline to feature directing, says Byrne: “If you look at [Everything Everywhere All at Once directors] The Daniels, they started off in the music video world, and then they won an Oscar,” she says. “Music videos still allow those unique personalities to shine through and take risks.” “Who knew that vinyl was going to make such a massive comeback, you know?” she says. Luz agrees: “It's like an album – albums are never gonna go away, and music videos are like punctuation for an album.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jasmine Entz, at her farm near Vulcan, Alta., poses with Beef, an eight-year-old Holstein that was recently declared by the Guinness Book of World Records to be the tallest living steer.LEAH HENNEL/The Globe and Mail Jasmine Entz met him just moments after he was born, all fresh into this world and still covered with slime. He was really cute, a purebred, black-headed Holstein lying in the straw. But there was something else that set him apart from all the other Holsteins at the dairy she works at in Lethbridge. “He was just a little go-getter right from the beginning.” She'd been looking for an animal to ride (yes, some people do ride cattle), and with his intelligence and gentle demeanour, this little black-headed fellow seemed like a perfect fit. He stayed at the dairy until he was weaned, then she brought him home to her hobby farm, to join her herd of 50 miniature goats. He was about three months old then, just a little guy, at least for a Holstein: 250 pounds and not yet up to her waist. She didn't mean for him to get so big. She fed Beef just like she would have any other calf, grain at first to develop his digestion, then a standard adult diet of various hays, with the odd pumpkin from a neighbour or something from the garden as a treat. And as the years went by, it eventually came to pass that Beef wasn't just tall, but strikingly, remarkably, record-breakingly tall. Beef was six years old when one of Ms. Entz's friends shared a story about Tommy, a brown steer in Massachusetts who then held the Guinness World Record for tall steers. Tommy was obviously no slouch, standing a respectable 6-foot-1 at the withers. But even before she measured, Ms. Entz already knew her Beef was bigger. “I was expecting him to get big,” Ms. Entz says. “I was not expecting him to get this big.” In just two more inches, he'll overtake Fiorino, a chianina ox from Italy who died in 2007, to become the tallest steer ever recorded. Even though they both enjoyed it, he's too big to fit her riding tack now, and, since she's afraid of heights, she'd be sitting too high off the ground for her comfort. Holsteins are big bovines by their genetics, but most steers don't have a chance to grow to maturity because – well, you know why. But Beef, through a combination of luck and charm, will live out his days in comfort and companionship on Ms. Entz's farm. Beef is healthy and receives regular checkups with a vet – dairy cattle have a naturally leaner look to them, if you were thinking he looks thin – but, let's face it, that's a lot of meat to carry around on those legs. Ms. Entz says the general consensus in cattle circles that, “it's a little silly that I'm feeding a 6-foot-6, eight-year-old Holstein steer.” “And I can't disagree with it,” she laughs. “You know, obviously Beef is the exception, because he's my baby and I've had him for eight years. Knowing what the cost of it is, no, I will not be getting another Holstein steer. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Work has begun to repair damaged off-site power lines to ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant) after 4-week outage, following establishment of local ceasefire zones to allow work to proceed,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director Rafael Grossi said in a social media post on Saturday. “Restoration of off-site power is crucial for nuclear safety and security. Both sides engaged constructively with the IAEA to enable complex repair plan to proceed,” he added. Neither side confirmed the local truce, but Ukraine's energy ministry said Ukrainian specialists were working to restore the power lines on Saturday, the 42nd round of repair works since Russia's full-scale invasion. The Russian-controlled power plant said in a post on Telegram that staff were carrying out restoration works, adding the Russian defense ministry was playing a “key role” in ensuring that the “work can be carried out in an area under active shelling by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.” The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant lost connection to its sole remaining power line last month, forcing the plant to run on emergency diesel generators for over 20 days, the IAEA reported. Both sides traded accusations over the outage. Russia said the blackout was caused by Ukrainian shelling. Russia has continued to carry out strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Two weeks ago, a Russian strike on a Ukrainian energy substation in the city of Slavutych caused a blackout that lasted more than three hours at the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Zelensky accused Moscow of a “deliberate strike” that involved “more than 20 drones,” stating that “the Russians could not have been unaware that striking facilities in Slavutych would have such consequences for Chernobyl.” CNN's Tim Lister and Gul Tuysuz contributed reporting</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Having survived the most restrictive supermax prison in the country on a trumped-up charge, Eric King tells what he saw. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Eric King has seen what hell looks like during his time in federal custody. While incarcerated, he was increasingly targeted for his anarchist political beliefs, often denied family visits, and restricted from receiving mail. In 2018, at FCI Florence, a lieutenant took him to a mop closet, where he was pushed and punched. King defended himself, after which he was slammed to the floor, stomped, handcuffed to a bed post, suffocated, and tortured. Unfairly charged with assaulting a government officer, he fought the case in court and won a “not guilty” verdict. When talking to King about ADX, or the Administrative Maximum Facility, he describes his experience as being entombed or buried. “These cells had held Tom Manning and Ray Luc. They held Mutulu Shakur and Oscar López Rivera. In this exclusive interview with Truthout, King discusses his new book, anarchism, mutual aid, supporting political prisoners, prison abolition, and more. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Zane McNeill: Can you start by introducing yourself and explaining why you wrote this book — who the audience is, what you hoped to accomplish, and maybe say a bit about your last book? There are books from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, but nothing from my generation that I could relate to — especially about federal prison. “I think people should care that there are human beings who have lived alone in a cell for over two decades — people we've never heard of and who will never be released.” The two experiences I had are things very few people go through. Inside, I'd get letters asking me to check out someone's website or if they could send me clothes, which showed me people don't understand — this prison is kept a secret, and it works. Many people — folks from Palestine, Cop City, people facing state repression, maybe soon just for being queer — are going to trial. That's why so many take plea deals. I felt both of these narratives were missing. Also, I think people should care that there are human beings who have lived alone in a cell for over two decades — people we've never heard of and who will never be released. One reason I wrote this book is to honor them. Why do you think it's important for people to understand what ADX is like and how it affects those inside? ADX matters to me because the government has built a narrative around it, and the public has accepted it without question. We've seen this before — other supermax prisons became almost mythical, like Alcatraz. People turn them into fiction and forget that real people suffered there, that there was real resistance, like the Battle of Alcatraz when prisoners fought the Marines. When I was in lower custody levels, you'd hear all kinds of wild stories about ADX — nonsense about it spinning underground — but you also knew it held the most infamous prisoners in the world, aside from state serial killers. Then I'd talk to friends outside, and they didn't know anything about it. Things won't change if no one's talking about it. The government says it imprisons the “the worst of the worst,” and people agree without knowing what it's really like — not hearing another human voice for a month, or having a guard refuse to sell you stamps so you can write your family, your only line of communication, and there's nothing you can do because you're behind two doors. In the book, you also discuss prison uprisings and how prisons evolved to prevent them and isolate people. There was a time when the BOP [Federal Bureau of Prisons] had [dozens of] political prisoners spread among [a handful] of prisons, and they made a difference. I've drawn strength from people like Kuwasi Balagoon, Bill Dunn, and David Gilbert — people who maintained their ethics inside — but also from my own trial and error. Throwing something in a guard's face will get you messed up. We don't “win” by getting hurt — there are no political prisoner points for suffering more. In my mind, all our revolts and rebellions should aim for that: undermine the prison, but strengthen yourself. Give yourself the chance to survive and make it out. You were an anarchist before prison and already had a political education. That's another misconception people have about prison, based on older revolutionaries. Back then, it was easier in some ways because there was so much social consciousness — movements like Black liberation were huge, and they empowered people inside in ways we can't fully understand today. Ed Mead of the George Jackson Brigade could sit and eat with Native Americans [in prison]. You can't do the same things now. So, when people talk about “revolutionizing” others in prison today, that's just not real — the administration will pull you off the yard. “One of the reasons I was sent to ADX was for ‘recruiting antifa,' which in reality meant giving anti-fascist and anti-racist books to people.” One of the reasons I was sent to ADX was for “recruiting antifa,” which in reality meant giving anti-fascist and anti-racist books to people. If someone didn't have money on their books, I'd point out that the white supremacists weren't sending them canteen money — meanwhile, my friends did, and I'd happily buy them a bad coffee. What should young political activists understand about the risks, vulnerabilities, and lack of guaranteed movement support if they are imprisoned? The movement doesn't always show up for you — a lot of people get forgotten. If it hadn't been for Denver Anarchist Black Cross, no one would've ever heard my name. It took that one group to really fight for me. And here's the ugly truth: They almost have to vouch for you, make you “worthy” to others. It's not enough that you're a human being suffering — people want to know your niche. Sure, there are pockets — Inland Empire, Reno, Los Angeles ABCF [chapter of the Anarchist Black Cross Federation], Salt Lake City, Portland, Blue Ridge, Bloomington, Chicago, and, of course, Eugene, where Josh Davidson, a supporter who became a dear friend of mine, lives — but if you don't have people having your back, you're alone. You talk to people like Kojo Bomani Sababu and the older Black Panthers [and] it's the same story. You've faced people who wanted to kill you, yet your anarchism still centers mutual aid, resistance, and collective care. It's a delicate balance, because I needed people. Even though I was abused by parts of the movement and saw how brutal people can be — guards, prisoners, even supporters — I also saw the beauty. I had people who chose to write to me for nine years, who made sure every month I had coffee, books, or magazines. They refused to let me be buried. From my perspective, getting out of prison and having opportunities but not using them to help others would feel like abuse. Sure, you can get out and just focus on yourself — you've been through enough — but for me, every person is someone I could connect with or encourage to help others. Disclosure: McNeill assisted with King's civil rights complaint during his incarceration at ADX. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posthumous memoir describes how the Prince's disastrous Newsnight interview provided ammunition for Giuffre's civil suit Prince Andrew insisted Virginia Giuffre sign a gag order so that he would not embarrass Elizabeth II during her Platinum Jubilee. Details of the legal battle and eventual agreement are revealed in Giuffre's posthumous memoir, which will be published next week. It describes how Prince Andrew's disastrous Newsnight interview provided ammunition for her civil suit. The Prince reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre on Feb 15 2022. “I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the Prince because it ensured that his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,” she wrote. Giuffre finished writing Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice in October last year. Her book describes how she was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell to work for Epstein at the age of 16. Epstein was arrested in 2019 and charged with running a sex trafficking network involving dozens of underage girls at his homes in New York and Palm Beach, Florida. The book sets out Giuffre's allegations that she was trafficked to a string of rich and powerful men. She describes her astonishment that Prince Andrew was photographed in public with the financier in 2010, after he served a sentence for sex crimes, including procuring a child for prostitution. And it details her legal battle with the Prince after suing him for unspecified damages in 2021. “As devastating as this interview was for Prince Andrew, for my legal team it was like an injection of jet fuel,” Giuffre wrote. “Its contents would not only help us build an ironclad case against the Prince but also open the door to potentially subpoenaing his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.” “The world didn't know it, but settlement discussions with Prince Andrew's team were suddenly moving quickly,” she wrote. “But I'd gotten more out of him than that: An acknowledgement that I and many other women had been victimised and a tacit pledge to never deny it again,” she wrote. “I was of course revolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll,” writes Giuffre, who finished the book six months before she took her own life in Australia, aged 41. “But mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein.” She said it was one thing for the rich and powerful to associate with Epstein before he admitted sex crimes in 2008. “Seeing this new photo of Prince Andrew at Epstein's side made ‘Randy Andy' seem even more arrogant to me.” Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice is published by Alfred A. Knopf.</p>

NEW YORK, October 18. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump will keep working on a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.

According to her, Trump "works around the clock in the pursuit of peace, and he will continue to do that with respect to Russia and Ukraine, just like he has with Israel and Gaza. <...> It's a new dawn in the Middle East, and we hope that can be true as well, with Russia and Ukraine, and the president is working very hard on that."

Leavitt pointed out that in his October 16 phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the October 17 meeting with Vladimir Zelensky, Trump made it clear that "this has been going on for far too long," and that US patience "is growing very thin."

Earlier, Trump wrote on the Truth Social platform that he had called on Zelensky to make a deal to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
