                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors should exercise “discernment” when considering privately-issued stablecoins, which carry all the risks of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) plus their own unique risks, according to Jeremy Kranz, founder and managing partner of venture capital firm Sentinel Global. Kranz called privately-issued stablecoins “central business digital currency,” which feature all of the surveillance, backdoors, programmability, and controls as CBDCs. Overcollateralized stablecoin issuers, which back their blockchain tokens with cash and short-term government securities, can be subject to “bank runs” if too many holders attempt to redeem the tokens at the same time, Kranz added. Algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins, which rely on software or complex trades to maintain their dollar-peg, also feature their own counterparty risks and dependencies, like the risk of de-pegging from volatility or flash crashes in crypto derivatives markets, he told Cointelegraph. Kranz said technology is a neutral tool that can be used to build a better financial future for humanity or be misused, but the outcomes are reliant on individual investors reading the fine print, understanding the risks, and making informed choices about the financial instruments they choose to hold. A plethora of opportunities and risks are coming down the pipeline "This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor central bank digital currency,” she said in a July 15 X post. “The Federal Reserve has been planning a CBDC for years, and this will open the door to move you to a cashless society and into digital currency that can be weaponized against you by an authoritarian government controlling your ability to buy and sell,” she added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, October 17, CEO Devin Finzer announced via X that Opensea will launch a native token, SEA, in Q1 2026, transitioning from an NFT marketplace to a full-suite on-chain trading platform. This is just the beginning of our transformation, from “NFT marketplace” to “trade everything.” In an X space attended by 11,100 users, Finzer outlined OpenSea's plans for a unified on-chain economy, enabling seamless trading of tokens, art, culture, and digital goods across multiple chains without compromising asset custody. Early users and participants in OpenSea's reward programs will receive significant claim allocations. Further details confirm that 50% of OpenSea's launch revenue will be used to purchase SEA tokens. Additionally, $SEA holders will be able to stake their tokens behind favorite NFT collections and assets, embedding governance and utility into OpenSea's core interface. He added that OpenSea's mobile app is already in the works, offering full access to on-chain trading, while perpetual trading (perps) and cross-chain abstraction features are under development ahead of the Q1 2026 launch. CryptoPunks remains the dominant collection, commanding 33.6% market share, while Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Pudgy Penguins make up the top three, with 6.02% and 5.02%, respectively. At press time, OpenSea's trading volume has reached $2.6 billion this month, reflecting active user engagement while NFT valuations have plunged.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Bay Area investigator who visited one of the alleged scammer's overseas compounds is sharing videos with the ABC7 I-Team. SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- The Department of Justice has seized a record $15 billion in Bitcoin from a cyber fraud operation based in Cambodia that targeted Americans. An investigator from San Jose is very familiar with this case. She visited one of the alleged scammer's overseas compounds earlier this year, and now, she's sharing her videos with the I-Team's Dan Noyes. The Department of Justice has indicted 38-year-old Chinese national, Chen Zhi, for wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy, and labeled his conglomerate of companies based out of Cambodia called the Prince Group as a "transnational criminal organization." The government seized 127,000 Bitcoin from Chen's accounts, worth $15 billion at the time - much of it received from unsuspecting American victims. Cyber fraud investigator Erin West told the I-Team, "If you can grab 15 billion of this, then how much has gone through that man's wallet? If we were able to take back 15 billion." West is very familiar with Chen Zhi and his operations. The attorney retired from Santa Clara County's fraud unit and launched her nonprofit, Shamrock, to help victims. West visited one of Chen's compounds in Cambodia earlier this year. You can see their laundry, you can see them inside, but there's no cars because nobody's going anywhere. These are people that are being held against their will and being forced to scam 16 hours a day." The cyber scam compound is disguised as an apartment building, even advertising rentals. West and her journalist friends approached the guard. Journalist: "So, this one is what business? Chen employed violence to keep the workers in line, the indictment saying he kept photographs depicting some of his methods. Then, the process called "pig-butchering" begins in which the scammer grooms a victim over days, weeks or months. "A typical romance scam and then after that, we will have shown you all along that the person you think you're in love with is a wealthy person and ultimately will say, 'Well, do you know why I'm so wealthy? Last year, West also visited a cyber fraud compound that had been busted in the Philippines. On the scene, she said, "It's more than 35 buildings and was designed and built for the sole purpose of scamming." MORE: Bitcoin ATMs increasingly used by scammers to target victims, critics say "They chain them up," a guide said. While the bust in Cambodia is a good step with that record $15 billion haul, West cautions victims here about getting their hopes up for seeing their money again. "I think we need to be really cautious about setting expectations about the return of that money to victims. And I don't think it's clear right now exactly who will be getting that money." The indictment says Chen Zhi operated dozens of business entities in more than 30 countries and that he paid bribes to foreign public officials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee and his Ethereum bet is back in the headlines this time on reports of a fresh $281 million buy that has crypto traders asking what he sees next for ETH. Tom Lee's BitMine Immersion reportedly bought 72,898 ether, worth about $281 million, within the last 24 hours. BitMine's Ethereum holdings have risen to 3.03 million ETH, about 2.5% of the total circulating supply, after adding roughly 202,000 tokens since Oct. 6. Analysts noted there are no visible transaction hashes, wallet addresses, or regulatory filings to verify the purchase. According to Coingecko data, Ether traded around $3,830 to $3,870 on Friday, posting slight daily gains of +0.8% yet still below its early-October highs. Market observers say investors such as Lee appear to be accumulating during weakness, wagering that Ethereum's long-term fundamentals will outweigh short-term swings. Crypto analyst Ted says Ethereum's next move depends on how it reacts to a large liquidity cluster between $4,400 and $4,800. The chart shows heavy sell orders stacked in that range, a sign that many traders are preparing to exit or short near those levels. Ethereum's rebound from below $3,600 lost strength around the mid-$4,000 zone. Ted said that if a US-China trade deal goes through, Ethereum could reach the upper band near $4,800 as shorts start closing. But if market sentiment weakens, ETH may slip back toward lower support before finding a base. Right now, Ethereum sits between two major liquidity zones, one above, one belo,w and whichever breaks first could set the tone for the next big move. The coin is currently trading near $3,870, and Tony expects another test of the $3,300–$3,400 range, a zone that could mark the formation of a double bottom, a classic signal of seller exhaustion and potential reversal. He noted that this projected wave (b) low fits within the ongoing correction, hinting at one final dip before a rebound. If buyers return around support, he believes ETH could soon shift back into recovery mode. Read original story Tom Lee Bought $281 Million in Ethereum Crypto: Does He Know Something We Don't?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CleanSpark (CLSK) has seen its stock attract a fresh wave of attention following recent industry developments and insights from company leadership. Momentum has clearly been building for CleanSpark, as excitement around institutional adoption of Bitcoin and surging industry activity has powered the stock to a 70% share price gain over the past month and a standout 107% year-to-date return. When you look at the three-year total shareholder return of nearly 570%, it is no wonder investors are watching closely even as volatility remains a feature of the sector. If bitcoin's recent rally has you wondering what other growth stories are out there, now is a great time to broaden your search and discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership After such remarkable gains, the key question looms: Is CleanSpark's stock still trading at a discount, or have markets already priced in the robust growth and institutional momentum around Bitcoin mining? CleanSpark's last close price of $19.53 sits just below its most popular narrative fair value estimate of $20.16, giving it a slight undervaluation edge as analysts look past short-term swings to focus on long-term profitability drivers. The widely discussed narrative pulls together policy tailwinds, efficient growth, and sector leadership to support its valuation, setting the stage for some compelling catalysts and assumptions. The company's strategic focus on sourcing flexible, low-cost, and increasingly renewable energy, combined with operating in supportive states, reduces exposure to volatile energy markets and supports stable or expanding gross margins. This fosters long-term earnings resilience in an industry prone to input cost shocks. Industry consolidation, with less efficient or capital-constrained miners exiting or pivoting to non-Bitcoin compute, is increasing CleanSpark's market share (already rising from 4.3% to 5.6% of global hash rate) and strengthening its competitive position. This consolidation is likely to support continued top-line growth and improved operating leverage. Want to know the financial playbook powering this bullish scenario? The narrative's fair value hinges on bold growth assumptions, aggressive margin moves, and a forward-looking profit multiple that hints at major upside. Click to uncover what could change the game for this stock. However, a prolonged drop in Bitcoin prices or regulatory changes could quickly challenge CleanSpark's growth story and test the durability of its current momentum. Find out about the key risks to this CleanSpark narrative. Looking beyond narratives, CleanSpark is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.8x. This situation highlights the balance between potential value and valuation risk. Could market sentiment shift the multiple, or is something being missed?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Stagnation was the norm throughout most of human history,” the committee observed, “Despite important discoveries now and again — which sometimes led to improved living conditions and higher incomes — growth always eventually levelled off.” But Mokyr identified prerequisites for sustained growth through technological progress, including: useful knowledge, mechanical competence, and institutions conducive to technological progress — as well as the “importance of society being open to new ideas and allowing change”. State of the art zkVM Jolt now proves RISC-V programs using 64-bit registers, rather than just 32-bit ones. And it does so at speeds exceeding those we reported two months ago for 32-bit programs: And how did Jolt hit RV64IMAC speeds (cycles/sec), exceeding our RV32IM results from two months ago? This gap matters: Without well-designed incentives, a system may distribute storage but fail to truly decentralize it. So we analyze Shelby — a storage network protocol recently proposed by Aptos Labs and Jump Crypto — and provide the first formal proof of its incentive properties. Our game-theoretic model shows that while off-chain audits alone collapse to universal shirking, Shelby's combination of peer audits with occasional on-chain verification yields incentive compatibility under natural parameter settings. We also examine coalition behavior and outline a simple modification that strengthens the protocol's collusion-resilience. Meanwhile, Bridge CEO shared this week that they submitted an application “for organizing a national trust bank” to the OCC. If the charter is issued, it would allow them to provide custody, stablecoin issuance, management of stablecoin reserves, and more, he said, “under a unified federal framework consistent with the GENIUS Act”. Citi's global head of partnerships and innovation said that “We may have certain solutions that are completely designed and built in-house that are targeted towards certain assets and certain segment of our clients, whereas may we may use a… third party, lightweight, nimble solution for other kind of assets.” BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with $13.46 trillion in assets under management, continues to push tokenization of assets, as reported in its Q3 earnings call this week. “We're spending a great deal of time on the tech,” CEO Larry Fink stated.

These requests don't produce new transactions or leave visible trails in blockchain analytics tools, and because the contracts themselves are immutable, defenders can't remove the embedded scripts. In practical terms, the technique allows threat actors to update or swap malware payloads by rewriting contract storage variables on-chain, all without needing to re-compromise distribution sites or clients. While financially motivated actors have previously used this infrastructure, Google says this marks the first time it has seen a state-sponsored crew fold the technique into its operational toolkit. Google's report ties the blockchain infrastructure to real-world infections delivered through compromised WordPress sites and social engineering lures, including fake job interviews designed to bait crypto developers. Victims who land on these sites receive the JADESNOW loader, which then reaches out to the on-chain smart contracts, retrieves a JavaScript payload, and runs it locally. While Google does not specify how smart contract data was retrieved, previous EtherHiding research has shown that attackers often rely on standard JSON-RPC calls, which may traverse public or hosted infrastructure. Blocking those services or forcing clients to use self-hosted nodes with policy restrictions could offer interim containment. On the browser side, organizations can enforce strict extension and script execution policies and lock down update workflows to prevent fake Chrome-style alerts from gaining traction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His distinctive creations have been exhibited in leading venues around the world. In an exclusive interview, Salazar shares his journey with Colombia One. Salazar is a marketing and international business professional with more than 15 years of experience in the field. This path took shape while pursuing a master's degree in Barcelona, where his connection with local artists inspired him to fully embrace art. “I not only managed to exhibit but also sold a piece at that first show,” he recalls. With his motivation fired up, he continued betting on the artistic path. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, represent a new way of owning and trading digital art through blockchain technology. For artists like Salazar, this innovation opened new possibilities: “When I came back to Colombia, extremely motivated by this exhibition, I created my first NFT collection, which had five editions. That showed me that maybe this was also the path to start showcasing my work and reaching, through art, an international audience — or even, as I see it today, a global one,” he explains. In 2021, after returning to Bogota, he joined his first international NFT exhibition — a digital show held in Panama — marking the beginning of his global journey: “I realized it wasn't just about selling or interacting in a digital market — it was about exhibiting and expanding the reach of my art across borders,” he says. By late 2022, he followed international NFT movements in cities such as New York, Paris, and Miami, studying how artists were taking their work to new heights. “We were no longer just exhibiting our works digitally in a private event — we were connecting with a massive audience. For an entire day, we took over the screens of New York, showcasing our pieces and receiving that highlight as participating artists. It revealed a completely different dynamic to us,” he recalls. Together with his close friends Yuseph Zapata (YuZapata) and Lucas Zapata (Luko), he founded an artistic collective called The Art Cartel. “As Colombians, the word cartel often carries a negative meaning abroad,” he explains. After all, the word ‘art' is right there inside ‘cartel', in both English and Spanish,” he adds. “These interactions have shown us the great potential of NFTs and how those of us who come from traditional art — since I come from painting physical canvases — can begin to find opportunities in the world of NFTs,” the artist says. Salazar's work has traveled across the globe, reaching Miami Art Week, Art Basel, Portugal, Finland, Japan, Madrid, Mexico, and Costa Rica, among others. Judasaca's artistic universe is built around transformation — the belief that “nothing stays the same.” Through this lens, he reimagines icons of pop culture such as Mickey Mouse, Snoopy, and Woodstock, taking them out of their familiar narratives and placing them in new settings. His work lately invites viewers to look beyond nostalgia and discover emotions, contradictions, and reflections that echoed Salazar's life.“If the viewer takes the time to pause — to look a little beyond the surface — they realize there is a message behind it. Since my latest collection, I've started painting more of my emotions and how they are reflected in these cultural icons that shaped our childhood. Seeing them here now, we think, ‘Wow, I'm no longer five years old.' Judasaca merges his background in marketing with his artistic instinct, playing with animated icons on the canvas, challenging permanence over time. His paintings, often infused with augmented or digital elements, illustrate a world in flux, where even the icons that shaped our imagination are forced to evolve. “I play with art and technology to create experiences that go beyond the canvas — and beyond the screen,” he says. For him, these networks provide more than exposure — they are spaces where artists connect and collaborate on a global scale. He also helped create Chromaverse, a platform where artists can showcase their work in both physical and digital galleries, enhanced with immersive virtual reality experiences. “Being part of this allowed us, especially as Latin American artists, to reach a global market, sell our work, and gain recognition that can be challenging in emerging markets where art collecting is just taking off,” he says. These experiences underscore how his bold approach — merging classic painting techniques with immersive digital experiences — has introduced his vision to a global audience. By leveraging NFTs, VR exhibitions, and community networks, Salazar has created new opportunities for Colombian art to thrive on the world stage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During D.C. Fintech Week in Washington, D.C. this past week, I moderated a conversation about how decentralized finance (DeFi) projects could be compliant with different regulations. Developers' liability for how their decentralized projects are used has already been the subject of multiple criminal cases in the U.S. and elsewhere (see, for example, the cases against Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev). Without getting into the specifics of those cases, there is a broader general question as to how much developers can do to prevent malicious actors from using their projects, and to what extent regulators can design guide rails for DeFi. I was privileged enough to discuss this with Maha El Dimachki, the head of the BIS Innovation Hub's Singapore Centre, Yaya Fanusie, global head of Policy at Aleo, and Lee Schneider, general counsel at Ava Labs, during a panel at D.C. Fintech Week on Thursday. Users should be able to use a truly decentralized protocol for any purpose, and the project's developers should not have any ability to interfere with these transactions. Another is that developers are or should be required to prevent dangerous actors from taking advantage of their projects. The biggest of these caveats is that we need to come up with a specific consensus agreement on how we're defining compliance here. Fanusie said he would describe developers' obligations more as "risk management," focusing on what issues they might encounter (alleged money launderers or other malicious actors, for example) Schneider said that another way of describing this is that neither developers nor regulators want users to lose their money (to roughly paraphrase his comments). And El Dimachki, who was previously at the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, said outcome-based policymaking, with regulators looking to prevent malicious activity being the goal of how they could approach rules around DeFi. Obviously this is an ongoing debate, and I'm curious what you all think. I'd love to gather your thoughts on the following questions: I'd love to have a follow-up conversation at some point. And of course, I'd like to thank the good folks over at the Fintech Foundation for inviting me to be a part of this conversation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Dorsey Prods Tether Over Donation to Support Bitcoin Devs Sometimes it can be easier to say nothing at all. This week, stablecoin giant Tether announced a $250,000 donation to OpenSats to support Bitcoin developers—only for one of the world's best-known programmers (and Bitcoin maximalists) to publicly chastise the size of the gift. Twitter co-founder and Square CEO Jack Dorsey lampooned the donation Thursday on X, shortly after it was touted by Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino. Tether is one of the crypto industry's most profitable companies. The USDT issuer, which posted a $13 billion profit last year, is reportedly seeking a $500 billion valuation in talks with potential investors. Tether said its donation to OpenSats, which funds the development of free and open-source Bitcoin software, will support the nonprofit's operations and grant-making efforts. A representative for the company did not respond to Decrypt's request for comment on Dorsey's comment, which Ardoino did not respond publicly to. Shortly after the comment was made, however, another X user pressed Dorsey on his own financial commitment to the cause of protecting Bitcoin developers, questioning how much he had donated. Indeed, OpenSats received a $21 million donation from Dorsey's Start Small initiative in 2024. The tech billionaire has been an outspoken advocate for decentralized technology and censorship resistance for years, and one of the most famous Bitcoin backers around. Udi Wertheimer, creator of popular Bitcoin Ordinals project Taproots Wizards, at first took Dorsey's side in the scuffle—but then turned on the Twitter inventor. “No one should go into a pissing match with Jack when it comes to funding open-source Bitcoin development,” Wertheimer said. “Sadly, that capital is being actively deployed to slow down development.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The confiscated Bitcoin–the largest crypto forfeiture in Justice Department history–may test the Trump Administration's plan for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. While investors know almost exactly how much gold the US holds in Fort Knox, it is unclear how much Bitcoin is already available for the strategic reserve. Crypto industry publications estimate that US government-controlled wallets contain $36 billion worth of Bitcoin. However, that number is unverified and may be larger than what will enter the reserve itself. The executive order specifies that some US government -controlled Bitcoin may be reserved for victim restitution or other statutory purposes. Tuesday's seizure could be the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve's single largest haul so far. On Tuesday, the Justice Department indicted Cambodian national Chen Zhi, chairman of the Prince Group, for large-scale fraud, money laundering, and human trafficking schemes. The Prince Group allegedly trafficked workers into barricaded phone farms in Cambodia and violently forced them to operate “pig-butchering” scams. Just two of these compounds housed 1,250 cell phones that controlled 76,000 social media accounts. In a psychological long-con, the workers “fattened victims up” by building trust and then “butchered” them with bogus crypto schemes. It shows how the US can transform illicit crypto assets into a national strength without new taxpayer spending. The Prince Group and other pig butchering schemes in Southeast Asia have been tied to larger Chinese-diaspora criminal networks, part of a web of corruption often enabled by Beijing. As US-China competition rises and pig butchering schemes proliferate, more digital assets are likely to enter US coffers. Questions remain over which agency has custody of seized Bitcoin, who audits and secures it, how it is valued, and how transfers occur between agencies or into the Reserve. Victims' claims can take years to resolve while prices swing wildly. Victims likely will expect restitution in stable fiat currencies. This valuation-timing mismatch complicates accounting and exposes the government to additional risk. Law enforcement is now a growth strategy for US government asset accumulation in an asset class where supply is finite. Prosecutors and law enforcement officials may be inadvertent market actors. Without clear transparency rules or congressional oversight, the Reserve could create policy risk and information asymmetry–conditions that destabilize markets. US states and foreign governments, are also establishing crypto reserves, inspired or provoked by Washington's move. Managing a massive crypto reserve is complex in a developed legal system like the United States, and more so in states with high corruption and weak justice systems. Any technical or political breach could destroy confidence, tank markets, and devastate victims. If any government's crypto reserve becomes mismanaged or used as a political stunt, politicians' reputations may be destroyed, victims' assets could be decimated for a second time, and markets could roil. Governments accumulating finite crypto assets like Bitcoin could inadvertently or intentionally compete for market share. Hypothetically, a rival state with its own crypto reserves might deliberately dump Bitcoin to undervalue the US reserve or create market instability. Politicians or prosecutors might push for aggressive seizure policies to pad crypto reserves. Large government crypto holdings ironically undermine the fundamental premise of digital currency. Crypto backers argue that decentralized digital currencies put governance in the hands of the blockchain rather than governments and institutional intermediaries, reducing potential for hacking and manipulation while reducing fees. Government custodians of large reserves can buy, sell, and regulate crypto in ways that concentrate distribution and fundamentally change the crypto ecosystem. Crypto's promise of decentralization is colliding with governments' desires to control it. Tuesday's seizure may give the new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve a huge injection of value and legitimacy. Such a large accumulation of Bitcoin–with more seizures likely to come–might shift how other states or private actors perceive regulatory risk and make market moves. Without safeguards, strategic reserves and the systems storing them could be vulnerable to attacks by adversary states. Reducing the uncertainty surrounding the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and US Digital Assets Stockpile will help protect US investors and safeguard our new national assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>North Korean hackers are now using a blockchain-based method known as EtherHiding to deliver malware to facilitate their crypto theft operations. According to experts, a North Korean hacker was discovered using this method, where attackers embed codes like JavaScript Payloads inside a blockchain-based smart contract. It claimed that using EtherHiding is convenient in the face of conventional takedown and blocklisting efforts. The threat intelligence group mentioned that it has been tracking threat actor UNC5342 since February 2025, integrating EtherHiding into an ongoing social engineering campaign. Google mentioned that it has linked the usage of EtherHiding to a social engineering campaign tracked by Palo Alto Networks as Contagious Interview. The Contagious Interview was carried out by North Korean actors. According to Socket researchers, the group expanded its operation with a new malware loader, XORIndex. The loader has accumulated thousands of downloads, with the targets being job seekers and individuals believed to own digital assets or sensitive credentials. In this campaign, the North Korean hackers use JADESNOW malware to distribute a JavaScript variant of INVISIBLEFERRET, which has been used to carry out so many cryptocurrency thefts. The campaign targets developers in the crypto and technology industries, stealing sensitive data, digital assets, and gaining access to corporate networks. It also centers around a social engineering tactic that copies legitimate recruitment processes using fake recruiters and fabricated companies. After that, the malware is then delivered to their systems and devices through fake coding tests or software downloads disguised as technical assessments or interview fixes. The campaign uses a multi-stage malware infection process, which usually involves malware like JADESNOW, INVISIBLEFERRET, and BEAVERTAIL, to compromise the victim's devices. The malware affects Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. EtherHiding provides a better advantage to attackers, with GTIG noting that it acts as a particularly challenging threat to mitigate. While security researchers may try to warn the community about a malicious contract by tagging it, it doesn't stop hackers from carrying out their malicious activities using the smart contract. In addition, attackers can retrieve their malicious payload using read-only calls that do not leave a visible transaction history on the blockchain, making it hard for researchers to track their activities on the blockchain. According to the threat research report, EtherHiding represents a “shift towards next-generation bulletproof hosting” where the most glaring features of blockchain technology are being used by scammers for malicious purposes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours as a broad sell-off sent Bitcoin from above $109,000 toward $105,000, with intraday prints near $104,700 on some venues. In all, almost 290,000 traders were “rekt” as cascading margin calls rippled across exchanges, amplifying volatility and slippage in thin order books. Technicians now flag $104,000 as first defense and $100,000 as the next major support, while a push back above $112,000–$114,000 could stabilize price action. Altcoins lagged as capital rotated toward Bitcoin and stablecoins during the broader risk-off move. The most significant single liquidation occurred on HYPE, where an ETH-USD position worth $20 million was force-closed amid cascading margin calls. BNB fell double digits from recent highs; XRP slid toward $2.20 as open interest fell from $9 billion to $3.5 billion following a $610 million liquidation event, even as Volatility Shares filed for a 5x leveraged XRP ETF. Meme coins were hit hardest as on-chain data show aggressive de-risking and reduced spot depth. James Wynn suffered multiple liquidations on $kPEPE longs, including a wipe of 9.79 million kPEPE ($66,000) as he re-levered into subsequent dips. Tracking services note Machi's cumulative drawdowns now far exceed earlier gains, an object lesson in the dangers of high leverage during volatility spikes. If BTC holds $104,000 and ETFs flip back to net inflows, a range rebuild is likely; lose it, and the market's gaze shifts to the psychological $100,000 round number with wider collateral effects across altcoins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let me lay out how this change is reshaping finance, what the pros and cons are of adopting these practices, and what it means for work in a digital economy. Crypto payroll is basically paying employees using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or stablecoins, instead of the usual fiat currencies. This new trend is really picking up steam with businesses, especially among SMEs who want to streamline how they pay and hope to attract a tech-savvy workforce. Their decision to cut rates is sending ripples through the use of crypto payroll. Lowering interest rates will pump more money into the financial system, which makes cryptocurrencies more appealing to everyone, from investors to companies. The thing is, as interest rates fall, other income sources for businesses dwindle too. Using crypto payroll not only helps save money, but it means speed, lower costs, and global payments without borders. In a world where low interest rates are normal, companies have to adapt or risk losing out. One of the biggest upsides to crypto payroll is its costs savings. Lower transaction fees and no need for banks means that SMEs can keep more money in their pocket. What company wouldn't want that especially if they're trying to work across borders? Offering crypto salaries is also a way to attract younger workers. Gen Z who are more open to using digital currency. These companies can also show they're forward-looking and modern, since crypto payroll shows they care about flexibility and new payment methods. They're automating things like tax compliance and settlements. That means less administrative work and more efficiency. As SMEs start using blockchain payroll platforms, they gain access to financial tools that work with both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Market volatility is always a risk with crypto. Everyone knows the price swings can be a headache for companies trying to plan payroll expenses. To get around this, many are going for stablecoins instead since they're a more stable value than other cryptos. The rules around cryptocurrencies are still being written and firms have to keep pace. This makes it tough for SMEs trying to jump on the crypto payroll train. Low-interest is a real moment for crypto banks, right? They are looking to thrive especially as these services become more common. They might even be the new wave of Web3 banking or whatever you want to label it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) declined by 2% on Friday despite reports of key crypto investors in Asia collaborating in an effort to launch a $1 billion ETH treasury, according to Bloomberg. Several crypto leaders in Asia have begun plans to enter the Ethereum treasury race, with Li Lin, founder of crypto exchange Huobi and chairman of investment firm Avenir Capital, joining forces with a group of investors in an effort to launch a $1 billion ETH treasury. The cohort includes HashKey Group CEO and Chairman Xiao Feng, Fenbushi Capital co-founder Shen Bo and Meitu Inc. founder Cai Wensheng. The initiative has already seen investors pledge about $1 billion, including a $500 million investment from institutional investors, including HongShan Capital Group (formerly Sequoia China) and $200 million from Lin's Avenir Capital, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. SharpLink Gaming follows behind with over 797,000 ETH worth roughly $3 billion. With more firms pivoting to an Ethereum treasury, experts are predicting a bubble. BitMine Chairman Thomas Lee stated that the 'bubble has burst' in digital asset treasury companies, as many trade below net asset value. A failure to hold $3,800 could send ETH toward the support just below $3,500. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are below their neutral levels, indicating a dominant bearish momentum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They've always been there but in recent months there have been countless high profile attacks which have potentially huge consequences, including: However, smaller businesses or even those not 'in the spotlight' can't rest easy in the hope hackers won't care about them. In fact, they may even be low hanging fruit. It's clear that 'no one is safe' and those behind these attacks show no signs of slowing down. A representative from the National Crime Agency suggests she has seen incidents double in the last two years to around 35 – 40 per week. Recent research based on a survey of over 200 cybersecurity professionals in the UK whose companies were subject to a ransomware attack between January – March 2025 also shows that the median demand is over £4 million, which could be devastating for small businesses. It's, therefore, unsurprising that the ICO have issued a list of practical steps small businesses should take: Data should be regularly backed up, but you also need to check it has worked/is working as intended. Equally, you'll need to make sure the back up isn't connected to the live data source to ensure that, if there is malicious activity, it won't reach the back up. Always consider strong and unique passwords which would be difficult to guess (e.g. the National Cyber Security Centre recommend picking three random words for passwords). Where you have the option, always consider enabling multifactor authentication (MFA). Although it may be inconvenient waiting for your code to be text/emailed, this second layer of security is always a useful measure to implement. It's important to exercise caution when working out and about. It's always important to ensure you are cautious of suspicious emails. Sometimes it may just be an odd new request, but things like bad grammar, a need to act urgently, and requests for payment are typical signs something may not be real. It's also worth checking email addresses carefully, e.g. a capital 'i' (I) looks near identical to a lower case L (l). However, things like generative AI and spoofing technologies are enabling threat actors to become more sophisticated. Equally, it could appear to come from the sender you know (see, for example, where deepfakes were used to convince someone to transfer $25 million on what they believed were the instructions of the CFO). Whether in an office or working from home/away, you need to ensure your devices are secure. Anti-virus software is a useful tool to protect against malware which may be sent via phishing attacks. If you're going to be away for longer, make sure your screens are in a secure place. Even if you're conscious of your surroundings and locked your screen as recommended while in a cafe, if you're using the public Wi-Fi or an insecure connection you could still be risking personal data. Always make sure you are using a secure connection when connecting to the internet, and if you use the cafe's public network, it's worth also using a secure virtual private network. Showing someone the wrong thing is hardly new, but it still happens. For example, you may be sharing your screen in a meeting and have tabs or documents which are confidential or include personal data open which can easily be accidentally shown. Equally, make sure notifications are turned off if you're sharing a screen to avoid someone else sending something to you being seen by others. If you're emailing lots of people which could reveal sensitive information about recipients, consider alternatives to BCC'ing them, such as bulk email or mail merge services. It's not uncommon for people to CC rather than BCC people, but in certain contexts this could reveal sensitive, if not special category, personal data (see for example, the charity which was fined by the ICO in 2020 when they CC'd 105 members of an HIV advisory board on an email which meant people could be identified). The ICO do also have guidance on sending bulk communications via email. Don't keep data for longer than you need it Not only does this limit the amount of personal information which is at risk if you are subject to an attack or there is a breach, but it will also free up storage space and is likely cheaper! When someone leaves the business, or they get new equipment, make sure there is no personal data on the devices (whether they are laptops, smartphones, or any device) before they are thrown away. The ICO is clear that "[m]ost small businesses hold personal information and conduct business digitally, so cyber security must be a priority". Ian Hulme (Executive Director for Regulatory Supervision at the ICO) also added that "[w]hile cyber attacks can be very sophisticated, we find that many organisations are still neglecting the very foundations of cyber security". Of course, all types of organisations need to ensure their systems are resilient against complex attacks, and they are able to meet their security obligations under data protection law. Equally, no system is infallible and it's not uncommon, for example, for cyber criminals to simply buy their way in by 'paying off' an employee. It may also be worthwhile considering obtaining insurance to cover the costs of a cyberattack (although you'll still need to have a good standard of security in place to ensure you don't void any such insurance). If you'd like to discuss your security obligations or how best to mitigate the chance of and prepare for a cyberattack, or would like training for your organisation, please do reach out to your usual Lewis Silkin contact.</p>
