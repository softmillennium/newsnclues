Lamine Yamal marked his return with an assist as substitute Ronald Araujo rescued a late winner for Barcelona against Girona, sparing a wasteful Marcus Rashford's blushes in the process. In a frantic end to the game, that Barca won at the death 2-1, head coach Hansi Flick was sent off - a costly red card that means he'll be forced to watch next week's Clasico from the stands.

Injury-hit Barca were looking to end a two-game losing run and all without Joan Garcia, Robert Lewandowski, Dani Olmo and Raphinha, with Flick forced to name a weakened team due to the absentees. Yamal, available again after injury, did make the starting XI, though, and provided his fourth assist of the season for Pedri early in the first half as the hosts made their dominance count. 

Girona were level in the 20th minute through an acrobatic Axel Witsel effort and could have doubled their advantage had Wojciech Szczesny not made smart stops to deny Vladyslav Vanat and Portu in quick succession. Rashford then smashed a free-kick off the crossbar on the half-hour mark as the Blaugrana aimed to make home advantage count.

Barcelona continued to huff and puff after the break, with Fermin Lopez, who was introduced at half-time, looking lively having struck the woodwork shortly after the restart. Pau Cubarsi then saw a second-half goal ruled out, while Rashford fluffed his lines from close range as Girona edged closer to securing an unlikely point.

However, the resolve was broken in second-half injury time as Araujo bagged a late winner and Barcelona's superiority paid off right at the death.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luka Modric has proven to be one of those rare figures. His positioning under the ball has made the Rossoneri's build-up seamless, offering defenders constant passing options and dismantling pressing traps with simple yet intelligent movements. Beyond tactics, Modric's presence has reshaped the atmosphere at Milanello. The team's performances have improved, but so has its belief. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, sales of Milan shirts featuring Modric's No.14 have surpassed those of Rafael Leao and Christian Pulisic, especially the club's striking yellow third kit. Simply put, Modric has brought prestige and purpose back to Milan, proving that even at 40, his artistry remains timeless. Before arriving in Italy, Modric's farewell to Real Madrid was emotional. During those years, he collected six Champions League titles, five Club World Cups, and four La Liga crowns, becoming one of the club's most decorated players. According to Defensa Central, the Croatian has already accepted an offer from Florentino Perez to return after his retirement, possibly as a coach or club ambassador. The plan, reportedly, is for Modric to take a one-year sabbatical after his Milan career ends, whether that's next year or in 2027, to spend time with his family. Luka Modric of Real Madrid presents his Ballon d'Or Trophy to the crowd. Despite planning his future, Modric remains fully focused on Milan and on one final international goal — the 2026 World Cup, where he hopes to lead Croatia one last time. His physical condition remains extraordinary, and both he and the Rossoneri are reportedly open to extending his current deal, which runs until June 2026, with an option for an additional year. At this stage of his career, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner has nothing left to prove — yet he continues to redefine what greatness looks like in soccer. From commanding the Bernabeu to mastering San Siro, his influence stretches beyond the field, touching every player and supporter who witnesses his craft. When Lamine Yamal stood motionless alongside his Barcelona teammates at the start of their clash with Girona, few watching live could understand what was happening.

Erling Haaland continued his incredible goalscoring form as Manchester City claimed a 2-0 victory over Everton on Saturday afternoon. The in-form striker netted a second-half brace as Pep Guardiola's side, if only temporarily, moved above title rivals Arsenal and Liverpool and stretched their unbeaten run to eight games in all competitions at the Etihad Stadium.

In a tight opening 45 minutes which saw City limited to a handful of half chances, Everton striker Beto had the best opportunity to break the deadlock but he was unable to convert for David Moyes' men, who performed admirably in the first half.

However, City made the visitors pay after the interval, taking the lead through Haaland after the Norway international headed home from Nico O'Reilly's cross. And the forward had a second just five minutes later when his low drive found its way past Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, taking his tally up to 11 goals in just eight league games.

Haaland almost had a hat-trick late on but he was thwarted by Pickford as City moved to the top of the table ahead of Arsenal's trip to Fulham later on Saturday, with Liverpool set to host Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has backed away from a potential conflict with President Donald Trump over his assertion that he could move some of next summer's World Cup matches out of U.S. cities he deemed unsafe. In suggesting earlier this week that parts of Boston had been "taken over" by recent unrest, Trump said FIFA president Gianni Infantino would "very easily" move 2026 World Cup matches away from designated host cities if he asked him to. In response, FIFA conceded that host countries are ultimately responsible for making sure their World Cup venues are safe. "Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide. Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety," a FIFA spokesperson said in a statement. Earlier in the day, Boston mayor Michelle Wu implied the city was ready for a faceoff with Trump if he tried to move the matches scheduled for Gillette Stadium in nearby Foxborough. "Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it," Wu said on the "Java with Jimmy" show. "We are going to continue to be who we are and that means, unfortunately, we are going to continue to be in a conversation in a way that is targeting Boston's values." FIFA had no comment on any of the cities or stadiums mentioned by Trump. Trump also suggested that he would consider moving the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA World Cup 2026 being held in Seattle. FIFA just released merchandise for its upcoming 2026 World Cup tournament, including hats, t-shirts, sweatshirts, and posters themed around each host city. The merchandise for Seattle, being one of the host cities, is predominantly purple in color, with gold, white, and blue accents. An alternative, less expensive T-shirt is available, along with cheaper gifts such as posters and magnets. Seattle is one of 16 cities hosting World Cup matches between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico starting in June 2026. Seattle is actively preparing to host six games, including two knockout stage matches. The Washington State Transportation Commission is considering two temporary toll hike options—either 50 cents or $1.00—applied 24/7 for six weeks from June 1 to July 15, 2026. At Tuesday's commission meeting, one member expressed reservations about the proposal, calling it a “slippery slope” to increase tolls for a single event. “The World Cup is a uniquely large event,” Washington State Transportation Commission Deputy Director Carl See told KIRO Newsradio. rates for two-axle vehicles currently range from $1.25 to $2.80. Officials said the temporary hike would represent a significant increase and acknowledged that residents and businesses would also be affected. See told KIRO Newsradio that, as early as December, the commission will decide whether or not to proceed with this potential toll rate increase based on the assessment that is currently underway. FIFA just released Seattle-themed merchandise for its upcoming 2026 tournament, including hats, t-shirts, sweatshirts, and posters. Ticket prices for Mariners vs. Blue Jays Game 5 have plummeted, offering fans a chance to experience the ALCS at a lower cost.

Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell took the opportunity to cement Humpy's legacy by calling Oct. 16 "Humpy Day" from here on out. KIRO Newsradio, Seattle Red, and MyNorthwest weighed in on the debate. In a touching moment, Greta Niehaus honors her father after the Mariners' thrilling 15-inning win. Tyson O'Neill, owner of Generator Supercenter of Puget Sound in Lynnwood, said homeowners must stop treating backup power like a luxury.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Mike Trucano in Virginia heard the men's World Cup soccer tournament would be back in the U.S. next year, he and his family were thrilled. "We were just so excited that it was coming," Trucano says. He's been to every World Cup since 1994, when the U.S. last hosted the tournament, a stretch of eight tournaments that has taken him all over the world — from South Korea to South Africa. He's seen some awesome games and goals. So Trucano planned to take his wife, two kids and his 80-year-old dad to next year's World Cup, hosted by the U.S., along with Canada and Mexico. That's before Trucano saw the prices FIFA would be charging for this World Cup. Most seats in the opening round of the tournament will cost at least several hundred dollars, with a tiny section of the stadiums available at $60. That's significantly higher than at the last World Cup in Qatar when prices at the same stage of the tournament ranged from about $11 to just over $200. Games for the U.S. men's national team are even more expensive. "I mean, my word, if it's five of us and it's $1,000 ... and $5,000 in this economy?" "In a great economy that's a no-go, let alone the economy we have right now." First, it has introduced a type of dynamic pricing, meaning prices will adjust based on demand. Another unusual thing: FIFA is offering what's called a right to buy a ticket that offers buyers a guaranteed ticket for the game of their choice. These "RTBs" cost hundreds — and even thousands of dollars. And that's before you buy the actual ticket. FIFA will determine that ticket price at a later stage. "To me this is madness," he says. He's been to seven World Cup tournaments so far and to six finals, including in Paris in 1998, when France beat Brazil and many of the fans were singing "La Marseillaise" as the home side clinched the trophy. But Waian says he refuses to pay the prices FIFA is charging next year. "It's much more than I would want to spend," Waian says. "There's other things I'd rather buy for that money that would last more than two hours." "Ticketing and resale fees align with industry trends across various sports and entertainment sectors," FIFA says. But Waian still doesn't understand why growing the sport means that ticket prices next year have to jump so much. "Everything they've done so far seems to be just concerned about maximizing profit and nothing, absolutely nothing, else," Waian says. Trucano in Virginia is also unsure what to do. Will he have to choose between his wife, dad and children. "I have to think really hard about taking my family and who, you know, who do we cut out and who do we don't?" FIFA will be selling tickets in stages all the way until next year's tournament. In the meantime though, he's angry and disappointed. "I think they see us as consumers," Trucano says. Big fat wallets that they can take as much money out of as they can. I don't think that does anybody any good." Fans like Trucano and Waian got to travel all over the world to see World Cup games. Turns out the one that's being held in their own country — in the U.S. — may be the one they have to watch on TV from their homes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mjallby supporters pictured during an Allsvenskan match against Djurgarden Michael Campanella/Getty Images It's a case of when, rather than if, they will become the most unlikely champions of a European league since Leicester City in 2015-16. At that point, Mjallby were in the third division. Scandinavia has thrown up a series of rags-to-riches stories in recent years. In a league that prides itself on its fan-owned '51 per cent model' and has produced more title winners (eight) than any other European league in the first decade of this century, Malmo had threatened to turn Sweden's Allsvenskan into another predictable top flight, winning eight of the last 12 titles. Mjallby's imminent success serves as the perfect antidote, partly because they are operating on a budget estimated to be around 15 per cent of Malmo's. And this is a miracle in two different ways. Their coach, 59-year-old Anders Torstensson, has dipped in and out of professional football over the past 20 years and is now in his third spell at the club. A now-familiar emphasis on data-based recruitment has led them to make excellent signings from afar, such as Gambian attacker Abdoulie Manneh, and a realism about their status has resulted in them happily selling their best youngsters for considerable fees, reinvesting that in the squad. But second, it's remarkable that Mjallby are top considering their underlying numbers. Malmo and Hacken, who account for the last five Swedish titles between them, have better xG numbers yet sit seventh and ninth in the table. This is a historic overperformance, as the graph below demonstrates. In fact, their xG numbers are very similar to those of Vasteras last season, who were relegated, leaving coach Kalle Karlsson ruing “sitters, open goals, crazy stuff”. First, it's worth working out at which end Mjallby are overperforming. In attack, they're about 6.6 goals ‘up' on what you would expect from the positions of their shots; a decent overachievement, but nothing particularly startling. If you'd only watched Mjallby in recent weeks, you'd suspect they were overwhelmingly reliant on set pieces, as six of their last nine goals have been from this route, and another was a penalty. But this has been a relatively recent trend, since opponents have increasingly realised their quality and sat deep. After scoring from a set piece on the opening day, they subsequently had a run of 30 goals when none were from set pieces. Mjallby play genuinely good football, usually in a 3-2-4-1 shape: a box midfield who play quick combinations, and two wide players who storm up and down, always arriving at the far post at the right time. Left-sided Elliot Stroud has thumped in goals from all sorts of angles, bringing to mind Alex Grimaldo's contributions to an unlikely title-winning campaign at Bayer Leverkusen. As well as creating a string of chances fired home from point-blank range, often from cutbacks, Mjallby have been particularly efficient at forcing high turnovers, then striking when the opposition defence is out of position. In that respect, they've allowed 35 goals' worth of chances, but only actually conceded 17; just under half of what you would expect. Single-game xG numbers should be used cautiously, but in each of their last 17 league games, Mjallby have conceded fewer goals than their xG numbers would suggest. Part of this, undeniably, is about wayward opposition finishing, but there are two other notable things. Mjallby are very compact without possession, particularly when defending deep. When attacks break down, Mjallby get their midfield line back into position incredibly quickly. It's rare to see the opposition attempting a shot when under severe pressure from multiple players. Noel Tornqvist, 23, is 6ft 6in (198cm) and notable for his Petr Cech-style protective headgear. In particular, he's decisive in one-against-one situations, sprinting out of his goal to close down the shooter incredibly quickly, smothering shots quickly, such as this one against IFK Goteborg. He's recently received a call-up to Sweden's senior side after their long-serving No 1 Robin Olsen stood down. It's no surprise that a bigger club has already snapped up Tornqvist: Cesc Fabregas' Como, who bought him in August but loaned him back to Mjallby. He will move to Italy once the title celebrations are over. It's also worth pointing out that ‘game state' comes into play. It helps that Mjallby have scored first in 21 of their 26 matches — the opposition have regularly been chasing the game, pushing men forward and trying to score against a packed Mjallby defence, while leaving their defence understaffed. “It's also a team that has got an exceptional amount out of what they've created. If you look at the underlying numbers, they've been overperforming quite a lot.” If Hellberg's side don't win a Stockholm derby against AIK on Sunday, the title will be heading to the village of Hallevik, regardless of Mjallby's final four results. But there's still an incentive for them to keep on winning: five more points will bring the highest points total in Allsvenskan history.</p>
