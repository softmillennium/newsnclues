State Senator Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, told Politico, ‚ÄúI'm grateful that Marc walked back his call for the National Guard to be deployed in San Francisco.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Mike McSherry set out to build a digital health startup, the veteran entrepreneur wanted to create a company that would become ubiquitous in healthcare. But its digital health software platform did gain traction ‚Äî and drew the attention of a global tech giant. The deal, reported by Modern Healthcare at about $115 million, signals Samsung's deeper push into digital health as it competes against Apple, Amazon, Google, and others. It's also a major milestone for Xealth, which helps healthcare providers prescribe and manage digital health tools. Samsung wants to triple the team's headcount, said McSherry, who previously co-founded Swype, the predictive-text keyboard acquired by Nuance for $100 million in 2011. Since launching eight years ago, Xealth expanded to services like transportation and meal delivery. McSherry said U.S. healthcare remains stuck in economics where hospitals are reimbursed for treatment, not prevention. He pointed to the lack of reimbursement for digital mental health apps despite widespread employer adoption. That economic misalignment can slow the adoption of digital tools in healthcare, even as AI and connected devices make it easier to monitor health outside the clinic. ‚ÄúWhat might be good for a patient is not necessarily good for the hospital finances or the insurance company finances,‚Äù McSherry said. ‚ÄúUltimately, that's going to be a doctor in your pocket, or a doctor on your wrist or ring,‚Äù he said. Those devices ‚Äî along with advances in AI ‚Äî will help intervene and notify consumers that they should schedule a doctor's appointment or take a certain action, McSherry said. Samsung has been seeking FDA approvals for health monitoring features such as AFib and sleep-apnea detection. McSherry, who will remain CEO at Xealth, said his team will help build out Samsung's health app store, curating digital-health solutions for consumers. For startup founders in digital health, McSherry advised to understand who their real buyer is ‚Äî and what motivates them. What are their economic incentives and motivations for buying that? And what are the repercussions to the other players that sit alongside them that may or may not play a role in reimbursement strategies or deployment strategies,‚Äù he said. McSherry co-founded Xealth with Aaron Sheedy, his former colleague at Swype, which also raised investment from Samsung. AWS re:Invent connects you with global leaders, builders, and innovators.

The Anker Prime 250W charging station is hitting an all-time low of $99 on Amazon, down from $169, but here's the catch: this is a flash sale and only 40 percent of the available stock remains. The 250W total output is distributed across six ports: four USB-C and two USB-A. This configuration handles modern devices while accommodating older accessories that still use traditional USB. The first USB-C port delivers a massive 140W on its own which is enough to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent in just 25 minutes. That kind of speed matters when you're racing against a deadline or need to top up quickly before heading out. The remaining ports intelligently share the remaining power based on what's connected, so you can charge your laptop, phone wireless earbuds, smartwatch and portable battery simultaneously. The GaN Prime tech is what enables this to be delivered in an ultra-compact form factor: Gallium Nitride components produce less heat and waste less power than standard silicon chargers and this enables Anker to put extreme power inside a desktop unit that won't take over the entire workspace. GaN chargers also stay efficient under prolonged load, and keeps the charger cool whether you're using all six ports at full capacity for hours on end. The 2.26-inch LCD display turns charging from guessing game to accurate monitoring: Real-time wattage is displayed on the screen for each device you plug in, allowing you to see exactly how much power is being delivered to your laptop compared to your phone. This information tells you what's being properly charged at optimal speeds and what could be moved to another port to yield improved results. The smart control dial adds another layer of customization: Instead of accepting whatever power distribution the charger automatically assigns, you can manually adjust output to prioritize specific devices. Need your laptop charged faster for an urgent meeting? This level of control is rare in multi-port chargers, where most models simply distribute power automatically without user input. USB-A accommodates wireless earbuds cases, older accessories, and devices that haven't made the transition yet. The combination means this charger remains relevant even as your device ecosystem evolves.</p>

Nvidia and TSMC on Friday announced they had reached a significant milestone with the manufacturing of the first production Blackwell wafer at Fab 21 near Phoenix, Arizona. "This is a historic moment for several reasons," said Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, at the commemorative event. Production of Nvidia Blackwell B300 silicon (we presume these are the B300 chiplets, though as it is unconfirmed) in the U.S.‚Äî one of the most complex chip ever created ‚Äî using TSMC's 4N fabrication process (a custom 4nm-class node for Nvidia) means that TSMC's Fab 21 is capable of making such large chips presumably with good yields (which apparently took some time to achieve), which may indicate that the fab is indeed as capable as ones that TSMC runs in Taiwan (something that we have already heard from TSMC's own comments, but those were made about smaller chips). Strategically, it fulfills a key goal of the U.S. government's industrial policy: bringing more advanced semiconductor manufacturing to American soil. Therefore, Nvidia can now claim that it produces one of its most essential products in the U.S. and avoid tariffs if they are imposed on Taiwan-made goods. The same applies to TSMC as it spreads its production across the world, reducing risks for its business from potential interruptions caused by China. Eventually, TSMC is set to build Fab 21 phases that will produce chips on N3, N2, A16, and A14 process technologies in Arizona. For decades, Nvidia ‚Äî the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $4.5 trillion ‚Äî has produced its chips exclusively in Taiwan with a brief production of the NV40 silicon at IBM's microelectronics fab in New York. Producing its key AI GPUs in the U.S. has a deep symbolic meaning for Nvidia, which is an American company. To some degree, this even gives Washington political leverage when negotiating with partners. While Nvidia's Blackwell silicon is now built in the USA, to make an actual Nvidia B300 out of them, they must be transported back to Taiwan and then integrated using CoWoS-L advanced packaging technologies with HBM3E memory at a TSMC facility. This not only makes these chips more expensive than those produced in Taiwan, but to a large degree, this strikes strategic and political advantages, leaving only the symbolic part. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Still, this strategic dependence on advanced packaging in Taiwan is not going to last long. Also, Micron and SK hynix are building DRAM production (Micron only) and HBM packaging facilities in the U.S., which will mark another significant step towards onshoring of production of strategically important components.

Microsoft ended official support for Windows 10 last week, which means an entirely new population has been forced to move to Windows 11, or be left behind. According to IT Media, shops in Tokyo's bustling Akihabara area are suddenly experiencing a meteoric rise in Windows 11 demand, alongside one other oddity ‚Äî optical drives. People upgrading to the new operating system want to likely keep their physical media collection accessible, which has made disc drives a commodity. Unfortunately, they're out of stock pretty much anywhere, especially if you're looking for an internal Blu-ray drive (BD-R), which are a tier above the standard DVD-R options... but even those are scarce. "Many people may prioritize writing speed and want an internal drive. With external drives, there's inevitably a limit to how fast they can be," says Dospara Akihabara Main Shop, a popular computer parts vendor in the region. Another retailer explained how internal disc drives are largely overlooked now since most modern PC cases don't have slots for proper optical drives. In pursuit of cleaner aesthetics and SSDs becoming mainstream, it doesn't make sense to account for the heat dissipation of an internal drive, especially with power-hungry GPUs. Still, the demand to carry over physical media support, especially in the age of perpetual licensing, seems to be more alive than ever.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move will likely affect WhatsApp-based assistants of companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Khosla Ventures-backed Luzia, and General Catalyst-backed Poke. The company has added a new section to address ‚ÄúAI providers‚Äù in its business API terms, focusing on general-purpose chatbots. The terms, which will go into effect on January 15, 2026, say that Meta won't allow AI model providers to distribute their AI assistants on WhatsApp. Providers and developers of artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies, including but not limited to large language models, generative artificial intelligence platforms, general-purpose artificial intelligence assistants, or similar technologies as determined by Meta in its sole discretion (‚ÄúAI Providers‚Äù), are strictly prohibited from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether directly or indirectly, for the purposes of providing, delivering, offering, selling, or otherwise making available such technologies when such technologies are the primary (rather than incidental or ancillary) functionality being made available for use, as determined by Meta in its sole discretion. Meta confirmed this move to TechCrunch and specified that this move doesn't affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. Meta's rationale behind this move is that WhatsApp Business API is designed for businesses serving customers rather than acting as a platform for chatbot distribution. The company said that while it built the API for business-to-business use cases, in recent months, it saw an unanticipated use case of serving general-purpose chatbots. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,‚Äù a Meta spokesperson said in a comment to TechCrunch. Meta said that the new chatbot use cases placed a lot of burden on its system with increased message volume and required a different kind of support, which the company wasn't ready for. The move will effectively make WhatsApp unavailable as a platform to distribute AI solutions like assistants or agents. Last year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT on WhatsApp, and earlier this year, Perplexity launched its own bot on the chat app to tap into the user base of more than 3 billion people. It charges businesses based on different message templates like marketing, utility, authentication, and support. During Meta's Q1 2025 earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg pointed out that business messaging is a big opportunity for the company to bring in revenue. ‚ÄúRight now, the vast majority of our business is advertising in feeds on Facebook and Instagram,‚Äù he said. Messenger is also used by more than a billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger.

Fascinatingly, while there was some damage to the camera's housing and internal components, tech and science enthusiast Scott Manley reveals that the internal SD card was ‚Äúundamaged.‚Äù Contents of the memory card have since been investigated, and 12 stills and nine videos have been recovered. The titanium and synthetic sapphire crystal constructed device features both onboard and expansion memory (the titular SD card). In some images of the PCB that are shared, you will notice details are blurred at the request of the Canada-based underwater imaging specialist and Rayfin Mk2 Benthic Camera manufacturer. However, SubC's requested trade secret obfuscation hasn't stopped internet sleuths asserting that they know exactly what components have been redacted. Picking through Manley's Tweet thread replies, the key PCBs in the camera were likely an Inforce 6601 System on Module (SoM) based on the Qualcomm SD820 processor, which comes with 4GB of RAM on board and 64GB of UFS storage. Another component is thought to be the Teensy 4.0 or 3.2, which acted as an MCU. With an undamaged SD card, of course, investigators (and others) were interested in what details of the tragedy may have been captured and stored by this camera system.

Check out Manley's Tweet thread, containing investigator report screengrabs, to take in the full gamut of back and forth between the data forensics investigator, Canada's Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), and SubC. To cut a long technical story short, though, the parties eventually met up at a lab/office in Newfoundland, where a recovered NVRAM chip and SD card image were interfaced with a ‚Äúsurrogate SoM board.‚Äù This did the trick, and 12 still and nine videos were recovered! Recovered images were at a resolution of 4,056 x 3,040 pixels, implying a pretty common 12.3MP sensor was used by the SubC Rayfin Mk2 Benthic Camera. Videos were at a more standard 3,840 x 2,160 pixels ‚Äì commonly referred to as 4K Ultra HD (UHD) video. No deep-sea shenanigans around the Titanic wreck were revealed. Manley explains in his Twitter thread that ‚Äúthe camera had been configured to dump data onto an external storage device, so nothing was found from the accident dive.‚Äù Nothing particularly pertinent to the tragic accident, that is.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‚ÄúBy getting to grips with thermodynamics at this unintuitive level, we can design better engines in the future and experiments which challenge our understanding of nature,‚Äù Molly Message, study lead author and a PhD student at King's College London (KCL) in the United Kingdom, said in a statement. In the engine, electrodes trap and levitate the microparticle in a near-vacuum setup called a Paul trap. Other times, the engine randomly cooled down when subjected to conditions that should have made it hotter. ‚ÄúWe can see all these odd thermodynamic behaviors, which are totally intuitive if you're a bacterium or a protein, but just unintuitive if you're a big lump of meat like us,‚Äù explained James Millen, study senior author and a physicist at KCL, to New Scientist. Due to the engine's small size, it probably won't end up in cars or household appliances, at least not any time soon. Instead, the researchers envision more theoretical applications for their small powerhouse. For instance, the trap is ideal for simulating other microscopic phenomena, such as how proteins fold inside our body, driving various metabolic processes. ‚ÄúProteins fold over milliseconds, but the atoms [that] make them move over nanoseconds,‚Äù explained Jonathan Pritchett, study co-author and a postdoctoral researcher at KCL, in the statement. ‚ÄúThese divergent timescales make it very difficult for a computer to model them. By just observing how the microparticle moves and working out a series of equations based on that, we avoid this problem entirely.‚Äù That's just one example of many, the researchers added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>T-Mobile has turned the wireless industry on its head with an offer that sounds too good to be true: free iPhone 17 devices for practically anyone who walks through their doors. Whether you're a loyal customer or someone fed up with your current carrier's inflated prices, T-Mobile is handing out Apple's latest flagship phones at zero cost. And if you're bringing the entire family along, T-Mobile will give you up to four lines of unlimited service for just one hundred dollars per month, with each line qualifying for its own complimentary iPhone 17. This isn't a limited-time offer gimmick meant only to pull in a few customers before reverting back to stealth mode: T-Mobile's got the infrastructure and faith backing such aggressive promotions because they run the fastest network in America, according to Ookla's Speedtest Intelligence data. Their first quarter 2025 readings revealed T-Mobile's decisive lead over the competition in speed and total performance. The company's been methodically growing its coverage area with 5G and adds towers and bandwidth that yield concrete improvements you can expect the moment you begin to use your brand-new device. T-Mobile's ambitions extend beyond traditional cellular coverage with their T-Satellite service, which leverages orbital technology to reach locations other providers simply cannot access. This innovation ensures strong signals even in remote areas where competitors' networks fade into uselessness. The economic benefits add up quickly for switchers: T-Mobile claims existing customers from competing networks can save up to twenty percent each month with a switch to an Experience plan. Those plans include in-flight Wi-Fi and Magenta Status benefits among others, but the large benefit remains in that no-cost iPhone 17 in the palm of your hand with your monthly fees lowered.</p>

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. The only problem is one you probably figured out already: They just weren't very effective as hearing aids, providing a blunt amplification of every sound, whether you wanted to hear it or not‚Äîunderpinned with a steady layer of hiss. Audien has repeatedly tried again in this low-end part of the market, cranking out at least five models of low-cost hearing aids. While they have gently ratcheted up the price, most cost under $300. Its latest release is the Atom X, another spin on the same in-the-ear design but with some fancy new features and a $389 price, inching ever upward. The hearing aids themselves aren't exactly striking: Earplug-like and beige, with a weight of 2.20 grams each, the simple devices each have a fat button on the outward-facing surface. These buttons control everything from volume (independently in each ear) and streaming media to hands-free calling, depending on whether they are connected via Bluetooth and how long the button is pressed. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The oblong design looks a bit odd at first, but it turns out they are fairly comfortable for longer listening sessions and reasonably discreet, only barely visible when in place in the ear. Three sets of differently sized ear tips in two different shapes, both unvented, are included in the box. The secret sauce is a touchscreen on the front, letting you easily tap to control volume, environmental mode, and toggle Bluetooth on and off. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Yet another mode kicks in when you are interacting with a phone call. Audien says you can expect 20 hours from the aids (without streaming) on a full charge and 28 additional hours of charge from the case before it needs to be topped up via a USB-C connection. Those estimates were reasonably accurate in my testing. I really enjoyed having all of this power at the ready without having to use an app, which is especially handy because Audien doesn't have an app. Streaming functions largely work like they would on a standard set of Bluetooth earbuds, and all hearing aid settings have to be managed through the case. That lack of control has long been the problem with Audien's products, which are blunt amplifiers that can't be tuned outside of changing the volume and picking one of the four environmental modes. There is no hearing test function and no way to shape the frequencies where you need the most help, which means everything gets lifted, more or less. For users accustomed to more refined control, it's a jarring experience, though Audien suggests that over time ‚Äúyour brain will adjust‚Äù to the overload of background sounds and your own booming voice. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I immediately noticed that there was a much lower level of hiss on the Atom X than on previous Audien hearing aids, but the overall experience still wasn't all that effective. Anything beyond that threatened to get painful. At $389, the Atom X is a tough sell compared to the $249 Apple AirPods Pro 3, which have a tuning system, app control, outstanding noise cancellation, and overall better-quality hearing support. Yes, they are much larger and more visible than the Atom X aids, but if you never actually wear your hearing aids because they don't provide a great experience, how much does discretion even matter?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Honor, a Chinese phone brand that primarily sells its devices in Europe and Asia, announced a new smartphone in its Magic series this week, dubbed the Magic8. It also has a positively massive 7,200-mAh silicon-carbon battery cell, but it's actually a very different Honor phone that steals the limelight from the Magic8. This is a concept, but Honor says it plans to reveal more details about it at Mobile World Congress 2026 in Barcelona next March. Based on the accompanying launch video‚Äîwhich appears to have been largely created using generative AI‚Äîthe Robot Phone features a camera module that flips out, functioning like a pan-and-tilt camera on a gimbal. It doesn't just take photos of subjects, but also reacts to people, and even plays peekaboo with a (fake) baby. Honor's concept Robot Phone is much more advanced. But even more advanced are the purported capabilities of this little robot camera. Motorola is gearing up to launch an ultra-slim phone that is marginally thicker than the iPhone Air and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge at 5.99 millimeters. It's not just slim and lightweight; this phone also has a bigger battery (4,800 mAh) compared to its svelte peers, which should give it a leg up. However, it's not a flagship smartphone, powered by the decidedly midrange Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 4. It's the last wellness frontier‚Äîfiguring out what your pee and poo are telling you. In 2023, Withings unveiled the U-Scan, a toilet bowl sensor that sits inside your toilet bowl and detects basic biomarkers via a replaceable cartridge. This week, renowned toilet bowl manufacturer Kohler announced the launch of Kohler Health, a foray into the digital health and wellness space with a similarly white, smooth device called the Dekoda. You clamp the device on the rim of your toilet bowl and log into every, er, session with a fingerprint scanner. Spectroscopy sensors (i.e., cameras) peer down at whatever you put in there to record signs of gut health, hydration, and blood. Your personalized results are sent to the Kohler Health app (which is on both iOS and Android). Unlike a wrist-worn fitness tracker, the Dekoda does seem to assume that you will mostly be doing your business at home. At least it doesn't need a subscription. It retails for $599 and will be available starting October 21. When it comes to software, functionality, and premium materials, there's just no competing with Garmin in the sports watch department. This week, Coros launched the Apex 4 ($479), its latest mountain watch. However, it's worth noting here that even though it has a speaker and a microphone for hands-free calls with LTE connection, it does not have what I suspect will shortly become a standard feature on many outdoor sports watches‚Äîsatellite communications, which showed up on the Google Pixel Watch 4, the Apple Watch Ultra 3, and the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro this year. Not a deal-breaker, but something worth thinking about. That's why Australian luggage manufacturer July launched CaseSafe, a built-in tracker on top of its suitcase that works with both Apple's Find My and Android's Find Hub networks. I am planning on using the carry-on version this weekend, and it easily paired with my iPhone. In every other respect, it's a normal bag‚Äîit has your standard polycarbonate shell with a (I have to say) garish embossed July logo on the side; smooth-rolling wheels, bumpers, and leather finishes. July's CaseSafe makes it so you don't have to fuss with AirTags, but that still doesn't stop me from saying you can upgrade your current carry-on similarly with an AirTag and a power bank, and it won't cost you anywhere near $300. The LiPlay+ is, like its predecessor, a hybrid camera and Instax printer. In fact, little about the main camera seems to have changed. It still has a 28-mm equivalent f/2 lens that records roughly 5-MP photos to the sensor. Here's more you may have missed this week: Fujifilm has added a second camera on the back, though, for taking selfies. Alas, there does not seem to be a way to make this an actual double-exposure image, which feels like a missed opportunity (especially since Fujifilm's other cameras, like the X100 series, have long had a double-exposure mode). The other new feature here expands on the original LiPlay's ability to record audio and attach it to a print via a QR code. Now it's not just audio but an animated video with sound and music. The Fujifilm Instax Mini LiPlay+ will be available later this month for $235. The security-focused, Android alternative operating system GrapheneOS has announced it will soon be available on phones other than the Google Pixel. The developers said in a post on Reddit that a "major OEM" will soon be added to GrapheneOS's list of supported phones. No brands were mentioned, but many users are guessing it will be OnePlus, given the company's past support for CyanogenMod, another Android alternative. They also explicitly say it is not Fairphone, which sells a separate version running another Android alternative, e/OS. Roku has announced some nifty software upgrades coming soon to its popular streaming devices and TVs, and they lean heavily on artificial intelligence. Roku Voice now features AI searches, allowing you to ask things like ‚ÄúWhat's Barbie about?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow scary is The Shining?‚Äù and get a helpful answer. You can also set up reminders for upcoming games, whereby you'll be notified to watch via the Roku app on your phone. In addition, Bluetooth Headphone Mode is coming to Roku Streaming Stick models, allowing folks to pair headphones for late-night viewing. The range was introduced back in 2013, but these all-new 2025 Dark and Grey Side of the Moon models each measure 44.25 millimeters and boast ceramic cases.
