                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Across the world, more than 1.5 billion people suffer from chronic liver disease. Despite this significant impact on society, alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) remains largely unaddressed by medical research. Liver diseases are rapidly increasing around the world, and there's a significant risk of them slowly progressing to more dangerous conditions like cancer. Being able to use our technologies to develop effective solutions against this progression is what's driving me and driving this research." Dr. Jyothi Menon, Associate Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Texas A&M University While current treatments for ARLD focus on alcohol cessation and anti-inflammatory medications, Menon and her collaborators at the University of Rhode Island are taking a much more focused approach. In healthy humans, the liver is a naturally self-healing organ, capable of regenerating most of its function even when 70% to 80% has been damaged. A key part of this healing process involves immune cells called Kupffer cells that protect the liver from infection and harmful substances. The Kupffer cells, which previously fought inflammation, start releasing protein signals with the opposite effect - increasing inflammation and encouraging other liver cells to form scar tissue in a process called fibrosis. The result is life-threatening organ dysfunction and even fatal liver cancer. The Menon Lab's nanoparticles are engineered to stop this damaging process. This protein functions as a receptor in the cell's membrane, receiving chemical signals and triggering cell behaviors in response. When it is activated by the nanoparticle's coating, it promotes beneficial, anti-inflammatory behavior in the Kupffer cells instead of increasing inflammation and scarring. The nanoparticles also release anti-inflammatory therapies as they break down, delivering medicine directly to the cells that need it most. "Instead of going for the cells which are producing the scar tissue, we're going one step behind and targeting the Kupffer cells themselves so that we can prevent them from stimulating other cells in the liver and causing this fibrosis progression," Menon said. "The individual components on their own did not have much of a therapeutic effect," Menon said. "But when we gave our final formulation with everything combined, it reduced inflammation and lipid droplet formation seen due to fat buildup in the liver. Getting to this point was no easy feat. Because Menon's team is one of the first to attempt this kind of approach, there was no prior research to lean on. "As one of the first groups to even approach something like this using nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, there wasn't any sort of prior literature to help us figure out what roadblocks there could be when we took up this research," Menon said. "The first time we were able to confirm that these particles can target Kupffer cells, it was very exciting for us." While Menon is currently focused on alcohol-related liver disease, her nanoparticle therapies have much broader applications. "What we have generated is very promising preliminary work that shows that this formulation can selectively target a specific cell population in the liver to deliver therapies and can potentially have a meaningful impact on the treatment of chronic ARLD," she said. "Our formulations are versatile, so they can be adapted or modified for treating other kinds of inflammation and fibrosis in other organs."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plastic is ubiquitous in the modern world, and it's notorious for taking a long time to completely break down in the environment - if it ever does. But even without breaking down completely, plastic can shed tiny particles - called nanoplastics because of their extremely small size - that scientists are just now starting to consider in long-term health studies. Xu's current work is focused on what happens when nanoplastics interact with seawater, where they can pick up some curious hitchhikers in the form of chemicals and organic components. When particles are released into the environment, they can interact with a lot of different materials that modify their surfaces, possibly including proteins, chemicals, and toxins. Most people are concerned with what happens when you accidentally ingest nanoplastics, but our work looks at how they might be getting into the body through the skin and what they might be bringing with them." As they demonstrated in a recent publication, Xu and his team have discovered that nanoplastics with environmental coatings can sneak past some of the skin's defenses at the microscopic level. "We found that particles with the environmental coating accumulated in certain areas inside the cell and seemed successful at avoiding its 'garbage disposal' system, which might try to kill or expel them," Xu said. "It's like they're wearing camouflage that allows them to stay inside the cell longer." "While the nanoplastics themselves are a health concern, we also want to better understand these environmental coatings and what those may do once inside the body," Xu said. To understand how nanoplastics affected by the environment enter the skin, Xu and his team created their own nanoplastic beads augmented by ocean water. "There are vendors that produce nanoplastic particles for scientific research, but these particles have never been out in the environment," Xu said. Then, they tested how the particles make their way inside cultured skin cells. "We had conducted previous research using plain nanoplastic beads that showed how they induce a reaction from skin cells," Xu said. Xu's research on the skin and environmental effects of particles is helping scientists understand that some of the trickiest problems in toxicology are even more complex than they had previously realized. "But what about those from algal blooms or other toxins? What happens when there are floods and water mixes with other contaminants? We haven't had the chance to explore how these things intersect yet." Even if researchers do find solutions to preventing absorption of nanoplastics with certain kinds of environmental coatings, there's no guarantee that those will continue to work. The first step, according to Xu, is for there to be better standardization for research on nanoplastic particles, which he hopes his research will help drive forward. "I've had students look at publications on the same particle and find different results because other researchers aren't required to consider environmental coatings," he said. Another step is to fully analyze all the coating types that Xu and his team found in their study of seawater. "We've already had people ask us about other types of coatings besides proteins," he said. "It will be a lot of work, but it's critical if we're to understand the full scope of the problem."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dominika Pilat, PhD, and Ana Griciuc, PhD, of the Department of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital are the lead and senior authors of a paper published in Neuron, "The Gain-of-Function TREM2-T96K Mutation Increases Risk for Alzheimer's Disease by Impairing Microglial Function." Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience? Our team wanted to understand how immune cells of the brain, called microglia, contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. It's known that subtle changes, or mutations, in genes expressed in microglia are associated with an increased risk for developing late-onset AD. Our study focused on one such mutation in the microglial gene TREM2, an essential switch that activates microglia to clean up toxic amyloid plaques (abnormal protein deposits) that build up between nerve cells in the brain. This mutation, called T96K, is a "gain-of-function" mutation in TREM2, meaning it increases TREM2 activation and allows the gene to remain super active. Through our research, we explored how this mutation impacts microglial function to increase risk for AD. We generated a mutant mouse model carrying the mutation, which was bred with a mouse model of AD to have brain changes consistent with AD. We found that in female AD mice exclusively, the mutation strongly reduced the capability of microglia to respond to toxic amyloid plaques, making these cells less protective against brain aging. Q: What methods or approach did you use? To analyze the role of this mutation in Alzheimer's disease, we combined studies of human genes, a novel TREM2-T96K mouse model, and lab tests on microglial cells. To examine the brain tissue, we used an optical imaging technique called confocal microscopy and protein tracking tools, including ELISA. Finally, we used single-cell RNA sequencing of microglia isolated from the mouse brain and bioinformatic analysis to map out exactly how the T96K mutation changes the microglia activity over time. Our study is the first to show that a gain-of-function mutation in TREM2 (not just a loss-of-function mutation) is associated with Alzheimer's disease risk, and that it impairs the uptake of toxic amyloid beta (Aβ). Our study on TREM2 gain-of-function mutations shifts our understanding of TREM2 function – not only from a genetic perspective, but also from a therapeutics perspective.These findings should help guide novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, based on targeting TREM2. Notably, our results also underscore the need for more studies addressing whether novel AD therapies aimed at enhancing TREM2 activity could have adverse, as opposed to beneficial, effects on AD pathogenesis. Future work will focus on investigating the role of TREM2 gain-of-function mutations in modulating immune functions, microglial lipid metabolism and cellular aging in human microglia-like cells and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. The gain-of-function TREM2-T96K mutation increases risk for Alzheimer's disease by impairing microglial function.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These craters could serve as good markers for immunotherapy success. This research provides insight into a key function of immune check-point blockade (ICB) cancer therapy that was previously unknown. However, what facilitates local tumor killing by the infiltrating CD8+ T cells has remained a mystery. Using a zebrafish model, researchers were able to monitor the infiltrating CD8+ T cells for up to 24 hours as they moved through the 3D architecture of endogenous melanoma tumors. Zebrafish provide the only tumor model where continuous live imaging over a 24 hour time period is feasible. We found that rather than patrolling the entire tumor surface, CD8+ T cells aggregated in pockets on the melanoma border, forming prolonged interactions with melanoma cells. Zon, first author Aya Ludin, and the team also discovered CRATERs in human melanoma samples. Moreover, they saw similar structures in human lung cancer, indicating that CRATERs are likely not limited to melanoma and may form in other solid tumors. To date, efficacy of therapeutic response to ICB therapy has been assessed mainly by estimating the degree of tumor necrosis and fibrosis. Indicators of CD8+ T cells infiltration has been associated with patient survival and treatment outcome, but direct evidence of effective immune cell-tumor cell interaction has been missing. "Pending thorough clinical verification and taken together with other measurements, CRATERs may serve to more accurately assess the efficacy of an ongoing treatment and improve treatment outcomes," said Zon. The research team is now planning a prospective clinical trial to test if CRATERs are the best marker of ICB success. CRATER tumor niches facilitate CD8+ T cell engagement and correspond with immunotherapy success.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review in Clinical Epigenetics synthesises growing evidence that paternal lifestyle and environmental exposures such as diet, obesity, smoking, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and stress alter sperm epigenetic marks (DNA methylation, histone retention, and small non-coding RNAs). These changes can influence sperm quality and fertilising ability, early embryo development, assisted reproduction outcomes, and long-term health risks in offspring. Paternal factors leave epigenetic "signatures" in sperm (DNA methylation, histone modifications, sncRNAs) that accompany the genome at fertilisation. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) (e.g., BPA, phthalates) can induce transgenerational DNA methylation changes, affecting fertility and disease risk. Stress in fathers before conception correlates with altered sperm miRNAs/piRNAs and methylation, with behavioural and metabolic effects detected across generations in animal models. ART implications: Male BMI, diet, and alcohol intake correlate with embryo quality and ICSI outcomes; epigenetic sperm profiles show promise as biomarkers to improve ART success. Clinical takeaway: Preconception interventions weight management, smoking cessation, balanced diet (including folate), physical activity, and reduced toxin exposure may help reverse adverse sperm epigenetic marks. While maternal epigenetics is well studied, this review highlights mounting evidence for paternal epigenetic influences, notes confounders (genetic background, fluctuating behaviours), and calls for longitudinal, controlled human studies using modern methylation and RNA-sequencing platforms. Incorporating epigenetic screening or lifestyle programmes into fertility care could enhance ART outcomes and reduce intergenerational disease risk. Large, longitudinal human cohorts to establish causality and dose-response. Standardised epigenome assays (e.g., MethylationEPIC, small-RNA profiling) in andrology/ART workflows. Trials testing preconception lifestyle interventions on sperm epigenetic readouts and clinical endpoints. Maintain healthy weight; prioritise balanced diet with adequate folate.
