                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apart from that, his life revolves around the ‘Four F's' - family, friends, football and food. A NASA scientist has offered perhaps the most sensible explanation as to why aliens have been ghosting us for all these years. No matter what camp you're in - either you think aliens are real or aliens are not real - it is mad how unfathomably big the universe is without having any visitors. While Ridley Scott and others may portray aliens as frightening, it's uncertain what the reality might be. Well, according to scientist Dr Robin Corbet, aliens are probably having these exact same thoughts about us. The astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center reckons extraterrestrial civilizations may not be as technologically advanced as we make them look in the movies. In his new research paper, 'A Less Terrifying Universe? This principle is also known as the 'Fermi paradox', where no species has 'achieved technology levels sufficient to accomplish large-scale astro-engineering or lack the desire to do so'. "In the mundane perspective, where other civilizations are not that much more advanced, a limit to exploration would arise," he said. Dr Corbet hypothesises that aliens' tech isn't much better than ours, and the idea of sending out 'swarms of interstellar robotic probes' just isn't possible. "The Fermi paradox may be explained if the galaxy contains a modest number of technological civilizations, with technology levels that, while more advanced than contemporary Earth, are nowhere near the 'super-science' levels that could result in readily detectable astro-engineering," Dr Corbet said in his paper. Dr Gordon Gallup, a biopsychologist at the University of Albany, said in a 2022 paper: "If there is intelligent life elsewhere, they may view humans as extremely dangerous. "We pose too great a risk, and they do not want to be discovered." You can just imagine the conversation: "Fancy a trip to Earth?"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A private company at a high-powered Army conference demonstrated a unique aircraft at the event — and allegedly took responsibility for setting off last year's drone and “UFO” pandemonium in New Jersey, a source told The Post. At the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August, a private contractor conducted a live demonstration of a manned aerial craft that wowed the crowd with its unconventional appearance and unorthodox flight-movements, an attendee told The Post. “You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? “When it turned you almost completely lose sight of it,” the source said, of the roughly 30-minute demonstration in the controlled airspace of Fort Rucker. “Which is why I think people were seeing this up in the sky and why there were reports of people seeing it and saying it disappeared.” All conference attendees were approved by brass at Fort Rucker, which enacted strict rules for participation, including the exclusion of any drone or craft containing any Chinese-made parts, the source revealed. “It would definitely have to be cleared,” they said, adding, “Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that.” Fort Rucker, which is the headquarters for the Army's Aviation Branch, could not be reached for comment. The rash of supposed drone sightings in New Jersey began on Nov. 13, 2024 over Army base Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and continued across the state through early December. President Trump's Federal Aviation Administration announced in January that many of the reports of mystery drones were hobbyists, recreational pilots, and private individuals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>© 2025 Cybernews – Latest Cybersecurity and Tech News, Research & Analysis. A cannonade of comments, though, may not be the worst thing, as when a UFO sighting gains online traction, it moves to the top of social media and gets more attention. And as for the sharer, the focus needn't be on whether they believe you or not, but how to capitalize on their content, like other influencers and social media figures. We sounded out Barna Donovan, a professor of communications and media culture at Saint Peter's University in New Jersey, to get his two cents on the topic. “Along with the appetite for stories of possible alien contact comes a wariness over online hoaxes and misinformation,” he said. For the mainstream news consumer, UFO stories remain a weird niche and would have to be aired on primetime by the big players to warrant their attention. Those trying to decide which claims of alien content are believable will tend to take stories more seriously if they are also given attention by mainstream media outlets. A UFO story featured on CNN or Fox or any of the broadcast networks will carry more weight with viewers. For more vertical discussions into sightings, coverups, and whistleblower accounts, there's a whole treasure trove of content available. “The usual format of each show begins with an overview of an alleged paranormal phenomenon, but then midway through the show, Gentile adds his signature line, ‘But is any of this true? When whistleblowers themselves feel a sense of disclosure fatigue, it can be down to channels like The Why Files or Jeremy Corbell's Weaponized podcast. These podcasts have featured prominent whistleblowers like David Grusch and Matthew Brown, whose immaculate constellation document revealed the Pentagon's secret UFO program. On The Proof Is Out There, for example, UFOs are a cornerstone topic alongside other paranormal ones. Popular episodes include jellyfish UFO sightings and spaceships almost colliding with planes at airports. The show has also pointed out hoaxes, too, by using scientists and special effects experts. The strategy seems to be to straddle science-heavy explainers and mystical ingredients so curiosity can be satisfied, especially when those in office aren't giving the game away. Credibility can be lost, and trust bottoms out with the circulation of fake content, as was the case in 2023 with Reddit's beloved r/UFO subreddit. VFX artists created two elaborate videos, later named “the Reddit UFO” and “Tesla UFO,” with the latter so meticulous that it had many fooled. Still, the belief economy endures, and witness recognition seems poised for a bigger breakout. “The truth about aliens is still out there,” Donovan says, “and the work of fraudsters or sloppy journalists won't deter true believers.” Most often, it isn't what you say, but how you say it. Even artificial intelligence (AI) may not be able to take over “bullshit jobs.” Instead, it can perform meaningless tasks more efficiently. © 2025 Cybernews – Latest Cybersecurity and Tech News, Research & Analysis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Have you ever thought about who the internet is? It is very interesting to learn about such conspiracy theories, which often revolve on Reddit. Verma laid out the case like a tech manifesto: Google owns 14% of Anthropic, 8% of SpaceX, runs AI platforms like Gemini, powers Claude with its own TPU chips, dominates search with 90% of global queries, and runs YouTube. Oh, and it also controls Android, manages ads, email, cloud, and browsers, while quietly mapping the world via Google Maps. Cue the Redditors with a sense of perspective and humour. One commenter pointed out that TATA Communications runs one of the largest fibre optic networks in the world, carrying perhaps a quarter of global internet traffic. The comment garnered laughs, but it also pinpoints an important truth: what we see online may not be the whole story. But the physical backbone—the cables, servers, and networks that make our instant access possible, is a far less glamorous world, run by telecoms, data centres, and undersea fibre. It is a classic case of perception vs. reality. For most of us, Google feels like the internet. We search, stream, navigate, and communicate through its ecosystem. But take a step back, and the internet is a sprawling, distributed beast, powered by countless invisible hands and yes, even companies you have probably never heard of. It is a reminder of how deeply intertwined our digital lives are with a few dominant players and how much of the magic behind the scenes may go unnoticed. While both claims are unverified, these Reddit theories could lay the foundation for strong possibilities. Catch all the  Technology News and Updates on Live Mint.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the latest episode of Candace, Owens alleged there's new evidence that raises questions as to what truly transpired on the day Kirk was murdered. "We were told that Charlie had healthy bones, and it was a miracle that his spine stopped a bullet," she claimed. Owens went on to discuss media reports claiming Kirk had briefly survived due to his strength and bone density, disputing those assertions. She also insisted investigators had gotten key facts about the case wrong, putting doubt on the type of weapon that was allegedly used to murder Kirk. "The idea that it was a .30-06 just didn't happen," she claimed, regarding the rifle police claimed Tyler Robinson used to shoot Kirk. "That means he was shot with a completely different kind of gun," she alleged. Owens also discussed witness statements and official records she feels leave gaps in the investigation. "It looks likely there were two people with weapons that day, someone in the audience and someone positioned elsewhere," she claimed. "And one of the supposed witnesses worked in local law enforcement. Owens then turned her topic to the FBI and her issues with how they've handled the investigation surrounding Kirk's death. "They look at us as if we're nothing and say, 'What are you going to do about it?'" "You wanted to traumatize us and then look us in the face and go, 'How dare you ask questions?' Yeah, we're grieving because you assassinated Charlie Kirk in front of the entire world." Next, Owens addressed what she feels are contradictions in the medical paperwork regarding Kirk's death. They didn't recover a .30-06 round, that's simply not reflected on the death certificate," she claimed. After one of her latest theories involving an Egyptian plane, an X user shared the following: "She's obviously not all there, but all of this is also malicious and calculated." "No single person has made more money profiting off Charlie Kirk's death than Candace Owens. Another X user accused the controversial conservative commentator of grifting, writing, "She's grifting hard to pay for her legal defense in the Macron case. They are seeking punitive damages, and there is a good chance she'll lose. Owens is currently the throes of a lawsuit brought on by Brigitte and Emmanuel Macron after her insistence that Brigitte was born a man and transitioned to a woman.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ace Frehley was told he'd live to be 100 years old in the months before his death at age 74. My dad lived to be 96 and my mom lived to be 86, but her older sister lived to be 99,” the founding KISS member and guitarist told the Aquarian in March 2025. “I mean, we have longevity in the family on both sides.” He added, “‘I just spoke to a psychic. Frehley divulged during the interview that a previous injury had presented challenges to his musical career. The iconic guitarist died on Thursday, his family confirmed in a statement. In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth,” the statement read. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. The rocker's former bandmates from KISS, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, released a heartfelt joint statement following the news of Frehley's passing. “We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley,” they wrote. “He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history.” “He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy,” the statement continued. “Our thoughts are with [his estranged wife] Jeanette, [daughter] Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.” An official cause of death has not been disclosed. The glam metal rocker had reportedly been placed on life support in the hours leading up to his death. The outlet reported that though Frehley had been on a ventilator, his condition had not improved, leading family to consider taking him off life support. Frehley continued on with KISS for six additional years, until 2002.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From campus legends to congressional hearings, East Texas A&M's fascination with UFOs spans decades of wonder, debate and discovery. This feature is part of East Texas A&M's annual October Spooky Stories Series. Stay tuned for more eerie tales and campus curiosities throughout the month. “These flying saucer stories are getting bigger and better all the time,” proclaimed an article in the March 31, 1950, issue of East Texas A&M's student newspaper. Indeed, whether it's 1950 or 2025, or somewhere in between, students, faculty and the community have long been curious about mysteries hidden in the night sky. The university has hosted scientific experts, offered astronomy and chemistry courses that explore life beyond Earth, and provided a platform for speculation about what might be out there. Titled “Saucer Theories Include ‘The Impossible,'” the article theorized that perhaps Hollywood was to blame for flying saucers, or carefully thrown hubcaps, or “Texas mosquitos fitted with neon lights and radar screens,” or simply hallucinatory tricks of the mind. The article even mentioned a Texas farmer who claimed flying saucers sprayed his land with kerosene to help keep the bugs away. Conversations on campus reveal that modern students hold various opinions about what UFOs might be—from aliens and government projects to natural phenomena. It's not just students who have speculated about UFOs over the years at East Texas A&M. There have also been educational pursuits with links to UFOs and alien life. In this age of easy media, when documentaries and clickbait videos about UFOs are as common as hot days in a Texas summer, the experts can be hard to differentiate from the charlatans. Four of those reports come from Commerce, the most recent in 2013, when someone lounging by their swimming pool one night claimed to have seen two stars flying side by side across the sky. Here are some of the more prominent UFO cases in Texas: At East Texas A&M and beyond, people often see things in the sky they do not understand. Even today, there is regular testimony in front of Congress from former military personnel about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP)—the latest hot term in this field of study, which is meant to be a broader term that encompasses more than just objects in the sky. Dr. Curt Carlson, professor in the Department of Psychology and Special Education at ETAMU, who has conducted research into eyewitness memory for over 20 years, feels that unreliable memories may be to blame for some reports. “For example, if reporting a UFO sighting from many years ago, memory has become too contaminated since the original event to be trustworthy.” Taking into account more recent sightings, Carlson continued, “As for an eyewitness reporting a UFO sighting from just a day ago, false memory is not as significant an issue. But misperception of common objects as UFOs certainly is.” Quarles thinks there may be another explanation besides misidentification. “Sure, some of the sightings are probably misidentified natural phenomena,” he said. But I suspect much of it is secret military projects. Obviously, for something secret, the military can't just come out and say it's us.” If some, maybe even all, UFO sightings can be explained by misinterpretation, the fog of memory and secret government projects, does that mean aliens don't exist? “Microbes of some kind probably exist elsewhere in the universe,” Quarles said. The closest star outside of our Sun is four light-years away. The question of UFOs and aliens has been something people have wrestled with for many years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(NewsNation) — A documentary that says it reveals a long-standing government cover-up of UFOs will be released on Amazon Prime on Nov. 21. “The Age of Disclosure,” which originally premiered at the South by Southwest film festival, will also have a limited release in theaters in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., beginning on the same date. Directed by Dan Farah, the film includes interviews with current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community. Those featured in the film include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, retired Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet and former Pentagon employee Lue Elizondo. The documentary made a splash when it premiered, highlighting what it says is an 80-year cover-up by the government to conceal the existence of UFOs and extraterrestrial life and efforts to reverse-engineer alien technology. The film includes shocking moments, including former Defence Intelligence Agency officer Jay Stratton saying that he has seen nonhuman craft and nonhuman beings. UFOs have been a subject of fascination in recent years and a rare bipartisan issue for Congress, where an informal UAP Caucus has held hearings over the possibility of secret UFO programs. Farah worked on the film for three years in secret, interviewing what he says are high-level, credible sources on the subject. The Pentagon has repeatedly denied the existence of any secret UAP-retrieval programs and says there is no evidence that unexplained sightings are extraterrestrial in nature.
