                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI headshots are becoming popular on LinkedIn and in professional portfolios as job seekers look for affordable profile pictures to give them an edge. But professional photography has long been a financial barrier for many job applicants with an average starting cost for a professional headshot in the U.S. that can easily run up to hundreds of dollars. Now job seekers are using fast and inexpensive AI tools to replace costly studio sessions. "When I was at Yale, it was $200 for a 15-minute session for students," said Melanie Fan, head of growth at Plush, an AI-powered online search platform for personalized shopping. This frustration has fueled the explosion of AI headshot tools like InstaHeadshots, PhotoPacksAI, HeadshotPro and Aragon AI, services that promise a professional image in minutes starting at under $50. "After I changed my LinkedIn photo, the amount of inbound I've been getting from companies has skyrocketed," Fan said. "Three to four times more messages from companies." Design company Canva recently launched its own AI headshot feature, with the goal of offering users a quick way to create realistic headshots and still be able to retouch or restyle them. According to a recent Canva job market research report, 88% of job seekers believe a polished digital presence influences hiring decisions, which is up 45% from the year before. This is in line with the general uptick in use of AI as part of the application and hiring process, with 90% of hiring managers saying they have used AI to help with the hiring process, and 96% of job seekers who used AI in the application process saying they received callbacks. Danny Wu, Canva's head of AI products, said the goal wasn't to replace real photography, but to make high quality imagery attainable to everyone no matter the budget or location. Once a user uploads an image, Canva can use AI for adjusting or changing the background, placing something in a different place, and for styling. "This is just a more accessible way to get professional and unique headshots," Wu said. Anyone with a phone can get a LinkedIn-ready headshot, but the technology's rapid adoption has created new questions about ethics and trust. Many candidates fear looking fake or deceptive and recruiters are on the lookout for AI-generated portraits that look overly smooth or stylized, saying authenticity matters the most. "It is perceived as risky to use an AI headshot," said Sam DeMase, ZipRecruiter career expert. "A poorly done AI-generated headshot is easily recognized, reads as inauthentic, and can hurt the candidate's chances of being selected." However, recruiters are struggling to tell if a headshot is AI produced, and the technology will only get better. "It's becoming more and more difficult to tell whether a headshot has been enhanced or generated by AI," DeMase added. Chris Bora, founder and principal AI architect of Bora Labs and a former Meta engineer, said he built his own headshot generator, Nova Headshot, after being disappointed by existing options. "Some made me look taller and skinnier," Bora said. With Nova, it takes less than ten minutes," Bora said. Amber Collins, an AI headshot user, said she still feels uneasy about it, especially since not every app gets it right. "Seven fingers, half a necklace, and the rest of it is gone from your neck. "In this economy, you have to be mindful of where you're going to put your money. I don't need to have my face out there excessively, but having a couple of really good, solid, professional looking headshots is worth it to me," Collins said. Wu said the goal for job applicants seeking a headshot should be to use Canva's tool to balance realism and creativity without losing their identity. A LinkedIn spokesperson told CNBC what while the platform does allow the use of tools, including AI, to enhance or create profile photos, "the photo must reflect your likeness." "Profile photos that don't comply with our user agreement or professional community policies may be removed," the LinkedIn spokesperson said. DeMase noted that many job candidates remain hesitant to use an AI headshot. "A headshot is one of the few places you can inject humanity into the job search," he said. A recent survey found that headshot use among job seekers is the highest within the Gen Z and millennial generations. And while recruiters may say they still prefer real photos, AI headshots are becoming harder to spot, and less likely to even be reviewed by humans in the first stages of the application process. A recent study from the HR trade group SHRM found that 66% of human resource professionals are using AI to generate their job descriptions, and 44% are using the technology to review or screen applicant resumes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House and comes against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services, but is testing the core balance of power as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that organizers warn are a slide toward American authoritarianism. Many protesters were especially angered by attacks on their motives. In Bethesda, Maryland, one held a sign that read "Nothing is more patriotic than protesting." In nearby Washington, Brian Reymann carried a large American flag and said being called a terrorist all week by Republicans was "pathetic." I disagree with their politics, but I don't believe that they don't love this country. I think they are power hungry," Reymann said. Trump himself is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. More than 2,600 rallies are planned Saturday in cities large and small, organized by hundreds of coalition partners. While the earlier protests this year — against Elon Musk's cuts this spring and Trump's June military parade — drew crowds, organizers say this one is uniting the opposition. Top Democrats such as Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders are joining in what organizers view as an antidote to Trump's actions, from the administration's clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids. "There is no greater threat to an authoritarian regime than patriotic people-power," said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, among the key organizers. Before noon, several thousand people had gathered in New York City's Times Square, chanting "Trump must go now," and waving sometimes-profane signs with slogans insulting the president and condemning his immigration crackdown. Retired family doctor Terence McCormally was heading to Arlington National Cemetery to join others walking across the Memorial Bridge that enters Washington directly in front of the Lincoln Memorial. "I really don't like the crooks and conmen and religious zealots who are trying to use the country" for personal gain, McCormally said, "while they are killing and hurting millions of people with bombs." Americans abroad held smaller rallies in major European cities, waving U.S. flags and chanting slogans. Republicans have sought to portray Saturday's protesters as far outside the mainstream and a prime reason for the government shutdown, now in its 18th day. From the White House to Capitol Hill, GOP leaders disparaged the rallygoers as "communists" and "Marxists." "I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday," said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. "Let's see who shows up for that," Johnson said, listing groups including "antifa types," people who "hate capitalism" and "Marxists in full display." "It's a rally of millions of people all over this country who believe in our Constitution, who believe in American freedom and," he said, pointing at the GOP leadership, "are not going to let you and Donald Trump turn this country into an authoritarian society." Democrats have refused to vote on legislation that would reopen the government as they demand funding for health care. But for many Democrats, the government closure is also a way to stand up to Trump, and try to push the presidency back to its place in the U.S. system as a co-equal branch of government. The situation is a potential turnaround from just six months ago, when Democrats and their allies were divided and despondent, unsure about how best to respond to Trump's return to the White House. Schumer in particular was berated by his party for allowing an earlier government funding bill to sail through the Senate without using it to challenge Trump. In April, the national march against Trump and Elon Musk had 1,300 registered locations. In June, for the first "No Kings" day, there were 2,100 registered locations. "What we are seeing from the Democrats is some spine," Levin said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

If there's a phrase of the day on Wall Street right now, it's "debasement," says Sarah Beaton, director of investment strategy at Madera Wealth Management. Essentially, investors are worried about the debasement of fiat currencies and sovereign debt assets as government spending and debt levels continue to rise. In simpler terms, they're concerned that the value of money and bonds will be inflated away. To deal with this threat, investors are increasingly piling into what's being called the debasement trade — taking long positions in gold, silver, and bitcoin. Here's what to know about the buzziest trade on Wall Street. Think about the collective investor as your nutty uncle who's been getting really into doomsday prepping lately. There are valid warning signs that debasement is underway. The US government deficit is set to balloon further as tax cut extensions take hold in 2026. Debt, which is inherently inflationary, is mounting, and the government has piled up $38 trillion of it as of this month, according to data from the Treasury Department. Higher tariffs threaten to leak into consumer prices. After all, long-term inflation expectations are still muted, the dollar's value hasn't declined all that much in recent months, and long-term interest rates are still below 5%. It depends on who you ask, but some think yes, the rallies in precious metals and bitcoin can continue. "We believe lower US real interest rates, further USD weakness, and ongoing political twists will drive prices higher," said Wayne Gordon, a strategist at UBS, in an October 3 client note. Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX Advisors, said that gold and bitcoin should also benefit from governments buying them up. "Bitcoin is just a digital version of that trade." David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, thinks bitcoin is a fraudulent asset with no value, for instance, and that gold has a poor track record. He continued: "Since 1980, gold has basically, through a lot of zigs and zags, just kept pace with inflation. Some market pros have called into question investing in assets like gold and bitcoin as a play on the debasement trade. Kelly said that a better way to play a falling dollar is to be in UK and European equities and currencies. But if I want to make a bet that the dollar is going to come down — and I do — you could bet on gold, but I'd rather bet on foreign developed country currencies, particularly the euro, but also sterling and the Swiss franc," he said. Beaton, the director of investment strategy at Madera Wealth Management, said that she also thinks international stocks are a better way to go, along with Treasury inflation-protected securities and real estate. "Personally, gold is not how I prefer to get inflation protection," she said. "I think there are better ways to protect yourself from dollar devaluation — international investing is one of them."

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation and written commentary from Jure Leskovec, a computer-science professor at Stanford University and cofounder of Kumo, a maker of AI tools for predicting business outcomes from company data. This story has been edited for length and clarity. Launch real projects using public datasets, deploy a demo, post your work on GitHub, or write about it on a blog. We organize hackathons ourselves and are often impressed by what participants produce. It's concrete proof of what you can do. We recently hired someone who stood out because he built a generative AI tool for analyzing customer purchase data. It showed ambition, curiosity, and problem-solving, which are qualities we really value. My second recommendation is to show adaptability — that you're the kind of person who is always experimenting with new tools, and that you can learn quickly. This is essential because AI is evolving at a pace that surprises even those of us who work in the field every day. The best job candidates have taught themselves frameworks like PyTorch, JAX, or LLM tooling, and they stay current on areas like GenAI, multimodal models, diffusion, and reinforcement learning. Curiosity and flexibility matter more than having a fixed set of skills, because the skills in demand today may look very different tomorrow. In job interviews, we can tell if someone is just trying to map new ideas to what they learned in school versus truly engaging with what's new. I always value it when my students bring me solutions that haven't been tried before, even if they're wrong. We're still at the experimental stage of AI in many ways, and there isn't always a clear textbook answer. At Kumo, we conduct several interviews to see an applicant's full thought process. We pay close attention to how they approach problems and often value their reasoning as much as their final answer — if not more. Your idea today could become the standard tomorrow. Over time, these habits train you to see possibilities others overlook. One last piece of advice: Don't forget to be human. I look for people who can communicate clearly, work well in teams, and think carefully about the ethical and social implications of what they're building.</p>

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump's administration began sending emails to some borrowers on income-based repayment plans notifying them that they're eligible to have their loans discharged. IBR plans give borrowers monthly payments based on their incomes, with the promise of forgiveness of any remaining debt after 20 or 25 years. While the Department of Education did not specify how many borrowers are eligible for this round of forgiveness, 2 million borrowers were enrolled in IBR plans in the second quarter of 2025, according to Federal Student Aid data. "Your loan servicer will notify you if and when your IBR discharge has been processed," the email, reviewed by Business Insider, said. Student-loan forgiveness has been rare under the Trump administration, given its focus on overhauling repayment and shifting away from debt relief efforts. Over the summer, the Department of Education paused IBR processing to update borrowers' payment counts, and it has also been working through a backlog of other repayment plan applications, including those for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Here's what borrowers should know about the coming relief. The updates meant that borrowers who enrolled in the plan before July 1, 2014, had payments that were 15% of their discretionary income with a repayment period of 25 years, while those who signed up after July 1, 2014, had payments that were 10% of their discretionary income with a repayment period of 20 years. That means payments made before IBR went into effect count toward the forgiveness threshold. Trump's "big beautiful" spending legislation that he signed into law in July made some updates to IBR eligibility. The government has been shut down since October 1, and federal agencies have enacted their contingency plans to ensure critical functions stay in operation. A notice posted at the top of Federal Student Aid's website said that "information on this website may not be maintained, and inquiries may not receive a response." It added that borrowers "should continue to make payments on your federal student loans as scheduled." The forgiveness emails that IBR borrowers received said that the Department of Education will send borrowers' discharge information to servicers after October 21, and those who want to opt out of the relief have to do so before that date. However, due to furloughed and terminated staff at the Department of Education, paperwork processing — including for forgiveness — could be delayed. A 2021 provision in the American Rescue Plan made student-loan forgiveness tax-free through 2025, so after January 1, 2026, borrowers who receive relief could face thousands of dollars in new tax bills.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday he expects to meet next week with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia to try to forestall an escalation of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that President Donald Trump said was unsustainable. Bessent said on X the two officials "engaged in frank and detailed discussions regarding trade between the United States and China." "We will meet in-person next week to continue our discussions," Bessent wrote. China state news agency Xinhua reported that He and Bessent had "candid, in-depth, and constructive discussions on major issues in bilateral economic and trade relations" in a video call, and agreed to a new round of trade talks as soon as possible. The two officials previously met in four European cities over six months to hammer out a tariff truce that brought duties down from triple-digit levels for each country. A meeting in Malaysia would shift the venue to a Southeast Asian exporter that trades heavily with both China and the U.S. and whose goods are now subject to a 19% duty imposed by Trump. Malaysia also faces a threatened 100% U.S. tariff on its semiconductors and derivative electronics devices under a national security trade review. Trump earlier on Friday blamed Beijing for the latest impasse, a dispute over China's sweeping new export restrictions on rare-earth minerals and magnets. Asked whether such a high tariff was sustainable and what that might do to the U.S. economy, Trump replied: "It's not sustainable, but that's what the number is." "They forced me to do that," he said in an interview with Fox Business Network that was broadcast on Friday. Trump also has threatened to impose new U.S. export controls that would halt supplies of "any and all critical software." The new trade actions were Trump's reaction to China dramatically expanding its export controls on rare-earth elements. China dominates the market for such elements, which are essential to tech manufacturing. Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday blasted the restrictions as a threat to global supply chains. Trump also confirmed he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in two weeks in South Korea and expressed admiration for the Chinese leader. The softening in tone and affirmation of his intent to meet with Xi helped stem Wall Street's early losses on Friday. Major U.S. stock indexes, which have been rattled over the last week by Trump's abrupt re-imposition of steep levies on Chinese imports and by credit worries among regional banks, were up in afternoon trading. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters in an interview the global trade body was extremely concerned about the latest spike in U.S.-China trade tensions and had spoken with officials from both countries to encourage more dialogue. Bessent took aim at China's state-driven economic practices in a statement to the IMF's steering committee on Friday, urging the IMF and World Bank to take a tougher stance on China's external and internal imbalances and industrial policies that U.S. officials say have helped China build up excess manufacturing capacity that is flooding the world with cheap goods. It also urged the U.S. to roll back measures that breach non-discrimination rules and align its industrial and security policies with WTO obligations. Bessent earlier in the week had accused one of He's top aides of being "unhinged" in recent interactions with U.S. trade negotiators. China said on Friday that Bessent's remarks "seriously distort the facts." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, in a post on X, apologized for suggesting that President Donald Trump should call the National Guard into San Francisco. "Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco," Benioff wrote. "My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused," he added. "It's my firm belief that our city makes the most progress when we all work together in a spirit of partnership. Throughout the conference, Benioff made repeated references to safety, and at one point said the company hired hundreds of its own security personnel. When reached by Business Insider, Salesforce declined to comment further than Benioff's remarks. The New York Times reported that Conway sent Benioff an email saying their "values were no longer aligned." "It saddens me immensely to say that with your recent comments, and failure to understand their impact, I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired," The Times reported Conway, a top Democratic donor, wrote to Benioff. Comedians Kumail Nanjiani and Ilana Glazer also canceled performances at Dreamforce, but did not specify the reason. On October 12, a group of current and former Salesforce employees, as well as other tech workers and San Francisco residents, published an open letter to Benioff, criticizing his original comments and demanding that he retract his endorsement of sending National Guard troops into the city. After his public apology, the group behind the open letter published an update saying they were "monitoring ongoing news" surrounding his apology, as well as an October 16 article by The New York Times, which reported that Salesforce had offered to aid Trump's immigration enforcement officers with AI services. In 2023, Benioff threatened to move Dreamforce outside San Francisco if that year's event was affected by what he called "the current situation with homelessness and drug use." Benioff later that year announced Dreamforce would return in 2024 due to "new standards with outstanding safety measures, cleanliness, and hospitality" in partnership with the city.</p>

The $1.65 trillion chip giant Broadcom cut staff earlier this week. The cuts on Thursday affected staff largely in sales, as well as customer success, account management, and solutions, according to LinkedIn posts and a person familiar with the matter. VMware's workforce has been slashed by roughly in half, Business Insider reported earlier this year. Broadcom has also been increasing prices on VMware's products. It first reached a trillion-dollar market cap late last year. On Monday, it inked a strategic agreement with OpenAI for 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators. Broadcom did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
