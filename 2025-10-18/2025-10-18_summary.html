            Russian forces are still edging forward along several parts of the long front line in Ukraine – despite yet another call from US President Donald Trump for a combat freeze along existing lines.
    


            Both sides “should stop where they are,” Trump said on social media Friday, after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington DC.
    


            But the Russians seem intent on locking in gains before the onset of winter. On Friday, they used a record 268 guided aerial bombs, according to the Ukrainian military, compared to an average of 170 to 180 per day in recent weeks. These bombs, which carry a payload of up to 1,500 kilograms (3,307 pounds), largely target Ukrainian forces and infrastructure close to the front lines.
    


            The Russians have also continued nightly barrages of drones and missiles against targets across Ukraine, especially against energy infrastructure. In September, an average of more than 180 drones were launched every night, more than twice the number at the beginning of the year.
    


            In recent days, the Ukrainians have acknowledged that about 20% are not being intercepted.
    


            To some analysts, the Kremlin has no incentive to compromise.
    


            “Moscow has developed fresh ways of using drones to find and kill Ukrainian soldiers and to destroy Ukrainian assets, turning what was once an area of weakness into an area of strength,” writes long-time Russia analyst Dara Massicot in Foreign Affairs.
    


            “It has built better missiles and created more rugged and capable armored systems. It is giving junior commanders more freedom to plan,” Massicot adds.
    


Trump meeting brings good news for Zelensky, but Kyiv's real prize remains out of reach – for now



            One town where Ukrainians are under growing pressure is Kupiansk, in the northern region of Kharkiv. Russian troops have advanced to the north and east of the town, which has been under siege for more than a year.
    


            A well-known Russian blogger, War Gonzo, said Saturday on Telegram that there was also fighting in the center of Kupiansk. About 80 Russian troops had infiltrated the town, the Ukrainian military acknowledged on Thursday, and its defenders were “doing everything possible to clear Kupiansk of Russian invaders and prevent the accumulation of enemy infantry in the city.”
    


            One Ukrainian military blogger – Bohdan Miroshnikov – said this week that the Russian tactic “may lead to control (if reinforcements can arrive and consolidate their positions).” He added that while the situation was very complicated, “full occupation of the city is still a long way off.”
    


            Also in Kharkiv region, closer to the international border, the Russians have claimed advances near the town of Vovchansk, including the capture of a nearby village.
    


            In Donetsk, heavy fighting continues around Pokrovsk, with a Russian military blogger claiming Saturday that Russian troops are advancing to the northwestern outskirts of the city. For its part, the Ukrainian military has claimed to have recovered some 70 square miles of territory in the Pokrovsk area over the past two months, in a series of counterattacks.
    


            Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian forces, insisted Friday that the Russians did not have “the strategic initiative. At the cost of enormous losses, the adversary has achieved only minor advances in certain sections of the front.”
    


            “Ukrainian warriors have ceased the enemy's spring-summer offensive campaign,” Syrskyi added.
    


            Russia has gained about 120 square miles of territory in the past four weeks, about half of what it seized in the previous four weeks, according to the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University.
    


            And Russian advances come at great cost. As many as 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, according to an estimate in June by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US-based think tank.
    


            Nearly 14,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the Pokrovsk area alone since late August, according to Ukraine's military command. CNN cannot verify battlefield figures.
    


Trump seeks to build on momentum from Gaza deal in a busy diplomatic week



            In the face of these losses, the Russian defense ministry appears to be changing the way it recruits additional personnel. In recent weeks, Russian regions have begun paring back the generous sign-on bonuses used to attract recruits.
    


            The Kremlin has traditionally relied on financial incentives to attract volunteers and avoid another mobilization, but the practice “is likely hitting diminishing returns, which may compel the Kremlin to adopt an alternative approach,” according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank.
    


            “Russia may begin to mobilize members of Russia's active reserve on a rolling basis to sustain its combat operations in Ukraine,” according to ISW.
    


            For its part, Ukraine is betting on long-range strikes targeting Russian energy infrastructure to persuade the Kremlin to accept negotiations. It has stepped up production of its own cruise missiles, although it has been unable as yet to persuade Trump to supply Tomahawk missiles.
    


            Since the beginning of the year, successful strikes haved been carried out against 45 facilities in Russia's fuel and energy sector, according to Syrskyi. Industry analysts estimate that one-fifth of Russia's refining capacity has been disrupted.
    


            But despite the casualties and damage to Russia's economy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of agreeing to a ceasefire or negotiations with Ukraine.
    


            More than 1,300 days since the full-scale Russian invasion began, as one expert puts it, “Ukraine cannot destroy Russia's war capacity, while Russia appears unable to militarily defeat Ukraine.”

Following high-level talks between Ukrainian and U.S. officials in Washington this week, European leaders are renewing calls for a peace plan to end Russia's invasion, after an apparent shift in U.S. support for Kyiv.

"Following his meeting with President (Donald) Trump, we have coordinated and will accompany the next steps. What Ukraine needs now is a peace plan," Merz wrote on X.

Merz also reportedly said that the meeting had not gone as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had hoped, according to German media outlet n-tv.

The statements come after an intense week of diplomacy culminating in a planned bilateral meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the failure of a Ukrainian delegation to clinch U.S. approval to purchase Tomahawk cruise missiles. 

The Ukrainian team had been hoping to capitalize on improved relations. President Trump has grown increasingly frustrated in recent months by Putin's refusal to end the war against Ukraine. 

The delivery of Tomahawks, which can strike targets between 1,600 and 2,500 kilometers (1,000–1,600 miles) away, would dramatically alter Ukraine's long-range strike capability. 

Using domestically manufactured drones, Ukraine has conducted repeated long-range strikes on Russian oil refineries in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin. 

But before the closed-door meeting started, Trump told reporters that the U.S. needed to maintain its own supply of the missiles. He did, however, signal openness to a weapons deal with Kyiv that could involve U.S.-made missiles and Ukrainian drones.

Russia has repeatedly warned that the U.S. supply of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine would represent a new stage of escalation. 

The meeting — the sixth since Trump's return to office — came one day after a phone call between Trump and Putin, culminating in a planned summit in Budapest in the next two weeks. 

Several European leaders held a conference call with Zelensky after the closed-door meeting, including NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

According to an Axios source who was on the call, Starmer suggested teaming up with the U.S. to shape a Ukraine peace plan inspired by Trump's Gaza proposal.

NATO chief Mark Rutte then pushed for European security advisers to hold a rapid follow-up meeting over the weekend, Axios reported.

He holds a BA honors degree in economics and Russian from McGill University.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that the meeting had not gone as Zelensky had hoped. 

International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said "both sides engaged constructively" with the agency to enable the repair plan.

"Hopefully, we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks," Trump told reporters before closed-door talks with Zelensky.

This comes as two survivors of the US's most recent drone strike on a boat have reportedly been detained by US forces.

With President Donald Trump floating potential military action within Venezuela and authorizing operations by the Central Intelligence Agency after launching several deadly strikes on boats near the South American country, three lawmakers from both sides of the aisle on Friday said they would force a new vote on blocking the White House from carrying out an attack there.

Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) last week introduced a measure to rein in Trump's bombing of boats in the Caribbean, which the White House has claimed are being used to traffic drugs into the US and present an imminent threat.

The measure failed, with one Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman (Pa.) joining most of the GOP in opposing it and two Republicans, Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), supporting it.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Kaine and Schiff on Friday were reportedly hoping that a new bipartisan measure, introduced with Paul, would garner more support from the Republicans.

They said they would force a vote on a war powers resolution to block the use of force by US troops “within or against” Venezuela unless it was “explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.”

The 1973 War Powers Act requires Congress to consider and vote on resolutions regarding a president's power to enter an armed conflict without congressional authorization.

“Congress has not authorized military force against Venezuela. And we must assert our authority to stop the United States from being dragged — intentionally or accidentally — into full-fledged war in South America,” said Schiff.

The lawmakers announced the resolution as it was reported that two survivors of the military's most recent drone strike on a boat have been detained by US forces, with legal experts questioning whether they are prisoners or war or criminal suspects.

The White House has insisted it is acting within its rights to defend US security by striking boats it believes are carrying drugs — even as details have emerged calling into doubt the allegations that the vessels pose a threat.

Venezuela is not a significant source of drugs that are trafficked into the US — a fact that Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed when a reporter brought it up soon after the military began bombing boats, at least six of which have been struck so far. At least 27 people have been killed, and the grieving family of one victim spoke out Thursday and said they had not been involved in drug trafficking.

Even if the vessels were carrying illegal substances, legal experts and critics in Congress have stressed in recent weeks that they should be dealt with, as in the past, by federal law enforcement agencies, as Congress has not authorized military action against Venezuela or drug cartels.

“The American people do not want to be dragged into endless war with Venezuela without public debate or a vote,” said Paul. “We ought to defend what the Constitution demands: deliberation before war.”

Kaine told reporters on Thursday the Congress' knowledge of legal rationale for the boat strikes amounts to “a complete black hole.”

Meanwhile, Trump has suggested this week he could further escalate attacks on Venezuela, saying the Caribbean Sea is “very well under control” — even though Vice President JD Vance has joked that the US could accidentally strike fishing boats in its operations there.

“We are certainly looking at land now,” Trump said Wednesday.

Kaine said he was “extremely troubled that the Trump administration is considering launching illegal military strikes inside Venezuela without a specific authorization by Congress.”

“Americans don't want to send their sons and daughters into more wars — especially wars that carry a serious risk of significant destabilization and massive new waves of migration in our hemisphere,” said Kaine. “If my colleagues disagree and think a war with Venezuela is a good idea, they need to meet their constitutional obligations by making their case to the American people and passing an authorization for use of military force.”

“I urge every senator to join us in stopping this administration from dragging our country into an unauthorized and escalating military conflict,” said the senator.

The New York Times reported that Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) could potentially join the effort to pass the war powers resolution after voting against last week's measure, which he said was too broad.

“I am highly concerned,” Young said after the vote last week, “about the legality of recent strikes in the Caribbean and the trajectory of military operations without congressional approval or debate and the support of the American people.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

No one was hurt in the incident when a wing from one plane struck the tail of another United aircraft

A United Airlines plane heading for its gate clipped the tail of another United aircraft at Chicago's O'Hare airport, authorities said.

No one was hurt in Friday's incident, and the 113 passengers on flight 2652 from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, were able to leave the plane normally after a delay, United officials said in a statement.

Runway collisions like these could add to worries about aviation safety in the wake of recent crashes and near misses – including the deadliest plane crash in the United States in decades, when an army helicopter collided with an airliner preparing to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National airport in January.

Earlier in October, two Delta Air Lines regional jets collided at the intersection of taxiways at LaGuardia airport in New York, injuring a flight attendant.

In Friday's case, the second United plane had its horizontal stabilizer struck and was not moving when the planes hit, officials said.

Bill Marcus, a passenger on the flight from Wyoming, said he didn't even realize anything happened until the pilot said there would be a delay to document something and passengers on the plane saw a number of people gather around the right wing.

“I was shocked that I didn't feel something more, although when they separated the planes there was some shuddering,” Marcus told CBS News Chicago. It took about 40 extra minutes for the plane to get to the gate, he said.

Five MTV channels will close at the end of the year in the UK, leaving just one – which mostly plays reality TV. And with budgets pinched, directors say they are struggling

The launch of MTV, in 1981, ushered in a new era of music. Showing music videos 24 hours a day, the television channel redefined artist marketing and launched the careers of artists such as Michael Jackson and Madonna, whose public personas became inseparable from the gripping, frequently controversial clips they produced to be played on the service.

Now, that chapter of music history appears to be drawing to a close, with MTV's parent company Paramount announcing last week that its five dedicated music channels in the UK – MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV and MTV Live – will cease broadcasting after 31 December. (The flagship MTV channel, which broadcasts reality programmes such as Catfish, The Hills and Geordie Shore, will remain in operation.)

For some, it represents the end of an era. Others, such as the musician Hannah Diamond, suggest that era may have been over some time ago. “The last few years, MTV has sort of transformed [into] more of a nostalgic memory,” she says. “It hasn't been part of the conversation for such a long time that it really doesn't surprise me that they're ending it.” As an independent artist, she says, YouTube has always been the primary platform for music video releases.

The specific shuttering of the brand's music platforms does call into question the position of the music video in today's industry, and whether the form still provides a viable outlet for expression and promotion. Jennifer Byrne, head of development at Academy Films – the famed production company that launched the careers of film-makers such as Jonathan Glazer through their music video work – says that “labels aren't as willing” to invest heavily in videos as they once were. “They're trying to spend that money on so many more deliverables than there used to be,” she says, referring to the multiplicity of online video and social media platforms. “It used to just be one three-minute video. Now it's: how do you reach all these different audiences and can you cut it in 10 different ways?”

Iris Luz, a London-based director who has made videos for British pop singers PinkPantheress and George Riley, says that budgets for videos are shrinking rapidly, even for seemingly simple clips. “The number of times I'll come up with an idea that, to me, seems easy, and people are like: ‘No, that's gonna be 50 billion pounds,'” she says. “I'm like, that's funny, because it's in one house with four people. I don't know what's going on.”

Neither Luz nor Byrne believes that the end of MTV will significantly impact music videos overall. In Luz's mind, videos now are less promotional tools than “vehicles for relatability and branding that makes [a viewer] want to buy into the artist,” she says. “They're just a facet in the ecosystem of a musician. Because of TikTok and the rise of independent artists, people put out music as soon as they're done with it. So a video is designed to convey that immediacy – where they're at in one moment – rather than make a big splash like 15 years ago.”

There are also still barriers to entry for smaller artists, says Diamond. “The music videos I have made have been made through sheer luck, grafting or multiple years of work put into one thing,” she says. “I've become a musician in an era where artists don't get the budget to make a music video unless they are a really big artist with a big label behind them that thinks it's going to be a worthwhile investment.”

Directors are feeling the pinch too: Byrne says that where “back in the day, an artist would have been like, ‘I like what Glazer's doing, I'm going to talk to him,' now, you're pitching [to an artist] against [maybe] 10 different directors, and that's free labour on the director's part, creating this amazing treatment.” Plus, she says, “no one makes money out of these videos. Production companies don't – but we still do them because they're really important and a vital part of a director finding their own voice.”

Part of the problem, of course, is that content budgets now have to stretch across short-form video, too. Luz says that while TikTok videos can be “shot on a DSLR camera; a guy with a guitar and a dream, singing on a pub stool,” they can also be just as creative and innovative as traditional videos. “Content can be an added facet to the [musician's] world,” she says, citing her work with the band Confidence Man, which she says is “on par with their shows and music videos because they have fun with it.”

Despite everything, videos can still be a pipeline to feature directing, says Byrne: “If you look at [Everything Everywhere All at Once directors] The Daniels, they started off in the music video world, and then they won an Oscar,” she says. “Music videos still allow those unique personalities to shine through and take risks.”

Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount was looking at ways to revitalise the MTV brand, and Diamond says that, given how volatile and changeable the industry is, it's hard to make any assumptions about the future of videos. “Who knew that vinyl was going to make such a massive comeback, you know?” she says. Luz agrees: “It's like an album – albums are never gonna go away, and music videos are like punctuation for an album. They're always going to exist.”

Jasmine Entz, at her farm near Vulcan, Alta., poses with Beef, an eight-year-old Holstein that was recently declared by the Guinness Book of World Records to be the tallest living steer.LEAH HENNEL/The Globe and Mail

Jasmine Entz met him just moments after he was born, all fresh into this world and still covered with slime. She took a picture of him and sent it to one of her coworkers, saying: “This one's really cute.”

He was really cute, a purebred, black-headed Holstein lying in the straw. But there was something else that set him apart from all the other Holsteins at the dairy she works at in Lethbridge.

“He just seemed to have an energy to him that he was always excited about life,” Ms. Entz recalls. “He was just a little go-getter right from the beginning.”

In fact, the more she fed the calf and got to know him, the more his character started to shine through. Cattle do have their own personalities, and he was calm and smart, always cuddly and excited to see her, wanting to lay his head in her lap.

She'd been looking for an animal to ride (yes, some people do ride cattle), and with his intelligence and gentle demeanour, this little black-headed fellow seemed like a perfect fit. He stayed at the dairy until he was weaned, then she brought him home to her hobby farm, to join her herd of 50 miniature goats. He was about three months old then, just a little guy, at least for a Holstein: 250 pounds and not yet up to her waist. She named him Beef.

She didn't mean for him to get so big. She fed Beef just like she would have any other calf, grain at first to develop his digestion, then a standard adult diet of various hays, with the odd pumpkin from a neighbour or something from the garden as a treat.

But Beef started to grow.

And grow.

And grow. 

And as the years went by, it eventually came to pass that Beef wasn't just tall, but strikingly, remarkably, record-breakingly tall. The tallest steer alive in this whole wild world, in fact.

Beef is now 6-foot-6 at the shoulder – and he's still growing.LEAH HENNEL/The Globe and Mail

Beef was six years old when one of Ms. Entz's friends shared a story about Tommy, a brown steer in Massachusetts who then held the Guinness World Record for tall steers. Tommy was obviously no slouch, standing a respectable 6-foot-1 at the withers. But even before she measured, Ms. Entz already knew her Beef was bigger. 

She submitted proof of Beef's height and health according to all the Guinness guidelines and rules, and Beef officially took the title and joined the record book this year. At the time he was measured, he was 6-foot-5.

“I was expecting him to get big,” Ms. Entz says. “I was not expecting him to get this big.”

Beef is actually now 6-foot-6 at the shoulder, having grown an inch since he set the record. That makes him almost as tall as a doorframe, as long as a small car, 2,500 pounds of pure Beef. At eight years old, he's also still growing. Ms. Entz doesn't know when he'll stop.

“When you break it down and look at each individual part, it really kind of puts it into perspective,” says Ms. Entz. “He's big in person. Much bigger than the pictures show.”

In just two more inches, he'll overtake Fiorino, a chianina ox from Italy who died in 2007, to become the tallest steer ever recorded. 

Beef eats 100 pounds of hay a day and $400 worth of hay a month.LEAH HENNEL/The Globe and Mail

Outside the record, there's not much tangible benefit to being the Tallest Living Steer in the World, or to being his person. Ms. Entz can't even ride him anymore. Even though they both enjoyed it, he's too big to fit her riding tack now, and, since she's afraid of heights, she'd be sitting too high off the ground for her comfort.

Holsteins are big bovines by their genetics, but most steers don't have a chance to grow to maturity because – well, you know why. But Beef, through a combination of luck and charm, will live out his days in comfort and companionship on Ms. Entz's farm.

Beef is healthy and receives regular checkups with a vet – dairy cattle have a naturally leaner look to them, if you were thinking he looks thin – but, let's face it, that's a lot of meat to carry around on those legs. Beef also needs an extra-tall stock trailer, and eats 100 pounds of hay a day and $400 worth of hay a month, and poops accordingly.

Ms. Entz says the general consensus in cattle circles that, “it's a little silly that I'm feeding a 6-foot-6, eight-year-old Holstein steer.” 

“And I can't disagree with it,” she laughs. “You know, obviously Beef is the exception, because he's my baby and I've had him for eight years. Knowing what the cost of it is, no, I will not be getting another Holstein steer. That was a lesson learned.”

Customs and Border Protection implemented rule this week, sending Americans with ‘X' marker into panic

US Customs and Border Protection implemented a rule this week that will require airlines to disregard “X” sex markers on passports and input an “M” or “F” marker instead, sending those people with an “X” marker into panic.

“X” markers became available to US passport holders in 2022, in an effort to allow people with gender identities other than male and female to obtain more accurate travel documents.

Now, the new CBP rule has many people on social media and beyond worried that they will no longer be allowed to fly internationally.

“It's a little bit too soon to say how this is going to practically work out,” said Andy Izenson, senior legal director at the Chosen Family Law Center.

Passports with “X” markers should still be considered valid travel documents; the US district court of Massachusetts issued an order in June ensuring that they would remain valid after the Trump administration attempted to ban them under executive order 14168, titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.

While the courts have continued to prevent the Trump administration from outright banning a third gender marker, this week's rule can still serve to make the lives of trans and non-binary people more difficult, Izenson says.

“I would suggest the intent is to ensure that any individual person who's acting under color of law or as an agent of the state has as much leeway to act out their personal bigotry as they want, without any concern about consequences,” Izenson said.

After spending time on the phone with CBP, the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security, Izenson was unable to get clear answers about how the rule would function, and who would be responsible for enforcing it.

Izenson said it's questionable whether it will be up to individual agents whether they choose to flag “X” gender markers on passports that are different from the “F” and “M” markers that airlines will now be required to input, or whether the rule could prevent travelers with “X” markers from boarding international flights. Land border crossings and domestic flights should not be affected, however, per Izenson.

A CBP spokesperson said: “Foreign travelers with authorized and valid US travel documents are being processed as they were previously. New or renewing Trusted Traveler Program applicants are now required to choose one of the two approved designations, male or female, to complete the application. An applicant's choice of sex is not criteria for an applicant's admission into the US.”

Izenson and Carl Charles, counsel for Lambda Legal, both say they have not yet heard about the rule causing problems for people at the airport. But Dr July Pilowsky, a scientist and US citizen currently residing in Spain who uses he/they/she pronouns, said the new rule is already disrupting their life.

When Pilowsky initially chose to change their passport gender marker to “X”, they said “it was a practical decision”.

“It's not like I did it to validate myself and feel good about myself,” Pilowsky said, noting they did it out of necessity because it can be a bureaucratic hassle when different identity documents have different information on them.

Additionally, Pilowsky said they'd already experienced trouble at the airport because of their gender expression.

“What CBP officers do when you show them your document [passport] at the border, is they look at the sex marker on your document. And based on what that sex marker says, they decide what you're supposed to look like and what your body is supposed to be like,” Pilowsky said.

Body-scanning X-rays at airport security that reveal genitalia can be especially invasive for trans people.

“The CBP officers can decide whether the results of the body scan are suspicious or not, based on, you know, there's something in your pants they think you shouldn't have. So what's on your document shapes what CBP officers believe ought to be reality,” they continued.

Pilowsky said they've experienced “invasive pat-downs” because of this, which is one reason why they decided to get the “X” marker.

“What I wanted to do was disrupt the process. When you have a sex marker that says ‘X', then suddenly it's difficult for the CBP officer to build an image of what you're supposed to look like and compare you against it, positively or negatively,” they explained.

Now that the new rule has been implemented, they have to worry about the same problem again.

“I've experienced some slice of the spectrum of things you can experience if you're under suspicion,” they said. “I don't want to know about the rest of that spectrum.”

To avoid this, Pilowsky said, “I'm being forced into the rather absurd situation of reaching out to an immigration lawyer in order to enter my own country.” They have dual citizenship in the US and Chile, so they're hoping to enter the US with a Chilean passport, which doesn't have an “X” marker option, in the future.

Charles of Lambda Legal said he still considers the availability of “X” markers a victory. “People need identity documents to navigate their everyday lives,” he said.

Future legal challenges to the policy will depend on how it winds up being implemented, Izenson said, adding that they expect the policy will shake out differently for different people depending on what airline passengers choose, and other elements of their identity.

“That question depends on a person's experience and identity and how they move through the world on a number of levels, including what gender they are perceived as, what their body looks like, what their skin tone is, how they're dressed,” Izenson said.

Izenson thinks that the intention of the policy has little to do with passports and airports, saying: “They are trying to throw us into a state of reactivity so that we're not able to focus on practical advocacy and the material needs of our communities. The more they can keep us confused and freaked out and not sure what's going on, the more they can do whatever they want.”

            The UN's nuclear watchdog has said work is underway to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant (ZNPP) following the establishment of rare “ceasefire zones.”
    


            The plant has been without power from the electricity network for four weeks, the longest blackout since the war began.
    


            “Work has begun to repair damaged off-site power lines to ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant) after 4-week outage, following establishment of local ceasefire zones to allow work to proceed,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director Rafael Grossi said in a social media post on Saturday.
    


            “Restoration of off-site power is crucial for nuclear safety and security. Both sides engaged constructively with the IAEA to enable complex repair plan to proceed,” he added.
    


            Apart from the regular exchanges of prisoners, the fighting in Ukraine has rarely eased in the three-year conflict.
    


            Neither side confirmed the local truce, but Ukraine's energy ministry said Ukrainian specialists were working to restore the power lines on Saturday, the 42nd round of repair works since Russia's full-scale invasion.
    


            “The only reason for the unprecedented risks and threat of a radiation incident in Europe is Russian military aggression, the occupation of the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhya NPP and the systematic shelling of Ukraine's energy infrastructure,” the ministry said in a Telegram post.
    


            The Russian-controlled power plant said in a post on Telegram that staff were carrying out restoration works, adding the Russian defense ministry was playing a “key role” in ensuring that the “work can be carried out in an area under active shelling by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.”
    


            “Without the security guarantees provided by the military, the work of the power engineers would be impossible,” the post said.
    


            The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant lost connection to its sole remaining power line last month, forcing the plant to run on emergency diesel generators for over 20 days, the IAEA reported.
    


            Both sides traded accusations over the outage. Ukraine's foreign minister Andrii Sybiha accused Russia of “intentionally” cutting the electricity supply to the nuclear plant to test reconnection with the Russian grid. Russia said the blackout was caused by Ukrainian shelling.
    


            The blackout at the power plant, occupied by Russian forces since the early days of the war, marked the tenth time the site lost connection to the grid since the military conflict began, according to the IAEA.
    


            Russia has continued to carry out strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Two weeks ago, a Russian strike on a Ukrainian energy substation in the city of Slavutych caused a blackout that lasted more than three hours at the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
    


            Zelensky accused Moscow of a “deliberate strike” that involved “more than 20 drones,” stating that “the Russians could not have been unaware that striking facilities in Slavutych would have such consequences for Chernobyl.”

Having survived the most restrictive supermax prison in the country on a trumped-up charge, Eric King tells what he saw.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

Eric King has seen what hell looks like during his time in federal custody. While incarcerated, he was increasingly targeted for his anarchist political beliefs, often denied family visits, and restricted from receiving mail. In 2018, at FCI Florence, a lieutenant took him to a mop closet, where he was pushed and punched. King defended himself, after which he was slammed to the floor, stomped, handcuffed to a bed post, suffocated, and tortured. Unfairly charged with assaulting a government officer, he fought the case in court and won a “not guilty” verdict. According to the Pew Research Center, 90 percent of federal trials end in plea deals, 8 percent get tossed, 2 percent go to trial, and King's case was one of 0.4 percent of cases that win. However, the government retaliated, and he was transferred to ADX Florence — the most restrictive supermax prison in the country.

When talking to King about ADX, or the Administrative Maximum Facility, he describes his experience as being entombed or buried. “These cells had held Tom Manning and Ray Luc. They held Mutulu Shakur and Oscar López Rivera. Now I joined my elders in maintaining my resistance while buried in the Rockies,” he writes in his newest book, A Clean Hell: Anarchy and Abolition in America's Most Notorious Dungeon. “All the bucking, protesting, resisting, fighting, starving, struggling, had all led to this. When they can't handle your presence, they bury it.”

In this exclusive interview with Truthout, King discusses his new book, anarchism, mutual aid, supporting political prisoners, prison abolition, and more. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Zane McNeill: Can you start by introducing yourself and explaining why you wrote this book — who the audience is, what you hoped to accomplish, and maybe say a bit about your last book?

Eric King: My name is Eric King, an ex–political prisoner. I wrote this book because I saw a major gap in the abolitionist movement's narrative. There are books from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, but nothing from my generation that I could relate to — especially about federal prison. Almost no one writes about it.

“I think people should care that there are human beings who have lived alone in a cell for over two decades — people we've never heard of and who will never be released.”

The two experiences I had are things very few people go through. First, ADX. Almost no one knows much about it. Inside, I'd get letters asking me to check out someone's website or if they could send me clothes, which showed me people don't understand — this prison is kept a secret, and it works. The second is trial. Many people — folks from Palestine, Cop City, people facing state repression, maybe soon just for being queer — are going to trial. There's a romanticized idea of what trial is, but the reality is soul-sucking and brutal. That's why so many take plea deals. I felt both of these narratives were missing.

Also, I think people should care that there are human beings who have lived alone in a cell for over two decades — people we've never heard of and who will never be released. One reason I wrote this book is to honor them.

Why do you think it's important for people to understand what ADX is like and how it affects those inside?

ADX matters to me because the government has built a narrative around it, and the public has accepted it without question. We've seen this before — other supermax prisons became almost mythical, like Alcatraz. People turn them into fiction and forget that real people suffered there, that there was real resistance, like the Battle of Alcatraz when prisoners fought the Marines.

When I was in lower custody levels, you'd hear all kinds of wild stories about ADX — nonsense about it spinning underground — but you also knew it held the most infamous prisoners in the world, aside from state serial killers. Then I'd talk to friends outside, and they didn't know anything about it. If people in the abolitionist movement don't know, what chance does the general public have? Things won't change if no one's talking about it.

The government says it imprisons the “the worst of the worst,” and people agree without knowing what it's really like — not hearing another human voice for a month, or having a guard refuse to sell you stamps so you can write your family, your only line of communication, and there's nothing you can do because you're behind two doors. They want you to hurt yourself, to fall apart, because that makes you easier to control.

You've spent a lot of time learning from past movements — studying FBI targeting of anarchists, Black Panthers, and understanding the history of political prisoners. In the book, you also discuss prison uprisings and how prisons evolved to prevent them and isolate people. Can you talk about that?

When we study the Black Panthers in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, what they went through isn't exactly what I went through, but I can learn from how they maintained themselves, how they survived, how they fought back. The ways we resist can't always be the same either. There was a time when the BOP [Federal Bureau of Prisons] had [dozens of] political prisoners spread among [a handful] of prisons, and they made a difference. We don't have that now. We're more isolated, with less solidarity inside, less communication with the outside, and more monitoring. So, we have to take their lessons and adapt them to our current reality.

I've drawn strength from people like Kuwasi Balagoon, Bill Dunn, and David Gilbert — people who maintained their ethics inside — but also from my own trial and error. It's hard. I've learned what works and what doesn't. Telling a guard that you know their address will get you messed up. Throwing something in a guard's face will get you messed up. Laughing at a lieutenant when he's trying to fight you will get you messed up. You have to find ways to feel powerful and resist without putting yourself in unnecessary danger.

We don't “win” by getting hurt — there are no political prisoner points for suffering more. We win when we make it out alive with our ethics and personalities intact. In my mind, all our revolts and rebellions should aim for that: undermine the prison, but strengthen yourself. Give yourself the chance to survive and make it out.

You were an anarchist before prison and already had a political education. Once inside, did you continue that?

That's another misconception people have about prison, based on older revolutionaries. Back then, it was easier in some ways because there was so much social consciousness — movements like Black liberation were huge, and they empowered people inside in ways we can't fully understand today.

The racial dynamics were also different. Ed Mead of the George Jackson Brigade could sit and eat with Native Americans [in prison]. If you tried that today, you'd be killed — you wouldn't make it off the yard, maybe not even out of the chow hall. You can't do the same things now. So, when people talk about “revolutionizing” others in prison today, that's just not real — the administration will pull you off the yard.

“One of the reasons I was sent to ADX was for ‘recruiting antifa,' which in reality meant giving anti-fascist and anti-racist books to people.”

One of the reasons I was sent to ADX was for “recruiting antifa,” which in reality meant giving anti-fascist and anti-racist books to people. I encouraged folks to read — not just to have an opinion, but an informed one. I'd reach people through solidarity. If someone didn't have money on their books, I'd point out that the white supremacists weren't sending them canteen money — meanwhile, my friends did, and I'd happily buy them a bad coffee. That opens the door to talking about mutual aid, which leads to talking about anti-racism, because we have to be there for everybody.

What should young political activists understand about the risks, vulnerabilities, and lack of guaranteed movement support if they are imprisoned?

The movement doesn't always show up for you — a lot of people get forgotten. If it hadn't been for Denver Anarchist Black Cross, no one would've ever heard my name. It took that one group to really fight for me.

And here's the ugly truth: They almost have to vouch for you, make you “worthy” to others. They have to make you relevant so people want to write to you. It's not enough that you're a human being suffering — people want to know your niche.

Sure, there are pockets — Inland Empire, Reno, Los Angeles ABCF [chapter of the Anarchist Black Cross Federation], Salt Lake City, Portland, Blue Ridge, Bloomington, Chicago, and, of course, Eugene, where Josh Davidson, a supporter who became a dear friend of mine, lives — but if you don't have people having your back, you're alone. The Angola 3 didn't have support for the first 20 years of their time in solitary. We look at them as heroes now, but at the time, no one cared. You talk to people like Kojo Bomani Sababu and the older Black Panthers [and] it's the same story.

We need to do better. Maybe it's because we're swamped: We have access to every struggle, so we spread ourselves too thin and forget those left behind.

You've faced people who wanted to kill you, yet your anarchism still centers mutual aid, resistance, and collective care. How do you hold onto that?

It's a delicate balance, because I needed people. Even though I was abused by parts of the movement and saw how brutal people can be — guards, prisoners, even supporters — I also saw the beauty. Writing a letter is a purposeful act; someone has to choose to do it. I had people who chose to write to me for nine years, who made sure every month I had coffee, books, or magazines. They refused to let me be buried.

From my perspective, getting out of prison and having opportunities but not using them to help others would feel like abuse. Sure, you can get out and just focus on yourself — you've been through enough — but for me, every person is someone I could connect with or encourage to help others.

Anarchism is putting your love forward, keeping your arms open. If I don't do that, I turn grim. For me, a love of life is a love of people and of doing good. You should want to help people. If you don't, and you're an able-bodied, mentally capable person, you need to check yourself — because if you can help and you won't, you're probably a piece of shit.

Wall Street destroyed NYC's social welfare economy in 1975. Can mass movements stop it from defeating Mamdani's agenda?

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

If polls are to be believed, Zohran Mamdani is likely to win the mayoralty of New York City this November. An October 9 Quinnipiac University survey taken after Mayor Eric Adams dropped from the race shows Mamdani is up 13 points over his nearest competitor, disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. 

Despite his youth and executive inexperience, Mamdani has all the advantages — a better ground game with tens of thousands of volunteers, a better social media campaign driven by young activists with an irreverent style, more favorable national and international media coverage, as much as four times more campaign cash on hand than Cuomo, a spate of high-profile endorsements (although not the leading officials of his own party), and other strengths.

Yet despite these electoral advantages, the deck is stacked against Mamdani's administration. This is because the political coalition necessary to govern is quite different from that which can get him elected.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

To be clear, Mamdani's electoral game is strong. Framed around making New York affordable for everyone, Mamdani offers policies to address the cost-of-living crisis in the city. Chief among them is free universal child care that would allow residents to enroll their children in subsidized pre-K programs. This program, providing free schooling for children from 6 weeks to 5 years old, would also raise the wages of child care workers, who are notoriously underpaid.

Child care is just the beginning of the proposed reforms. Mamdani's platform includes secure funding for libraries and the city's municipal hospital system. It calls for a new “community safety” department to remove the burden of crisis intervention from the police. It promises free buses that run faster, a system of five city-owned grocery stores, to raise the minimum wage to $30 an hour in the next five years, to freeze the rent, and to enforce landlord regulations, among other necessary reforms. 

If Mamdani wins in November it will demonstrate that progressive Democrats, running within the party, can win elections based on popular working class reforms — that is, if they aren't thwarted by their own party leadership.

In the post-World War II period, this was a winning strategy. New York had a highly developed social welfare state, once considered the closest U.S. example of Scandinavian-style social democracy.

Between 1945 and 1975, New York had free public higher education and a free municipal hospital system, spent billions on public and cooperative housing, initiated rent control and job training programs, expanded welfare payments, and, famously, subsidized the transit fare, which stayed at just five cents for the first 40 years of the MTA's existence.

This “social welfare” economy of NYC came crashing down with a punch delivered by Wall Street in the 1970s. The 1975 fiscal crisis was the result of a collapsing municipal bond market and a severe economic depression. The city lost a whopping 500,000 manufacturing jobs between 1969 and 1975 as North American manufacturers moved plants out of cities and eventually out of the country. Both the depression and the market collapse were the result of actions by the “masters of the universe,” the Wall Street investors whose funds flowed to overseas investments rather than supporting domestic industry and the cities where they were rooted.

New York was caught in this neoliberal slurry. With a declining economy, it couldn't pay its bills. And with the municipal bond market in free fall, it couldn't get access to credit to help it bridge the down years. 

This is where Wall Street's punch came in. The punch was a “capital strike” in which major banks refused to issue New York City bonds until the municipal government cut social programs to the satisfaction of financiers. Welfare programs, public schools, drug treatment centers, senior centers, and even police and fire stations all got the axe. The City University of New York (CUNY) imposed tuition for the first time in its 130-year history. Sydenham hospital in Harlem was shuttered. By some estimates, as many as 60,000 municipal workers lost their jobs.

With NYC municipal bonds locked out of the credit markets, Gov. Hugh Carey and Mayor Abraham Beame turned to the federal government for short-term aid. But a new Republican president, Gerald Ford, and his phalanx of neoliberal economists — most prominently Alan Greenspan (chair of the Council of Economic Advisors) and others like Treasury Secretary William Simon and the infamous Donald Rumsfeld (then chief of staff) — refused the city bridge loans. In fact, at a closed-door White House meeting where the Ford administration debated funding New York, Rumsfeld urged the president to tell the city, “Not just ‘no,' but ‘hell no.'”

That attitude, to let the people of New York City dangle, or “drop dead” as suggested by a headline in the New York Daily News, was shared by the banks and the federal administration. So-called fiscal responsibility has been the bugaboo of social reform ever since.

In 2025, for Zohran Mamdani, these conditions remain largely unchanged — especially one: Wall Street's stranglehold on city finances. With private financing necessary for public programs, the private sector has the ultimate veto over social policy. It can simply close the purse.

For his part, Mamdani has promised to pay for these programs through tax increases at the state and city level. His programs will add an estimated $7 billion to the city's $116 billion annual budget. And he says he will pay for them through a series of progressive taxes that would increase income tax rates for those earning over $1 million a year and increase the state's corporate tax rate to match that of New Jersey — 11.5 percent.

Indeed, this is how city finances were managed through the golden age of post-war growth, imposing a municipal income tax in the late 1960s, as well as maintaining a stock transfer tax and other progressive business taxes.

To get his taxes, Mamdani will have to go through Albany. The Democratic governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, has promised to block any tax increase meant to fund social programs. New York businesses and bourgeoisie are also threatening not a capital strike, but capital flight — to leave the city if Mamdani is able to increase taxes. 

In short, the economic and political structures that brought an end to New York's experiments in social democracy in the 1970s are still in place. First, the structure of the federal system makes changes at the local level very difficult. With necessary changes to improve city finances having to pass through Albany or Washington, it can be virtually impossible to develop and finance the social welfare structures that working people desperately need in the city. This is even more difficult with neoliberal and far right politicians, Hochul and Trump, holding state and federal positions.

But there is a deeper problem. When public programs are financed through the private sector, banks hold the ultimate veto power. This is what happened in the fiscal crisis of 1975, when Wall Street locked the city out of the credit market and forced New York to make cuts to the satisfaction of the banking sector. And this had happened before, in 1933, at the height of the Great Depression, when the “bankers' agreement” closed credit markets on the city and forced austerity on municipal spending. This is the structural veto that Wall Street holds over our very democracy.

This is not to say that these obstacles are insurmountable, or that the hope of progressive reforms can never be achieved in the U.S., or at least in New York City. Indeed, Mamdani may be savvy enough, may have the popular support he needs, may benefit from an organized working population that can force through these reforms and the financing necessary to pay for them.

It is to say, however, that in a capitalist democracy, capital holds all the cards. Electing a single, lone, progressive politician is not enough to discipline the rich to pay for what all we need. That necessitates power. We would need mass movements that can threaten much bigger disruptions unless the rich capitulate. As we've seen with the Obama, Sanders, and other campaigns, translating an electoral coalition into a political force with popular power to govern is not always possible.

To do so would require amassing power outside of elected office, a power that can overcome the structural power of the banks and the investment class. Indeed, popular movements are always necessary to force elected officials, even ones as earnest as Zohran Mamdani, not to compromise on their promises. And there is indication that Mamdani may already be planning to do exactly that.

This kind of popular power is possible. After all, during the New Deal, the business class was chastened enough to allow the passage of major, humane, social reforms — to the benefit of working people. With the Trump administration's assaults on the New Deal “administrative state,” that cycle seems to have run its course. 

What comes next is anyone's guess, and if Mamdani is elected, his victory would bode well for what progressives can achieve. But his plans will get nowhere without disruptive popular movements forcing these changes on the rich. At best, this will get us a sort of new, new deal — but with an old deck. This is good, but not enough. Perhaps, with movement organization and institutions of popular power, we can get to a place where it's possible to imagine a new deck entirely, not just a new deal. And one day, we may be able to flip the table and drive the moneychangers from the people's temple altogether.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Canada isn't helping to repatriate refugee applicant Mahin Shahriar, a 28-year-old Bangladeshi man, his lawyer says

A refugee applicant living in Canada is trapped at a US immigration detention facility after he says he mistakenly crossed the border, but his lawyer says Canada isn't helping to bring him back.

Mahin Shahriar, 28, who came to Canada from Bangladesh in 2019, told the Canadian Press he accepted an invitation from a “friend” to visit a property near Montreal, which he now suspects was part of a broader human trafficking operation.

He says the alleged property was in a rural area and when he couldn't find it, he called the acquaintance for directions.

“Then I found myself in the US,” he said. “It was not my intention.” Shahriar approached immigration officials when he realized his mistake – and was subsequently detained.

But unlike recent harrowing stories in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials have blocked attempts to repatriate people to Canada, Shahriar's lawyer told the Guardian it is the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) hampering his client's return.

“It's not that CBSA isn't accepting him – it's that they won't even respond to us at all,” said immigration lawyer Washim Ahmed. The last time he received correspondence from the border agency was in July. “Quite simply, they have a legal obligation to bring him back.”

Ahmed says that, under the safe third country agreement, Canada is required to bring Shahriar back because he was detained by border officials within 14 days of illegally entering the US. Even if the CBSA did not invoke the agreement in this case, an exception could still apply, said Ahmed.

“If you have a family member in Canada that has legal status or is a refugee claimant – which he had – you are entitled to return. And so our position is either to apply the agreement or acknowledge the exception, but the end result is the same: he needs to come back.”

Ahmed has turned to the federal courts, requesting the courts compel a formal decision from CBSA in order to begin the process of a judicial review of the case, under the argument that CBSA is obliged to facilitate Shahriar's return.

He has also petitioned Canada's public safety minister, Gary Anandasangaree, for assistance in the “unique” case.

“In the past we've seen people from the US trying to enter Canada and border officials reject them, citing the safe third country agreement. We're now asking them to apply those same rules of the agreement to this case,” said Ahmed.

Canada's border services agency says as a broader policy, it does not comment on specific cases and does not intervene on behalf of foreign nationals subject to immigration enforcement in another country.

CBSA did say that anyone trying to enter Canada must appear at an official examination centre to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

But Ahmed said Ice will not bring Shahriar to an examination centre without prior approval from the CBSA. He says correspondence with Ice also suggests US officials have reached out to Canadian counterparts and faced resistance.

Complicating Shahriar's case is a failed refugee application in Canada. He arrived to the country in 2019 as a student and fell victim to a fraudulent immigration consultant who portrayed himself as a qualified lawyer. A fraudulent claim was made on his behalf and rejected.

Under Canadian law, Shahriar is eligible to apply for pre-removal risk assessment because his failed claim was made more than a year ago. As part of the assessment, officials check whether claimants would face persecution if deported to their home country. If they face substantial risk, they can remain in Canada.

“Ice has looked at his case and concluded he would face risks in Bangladesh, so they won't send him there,” said Ahmed. “And so we want to apply for pre-removal risk assessment because we're confident Canadian officials will see the dangers he will face if he was ever sent back.”

While staying in Canada without legal status, Shahriar managed to bring his mother and sister to the country and Ahmed was able to prepare a successful claim on behalf of Shahriar's mother.

Shahriar's mother, who has permanent residency in Canada, has been hospitalized on numerous occasions for severe mental health issues compounded by her son's detention.

“My client is in arbitrary detention. He didn't commit any crime. He didn't steal anything, didn't harm anyone or cause trouble. And it's been like this for nearly half a year,” said Ahmed, calling the case a “profoundly disappointing” situation. “He doesn't know where he's going. He can't be deported to Bangladesh. He needs to go back to Canada. And so we're asking Canadian officials to do what's right – but also what they're legally obliged to do.”

Prince Andrew insisted Virginia Giuffre sign a gag order so that he would not embarrass Elizabeth II during her Platinum Jubilee.

Details of the legal battle and eventual agreement are revealed in Giuffre's posthumous memoir, which will be published next week.

The book's claims will heap further embarrassment on the Prince who was forced to relinquish his Dukedom on Friday to avoid inflicting further damage on the Royal family.

It describes how Prince Andrew's disastrous Newsnight interview provided ammunition for her civil suit.

The Prince reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre on Feb 15 2022.

Giuffre claimed she was sexually abused or raped by Prince Andrew on three separate occasions when she was 17. She sued him for unspecified damages.

The Prince denied all the allegations and the settlement included no admission of guilt, but Giuffre said his acknowledgement of the abuse suffered by Epstein's victims brought tears to her eyes.

“I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the Prince because it ensured that his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,” she wrote.

The Prince was reportedly intent on clearing his name, even as headlines about the case threatened to overshadow his mother's big year.

The settlement meant Giuffre was silenced, barred from discussing the abuse she suffered at the hands of Epstein, throughout the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022.

Giuffre finished writing Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice in October last year. She took her own life six months later.

Her book describes how she was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell to work for Epstein at the age of 16.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year jail sentence for procuring underage girls for Epstein.

Epstein was arrested in 2019 and charged with running a sex trafficking network involving dozens of underage girls at his homes in New York and Palm Beach, Florida.

He died by suicide before he could face trial.

The book sets out Giuffre's allegations that she was trafficked to a string of rich and powerful men.

She describes her astonishment that Prince Andrew was photographed in public with the financier in 2010, after he served a sentence for sex crimes, including procuring a child for prostitution.

And it details her legal battle with the Prince after suing him for unspecified damages in 2021.

Her case, she said, built on some of the claims he made in his 2019 Newsnight interview when he said he did not remember ever meeting Giuffre.

The interview was a public relations disaster for the member of the Royal family.

The Prince said he was with one of his daughters at the Woking branch of Pizza Express on the night Giuffre claimed to have first been trafficked to him, and that he could not have been seen dancing sweatily with her at a nightclub because he had temporarily lost the ability to perspire because of an “overdose of adrenaline” during his service during the Falklands War.

“As devastating as this interview was for Prince Andrew, for my legal team it was like an injection of jet fuel,” Giuffre wrote.

“Its contents would not only help us build an ironclad case against the Prince but also open the door to potentially subpoenaing his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.”

“The world didn't know it, but settlement discussions with Prince Andrew's team were suddenly moving quickly,” she wrote.

“After he'd stonewalled us for months, the scheduling of his deposition, which was to take place on March 10, seemed to motivate him.”

In January of that year, Buckingham Palace announced it had stripped Prince Andrew of all military titles and patronages.

A month later the settlement was announced. It reportedly included a $12m payout along with a $2m donation to her charity.

“But I'd gotten more out of him than that: An acknowledgement that I and many other women had been victimised and a tacit pledge to never deny it again,” she wrote.

Her memoir details each of her three alleged encounters with the Prince and her shock at seeing a photograph of him years later strolling through Central Park together.

“I was of course revolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll,” writes Giuffre, who finished the book six months before she took her own life in Australia, aged 41.

“But mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein.”

She said it was one thing for the rich and powerful to associate with Epstein before he admitted sex crimes in 2008.

“But by 2011, everyone knew that Epstein – though he'd gotten off with a light sentence – was a convicted sex offender,” she wrote.

“Seeing this new photo of Prince Andrew at Epstein's side made ‘Randy Andy' seem even more arrogant to me.”

Editor's note: This is a developing story. 

A Latin American citizen was fatally stabbed after a dispute in the western Ukrainian city of Ternopil, local police said. 

The victim, a 35-year-old man, was stabbed by his 25-year-old acquaintance, also a man and a citizen of a Latin American country, according to a Ternopil Police statement. The statement does not specify which countries the men are from. 

Police received a report at around 4:30 a.m. about a dispute at a gas station in the village of Velyki Hai, a suburb of Ternopil. Paramedics attempted to resuscitate the man, but he died from his injuries. 

CCTV footage shows the suspect stabbing the victim multiple times. Police said the attack followed a domestic dispute between the men. 

The attacker faces up to 15 years in prison.

Bernie Sanders to headline rally in Washington DC as other Democratic officials lend support

What to know about the anti-Trump protests attracting millions

Millions are expected to show out for protests on Saturday at more than 2,500 locations across America, from small towns to large cities, to speak against the Trump administration.

No Kings, the coalition behind a mass demonstration in June, is again calling people to the streets to send the simple message that Donald Trump is not a king, pushing back against what they see as increasing authoritarianism.

Several US cities now have a militarised presence on the ground, most against the will of local leaders. Trump has promised to crack down on dissent as part of an ongoing retribution campaign. Still, organisers say they expect to see one of the largest, if not the largest, single day of protest in US history.

What are the No Kings protests?

A coalition of left-leaning groups is again leading a day of mass demonstrations across the US to protest against the Trump administration. The coalition spearheaded a previous No Kings protest day in June, drawing millions to the streets to speak out against the president on the same day Trump held a military parade in Washington.

The protests are called No Kings to underscore that America does not have kinds of absolute rulers, a ding against Trump's increasing authoritarianism.

“‘NO KINGS' is more than just a slogan; it is the foundation our nation was built upon,” a website for the protests, nokings.org, says. “Born in the streets, shouted by millions, carried on posters and chants, it echoes from city blocks to rural town squares, uniting people across this country to fight dictatorship together.”

Where are they happening?

Organisers say there are more than 2,500 protests planned across the country, in the largest cities and in small towns, and in all 50 states. It is part of a distributed model where people protest in their own communities rather than travelling to large urban hubs to show that discontent with Trump exists in all corners of the US.

For the 18 October day of action, organisers have identified several anchor cities: Washington DC; San Francisco; San Diego; Atlanta; New York City; Houston, Texas; Honolulu; Boston; Kansas City, Missouri; Bozeman, Montana; Chicago and New Orleans.

The protests start at different times depending on location. The No Kings website has a map with details for each location.

Read more about who organised the protests, why organisers are asking protesters to wear yellow, what Trump has said about them and more in our Q&A here:

Connecticut senator Chris Murphy called Donald Trump the “most corrupt president in the history of America” at a “No Kings” rally in Washington DC.

The senator addressed the government shutdown, describing it as an “unplanned vacation” that Republicans have been on from the nation's capital for five weeks, he said.

“Trump does think that he's a king and he thinks he can act more corruptly when the government is shut down. But he cannot. He doesn't have new powers, extra powers during the shutdown,” Murphy said.

He added: “The truth is that he is enacting a detailed step-by-step plan to try to destroy all of the things that protect our democracy: free speech, fair elections, and independent press, the right to peacefully protest. But the truth is he has not won yet. The people still rule in this country.”

Crowds are also gathering by the thousands in Washington DC, where senator Bernie Sanders will headline today's rally.

In Northern Virginia, many protesters were seen walking on overpasses across roads heading into DC, and several hundred people gathered in the circle near Arlington National Cemetery, near where Trump is considering building an arch across the bridge from the Lincoln Memorial, Reuters reported.

Senator Raphael Warnock also decried masked Ice agents

“Showing up in communities all across our country--imagine this--agents of the government flying in Blackhawk helicopters into Chicago, rappelling down an apartment building in the middle of an American city. Literally separating Black people from brown people. I'm a preacher, but I have to say this. What the hell is happening? And all of us have to be concerned.”

Warnock said he would stand firm on the shutdown of the federal government until the threat of skyrocketing premiums created by the One Big Beautiful Bill are abated. He railed against CDC firings and political interference with healthcare.

“The CDC is not a hazard to our health. Robert F Kennedy is a hazard to the health of the American people and its doctors.”

Warnock described redistricting efforts by Republicans as gerrymandering, “by trying to squeeze your voices out of the democracy. There's a world for that. It's called fascism. ... And if they convince you that they have already won, then you lose your fight. But you must never lose your fight. You must never lose your courage. You must never give up your voice. Because your voice is your human dignity and your human dignity is connected to you.”

“If this budget were an EKG, it would suggest that our elected representatives have a heart problem and are in need of moral surgery. ... I'm saying to you that when you show up on a Saturday morning like this, let me tell you what you're doing, you are the moral surgeons in America who are trying to heal our country.”

Describing the gathered crowd at the Atlanta Civic Center as “moral surgeons” for our democracy, Senator Rev Raphael Warnock lambasted Trump's comments to military leaders calling Democrats “the enemy within.”

“As the pastor of Doctor King's church, Ebenezer Baptist Church, Dr King said we will have to repent in this generation, not only for the violent actions and vitriolic words of the bad people, but because of the appalling silence and indifference of the good people.”

“I heard an American president stand up the other day and say to generals, in our military that we've got to stand up, he said, against the enemy within. Listen to me. I don't I don't care what your politics are today. I mean that. If you are an American citizen, you should be deeply concerned. And I know you are. That's why you're gathered here today. We should all be deeply concerned about an American president who stood in front of our military and said that the real concern is the enemy within.”

Crowds are still increasing, but at least 10,000 people have filled the field of the Atlanta Civic Center in preparation for a march to the Georgia capital. Permitting was a question up until a day before the march, but Atlanta's mayor, Andre Dickens, gave his assent.

“I love all the American flags. You know why? Because we love America,” said Andrea Young, executive director of the Georgia ACLU as speakers began addressing the crowd. “We are here to say we love America too much to give it over to a wannabe king.

We are governed by laws, by a constitution, a Bill of Rights, and we are here to say no kings. We say no one is above the law. And no one is below the law.”

People are gathering in Times Square in New York City by the thousands for No Kings day as protests kick off on the east coast.

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders will headline the Washington DC No Kings rally near the US Capitol building in what is anticipated to be the largest grassroots mobilization since Trump returned to office.

“I am looking forward to joining millions of Americans across the country at a ‘No Kings' rally tomorrow. I'll be speaking here in Washington, DC. I hope to see you there,” Sanders wrote on social media.

In an accompanying video, he added: “People fought and died throughout the history of this country to preserve our democracy. We're not going to let Trump or anybody else take it away.”

Democratic officials across the US have posted in support of the No Kings protests.

The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, wrote on Saturday morning in a social media post: “Do not let Donald Trump and Republicans intimidate you into silence. That's what they want to do. They're afraid of the truth. Speak out, use your voice, and exercise your right to free speech.”

California's governor, Gavin Newsom, wrote: “I urge our nation to use this weekend's No Kings marches as a declaration of independence against the tyranny and lawlessness currently running this country. Use your voice. ACT PEACEFULLY. Protect yourself and your community. THERE ARE NO KINGS IN THE UNITED STATES.”

Former vice-president Kamala Harris said in a video posted to social media: “In our country, the power is with the people, and tomorrow I encourage everyone to get out there in peaceful protest of what is happening in our country and express our voice around the country we believe in.”

“They have a ‘Hate America' rally that's scheduled for October 18 on the National Mall,” the House speaker, Mike Johnson, said on Fox News on Friday. “It's all the pro-Hamas wing and, you know, the antifa people. They're all coming out.”

The Republican Minnesota congressman Tom Emmer said the party's “terrorist wing” was holding the “Hate America” rally. “Democrats want to keep the government shut down to show all those people that are going to come here and express their hatred towards this country that they're fighting President Trump,” said the House majority leader, Steve Scalise. The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, embellished the story on Fox, referring to the demonstrations' “paid protesters” and adding: “It begs the question who's funding it.”

These people are, of course, slandering the second round of No Kings marches, following those on 14 June, which dwarfed Trump's pitiful birthday party military parade. This time the events – more than 2,500 of them, according to organizers, planned for every state – promise to be even larger.

Trump's allies are trying to overwrite the patriotic, historically resonant words “No Kings” with insinuations of treasonous violence.

Everyone participating in the protests must prove them wrong. Nonviolence, both rigorously disciplined and open-hearted, must define 18 October.

Donald Trump told Fox News, “I'm not a king,” as millions across the US were expected to march against his second presidency, uniting behind a message that the nation should halt its slide toward authoritarianism -- and that kings should not rule the country.

“A king! This is not an act,” Trump said in a preview clip of an interview scheduled for the upcoming edition of Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures. “You know – they're referring to me as a king. ‘I'm not a king.”

Saturday's planned No Kings demonstrations build on massive protests in June. Events are scheduled in more than 2,700 locations, ranging from small towns to large cities, among them some who have sued the Trump administrations over its actions targeting them.

Allies of Trump have derisively referred to the demonstrations as “Hate America” events. The gatherings were planned as Trump has sent in federal troops in certain cities to either support immigration agents seeking to deport as many people as possible or to ostensibly fight crime, even though at least some of those communities had been reporting steep reductions in violence.

Ahead of the huge No Kings protests expected across all 50 states of the US on Saturday, several protests in solidarity have popped up across Europe.

In Berlin, Germany:

In Madrid, Spain:

In Rome, Italy:

Republican governors in several US states have placed National Guard troops on standby in preparation for a nationwide protest to oppose Donald Trump and his policies.

Governors in Texas and Virginia have activated their state's National Guard troops, although it is unclear how visible the military presence will be.

Donald Trump has cracked down on US cities, attempting to send in federal troops and adding more immigration agents. He is seeking to criminalize dissent, going after left-leaning organizations that he claims are supporting terrorism or political violence. Cities have largely fought back, suing to prevent national guard infusions, and residents have taken to the streets to speak out against the militarization of their communities.

Trump's allies have sought to cast the No Kings protests as anti-American and led by antifa, the decentralized anti-fascist movement, while also claiming that the protests are prolonging the government shutdown.

Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, has said he will send the state's national guard to Austin, the state's capital, in advance of the protests. He said the troops would be needed due to the “planned antifa-linked demonstration”.

Democrats denounced the move, including the state's top Democrat Gene Wu, who argued: “Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do – and Greg Abbott just proved he's one of them.”

Recovery from a recent surgery for colon cancer will not stop James Phipps, 75, from attending Saturday's No Kings demonstration in Chicago, Illinois. “I have a burning desire to be a part of the protest.” he said, “because that's all I've done all my life.”

Phipps, born in Marks, Mississippi, was involved in the civil rights movement in the 1960s from the age of 13, when he was part of racially integrating his local high school and organising with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. At 15, he became involved in the Mississippi Freedom Labor Union (MFLU), which organised sharecroppers for better wages.

At the time, the MFLU was organising cotton pickers. “They were paid 30 cents an hour, working in the hot sun, 10 hours a day, which was $3, two and half cents per pound of cotton,” said Phipps. “It broke their necks, backs, pelvis and knees.”

“They had no medical care,” he added. “That's one of the key things in my mind right now.”

Still, this Saturday, even in cities with troops on the ground, millions of people are expected to march against the president as part of a second “No Kings” protest. The last No Kings protest in June drew several million people across more than 2,000 locations. This time, more than 2,500 cities and towns nationwide are hosting protests.

Hello and welcome to the Guardian's coverage of the protests due to take place across the country on Saturday, dubbed ‘No Kings' in protest at the Trump administration.

Leaders of the movement estimated during a press conference on Thursday that there will be more than 2,500 demonstrations throughout the US. “We do not expect there to be any need for the National Guard to be deployed, but if the Trump administration attempts to do that as a way to intimidate peaceful protests, we are prepared for that,” they added.

Leaders of the coalition also said that they don't anticipate anything other than a peaceful protest, and don't currently have any information that would suggest any outside agitator groups are planning to disrupt the coordinated demonstrations.

Millions of people turned out for similar protests on Saturday 14 June as Donald Trump held a military parade in the streets of Washington DC.

The protests took place at about 2,100 sites nationwide, from big cities to small towns. A coalition of more than 100 groups joined together to plan the protests, which are committed to a principle of nonviolence.

No Kings organizers estimated the day's events drew millions of people, in all 50 states and to some cities abroad. These included more than 200,000 in New York and over 100,000 in Philadelphia, plus some small towns with sizable crowds for their populations, including the town of Pentwater, Michigan, which saw 400 people join the protest in their 800-person town, the No Kings coalition said.

The protests were largely peaceful, though some – in Los Angeles and Portland – were later deemed unlawful assembly by law enforcement and met with teargas.

The tenor of the day was also marked by political violence. There were two early morning shootings of two Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, one of whom was killed along with her husband, in what local officials called a politically motivated attack. The state's police and governor cautioned people to not attend demonstrations across the state “out of an abundance of caution”.

Earlier this week, Robert De Niro urged Americans to “stand up and be counted” in the protests, characterising Trump as an aspiring tyrant who aims to end American democracy.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to obtain Tomahawk missiles for strikes on Russia from a meeting with Donald Trump on Friday, with the US president later calling for both sides to cease fighting and accept current battle lines.
    


            Zelensky had traveled to Washington hoping to receive the long-range cruise missiles, which he believes could deliver a decisive blow to the Kremlin's war economy by enabling targeted strikes on oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia.
    


            However, during opening remarks at a White House working lunch, Trump expressed hopes to resolve the war “without thinking about Tomahawks,” adding that the weapon is one America “needs.”
    


            And Zelensky appeared to come away empty-handed, describing the meeting as “productive” but declining to comment further on Tomahawks because the US “doesn't want escalation.”
    


            Hours later, Trump made a public call for Kyiv and Moscow to “stop the war immediately.”
    


            “You go by the battle line, wherever it is. Otherwise, it's too complicated. You'll never be able to figure it out. You stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters upon landing in West Palm Beach, Florida.
    


            “And both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing. And that should be it,” he added, saying that he'd communicated that sentiment to both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            The meeting came a day after Trump spoke on the phone with Putin and agreed to meet him soon in Hungary.
    


            During that call, Putin is said to have stressed that Tomahawks – which have the range to target major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield. But they would damage the US-Russian relationship, he argued.
    


            Tomahawk missiles have a significantly longer range than any others in Ukraine's current armory.
    


            Although Trump has tempered discussions regarding their delivery, he has not definitely ruled it out.
    


            Ahead of Friday's White House meeting, Zelensky appeared to suggest a trade of Ukrainian drones for US Tomahawks.
    


            “Ukraine has thousands of our production drones but we don't have Tomahawks,” he said.
    


            “They (US) can have our thousands of drones, that's where we can work together.”
    


            Zelensky briefed European leaders virtually following his meeting with Trump. The leaders reiterated their “unwavering commitment to Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression.”
    


            Speaking to reporters, the Ukrainian leader reaffirmed his trust in Trump wanting to finish the war, adding “it was also difficult to manage the situation in the Middle East, and the president was successful in it.”
    


            On Friday, Trump stopped short of offering a view on whether Ukraine would need to cede territory as part of a peace settlement with Russia.
    


            Trump has taken divergent stances on the issue.
    


            Ahead of his meeting with Putin in August, he said “land swaps” would be necessary for the war to end.
    


            Later, he changed his mind, saying he believed Ukraine could win back all the territory now occupied by Russia.
    


            In comments Friday, Trump did allow for the possibility that Putin may be stringing him along in a bid to gain time to complete his war aims in Ukraine, but concluded: “I think that he wants to make a deal.”
    


            “You know, I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,” he added.

NEW YORK, October 18. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump will keep working on a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.

According to her, Trump "works around the clock in the pursuit of peace, and he will continue to do that with respect to Russia and Ukraine, just like he has with Israel and Gaza. <...> It's a new dawn in the Middle East, and we hope that can be true as well, with Russia and Ukraine, and the president is working very hard on that."

Leavitt pointed out that in his October 16 phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the October 17 meeting with Vladimir Zelensky, Trump made it clear that "this has been going on for far too long," and that US patience "is growing very thin."

Earlier, Trump wrote on the Truth Social platform that he had called on Zelensky to make a deal to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.

            It's once again Sho-time in the World Series.
    


            The Los Angeles Dodgers will have a chance to defend their World Series title in this year's Fall Classic after a Game 4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers, clinching a four-game sweep in the National League Championship Series. The Dodgers were led by their otherworldly star, Shohei Ohtani, who hit three home runs, struck out 10 batters and got the win for the Dodgers.
    


            It was one of the greatest individual performances in the history of the game, let alone on a stage of this magnitude. Ohtani, the Japanese two-way star who has been breaking boundaries since he joined the league, looked sterling in a six-inning, shutout performance.
    


            And then when he walked to the plate to do something no other player does in Major League Baseball these days – hitting while being a starting pitcher – Ohtani helped himself out. He hit home runs in the first, fourth and seventh innings, with the last one sending his teammates into hysterics.
    


            According to MLB statistician Sarah Langs, Ohtani became the first player in league history to hit three home runs and strike out at least one batter, let alone 10. Per the TNT Sports broadcast, Ohtani became the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit a leadoff home run in the regular season or the playoffs, and the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game.
    


            All of those incredible superlatives come with one other amazing fact, given that starting pitchers usually thrive on a regular five-day schedule for starts: It was the first time Ohtani had pitched in 13 days.
    


            He was, quite obviously, named the NLCS MVP for his performance.
    


            “It was really fun on both sides of ball today,” Ohtani said via his translator while holding the NLCS MVP trophy. “As a representative, I am taking this trophy and let's get four more wins.”
    


            Far from the home runs that baseball fans are used to seeing from pitchers, Ohtani's blasts were absolutely majestic. He led off the game for the Dodgers with a 427-foot blast, hit a gigantic 469-foot homer in the fourth and topped it off with another mega 446-foot blast in the seventh.
    


            “We won it as a team and this is really a team effort so I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world can enjoy a really good sake,” Ohtani added.
    


            It's the fifth time in the last nine seasons that the Dodgers have won the National League pennant, the 26th trip to the World Series in their history.
    


            “Oh my God. I'm still speechless,” Dodger first baseman Freddie Freeman said of his teammate's performance in an interview with the TNT broadcast after the game.
    


            “Sometimes you have to check him and make sure he's not made of steel when he does something like that. Absolutely incredible. The biggest stage and he goes and does something like that. It'll probably be remembered as the Shohei Ohtani Game.”
    


            Ohtani's game drew the admiration from another Dodgers star, Clayton Kershaw.
    


            “We all know about Shohei but until you play with him and you see him, it's just a different level,” said Kershaw, the team's future hall of famer who is coming out of the bullpen in the playoffs.
    


            With the Seattle Mariners taking a 3-2 lead in the American League Championship Series over the Toronto Blue Jays earlier in the night, the Dodgers will have to wait to find out who their opponent will be in the Fall Classic.
    


            But whoever the American League champion is will be facing a buzzsaw.
    


            The Dodgers have lost just one game in this postseason and their pitching hasn't allowed more than one run per game since a loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Divisional Series more than a week ago. Starters Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Ohtani make up one of the most formidable playoff rotations in recent memory and their lineup with Ohtani at the top followed by stars like Mookie Betts, Freeman, Teoscar Hernandez and a slew of others.
    


            “Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,” manager Dave Roberts said to an applauding crowd on hand at Dodger Stadium. “Let's get four more wins and really ruin baseball.”
    


            No team has repeated as World Series champions since the New York Yankees dynasty of the last 1990s and early 2000s won three straight titles between 1998 and 2000. The Dodgers are the first team to even make it back to the World Series the year after winning it since the Phillies did it in the late 2000s.
    


            Kershaw is one of the few players still in the league who was playing when the Phillies made that run. He's on his last go-round now, retiring after the season and is relishing the opportunity to make history.
    


            “Just to be a part of this team … I'm so happy to be a part of it. This group of guys is awesome, we have a blast and we're playing so good. It's just awesome. Whether I get to pitch or not, I'm just glad I get to be a part of it. It's so fun.”

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the White House on Oct. 17 for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, amid growing speculation that Washington could authorize the delivery of Tomahawk long-range missiles to Ukraine. 

The two leaders fielded questions from reporters during a bilateral lunch before holding closed-door talks for over two hours. 

Before meeting with Zelensky privately, Trump said he hoped Tomahawk missiles won't be needed in peace efforts — though he did not rule out supplying the long-range weapons to Ukraine. 

"You know, we need Tomahawks and we need a lot of other weapons that we're sending to Ukraine... Hopefully, we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks," he said.

Zelensky announced in a briefing after the meeting that he and Trump discussed the provision of long-range weapons, but agreed not to comment publicly on the matter at this time. He said securing a ceasefire was the top priority and that Ukraine is counting on Trump's "pressure on Putin to stop this war."

Axios, citing Ukrainian sources familiar with the discussions, reported that the two-and-a-half hour meeting was tense, at times getting "emotional."

"Nobody shouted, but Trump was tough," one source described the meeting to Axios.

In a post on Truth Social after his meeting with Zelensky, Trump said "it is time to stop the killing, and make a deal." He later told reporters he wanted Ukraine and Russia to freeze the war along the current battle lines. 

The meeting — the sixth since Trump's return to office — comes one day after Trump's phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and their announcement of a planned summit in Hungary.

Following his session with Trump, Zelensky held a conference call with several European leaders, including NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. 

Zelensky and Trump offered praise for each other's leadership at the start of their joint briefing. 

Trump even complimented Zelensky's jacket — a pointed reference to their disastrous Oval Office meeting in February, where one of Trump's complaints was Zelensky's lack of suit.

"(Zelensky) looks beautiful in his jacket," Trump said on Oct. 17. "I hope people notice ... it's actually very stylish."

The U.S. president also spoke highly of Zelensky's character and their positive relationship. 

"It's an honor to be with a very strong leader, a man who has been through a lot, and a man who I've gotten to know very well, and we've gotten along really very well," Trump told reporters.

Zelensky expressed cautious optimism about the prospects for ending Russia's war against Ukraine, emphasizing both the urgency of peace and Ukraine's recent battlefield successes.

"We understand that Putin is not ready. I think (he's) not ready, but I'm confident that with your help, we can stop this war," Zelensky said. "We see that they don't have successful steps on the battlefield, and it's good. I think that their army is weak now, and a lot of losses there."

Going into the meeting with Trump, the Ukrainian delegation hoped the U.S. was prepared for more decisive action against Russia. After speaking with Zelensky in New York on Sept. 23, Trump said Ukraine, with European support, can reclaim all Russian-occupied territories — a remark that fueled speculation about a shift in U.S. policy. 

Zelensky then said he held what he called "productive" phone calls with Trump on Oct. 11 and 12, focusing on air defenses and long-range strike capabilities. Trump said on Oct. 15 that Ukraine wants to "go offensive," without providing details, and that he would decide whether to approve such a plan after meeting Zelensky in Washington.

After their talks on Oct. 17,  Zelensky said the conversation with Trump was "productive" while Trump described it as "interesting" and "cordial." Despite the leaders' warm tone, the meeting ended with no concrete promises. 

Trump did not commit to Tomahawks for Ukraine, telling reporters ahead of the closed-door meeting that the U.S. needs to maintain its own supply of the missiles. But he also signaled openness to a weapons deal with Kyiv that could involve U.S.-made missiles and Ukrainian drones. 

Zelensky suggested that Washington's provision of Tomahawks could be part of a mutually beneficial defense partnership, in which Kyiv could help the U.S. gain an edge in drone technology. 

"If you want to target a military goal, you need thousands of drones," Zelensky said. 

"It goes together with such missiles (as Tomahawks). ... United States has Tomahawks and other missiles, very strong missiles, but they can have our thousands of drones. That's where we can work together." 

Trump said he was open to a weapons deal with Ukraine. 

"They make a very good drone," he said.

Before traveling to the U.S., Zelensky said that part of the agenda for the trip included talks on Kyiv's so-called "Mega Deal" — a major agreement on the purchase of American weapons — and a "Drone Deal," a plan to sell Ukrainian unmanned systems to the U.S. The deal was initially earmarked to be worth up to $90 billion.

Kyiv has repeatedly stressed the need to reinforce its ability to target Russian military sites and energy infrastructure with long-range weapons, aiming to increase the economic costs of Moscow's war while strengthening its own air defense network against Russian strikes on Ukraine's power grid.

The potential delivery of Tomahawks, which can strike targets between 1,600 and 2,500 kilometers (1,000–1,600 miles) away, would dramatically alter Ukraine's long-range strike capability. 

Zelensky reportedly showed Trump a map of possible targets to hit inside Russia during their White House meeting, a member of the Ukrainian delegation told the Agence France-Presse. 

Russia has responded to the threat of Tomahawks with dire warnings and saber-rattling — a tactic that appears to make an impact on Trump. 

The Kremlin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, said that the Putin directly raised the matter during his recent phone call with Trump. 

"Vladimir Putin reiterated his point that Tomahawks would not change the situation on the battlefield but would cause significant harm to relations between (Russia and the U.S.)," he said.

Putin has warned that transferring Tomahawks to Kyiv would represent a "qualitatively new stage of escalation."

Trump himself parroted this point during his Oct. 17 meeting with Zelensky. 

"They're a very powerful weapon, but they're a very dangerous weapon," he told reporters in their briefing. "And it could mean big, you know, escalation. It could mean lot of bad things can happen. Tomahawks are a big deal." 

Zelensky told reporters after the meeting that he discussed Tomahawk missiles with Trump, but would not comment on the details of those talks. 

"We spoke about also about long-range (missiles) of course. And I want not to make statements about it. We decided that we don't speak about it because ... United States doesn't want escalation," Zelensky said. 

Asked whether he was more or less optimistic about Ukraine getting Tomahawks after speaking with Trump, Zelensky said he was "realistic." 

While Zelensky told reporters outright that Putin was "scared of Tomahawks," Trump did not credit the threat of Tomahawk missiles for bringing Putin back to the negotiating table. 

"I don't know what's bringing him — I think he wants to make a deal, that's all," Trump said. "I can't tell you what's bringing him." 

Trump, who has been hesitant to impose any material consequences on Russia in his push for a peace deal, claimed that both Zelensky and Putin were ready to end the war — but personal animosty between the leaders has delayed the process. 

"I think President Zelensky wants it done and I think President Putin wants it done," said. 

"Now all they have to do is get along a little bit." 

Trump's comments on Truth Social after the meeting were also directed at Zelensky and Putin, urging both leaders to "stop the killing." Instead of threatening Russia with consequences for prolonging and escalating the war, he called for Kyiv and Moscow to "stop where they are." 

"They should stop where they are. Let both claim victory, let history decide! No more shooting, no more death, no more vast and unsustainable sums of money spent," he wrote. 

In remarks to reporters later that evening, Trump reiterated his call for an immediate end to the war and said Ukraine and Russia should stop the fighting along the current line of contact. 

"In my opinion, they should stop the war immediately. You go by the battle line, wherever it is, otherwise it's too complicated, you'll never be able to figure it out," he said. 

"You stop at the battle line, and both sides should go home, go to their families,  stop the killing, and that should be it. Stop right now at the battle line. I told that to President Zelensky, I told it to President Putin."

Russia currently occupies around one-fifth of Ukrainian territory. 

Trump's planned summit with Putin in Budapest would be the second meeting between U.S. and Russian leaders since 2022, raising questions in Kyiv and Europe about how Trump's diplomacy could alter the course of the war.

The U.S. president said the meeting with Putin would "most likely be a double one."

"It'll be a double meeting, but we will have the president, Zelensky, in touch. There's a lot of bad blood between the two presidents," the U.S. president added, without elaborating.

A source at the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky's team was not aware of any plans for a call between Putin and Trump ahead of the White House meeting.

"(Trump's) entire tactic is to end the war. So the main thing is that the tactic works," the source said.

Sources familiar with the Trump-Putin call told CNN that during the conversation, the U.S. president did not rule out the possibility of sending the requested missiles to Ukraine.

Trump and Putin last spoke on Aug. 18, after Trump's meetings with Zelensky and European leaders. The U.S. president said he was arranging a meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. 

By inviting Zelensky to meet in Moscow, Putin effectively declined direct talks with the Ukrainian leader. Zelensky has repeatedly said he is willing to meet Putin on neutral ground. In his press conference after the White House meeting, he said he was ready to hold talks in a bilateral or trilateral format. 

Trump and Putin also met in Alaska on Aug. 15 to discuss prospects for a peace settlement and bilateral cooperation — their first meeting since Trump returned to office in January. Despite the talks, no progress has been made toward ending the war.

Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that the Alaska summit convinced Putin he could intensify air strikes on Ukraine without facing major pushback from Washington. 

Since then, Russia has increased its attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, and various drone sightings have been reported throughout Europe, with some officials indicating these might be Russian provocations.

As the meeting ended in Washington, air raid alarms once again sounded throughout Ukraine in response to waves of Russian drones. Explosions have been reported in multiple cities, including Cherkasy, Poltava, and Kharkiv, at the time of publication.

HONOLULU (AP) — Jason Momoa drove a vintage pickup along a winding country road in Hawaii, a tattooed arm dangling out the window and Metallica blasting.

“POO'-ah-LEE',” he said. 

His passenger corrected him, again, modeling the subtle emphasis on the “u” sound: “Puali.”

Momoa was preparing for his role in “Chief of War,” the first major TV series featuring the language and culture of Hawaii's Indigenous people. His passenger, Kahoʻokahi Kanuha, connected with Momoa years ago while they were both protesting against a giant telescope on a mountain summit held sacred by some Native Hawaiians. He wound up living with the Hawaiian Hollywood superstar for nearly a year as his personal language coach.

The word they kept working on during the drive can mean “warrior” or “army.” It was one of many to get right. 

Like many Native Hawaiians in Hawaii and elsewhere, Momoa didn't grow up speaking Hawaiian. Most of the other actors in the series also aren't fluent. They worked with coaches like Kanuha to pronounce the vowel-laden sounds. Kanuha was at Momoa's side 24/7, with a binder in hand of the actor's lines to practice any chance they had — while driving, eating, working out. 

“My objective was to be able to get him to say his lines, deliver his lines in a way that wasn't distracting to the viewer,” Kanuha said. 

The final product of the Apple TV series that premiered in August isn't perfect, Kanuha and other Hawaiian language experts say, but it's a successful global-scale contribution to revitalizing and normalizing a language that has endured erasure attempts amid colonization. They say it's too early to quantify but that it can only help spark interest, especially among young Hawaiians who now have a mainstream representation of their language and culture. 

While the first two episodes are mostly in Hawaiian, the language is spoken less as the series progresses from 18th-century Hawaiian society before contact with Europeans to Momoa's character traveling beyond Hawaii. 

“This is a moment where we're showcasing our people, our language on a scale that says, we're here ... we are amazing and our language is beautiful and thriving,” said Moses Goods, an actor in the series who said he “grew up largely without the language.” Hawaiian was his mother's first language, but her parents forbade her from speaking it as a child, he said. 

An 1896 law, a few years after the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom by American business owners, dictated English as the medium of education, said Kaʻiuokalani Damas, an assistant professor in Hawaiian language at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. 

That resulted in a systemic devaluing of Hawaiian and forbidding children from speaking it, Damas said. 

“We have lots of stories of students being beaten or made to haul boulders and rocks from one side of the school to the other,” he said. “Writing on the blackboard 500 times, ‘I will not speak Hawaiian.' ”

By 1940, native speakers were rare. Revitalization efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to restore Hawaiian as the medium of education resulted in immersion schools. It's difficult to count how many are fluent today, Damas said, noting that recent Census data showing more than 30,000 speakers includes a wide range of proficiency. 

Momoa's language coach started learning Hawaiian as a second language in 1994 at an immersion preschool. 

“It's not a language that my parents or my family spoke,” Kanuha said. “And so I learned as a kid that going through these programs ... can sometimes be a very lonely journey.”

Now 36, Hawaiian is his primary language and the first language of his two young sons.

As a family, it can feel like they live in a Hawaiian bubble until they leave home and everything is mostly in English, he said. With the show, his children can enjoy entertainment in Hawaiian — when they're not closing their eyes during violent battle scenes. 

“How ironic that being Hawaiian — in Hawaii — speaking Hawaiian makes you feel lonely,” Kanuha said. “I think this helps to kind of start to reverse that a little bit.” 

Before acting in the show, New Zealand-born actor Luciane Buchanan said she had barely heard Hawaiian spoken. Her mother is from the Polynesian country Tonga and her father is of Scottish descent. 

“I'm not going to lie, it freaked me out because I wanted to do it, but I only speak English,” she said. “I'm Tongan, but don't speak Tongan, so I understand that kind of language trauma that I can empathize with the (Hawaiians) that have that disconnect.” 

She recalled having to also learn other characters' lines with her coaches so she could react appropriately — “so it's not like we're giving blank faces.” 

Actor Cliff Curtis drew on his identity being Maori from New Zealand as a way to make connections with Hawaiian language, but said there were also challenging differences. 

“There's a fluidity to the way that it flows in Hawaiian,” he said. “There is a different cadence.”

Puakea Nogelmeier, a former professor of Hawaiian language at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, helped translate the script. He said he was nervous about the show's outcome knowing how few of the cast were fluent in Hawaiian. 

Nogelmeier isn't Hawaiian, and he learned the language after moving from Minnesota to Hawaii in 1972. He said the show helps prove it's a “functional, viable world language.”

“I was pleasantly surprised,” he said of the actors' performances. “I'm afraid that even Apple doesn't know how well they did.”

When Momoa first shared the idea of the show with Kanuha, he doubted it would ever happen. Before “Chief of War,” it was normal not to have any mainstream entertainment in Hawaiian, Kanuha said.

Now he can't imagine a world without it.

“Not only to hear their language, but just to see our world,” he said. “To be able to see the world that we talk about, that we're trying to preserve, to be able to visually see it and to hear it.” 

He and others eagerly await news on whether there will be a second season.

Live Updates


            • Nationwide protest: Crowds are growing at rallies in major cities and smaller demonstrations across the country for “No Kings” protests against President Donald Trump's administration. CNN is on the ground at several of the more than 2,500 events expected to draw millions of attendees.
    


            • Why they're protesting: Organizers say Trump is leading an increasingly militarized and authoritarian regime. Sweeping ICE raids and troop deployments in Democrat-led states have intensified the outrage since the original “No Kings” protests in June. Trump and the GOP have dismissed the demonstrations, with some Republicans calling them anti-American.
    


            • Government at a standstill: The protests come with the backdrop of a federal government shutdown, with GOP lawmakers and the White House locked in a standoff with Democrats over a funding bill.
    


            Unicorns and chickens and frogs, oh my.
    


            These are among the costumes demonstrators are sporting at “No Kings” protests across the country.
    


            “It's resistance – part of the resistance,” one protester told CNN in New York City, speaking from the clear window in her inflatable pink unicorn costume.
    


            A 24-year-old demonstrator in an inflatable frog suit named Hailey said, “I think the inflatables really show that we're not violent, we're just trying to support our community.” The costume, she added, was a little bit hot.
    


            “I think it's hard to see a country that you love descend into fascism,” Hailey, who says she works for an AI startup, said. She came to join the protest from Connecticut.
    


            She told CNN that she was inspired by  Portland, Oregon, where demonstrators have faced off for weeks against federal law enforcement. Protesters have donned inflatable costumes at rallies outside an ICE facility – in part to dispute President Donald Trump's characterization of the Democrat-led city as “war-ravaged.”
    


            “It's kind of hard to spin that narrative, calling us like terrorists and stuff, when we're just out here in funny costumes dancing,” Dustin Ragsdale, a demonstrator in Portland, previously told CNN.
    


            We've been talking about the growing scale of the “No Kings” protests today in major cities — here's a little perspective on that.
    


            This is a view from above the Boston Common a short time ago:
    


            A large — and still growing — crowd has made its way into Grant Park in Chicago.
    


            Today's “No Kings” rally in the city is being held at the Petrillo Music Shell, the park's well-known rally venue along Lake Michigan. It regularly serves as the venue for some of Chicago's biggest music festivals, including Jazz Fest, Blues Fest and Lollapalooza.
    


            Many people are carrying what appear to be homemade signs, and others are carrying pre-made “Hands Off Chicago” posters. There are lots of American flags in the crowd, along with a few Mexican and LGBTQ flags.
    


            Bobbie Castillo traveled miles from her hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska, to the “No Kings” protest in Washington, DC, for her first protest ever.
    


            “It's very powerful to be here right now. It makes me emotional,” she told CNN.
    


            Her fiancé, Michael Langfeldt, told CNN that he's participated in protests in Nebraska, but “nothing compared to this.”
    


            Langfeldt said he's protesting what he sees as “hatred” toward immigrants and the deployment of military to US cities.
    


            “I feel like there's a lot of overreach in the federal government, specifically in like the executive branch,” he said. “Congress doesn't do anything about it.”
    


            Castillo also expressed concern over what she feels is a threat to freedom of expression.
    


            “It doesn't seem like we're able to peacefully or safely (express ourselves) right now, without fear of repercussions” from the government, work or families, she said. “It's becoming so divisive … Personally, I don't like it. It bothers me.”
    


            Dressed in Revolutionary War-era clothing and wigs, members of the group All in for Democracy shared their reasons for attending the “No Kings” protest in Washington, DC.
    


            “I just see all of our institutions changing, and I don't want us to change as a country and as a people,” said DC resident Lee Ayres, sporting a coat, wig and hat. “I want all of America to realize the Declaration of Independence is about no kings.”
    


            Some top Republicans like House Speaker Mike Johnson have accused the protesters of being “anti-American” in recent days.
    


            Bob Hoeft, who described himself as a former Republican voter from Burke, Virginia, called such accusations “ridiculous.”
    


            “There's a lot of lot less truth coming out of the Republican Party than there is just vitriol, trying to gain political favor, trying to anger Americans for their benefit,” Hoeft said.
    


            One demonstrator at the “No Kings” march in New York City told CNN she's been protesting since the 1960s.
    


            But this time feels different, she told CNN.
    


                    “In the 60s we wanted to expand rights – women's rights, gay rights, minority rights, voting rights,” she said. “But all that's being taken away now. Now our entire democracy is being threatened, the basic tenets, the press, the judiciary.”
                





            One of thousands of protesters expected to attend the Manhattan demonstration, the demonstrator held a sign that reads: “We protest because we love America, and we want it back.”
    


            She described feeling “very sad, a sense of loss, fear” under the Trump administration.
    


            “I'm hoping together, we can all save democracy,” she said.
    


            Liz Cattaneo, an organizer of the “No Kings” rally in Washington, DC, said the safety of protesters on Saturday is especially important amid growing political violence across the country.
    


                    “We take the security and safety of our demonstrators very, very seriously, and we have to do so in light of growing political violence,” Cattaneo told CNN. “We want to take extra assurances that people can come and protest safely.”
                





            Cattaneo said it's important that people come out despite potential fears about security “to show that we are not afraid.”
    


            Cattaneo said nonviolence and safety are priorities for her and other organizers across the country.
    


            “Our movement has always had a commitment to nonviolence and to peaceful demonstration,” Cattaneo said.
    


            In preparation for Saturday's national event, Cattaneo said volunteers underwent extensive training in de-escalation tactics.
    


            “We have not left anything to chance. We have had nearly daily security briefings and training for volunteers across the country,” she said.
    


            Some of the biggest crowds we're seeing so far today are in New York, where “No Kings” protesters have packed the streets in some of the busiest parts of the city.
    


            A march outside Madison Square Garden has featured a large banner reading, “No Kings” and “People Over Billionaires.” Protesters are chanting slogans into megaphones, including, “This is what democracy looks like,” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.”
    


            There are signs referencing everything from yesterday's George Santos pardon to workers' rights (that placard says it is endorsed by the Writer's Guild of America), and a variety of costumes, including various animals and unicorns.
    


            Bagpipes and beating drums are making for a cacophony of sound, along with the constant chanting.
    


            A section of California's Interstate 5 will be closed today “due to extreme life safety risk and distraction to drivers, including sudden unexpected and loud explosions,” as the United States Marine Corps celebrates its 250th anniversary at Camp Pendleton, the California governor's office said.
    


            Vice President JD Vance is set to attend the event celebrating the 250th anniversary celebrations, which will feature amphibious assault demonstrations.
    


            The state said it received notice from event organizers asking for CalTrans signage to be posted along the I-5 freeway that would read: “Overhead fire in progress.” A decision to close a portion of the interstate from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time Saturday was then made, according to the governor's office and information from the California Department of Transportation.



            “Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn't just wrong — it's dangerous,” Newsom said in the statement.
    


            The event at Camp Pendleton will also be attended by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan and General Eric M. Smith, commandant of the Marine Corps. Vance is the first Marine to serve as vice president.
    


            Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts is at a “No Kings” protest in the town of Haydenville today.
    


            He shared photos on X showing him shaking hands with attendees.
    


            “We will not back down to Donald Trump—protest is what this country was founded on,” McGovern wrote.

            At protests across the US, some demonstrators are wearing yellow – a symbol of unity and a reference to other nonviolent resistance movements, according to organizers.
    


                    “Throughout history, people who have come together in protest against authoritarian regimes have utilized a color that is easy to see among a sea of thousands,” reads a flyer on the “No Kings” website. “Yellow is a bright, unmistakable reminder that millions of us stand together in the belief that America belongs to its people, not to kings.” 
                





            During Hong Kong's 2014 political protests, demonstrators carried yellow umbrellas – first as a defense against police use of pepper spray, then as a symbol of a growing political movement. In South Korea, after the Sewol ferry tragedy left hundreds dead in 2014, yellow ribbons “evolved from memorial tokens into protest symbols demanding government transparency and justice,” according to the “No Kings” website.
    


            And in eastern Ukraine, yellow ribbons served “as a signal of resistance and national self-determination amid invasion,” says the site. “Yellow Ribbon” activists have led nonviolent resistance movements in areas occupied by Russia.
    


            Yellow “is a visible, optimistic banner that carries the weight of democratic struggle, nonviolent dissent, and a reminder that power must stem from the people, not from crowns,” reads the site.
    


            Along with the larger events we're monitoring today in major cities, we're seeing small pockets of “No Kings” protesters crop up along busy thoroughfares, in small town squares and elsewhere around the US.
    


            That's the case in Silver Spring, Maryland, a town outside Washington, DC, where a group is waving their signs for passing traffic on an overpass over the Capital Beltway.
    


            We've also been keeping an eye on demonstrations in Europe this morning, where groups have held events in solidarity with the Americans attending today's “No Kings” protests.
    


            Crowds gathered outside landmarks and US embassies in Berlin, Paris, Rome and Sweden holding signs denouncing fascism and dictatorships, with some suggesting US President Donald Trump does not uphold the values of democracy.
    


Here are a few scenes from protests we're monitoring:



            On “No Kings Day,” Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California delivered a message to people participating in rallies across the state, aligning the movement with the spirit of the American Revolution.
    


             Schiff said the day marks a grassroots stand against authoritarianism and in defense of democratic values.
    


            In a video shared ahead of the events, Schiff praised attendees for “standing up. Not just for yourself, but for your neighbors, and for an idea.”
    


            The senator's message drew a direct line from the present moment to the country's founding, invoking the grievances laid out in the Declaration of Independence, and aimed his historical parallel squarely at President Donald Trump.
    


                    “If those grievances sound familiar, they should, because the man who would rule America today has done all of that and more,” Schiff said. “When we declared independence from a king 250 years ago, we also declared independence from the idea of kings.”
                





            He reminded Americans that their role as citizens is not passive, but active, and that democracy is not inherited, but earned and protected by each generation.
    


            “We have a people brave enough to govern themselves and wise enough to know that democracy only survives if we defend it,” he said.
    


Keep in mind: Schiff's parallel between today's demonstrations and the country's founding principles comes as Republicans have attacked the protests as “anti-American.”



            It's a calm and organized scene here in Atlanta, where a band is playing as people gather in a parking lot behind the Civic Center for today's “No Kings” protest.
    


            We spoke with Joan Press, an attendee in her 50s who came to the rally with her husband. Press told CNN she was driven to attend by what she described as President Donald Trump's threats to abortion rights, health care access and social security.
    


                    Asked for the message she hopes to send, Press said: “We're a democracy. And that, in a democracy, people can stand up and voice their opinions. And that we are not going to be silenced.”
                





            Organizers tell us the rally in Atlanta will be followed by a protest march.
    


CNN's Maxime Tamsett and Matt Meyer contributed to this report.



            As we reach 10 a.m. on the East Coast, we're keeping an eye on some of the first “No Kings” rallies expected to begin around the US.
    


            Organizers in Atlanta slated a rally to begin at the top of the hour, followed by a protest march.
    


            In New York City, a march is planned to begin around 11 a.m. ET.
    


            That will be followed by a rally in Washington, DC, at noon ET and a rally and march in Chicago at 1 p.m. ET, according to organizers.
    


            Of course, those are just a few key cities we're watching, as there are more than 2,500 events planned in all 50 states.
    


            CNN is on the ground around the country, and we'll bring you insights on why protesters say they're gathering as the day goes on.
    


            Ahead of today's “No Kings” protests against the Trump administration, the Department of Homeland Security sent out an intelligence report warning law enforcement agencies across the country about the potential for certain events to become violent.
    


            The report, which was obtained by CNN, did not indicate national security officials were aware of any specific and credible threats, nor did it identify any planned protests by name.
    


            DHS said police should look out for certain indicators, including attendance by demonstrators “with a history of exploiting lawful protests to engage in violence” and attendees who have received paramilitary-like training.
    


            The report recommended that local law enforcement communicate with transit agencies to be aware of increased travel to a particular area from people outside the region, and to consider establishing separate areas where protesters and counter-protesters can demonstrate at a distance from one another.
    


            It also recommended that law enforcement work with liaisons from the protest organizers and any counter-protest groups to help establish legal guidelines.
    


What organizers are saying: While the Trump administration and some GOP officials have painted anti-Trump protests as the work of “violent left-wing radicals,” the organization behind the “No Kings” events, the Indivisible Project, says it is committed to “nonviolent action” and has trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation.
    


            The group, which says the events will be attended by a broad coalition of participants of various ages and backgrounds, has said peaceful protests will serve as a contrast to the Trump administration's show of force in Democrat-led cities.
    


Go deeper: CNN spoke to attendees at the last “No Kings” protests.



            Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the Indivisible Project, spoke on our air this week about Republican criticism against the “No Kings” demonstrations his organization is helping lead.
    


Watch the interview below:



            Ahead of the second iteration of the “No Kings” protests scheduled nationwide today, North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson urged people to protest peacefully and safely in a statement yesterday.
    


            “Peaceful protest is one of the most important rights we have as Americans. It's how people make their voices heard and stand up for what they believe in,” Jackson said.
    


                    “Protesting peacefully honors both the cause and the Constitution. Peaceful protest strengthens our democracy; violence undermines it,” he added.
                





            The organization behind the “No Kings” events, the Indivisible Project, says it is committed to “nonviolent action” and has trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation.
    


            President Donald Trump responded to the second round of “No Kings” demonstrations, scheduled today, in an interview with Fox Business Network that aired yesterday.
    


            He suggested Democrats have delayed negotiations to reopen the government for the widespread protest.
    


                    “I mean, some people say they want to delay (reopening the government) for that — the king — this, this is not a king,” Trump said. “You know, they're saying. They're referring to me as a king. I'm not.”
                





            Some Republican leaders have labeled the protests as anti-American, while earlier this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson also claimed, without evidence, that the rallies have contributed to the ongoing government shutdown.

Watch live from New York and Washington as protesters join a “No Kings” demonstration against U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration's policies.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Protesting the direction of the country under President Donald Trump, people gathered Saturday in the nation's capital and communities across the U.S. for “ No Kings ” demonstrations — what the president's Republican Party is calling “Hate America” rallies.

This is the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House and comes against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services, but is testing the core balance of power as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that organizers warn are a slide toward American authoritarianism.

Many protesters were especially angered by attacks on their motives. In Bethesda, Maryland, one held a sign that read “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting.”

In nearby Washington, Brian Reymann carried a large American flag and said being called a terrorist all week by Republicans was “pathetic.”

“This Is America. I disagree with their politics, but I don't believe that they don't love this country. I believe they are misguided. I think they are power hungry,” Reymann said. 

Trump himself is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.

“They say they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,” Trump said in a Fox News interview airing early Friday, before he departed for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club. Protests are expected nearby Saturday.

More than 2,600 rallies are planned Saturday in cities large and small, organized by hundreds of coalition partners.

While the earlier protests this year — against Elon Musk's cuts this spring and Trump's June military parade — drew crowds, organizers say this one is uniting the opposition. Top Democrats such as Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders are joining in what organizers view as an antidote to Trump's actions, from the administration's clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids.

“There is no greater threat to an authoritarian regime than patriotic people-power,” said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, among the key organizers.

Before noon, several thousand people had gathered in New York City's Times Square, chanting “Trump must go now,” and waving sometimes-profane signs with slogans insulting the president and condemning his immigration crackdown. Some people carried American flags.

Retired family doctor Terence McCormally was heading to Arlington National Cemetery to join others walking across the Memorial Bridge that enters Washington directly in front of the Lincoln Memorial. He said the recent deployment of the National Guard made him more wary of police than in the past.

“I really don't like the crooks and conmen and religious zealots who are trying to use the country” for personal gain, McCormally said, “while they are killing and hurting millions of people with bombs.”

Americans abroad held smaller rallies in major European cities, waving U.S. flags and chanting slogans.

Republicans have sought to portray Saturday's protesters as far outside the mainstream and a prime reason for the government shutdown, now in its 18th day.

From the White House to Capitol Hill, GOP leaders disparaged the rallygoers as “communists” and “Marxists.” They say Democratic leaders, including Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces.

“I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. 

“Let's see who shows up for that,” Johnson said, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism” and “Marxists in full display.” 

In a Facebook post, former presidential contender Sanders countered that, “It's a love America rally.”

“It's a rally of millions of people all over this country who believe in our Constitution, who believe in American freedom and,” he said, pointing at the GOP leadership, “are not going to let you and Donald Trump turn this country into an authoritarian society.”

Democrats have refused to vote on legislation that would reopen the government as they demand funding for health care. Republicans say they are willing to discuss the issue later, only after the government reopens.

But for many Democrats, the government closure is also a way to stand up to Trump, and try to push the presidency back to its place in the U.S. system as a co-equal branch of government.

The situation is a potential turnaround from just six months ago, when Democrats and their allies were divided and despondent, unsure about how best to respond to Trump's return to the White House. Schumer in particular was berated by his party for allowing an earlier government funding bill to sail through the Senate without using it to challenge Trump.

In April, the national march against Trump and Elon Musk had 1,300 registered locations. In June, for the first “No Kings” day, there were 2,100 registered locations. 

“What we are seeing from the Democrats is some spine,” Levin said. “The worst thing the Democrats could do right now is surrender.”

Protesters in Atlanta, New York City, Washington, DC, and other major cities gather for demonstrations marking a "day of defiance" against Trump's administration.

Millions of people are expected to gather across thousands of locations in the United States on Saturday for a nationwide "No Kings" protest challenging President Donald Trump and his GOP priorities. 

Saturday's demonstrations across the nation mark the second "No Kings" protest since Trump took office. Some Democratic members and candidates for Congress are expected to attend. 

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not provide a clear answer when asked if he would attend one of the rallies Saturday, telling reporters he hasn't "finalized" his schedule. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as well as House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., both told the press they would be in attendance Saturday. 

Republicans have argued that this second mass "No Kings" protest event scheduled for Saturday is simply an effort to distract from the current government shutdown battle and appease their base. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told FOX Business he hoped that Democratic leaders who attended would be more willing to accept the GOP's plan after the demonstrations were over — but he did not sound overly optimistic.

"It'll be a collection of wild leftist policy priorities, and that'll be on display for the whole country. After that's over, I hope there's a few Democrats over here who will come to their senses and return to governing the country," Johnson said. "Right now, I don't think — it's my assumption and all of ours that they would not make that concession before that rally's over because they don't want to face the angry mob. I mean it's sad, but that's where we are."

"My guess is if they don't want a primary from the left, they'll probably find a way to sneak [attending a rally] into their schedule," Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, told Fox News Digital earlier this week. "The real question that's going to be is, do they have the fortitude after Saturday to come back and open up the government?"

By around 10:30 a.m. ET, crowds had already begun gathering in New York City's Times Square, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. and in Atlanta. By noon, significant crowds were seen in places like Carrollton, Texas, Charlotte, North Carolina, Arlington, Virginia and the U.S. Embassy in London.

In the state of Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin mobilized the National Guard to help with any potential chaos. 

"I want to be clear that Virginians have a fundamental right to free speech and peaceful assembly, but that right does not include the destruction of property, looting, vandalism, disruption of traffic or violence of any kind — for which there will be zero tolerance," Youngkin said, according to The Virginia Pilot. 

Virginia-specific protests are expected to take place in Hampton Roads, Chesapeake, Virginia Beach, Newport News and Williamsburg, according the official No Kings website.

In addition to the protests taking place in the continental United States, protests are also expected in Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Alaska. Protests are also planned for outside the U.S., including in multiple European countries, and there is at least one rally planned in Mexico.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A Cameroonian-flagged ship caught fire Saturday in the Gulf of Aden off Yemen after possibly being struck by a projectile, officials said, with at least one mariner missing and another still likely aboard the burning tanker after the rest of the crew abandoned the vessel.

U.K. and European Union officials offered differing opinions about what sparked the blaze on the Falcon, with the British suggesting a projectile hit it, while the EU said that it appeared to be “an accident.” They warned ships in the area that the vessel could explode, because it was “fully loaded” with liquefied petroleum gas. 

The incident comes as Yemen's Houthi rebels have been attacking ships through the Red Sea corridor. However, the rebels didn't immediately claim to have been involved, though it can take them hours or even days to do so. 

The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, or UKMTO, center issued an alert about the Falcon, describing the incident as taking place around 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of Aden. 

“A vessel has been hit by an unknown projectile, resulting with a fire,” the UKMTO said. “Authorities are investigating.”

The EU's Operation Aspides, which has been patrolling the area, said that the Falcon's crew of 26 was all Indian except for one Ukrainian. The Greek frigate HS Spetsai was nearby the Falcon, while the French also sent an aircraft overhead, the EU operation said. 




“Initial indications suggest that 15% of the ship is on fire and the fire was caused by an accident,” the EU naval force said, without elaborating. 

The Falcon previously had been identified by United Against Nuclear Iran, a New York-based pressure group, as operating allegedly in an Iranian “ghost fleet” of ships moving their oil products in the high seas despite international sanctions. The ship's owners and operators, listed as being in India, couldn't be immediately reached for comment.

The Israeli military said that it was aware of the strike on the ship, but that it didn't carry out any operation in the area.

The Houthis have gained international prominence during the Israel-Hamas war over their attacks on shipping and Israel, which they said were aimed at forcing Israel to stop fighting. Since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, no attacks have been claimed by the rebel group. 

The Houthi campaign against shipping has killed at least nine mariners and seen four ships sunk. It upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which about $1 trillion of goods passed each year before the war. The rebels' most recent attack hit the Dutch-flagged cargo ship Minervagracht on Sept. 29, killing one crew member on board and wounding another.

Meanwhile, the Houthis have increasingly threatened Saudi Arabia and taken dozens of workers at U.N. agencies and other aid groups as prisoners, alleging without evidence they were spies — something fiercely denied by the world body and others.

Donnie Wahlberg told Fox News Digital his wife Jenny McCarthy did not get jealous of his New Kids on the Block fan base.

Donnie Wahlberg is reflecting on his 11-year marriage to Jenny McCarthy. 

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the "Boston Blue" star — who is currently starring in the "Blue Bloods" spinoff — detailed how his past romantic mistakes helped shape his relationship with McCarthy. 

"Well, we've both been divorced before, so we did a lot of individual therapy and when we got together we decided, let's do some together, sort of preemptive, because no matter what, every new relationship brings on new challenges and sometimes we don't even know what activates us, what causes us to react to certain things and brings out vulnerabilities in us," said Wahlberg.

"But intimate new relationships are usually where they surface," he continued. "Some of us are really good at working in a work environment or with friends. We can give advice, and we can handle things, but sometimes you get into a romantic relationship and suddenly things bother you that don't bother you in other parts of your life. And it's because it's the most vulnerable relationship you're going to be in, and that's where those vulnerabilities pop up."

McCarthy and Wahlberg began dating in July 2013 and tied the knot in August 2014. Wahlberg has two sons from his previous marriage to Kimberly Fey, and McCarthy has one son, Evan, from an earlier marriage to John Asher.

The former Playboy model and Asher got divorced in 2005. At the time, the couple had been married for 6 years and were grappling with their son's autism diagnosis.

In 2008, McCarthy told Oprah Winfrey that the diagnosis took a toll on their marriage. 

"I felt very alone in my marriage," she said at the time. "He never sat down and said, 'What did you find out on Google?' There was never that connection of wanting to know and being there."

For the second attempt at marriage, Wahlberg said he and McCarthy make it a priority to "put the relationship first."

"I think both of us [put kids before our marriage] in our first relationships and we're not going to make that mistake again."

"That means doing work to protect and fortify the relationship," he said. "And we put faith in the center of our relationship too, and that is such a foundation for us, and it's just huge for us. But in any relationship, you have to put the relationship first."

"It's hard to always reconcile that, especially when you're a parent, but they say on an airplane, if something happens, put your mask on first before your children. And I always thought that was the craziest thing. We have to do our kids first. But the theory is, if you don't put your mask on first, you can't help your children. It's easy to put the kids before everything and forget your partner. And it's understandable."

"I think both of us did that in our first relationships and we're not going to make that mistake again," he added.

Another piece of advice? Go on dates, said Wahlberg. 

"Dates are fun!" he said. "All the things we do when we first meet, we stop. We eventually stop. We get complacent. We don't mean it, but you stop asking questions, you stop being curious, you stop putting in the effort, you stop sending flowers, you just stop. We just tend to stop because we start to trust that the relationship's solid and it's there. But I think if we keep giving it that fuel and that energy, that love that we started with, then I think it really does keep the fire going."

Earlier this year, the New Kids on the Block star detailed the moment he knew McCarthy was "the one."

During an interview with Fox News Digital, Wahlberg said his wife of over a decade never got jealous of his female fan base, even when he would kiss a different fan at the end of every show.

"Jenny, when we first started dating, like, one of the reasons I knew she was a great girl for me, among the many reasons, was I told her, I said, 'Look, I'm in this band. My fans are going to be there. When I walk into a hotel with you, for example, and you know there are 50 screaming fans outside, I can't just duck by and run into the hotel.'"

"'I got to stop and take pictures. I got to stop and say thank you. I got to stop and sign autographs.' And she said, ‘OK.' And I said, ‘All right, are you going to be good with that?' She said, 'Yeah, I'll take the pictures with you. I'm good,'" Wahlberg said.

He continued, "Like, I knew right then. I was like, 'Oh, she's the one.' I knew already, but you know, I did have that talk with her."

In 2023, McCarthy shared her husband's sentiments on what makes a relationship work. 

"Respecting each other, communicating with each other, being each other's friends. Finding date nights and doing the work," McCarthy told Fox News Digital. 

"You know that saying… your partner is your best teacher. It really is true. Anything that you need to work on will come out in your relationship. And we were both always willing and still willing to do the work when things come up. And it really is, it makes all the difference in the world."

Throughout their marriage, the two have made a point to support each other on a professional level as well. 

Wahlberg said his latest show, "Boston Blue" — which premiered on Oct. 17 on CBS — presents a "great opportunity to keep faith and family and tradition on TV."

"It's fun. It's a lot of things, but I think first and foremost, it's a great opportunity to keep the ‘Blue Bloods' world and the Reagan legacy alive," said Wahlberg, who portrayed Detective Danny Reagan for 14 seasons. "It's a great opportunity to keep faith and family and tradition on TV and to feature a law enforcement family."

"Of course, it's a new family, a new world, a new city, and Danny's facing new challenges and being a dad on the police department for the first time in his life," he continued. "But it creates a lot of opportunities to explore the character in new ways that I've never gotten to before."

The "Blue Bloods" spinoff might even welcome a familiar face to the screen — Tom Selleck. 

"Of course, we have some surprise guests already in the show," said Wahlberg. "I would give anything to work with Tom again, and I fought like heck to be able to keep working with him on ‘Blue Bloods,' but it just wasn't meant to be. So, hopefully, this show is a tremendous opportunity, as I said, for a lot of things, but it's certainly an opportunity to keep the Reagan legacy alive. And that would mean, of course, any chance I could work with any of the original cast, I would take it."

"Boston Blue" airs Fridays on CBS and streams the next day on Paramount+.

CAIRO (AP) — The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will reopen Monday for people returning to Gaza, the Palestinian embassy in Egypt said Saturday, but the territory's sole gateway to the outside world will remain closed to people trying to leave.

But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement within minutes, saying that the Rafah crossing wouldn't reopen “until further notice,” adding that it would depend on how Hamas fulfills its role in returning all the bodies of the dead hostages.

Israel's foreign ministry on Thursday had said that the crossing would likely reopen Sunday — another step in the fragile ceasefire.

The Rafah crossing is the only one not controlled by Israel before the war. It has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side. A fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Gazans to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt, home to tens of thousands of Palestinians.

It's unclear who will operate the crossing's heavily damaged Gaza side once the war ends.

Meanwhile, Gaza's ruins were being scoured for the dead, over a week into the ceasefire. Newly recovered bodies brought the Palestinian toll above 68,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Thousands of people are still missing, according to the Red Cross.

The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. But the ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.

Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack on southern Israel that sparked the war on Oct. 7, 2023.

Israel on Saturday said that the remains of a 10th hostage that Hamas handed over the day before were identified as Eliyahu Margalit.

The handover of 28 hostages' remains is among key points — along with aid deliveries into Gaza and the devastated territory's future — in the ceasefire process meant to end two years of war.

The 76-year-old Margalit was abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz during the Oct. 7 attack. His remains were found after bulldozers plowed up pits in the southern city of Khan Younis.

U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that he would greenlight a resumption of the war by Israel, if Hamas doesn't return the remains of all dead hostages.

Hamas has said it is committed to the ceasefire deal, but that the retrieval of remains is hampered by the devastation and the presence of unexploded ordnance. The group has told mediators that some remains are in areas controlled by Israeli troops.

In a statement, the hostage forum that supports the families of those abducted said it will continue holding weekly rallies until all are returned.

As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel on Saturday returned the bodies of a further 15 Palestinians to Gaza. Gaza's Health Ministry said the International Committee of the Red Cross handed them over to Nasser Hospital, bringing the total Israel has returned to 135.

Hamas again accused Israel of continuing attacks and violating the ceasefire, asserting that 38 Palestinians had been killed since it began. There was no immediate response from Israel, which still maintains control of about half of Gaza.

On Friday, Gaza's Civil Defense, first responders operating under the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, said nine people were killed, including women and children, when their vehicle was hit by Israeli fire in Gaza City. The Civil Defense said the car crossed into an Israeli-controlled area in eastern Gaza.

The Civil Defense said Israel could have warned the people in a manner that wasn't lethal. The group recovered the bodies Saturday with coordination from the United Nations, it said.

Israel's army said it saw a “suspicious vehicle” crossing the so-called yellow line and approaching troops. It said it fired warning shots, but the vehicle continued to approach in a manner that posed an “imminent threat.” The army said it acted in accordance with the ceasefire.

Hamas has urged mediators to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza for its 2 million people, expedite the full opening of the Rafah border crossing and start reconstruction of the battered territory.

There are continued closures of crossings and Israeli restrictions on aid groups.

U.N. data on Friday showed 339 trucks have been offloaded for distribution in Gaza since the ceasefire began. Under the agreement, about 600 aid trucks per day should be allowed to enter.

COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid in Gaza, reported 950 trucks — including commercial trucks and bilateral deliveries — crossing on Thursday and 716 on Wednesday, the U.N. said.

Throughout the war, Israel restricted aid to Gaza, sometimes halting it altogether.

International food security experts declared famine in Gaza City, and the U.N. says it has verified more than 400 people who died of malnutrition-related causes, including over 100 children.

Israel has long said it let in enough food and accused Hamas of stealing much of it. The U.N. and other aid agencies deny the claim.

Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa sparked backlash within the football community after he publicly called out his teammates following the team's fifth loss of the season, this time against the Los Angeles Chargers.

Among those disappointed with the quarterback's comments was his former head coach, Alabama legend Nick Saban.

Saban, who coached Tagovailoa en route to a national championship during the 2017 season, said he was shocked to hear some of the remarks his former quarterback had made.

"One of the things that I always try to tell our players is you never criticize another player and, in my entire coaching career, you never ever saw me criticize one of our players. I think everybody's got to take responsibility for what they can control, and if you start worrying about things you can't control, that's going to start affecting things you can control," Saban said Friday on "The Pat McAfee Show."

"I was really shocked that Tua did what he did, when he threw some guys under the bus. Maybe they're not playing the way they should play, I'm not taking up for the guys, but you don't say that about your teammate."

Following the 29-27 loss to Los Angeles, which saw Miami fall to 1-5 this season, Tagovailoa vented to the media about his teammates.

"We have guys showing up to player-only meetings late. Guys not showing up to player-only meetings. There is a lot that goes into that. Do we have to make that mandatory? Do we not have to make that mandatory? So it's a lot of things of that nature that we got to get cleaned up. It starts with the little things like that."

The remarks sparked backlash from around the NFL, prompting him to apologize just days later.

"As a leader of this team, of the Miami Dolphins, the comments that had been said, I've made a mistake," he said Wednesday, "and I'm owning up to that right now. I've talked to guys on the team about it, talked to the leaders about it, and they know my heart. They know that the intent was right. But no matter the intent ... when things get misconstrued or however the media wants to portray it, that leaves a void of silence and a lot of questions for the guys on our team."

Tagovailoa looked at the incident as a learning opportunity, and Saban commended his former player for publicly acknowledging the mistake.

"I really was proud of the way he came back and took accountability for making a mistake."

The Dolphins will look to rebound Sunday on the road against the Cleveland Browns.

George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley joins 'Fox & Friends' to weigh in on Attorney General Pam Bondi warning against inciting political violence amid the rise in online rhetoric.

After Charlie Kirk was assassinated at Utah Valley University in the city of Orem last month, American academics across the country have taken to social media to lambast the conservative leader and brand him as dangerous. 

Matthew Reznicek is an associate professor of medical humanities at the University of Minnesota. 

"Professors were subject to political violence because of Kirk and the culture he ushered in, the culture that is being whitewashed," he said in a Sept. 13 post on the left-leaning social media platform Bluesky.

UNIVERSITIES CRACK DOWN ON EMPLOYEE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS CELEBRATING, DEFENDING KIRK'S DEATH

Reznicek's objection, like that of many of his colleagues, stemmed from an opinion piece called "Charlie Kirk Was Practicing Politics the Right Way," by Ezra Klein, published in the New York Times.

The Minnesota academic later insulted Kirk's intellect. 

"The thing about memorializing Kirk as the Socrates of our era, willing to debate me bro anywhere anytime, is how he was also a know-nothing," said Reznicek. 

Chris Lamb, a journalism professor emeritus of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, who brags about being on Turning Point's "Professor Watchlist," also made claims that Kirk and Turning Point caused violence. 

"I'm on Charlie Kirk's professor watchlist. I know professors who were harassed and threatened after appearing on the list. Others were physically assaulted. Kirk's murder is a tragedy – as is any murder. But let us not praise Charlie Kirk. He was a SOB," he said on Bluesky. 

Lamb declined to provide evidence of this claim.

‘FEARLESS' TOUR TAKES CHARLIE KIRK'S FREE SPEECH MISSION TO COLLEGES NATIONWIDE

"I am not going to give you the name of a college professor or instructor who was harassed and threatened after being targeted by TPUSA, and, in giving you that name, put the person in harm's way (again)," he told Fox News Digital. 

He pointed Fox News Digital to a documentary called "Surviving Turning Point USA," produced by an Arizona academic. Lamb is interviewed in the film, and refers to Turning Point as "the Hitler youth." 

Other academics who are on the Professor Watchlist are interviewed in that documentary, but none provide proof of threats or violence stemming from the list. One professor in the film says she didn't even know she was on the list until the filmmaker reached out to her. 

The film covers the story of Ken Storey, a former professor at the University of Tampa who was fired in 2017 after Turning Point USA and the national media highlighted a post he made on X, then Twitter, celebrating the devastating Hurricane Harvey that hit Texas that year.

"I don't believe in instant Karma but this kinda feels like it for Texas. Hopefully this will help them realize the GOP doesn't care about them," Storey's post said. He later doubled down, suggesting that residents of Florida who voted for President Donald Trump deserved the same fate.

YEARS OF CAMPUS ATTACKS ON CONSERVATIVE ACTIVISTS RESURFACE AFTER CHARLIE KIRK'S MURDER

The University of Tampa fired Storey. He received threatening voicemails that are played in the film. 

Lamb doubled down on his disdain for Kirk in his response to Fox News Digital. 

"I am saddened about Charlie Kirk's murder," he said. "I didn't like him. I found him offensive. He was a bigot who perpetuated bogus conspiracies. This is confirmed by his own words. He exploited the politics of hate and division."

"But there was more to him than other provocateurs. He was married with two small children. Maybe that would have motivated him to become a better version of himself if he had lived," Lamb said. "It's happened before. He was not afraid to engage with people who disagreed with him. This set him apart. America really needs someone who can engage us—rather than further divide us. Maybe he could have become one of those people. We'll never know."

Jeremy Littau, who teaches journalism at Lehigh University, also shared the sentiment of his colleagues in response to Klein's think piece. 

"I have two professor colleagues who have faced threats and harassment due to the organization Charlie Kirk built, and they were not alone," he said on social media the day after Kirk's murder. "We can denounce and loathe political violence without hagiography for its victims. This is dangerous nonsense."

ANTI-TRUMP VOICES PRAISE CHARLIE KIRK'S LEGACY AFTER ASSASSINATION, SAY HE WAS DOING POLITICS 'THE RIGHT WAY'

"The big problem is that a large swath of America had never heard of Kirk until yesterday," he continued. "Every piece in major media about him is an introduction for many, and so conferring the sense of sainthood on him in the long run creates permission for the dangerous response I fear is coming."

Reznicek and Littau did not return requests for comment seeking proof of their claims of threats, violence and harassment. 

In 2023, an Arizona State University professor named David Boyles was confronted by two Turning Point activists on campus. One was filming and the other was asking questions about the LGBTQ content in his coursework. Boyles eventually swatted the camera from his face, leading to a physical confrontation.

CHARLIE KIRK PAINTED AS 'CONTROVERSIAL,' 'PROVOCATIVE' IN MEDIA'S ASSASSINATION COVERAGE

In one piece called "'I Am Charlie Kirk' Is the New Way to Confess You're a Racist. Thanks for the Warning," she compared people who use that phrase to the head of the Nazi youth Baldur Benedikt von Schirach, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi SS leader, George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of America's Nazi party, as well as segregationists and KKK members. 

The phrase "I Am Charlie Kirk" has become ubiquitous among his millions of supporters since his death. 

Patton explained that her piece wasn't meant to be taken literally. 

"The piece is a layered rhetorical essay, not a headcount of fascists," she told Fox News Digital. "Saying ‘I am Charlie Kirk' is a literary device, an historical analogy tracing the ideological lineage of fascism, not a literal equivalence."

She further explained that she "drew a historical throughline between Goebbels' techniques and the rhetorical tactics of modern demagogues." 

Patton declined to comment when asked if she thought rhetoric similar to hers could have contributed to Kirk's assassination.

Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin reports from clashes outside a Broadview, Ill., immigration facility where anti-I.C.E. protesters are being arrested on ‘Special Report.'

The Trump administration has urged the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago to protect federal personnel and federal property amid protests over immigration enforcement in the area.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer, Trump's top Supreme Court lawyer, urged the justices to step in immediately after a judge ruled last week that National Guard troops sent to Illinois by President Donald Trump to combat crime can remain in the state but can't patrol or deploy to protect federal property. A federal appeals court had refused to put the judge's order on hold.

U.S. District Judge April Perry said she found no convincing evidence that a "danger of rebellion" exists in Illinois amid Trump's immigration enforcement push.

TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS CAN STAY IN ILLINOIS BUT FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS DEPLOYMENT

Sauer wrote in the emergency filing that the judge's ruling "intrudes on the president's authority and needlessly puts federal personnel and property at risk."

The Trump administration argues in its filing that the case represents a "disturbing and recurring pattern" in which federal officers enforcing immigration law are met with "prolonged, coordinated, violent resistance that threatens their lives and safety and systematically interferes with their ability to enforce federal law."

The filing says, "resistance succeeds to an alarming degree in its aim of obstructing federal agents from enforcing federal immigration law."

"Federal agents are forced to desperately scramble to protect themselves and federal property, allocating resources away from their law enforcement mission to conduct protective operations instead," the filing states.

"Receiving tepid support from local forces, they are often left to fend for themselves in the face of violent, hostile mobs. Confronted with intolerable risks of harm to federal agents and coordinated, violent opposition to the enforcement of federal law, the president lawfully determines that he is unable to enforce the laws of the United States with the regular forces and calls up the National Guard to defend federal personnel, property and functions in the face of ongoing violence," it says.

The Supreme Court has asked for the opposition's response to the Trump administration's emergency filing by 5 p.m. on Monday. The court is then expected to offer  that the administration file a reply.

The plea to the nation's top court comes as 11 protesters were arrested Friday outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, a west Chicago suburb that has become a frequent flashpoint for demonstrations against federal agents in recent weeks.

The filing also further escalates Trump's standoff with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have staunchly opposed deploying troops. They have called any deployment unconstitutional and insisted the city is not facing the kind of crime crisis the White House claims.

Pritzker fired back at the filing on X, accusing Trump of trying to "invade Illinois with troops" and vowing to defend the state's sovereignty.

"Militarizing our communities against their will is not only un-American but also leads us down a dangerous path for our democracy," Pritzker wrote. "What will come next?"

Trump has already deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and Memphis, Tenn., to help curb violent crime. He has said the moves caused crime to plummet in those areas. 

Earlier this week, the president floated the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act to tackle violent crime in Chicago and urged Pritzker to "beg for help" from the federal government.

"I could use it if I wanted to. I could use it — that's a very simple answer. I'm allowed to use the Insurrection Act," Trump said, after the question was put to him by a reporter aboard Air Force One. 

The Insurrection Act of 1807 gives the president authority to deploy active-duty military or federalized National Guard troops inside the country in limited circumstances, such as to suppress civil disorder, rebellion or obstruction of federal law. It has been invoked about 30 times by roughly 10 presidents, most recently by George H. W. Bush during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, according to The Associated Press.

But on Monday, Trump said he didn't have to "go there yet" because his administration is "winning on appeal."

"You know, we lose with radical-left judges at the lower level, but we're winning on appeal. So we'll see what happens," Trump said.

The conservative-dominated court has handed Trump repeated victories in emergency appeals since he took office in January, after lower courts have ruled against him and often over the objection of the three liberal justices. 

The court has allowed Trump to ban transgender people from the military, claw back billions of dollars of congressionally approved federal spending, move aggressively against illegal immigrants and fire the Senate-confirmed leaders of independent federal agencies.

President Donald Trump said he would "speak" with Moscow on giving Kyiv Tomahawk missiles in a thinly veiled threat.

Tomahawks, Tomahawks, Tomahawks. That's the word buzzing in the ears of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as President Donald Trump weighs providing America's precision strike missile of choice to Ukraine.   

Since May, Trump has bombed the Houthis in Yemen, obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities and hit narco-terrorist drug boats in the Caribbean.  Putin has to realize that Tomahawks could soon be in the skies over Russia.

What can Ukraine hit with the 1,000-mile-range Tomahawks? Start with the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan, and at least 67 Russian airbases. Tomahawks in Ukraine's hands rip open Russian energy infrastructure to precision attack with no warning.

ZELENSKYY PITCHES TRUMP ON UKRAINE DRONE-FOR-TOMAHAWK MISSILE EXCHANGE AS PRESIDENT WEIGHS ESCALATION CONCERNS

If Ukraine launches Tomahawks, they'll be flying as low as 100 feet, hugging the terrain, evading radar. TLAMs can each take separate routes at 500 mph and then meet up over the Russian target for a coordinated strike.

Trump is baiting Putin. "Hopefully, they won't need it," Trump said of the Tomahawks at Friday's lunch with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. Trump said he'd like to "get the war over without Tomahawks" but then went on to describe the missiles as "very dangerous" and "incredible."

Here's the backstory on the Tomahawks and why Trump is keeping them on the table to pressure Putin.  

First tested in 1972, the Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missile, or TLAM, was actually developed by the U.S. Navy during the Cold War to attack targets on land in the Soviet Union. In case you haven't seen one up close, the Tomahawk is 20 feet long but just 21 inches wide.  It looks like a white pole with winglets, but inside is a powerful turbo-fan engine and sophisticated guidance. Today's Block IV Tomahawks can be retargeted in flight, and loiter over a target for hours, taking electro-optical scans and waiting for other missiles to arrive before detonating. They carry a unitary warhead for harder targets, or dispense cluster munitions over a wide pattern to hit airfields, for example. (Yes, there was once a nuclear TLAM variant with a 200 Kiloton warhead, but they were placed in storage in 1991 and eliminated in 2010.) 

The presence of Tomahawks in Ukraine will set up an almost insoluble air defense problem for Putin. No way can Russia place air defenses at every remote gas pipeline point or cover all the airbases where planes park out in the open.  

TLAMs could be in Ukraine in 24 hours. The Army Mid-Range Capability missile system is a tractor-trailer missile launcher that can be driven onto a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane. The Army deployed TLAM launcher 8,000 miles away to North Luzon in the Philippines in under 15 hours last year for a wargame. Trump has plenty of time.  

Deterring Putin. The brutal escalation of mass attacks by Russia led Ukraine to ramp up its drone strikes on Russian energy starting in August. According to a Reuters study, Ukraine's drones have hit 18 pumping stations, plus 32 strikes on refineries. Ukraine's Liutyi drones have a range of about 600 miles and carry warheads of about 50 pounds. Mixing in TLAMs would intensify pressure on Russian energy, Putin's single biggest source of government revenue. Zelenskyy has called Ukraine's drone attacks on Russian energy "the sanctions that work the fastest."

The U.S. still has about 4,000 Tomahawks in its inventory, and new missiles like the U.S. Navy's SM-6 are already in action. The U.S. Army deployed its new Dark Eagle long-range hypersonic weapons to Australia in August and will have its first full battery by December. By the way, last year Japan bought 400 Tomahawks for targeting China and North Korea.  

Tomahawks have piled up an incredible combat record since Jan. 17, 1991, when 122 TLAMs hit Iraqi oil and command and control targets at the start of Operation Desert Storm. Eight-hundred TLAMs were fired in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Over the years, Tomahawks have hit targets in Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen and, of course, Iran. On June 22, TLAMs hit above-ground "key surface infrastructure targets" in the nuclear complex at Isfhahan, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine. The TLAM strikes left the sprawling site visibly damaged and blackened. "We gave it a capper with 30 TLAMS," as Trump said Friday. 

Putin may yell and scream about Tomahawks for Ukraine. Pay no attention. He's grumbled about each weapon system, from F-16s to Patriots. And no, Putin does not dare escalate with nuclear weapons in Ukraine, because the wind patterns blow radiation clouds back into Russia.  

As Trump said Friday: "Yeah, its escalation. But we're going to talk about it anyway."

            A series of public statements from the Department of Homeland Security during its migrant crackdown in Chicago and across the country has been contradicted or undermined by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing.
    


            These issues have been particularly notable in three prominent incidents: the arrest of a WGN employee, the shooting of a US citizen accused of ramming police vehicles and ICE's detention of a 13-year-old in Massachusetts.
    


            A closer look at the incidents underscores the broader skepticism of the Department of Homeland Security's statements as federal agents have moved into city streets in Chicago and elsewhere.
    


            Last week, a federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, saying its statements about protests were “not reliable.” The administration had highlighted several arrests for carrying weapons and assaulting federal agents – but the judge responded that federal grand juries had refused to indict at least three of those arrested, indicating a lack of probable cause.
    


            “In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor by these affiants, it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” US District Court Judge April Perry wrote in her order of those incidents.
    


Chase involving federal agents led to a crash and angry community response in Chicago



            A judge openly questioning the credibility of law enforcement reflects a larger problem and raises questions as to what recourse ordinary citizens or immigrants have when accused.
    


            “A lawyer's credibility isn't just about personal integrity; it's a factor judges are required to consider when ruling,” said Elliot Williams, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. “Simply put, parties lose when courts find their lawyers untrustworthy. DHS's problem is how alarmingly consistent judges have been with their questions about the department's work and its attorneys' trustworthiness.”
    


            The Trump administration has appealed the ruling. DHS has said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst,” and its agents are facing a surge in attacks against them.
    


            To understand this credibility issue, CNN took a closer look at DHS statements about the three high-profile incidents involving federal immigration enforcement.
    


            Asked about the contradictions between the DHS statements and other evidence, a spokesperson said, “We stand by everything we have previously said.”
    


            Video from a bystander last week captured the arrest of an employee working for the Chicago TV station WGN.
    


            In the video, officers put the employee, Debbie Brockman, in handcuffs while she lies prone on the ground, her pants falling down. The officers then put her in an unmarked vehicle and leave the scene.
    


            “I asked the agents like, well, why are you detaining this person?” Josh Thomas, the witness who took the video of the arrest, told CNN. “They basically tell me she's obstructing justice.”
    


            Thomas said he did not witness Brockman's interaction with the agents before she was detained.
    


            Brockman was released without charges – either for obstructing justice or assault – after about seven hours of detention, according to her attorneys.
    


            After the video spread on social media, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X that the arrest came as US Border Patrol was driving around conducting immigration enforcement.
    


            “Deborah Brockman, a U.S. citizen, threw objects at Border Patrol's car and she was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer,” McLaughlin said.
    


            In a statement, her attorneys disputed McLaughlin's version of events and said she was attacked by federal agents while on her morning commute.
    


            “Ms. Brockman and her legal team adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone. Rather, Ms. Brockman was the one who was violently assaulted by federal agents on her way to work,” the attorneys said.
    


            DHS's statements about the shooting of a 30-year-old US citizen have been undermined by a criminal complaint and by an attorney who watched body-camera footage of the incident.
    


            Marimar Martinez, the US citizen, was arrested and shot multiple times by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago on October 4.
    


            McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary, said in a post on X that multiple drivers, one of whom was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” rammed a law enforcement vehicle.
    


            “Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” she said.
    


            A DHS press release repeated the allegation that Martinez was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” Together, the statements gave the impression Martinez had been brandishing her firearm when she was shot.
    


            Martinez was charged in federal court with forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. The criminal complaint, though, does not mention a semi-automatic weapon or that Martinez was armed.
    


            Instead, the complaint alleges Martinez drove into and side-swiped a CBP vehicle. When an agent got out of the vehicle, Martinez drove at the agent, who fired about five shots at Martinez, the complaint states.

            In court Wednesday, Assistant US Attorney Aaron Richard Bond said Martinez “forcibly impeded Border Patrol agents,” and that the case involved a dangerous weapon – a motor vehicle. Martinez pleaded not guilty.
    


            Martinez's attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN she has a concealed-carry license and had a handgun in her purse, inside a holster with the snap closed. “(It was) never brought out in this incident,” he said.
    


            Parente has disputed the government's account generally as well. He said he viewed body-camera footage, which has not been made public, that he said shows a CBP vehicle swerved into Martinez's vehicle — not the other way around. Then, “within seconds,” an officer jumped out of his vehicle and fired at Martinez, Parente said.
    


            “Normally in a criminal case I would not speak to the media until the case is over, but there is such misinformation out there that the public needs to see this is not what they've been sold by the government,” Parente told CNN.
    


            “I think anybody who sees what's going on today is going to question these indictments coming out of the Department of Justice,” he added.
    


            A 13-year-old in Everett, Massachusetts, was detained by ICE and moved to a different state last week in a case in which local officials have contradicted a key statement from a DHS official.
    


            The arrest took place October 9 when police called Josiele Berto, the mother of 13-year-old Arthur, to say her son had been arrested. The teenager was then detained by ICE and moved to Virginia, she soon learned.
    


            The Berto family is from Brazil and have had a pending asylum application since arriving in the US in 2021, Berto said.
    


            McLaughlin, the DHS official, posted on X what she said were the “facts” of the case, saying the teenager “was in possession of a firearm and 5-7 inch knife when arrested.”
    


            Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria said a teenage boy – who he did not name because he is a juvenile – was arrested after Everett Police received a “credible tip” accusing him of making “a violent threat against another boy within our public school.”
    


            He confirmed the presence of the knife but was adamant that the teen did not have a firearm. “No guns were found,” DeMaria said.
    


            DHS did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the discrepancy between the statements by McLaughlin and DeMaria over whether the child had a gun.
    


            Credibility questions have long trailed law enforcement agencies, whether federal or local, and police statements immediately after an arrest have occasionally proved to be incorrect or misleading. The murder of George Floyd, for example, was initially described by Minneapolis Police as, “Man dies after medical incident during police interaction.”
    


            Juliette Kayyem, CNN senior national security analyst and former DHS executive, said misleading claims can be exposed in the modern age.
    


            “In an era where everyone has a camera in their pocket, social media has been flooded with videos of immigration operations,” she said. “DHS must seriously understand that any blatantly misleading claim about tactics can often be easily disproved in this new digital age, especially if they're happening frequently.”
    


Federal judge demands answers from Trump admin on following order to avoid violent encounters with Chicago protesters



            The credibility questions have also placed a spotlight on one law enforcement tool often missing from immigration enforcement operations: body-worn cameras. The technology is a staple at police departments across the country, documenting encounters with the public and helping clarify questionable incidents and competing claims.
    


            On Thursday, a federal judge in Chicago questioned whether federal law enforcement agents are following an earlier order and said she will require all agents with body cameras to have them on during encounters with immigration protesters.
    


            “That's the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” she said.

South Carolina's leading cities have systemically embedded diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives into their master plans, sparking outcry from top officials. 

Columbia, Charleston, Greenville, and Spartanburg are among the cities that have incorporated extensive DEI measures into foundational blueprints, including economic development, safety, transportation, housing, cultural, police, and fire department plans, according to an investigation by the Washington Examiner.

Upon reviewing those measures, several South Carolina lawmakers, including Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), who is campaigning to become the state's next governor, are speaking out, saying DEI has “no place” in the state. South Carolina Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, also a GOP gubernatorial candidate, has added her voice to the fray, arguing that such policies are “dangerous and undermine public safety.” And the Justice Department said it is on “high alert,” warning that “DEI initiatives, such as these in South Carolina, risk violating citizens' constitutional protections of fairness and equal treatment under the law.” 

“Taxpayer dollars should never be used to enforce policies and initiatives that give preferential treatment based on unlawful racial discrimination,” Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice Harmeet Dhillon said in a statement. “This Division will be on high alert to ensure all American cities respect our nation's civil rights laws.”

While South Carolina is a solidly red state, Judge Glock, director of research at the Manhattan Institute, said he's not surprised DEI programs are active in its cities. That's partly because most red states haven't passed comprehensive laws banning DEI or explicit racial preferences in all public institutions, he said, and also because the Biden administration's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act often conditioned federal grants for housing and transportation and infrastructure projects on adopting DEI-style policies. This encouraged DEI's spread nationwide, “even in more conservative areas,” Glock said. 

In response to questions, the city said that some DEI policies are being rolled back by Mayor William Cogswell, who last year became the first Republican to assume the position since 1877. 

“The current administration is aware of the concerns raised and is working closely with its legal team to ensure that all city practices comply fully with state and federal law,” Deja Knight McMillan, Charleston's Chief Communications Officer, said.

DEI is ingrained in the city's five-year housing plan. The “Housing for a Fair Charleston” plan for 2025-2029 “focuses on the importance of equity, of acknowledging that there are inherent inequalities present in our society that makes things more difficult for some.” It heralds Seattle's ​​Equitable Development Initiative, which seeks to benefit “historically marginalized communities,” as an example for Charleston.

DEI is endorsed in the city's 2024 budget and capital improvement plan, when speaking of practices set by the Medical University of South Carolina that infuse “diversity, equity, and inclusion across academic programs and at the highest administrative levels.” The plan names ensure “all” Charleston's planning initiatives are “viewed through an equity lens” as a “core responsibility” and describes “helping neighborhoods and organizations grow and develop equitably” as a “core responsibility.”

DEI initiatives are championed in the city's 2022-2026 plan for the Charleston Fire Department, as well as the city's 2020-2025 Strategic Leadership Plan for the Charleston Police Department, which states that “diversity, equity, and inclusion will guide hiring, training, and promotion practices.” The CPD's 2024 report also discusses how to implement DEI-oriented recommendations guarding against “racial bias.”

The fire department's planning documents name “a lack of diversity” and a failure to be “creating an inclusive environment” as a “weakness;” describe goals to improve DEI for members as an “opportunity;” and name as an “objective” plans to “pursue a more diverse and inclusive environment within the CFD” within 1-3 years, including through a recommendation to increase DEI training “for all command staff.” 

The police department's plan states that DEI “will guide hiring, training, and promotion” practices; calls for the hiring of more LGBT people and Hispanics; calls for the “recruitment of women and minority group members to meet and maintain diversity goals,” pointing to goals of up to 37% made by an audit for “racial bias” known as the CNA recommendations; calls for the CPD to “increase diversity” in its Explorers Program and Youth Citizen Academy by 35%; and calls for more police training on “implicit bias,” “diversity issues,” “cultural awareness and sensitivity.”

The CPD's report discusses the implementation of the CNA recommendations. It states that the department “should closely re-examine the demographics of each specialized unit and team to ensure that these teams and units are diverse and inclusive”; and calls for the CPD to produce an annual demographic profile of sworn and civilian personnel, “tracking over multiple years gender, race…and other relevant variables pertinent to having a diverse and inclusive department.”

When pressed on DEI embedded in Greenville's blueprints, spokeswoman Beth Brotherton said the city is “committed to ensuring” it complies “with local, state, and federal laws while fostering a community that fairly serves all residents and businesses in alignment with civil rights requirements.”

Greenville has a DEI page on the city's website that links to an LGBTQ+ support page. That page notes Greenville has a separate city LGBTQ+ liaison and another Greenville Police Department LGBTQ+ liaison. The city also has a DEI initiative report, which states, “diversity, equity, and inclusion are at the core of who the City of Greenville is.”

“We are committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in all its forms. These values are an integral component of our culture and business practices and vital to achieving our vision of ensuring equal opportunities and equitable outcomes for all,” the report states. 

The city highlights DEI in the recruiting process, saying “all new hires complete diversity training,” including LGBT and “diversity awareness” courses. It states that police department personnel undergo “fair and impartial, implicit and explicit bias, [and] racial profiling” training.

DEI is playing a key role in developing Greenville's Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Master Plan. Agency, the firm the city hired to carry out the PRT plan, says on its website that it holds a “mission-driven practice dedicated to addressing social equity,” adding that “diversity and inclusion are foundational to how we see, understand, and, ultimately, shape” public spaces, parks, and streets in cities.

Key issues that must be considered in the PRT Master plan include the “assurance that all policies and practices are inclusive and equitable…[and] implementation of initiatives that support diversity, equity, and inclusion in all endeavors,” according to the city website, which applauds Agency for holding a “strong commitment to equity and inclusion.”

Greenville's Economic Development Strategic Plan speaks of making DEI “an economic development goal.” Resonance, the firm leading that plan, says on its website that: “We believe that absolute economic results are not enough, and that growth and the opportunities it creates should be as shared and equitable as possible.”

The plan states that Greenville must be “intentional about inclusivity and make equitable infrastructure” investments; asserts “mindful economic development” recognizes “areas of inequity;” calls for support and training programs specific to “minority-owned businesses to create a level playing field;” and calls for “a citywide DEI study to better understand challenges and opportunities.”

When pressed for comment about themes of DEI threaded throughout city documents, including its 2036 plan, which is branded as the “blueprint” for how South Carolina's state capitol will develop over the next decade, a Columbia official called the plan “old.”

The city is committed to aligning with all federal and state government precedents and standards with a priority for compliance, the official said. However, as a whole, Columbia still plans to follow the strategic direction of the plan, while it is not set on strictly adhering to its practices, the official said.

The plan's economic development component names “equity” as one of the six criteria for consideration of gateway and corridor improvements. It asks the city to consider: “Does the project benefit underserved communities?” And it recommends an “Equity composite measure” that weighs families living near or below the poverty line, non-white populations, and non or limited English speaking households. 

The plan's transportation component notes that the city historically focused on five components: engineering, education, encouragement, enforcement, and evaluation & planning. The city noted it will add equity as a sixth component, because “improving safety is also a question of equity.” It recommends that when Columbia develops a transportation project prioritization framework, the city consider equity because it is“ critical both to the existing conditions analysis and the recommendations of the plan,” and states that for the report, “an equity analysis that took into account the location of vulnerable populations was critical to the planning process.”

The 2036 plan's cultural resources component states that stakeholders “advocated for embracing diversity and dismantling inequitable systems by examining unconscious bias in the allocation of public resources dedicated to supporting arts and culture;” and notes “a desire to invest in inclusion” so Columbia can create a “more equitable future.”

The city's ten-year plan for its communities facilities component calls for data to be collected regarding city policies that “incentivize or require resiliency and equity in projects or developments”; issues a recommendation calling for the city to “examine, revise, and expand procurement procedures” to ensure contractors “are more reflective” of Charleston's population; and notes recommendations to advance contracts for LGBT-owned firms, pointing to an effort from Nashville that allowed offificials to “better understand the availability of LGBT firms and assess if it is contracting with them equitably.”

The community's facilities component additionally calls for city-wide training focused “on sensitivity and inclusion,” including about “gender identity terms and concepts, the city's Fair and Impartial Policing policy, microaggressions, and implicit bias issues … to ensure members of minority or vulnerable communities” are treated with empathy; and heralds the Richland County Sheriff's Department Gay and Lesbian Liaison Office's “specialized customer service” for the LGBT community as a model. 

Spartanburg did not respond to a request for comment about DEI elements in planning documents, including the county's 2025 report on its recovery plan for fiscal funds, which states goals “to promote equitable outcomes.” 

DEI measures are systematically incorporated into the county's Safety Action Plan, released in 2024, Spartanburg's 2024-2028 consolidated city plan, and its 2023 city plan. The latter document contained eleven recommendations to “increase diversity and inclusion” in the business community; another ten recommendations for implementing “equity” overall, including by requiring DEI training for “staff at all levels to hold everyone accountable;” and applauded the city-run One Spartanburg Inc. and its Inclusion Council as a “model,” naming “the major initiative of Diversity and Inclusion as a core focus.”

The city website continues to note its Human Resources Department seeks employees who support “inclusion.” The website also contains a page called the “Office of Strategic Partnerships and Opportunities,” formerly known as the office of “Equity and Inclusion,” which is focused on building “an inclusive and equitable culture.”

The website references goals to promote training “for equity and inclusion for City employees, and to create data-driven solutions to address equity and inclusion” in Spartanburg. “We work closely….to build a collaborative network of staff and residents who put equity and inclusion at the forefront of all we do,” it adds.

Spartanburg's 2024-2028 plan warns that the city's affordable housing plan “lacks equity focus;” says select communities will begin to develop “Equity Plans;” and states that the city “has committed to an equity-focused plan” to address “barriers.”

During a meeting about the Safety Action Plan, the City Council said that making residents safer “cannot succeed without a focus on equity and identifying communities that have disproportionate traffic safety impacts.”

CONSERVATIVES FIND DEVIL IN THE DETAILS IN WAR ON DEI

The plan says “equity is integrated throughout” the safety blueprint; identifies impacts on “historically disadvantaged communities to set a foundation for equitable actions;” and calls for “Equitable Transportation Communities” that identify census tracts as “disadvantaged”  based on “social vulnerability, transportation insecurity, health vulnerability, environmental burden, and climate and disaster risk.” 

The plan calls for an “Equity Analysis Framework” to identify communities that have “disproportionate safety.” The analysis holds “the express purpose of influencing the decision-making.” Recognizing that traffic violence holds “disproportionate impacts on people of color, low-income households, and other communities that have been marginalized, focusing interventions and improvements to serve these communities advances equity,” it says.

Ahead of the nationwide "No Kings" protests, Public Citizen Co-President Lisa Gilbert told Fox News Digital why demonstrators are rallying against what they see as king-like behavior from the Trump administration.

New York City organizers embedded in the global intifada to destroy the state of Israel moved Friday to join the controversial "No Kings" protests planned for today, despite the peace deal reached between Israel and Hamas.

"UAW Labor for Palestine" and "NYC Labor for Palestine" quietly posted a call-to-action for the "Palestine Labor Solidarity Contingent" to meet Saturday at 11 a.m. at Duarte Square between Grand Street and Canal Street in lower Manhattan and then flow into the #NoKings protests planned to protest President Donald Trump.

They're not alone. Around the country, anti-Israel blocs are slotting themselves into the "No Kings" protests as a "Palestine Contingent" and "Socialist Contingent," positioning their messages "front and center," as Seattle activists put it, "from Providence to Palestine."

‘NO KINGS' ORGANIZER DISCOURAGES VIOLENCE FOLLOWING COAST-TO-COAST ARRESTS

The alignment underscores a strategic pivot in the global intifada's next phase, experts say, carrying the anti-Israel message into any high-energy civic protest, even after Hamas agreed to a ceasefire by linking "Free Palestine" to domestic fights like ICE, police and "fascism."

Billionaire donor George Soros is reportedly funding many of the organizations leading the "No Kings" protests, like Indivisible, whose co-founders, Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin, received a $3 million two-year grant last year from Soros's Open Society Foundations for "social welfare activities." Details about the "Palestine Contingent" weaving into the "No Kings" protests raises new questions about the way big Democratic donors like Soros are funneling nonprofit dollars into a professional protest industry that is fractious, divisive and partisan, potentially in violation of tax and nonprofit laws.

‘NO KINGS' MOVEMENT AND WHAT IT WANTS: INSIDE THE MESSAGE DRIVING SATURDAY'S NATIONWIDE PROTESTS

Behind the emotion and patriotic imagery of the protests, a Fox News Digital investigation revealed that the movement's polished "pro-democracy" branding masks a coordinated network of Democratic tax-exempt nonprofits and labor unions, political action committees, coalitions and for-profit protest consultants that include some of the most virulent activists against Israel, including self-declared socialist groups like the Party for Socialism and Liberation, Democratic Socialists of America and Students for a Democratic Society. 

According to a public database of the protest's organizers, compiled by the Pearl Project, a journalism initiative, the protest's "partners" include 265 mostly nonprofit organizations, including some anti-Israel groups, like Jewish Voice for Peace, exploiting their nonprofit benefits to wage a political war against the sitting president. Their nonprofit status shields them from paying taxes on most of their total annual revenues of $2.9 billion, even while they engage in partisan work they aren't supposed to be doing. Critics say they are allegedly skirting, if not violating, tax and nonprofit laws. Event organizers didn't return requests for comment.

"They call it ‘No Kings,' but what they've built is an empire of tax-exempt organizations doing the Democratic Party's work on the taxpayer's dime," said Jennica Pounds, a computer scientist who runs a platform, DataRepublican.com, following the money on these organizations. "They are using every excuse in the book, from immigration to Israel, to rage-bait America. There is nothing ‘charitable' about their professional protest enterprise, and they should be investigated for fomenting so much hate in America behind the shield of ‘charity work.'"

Already, Trump has said that he has directed the Justice Department to investigate possible violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has opened an investigation that follows the money to anti-Israel groups, including some of the groups who will be bringing their protest signs to the "No Kings" demonstrations. 

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital, "The Trump administration and the Republican Congress are committed to countering this network of left-wing violence."

Last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson called the protests a "hate America rally." Indeed, on June 14, at the "No Kings" protest in Philadelphia, activists from the "Palestinian Contingent," including activists from the Council on American-Islamic Relations and Democratic Socialists of America, hissed as a woman sang the national anthem. 

"Booooo! Boooooo!" they yelled, covering their faces in keffiyehs, carrying Palestinian flags and heckling bystanders, "Zionist!"

While organizers insist the movement transcends party lines, its structure tells a different story. 

The protest network's official "partners" include 24 Democratic political action committees that make no secret of their partisan agenda, dedicated to electing Democratic politicians. Among them are the mega-organizing groups Indivisible Action, Hollywood Democrats and the Democratic National Committee's Washtenaw County Democratic Party in Michigan, Westside Democratic Headquarters in Los Angeles, Wellstone Democratic Renewal Club in northern California, 504 Democratic Club and College Democrats of America.

"They call it ‘No Kings,' but what they've built is an empire of tax-exempt organizations doing the Democratic Party's work on the taxpayer's dime."  — Jennica Pounds, of DataRepublican.com

The motto of Field Team 6, another political action committee, is "Register Democrats. Save the World." However, those PACs are just one layer of a much larger partisan infrastructure. 

About one-third, or 79 groups, behind the "No Kings" protests hold 501(c)(3) status, meaning their donors receive tax deductions while the groups face strict restrictions to do "charitable" work, not political work. They are supposed to be nonpartisan. Yet most have clearly stated political agendas. 

On its donation page, one of the protest partners, "Build the Resistance," states a partisan mission to "fight against autocracy, fascism, and donald [sic]." Donations go to Oil and Gas Action Network, a 501(c)(3) that reported $1.9 million in revenues in its last tax filing.

Another 100 are 501(c)(4) political nonprofits that may do limited lobbying but still cannot devote themselves primarily to political work. Meanwhile, 24 are 501(c)(5) labor union nonprofits, like the labor unions marching against Israel in New York and the San Francisco Bay Area, that also have limits on the amount of political work they can do.

It's clear that the protests are all about politics. The protest's own internal online "toolkit" mentions Trump 12 times and describes the mobilization explicitly as a direct stand against "the Trump administration," "Trump and his enablers," "President Trump's authoritarian takeover" in a partisan-centered campaign.

In Rhode Island, the "Free Palestine Contingent" activists will march "FROM PROVIDENCE TO PALESTINE" to "FIGHT FASCISM! FIGHT GENOCIDE." It connects the battles against ICE law enforcement officers and the battles of Palestinians, noting, "Military occupations and ICE violence are wreaking havoc in Black and brown communities in D.C., L.A., Chicago — and here in Providence. On the streets of U.S. cities, the same weapons and surveillance technologies the Israeli military has used to devastate Gaza are being used in escalated ways against us. What we allow fascists to do in Palestine, they will do to the entire world — and it is our duty to resist them and fight for a free Palestine.

In northern California, activists at "Bay Area Labor 4 Palestine" and Service Employees International Union Local 1021 announced yesterday, "The fight for a liberated Palestine is not over and cannot be ignored," over a graphic for the "No Kings" protest. They instructed followers to "Bring flags, signs, keffiyehs and art" to the "No Kings" march in Oakland, Calif., at Wilma Chan Park off Jackson Street. 

In New York City, the "Palestine Labor Solidarity Contingent" said its message would be very specific: "STOP ARMING ISRAEL! FUND OUR COMMUNITIES, NOT GENOCIDE & OCCUPATION! END ICE, MILITARY & POLICE TERROR…HANDS OF VENEZUELA!"

Across the country, in Washington state, activists from "Seattle Against War" yesterday celebrated local organizers adding an anti-Israel activist, Tariq Ra'ouf, to the official #NoKings speaker lineup, noting it will be a "great opportunity for us to support the demands of Palestinians from the belly of the beast!"

The Party for Socialism and Liberation's local chapter in Syracuse, N.Y., posted a similar poster with the local chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, which has Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani as its political candidate in New York City.

In Charlotte, N.C., the local chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation put out a call to members to assemble at 10 a.m. tomorrow for the local #NoKings protest at First Ward Park: "JOIN THE PALESTINE CONTINGENT @ THE ‘NO KINGS' RALLY…MEET AT THE PLAYGROUND."

With local partners, including the 501(c)(3) nonprofit Jewish Voice for Peace, activists at the Party for Socialism and Liberation noted that, post-ceasefire, they will "continue to fight for a free Palestine." Some of the groups in the Palestine Contingent are part of the wider network of publicly acknowledged partners of the protests, like 50501.

In Eugene, Ore., activists with the Party for Socialism and Liberation are rallying members to meet the "Socialist Contingent" at the corner of Mill Road and Eighth Avenue to "march for a free Palestine" and get ICE officers "OUT of our communities."

In Portland, a local Palestinian American activist announced, "The Nakba Is Still Not Over!" in a reference to the "humiliation" over the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. She summoned activists to the "No Kings" protests: "‼️SHOW UP FOR PALESTINE‼️"

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shohei Ohtani propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers back to the World Series with a two-way performance for the ages.

Ohtani hit three mammoth homers and struck out 10 while pitching shutout ball into the seventh inning, and the Dodgers swept the Milwaukee Brewers out of the National League Championship Series with a 5-1 victory in Game 4 on Friday night.

“That was probably the greatest postseason performance of all time,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “There's been a lot of postseason games. And there's a reason why he's the greatest player on the planet.” 

The Dodgers will have a chance to become baseball's first repeat World Series champions in a quarter-century after this mind-blowing night for the three-time MVP, who emphatically ended a quiet postseason by his lofty standards. Ohtani was selected the NLCS MVP essentially on the strength of this one unforgettable game.

“This time around it was my turn to be able to perform,” he said through his interpreter.

After striking out three in the top of the first inning, Ohtani hit the first leadoff homer by a pitcher in major league history off Brewers starter Jose Quintana.

Ohtani followed with a 469-foot drive in the fourth, clearing a pavilion roof in right-center.

He added a third solo shot in the seventh, becoming the 12th big league player to hit three homers in a postseason game. His three homers traveled a combined 1,342 feet.




Ohtani also thoroughly dominated the Brewers in his second career postseason start on the mound, allowing just two hits during his first double-digit strikeout game in a Dodgers uniform. He didn't give up a hit until the fourth, and he fanned two Brewers in the fourth, fifth and sixth.

“Sometimes you've got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he's not just made of steel,” said teammate Freddie Freeman, last season's World Series MVP. “Absolutely incredible. Biggest stage, and he goes out and does something like that. It'll probably be remembered as the Shohei Ohtani game.”

After the Brewers' first two batters reached in the seventh, Ohtani left the mound to a stadium-shaking ovation — and after Alex Vesia escaped the jam, Ohtani celebrated by hitting his third homer in the bottom half.

The powerhouse Dodgers are the first team to win back-to-back pennants since Philadelphia in 2009. Los Angeles is back in the World Series for the fifth time in nine seasons, and it will attempt to become baseball's first repeat champs since the New York Yankees won three straight World Series from 1998 to 2000.

“That was special,” Freeman said. “We've just been playing really good baseball for a while now, and the inevitable kind of happened today — Shohei. Oh my God. I'm still speechless.”

Following a 9-1 rampage through the NL playoffs, the Dodgers are headed to the World Series for the 23rd time in franchise history, including 14 pennants since moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Only the Yankees, last year's opponent, have made more appearances in the Fall Classic (41).

Los Angeles will have a week off before the World Series begins next Friday, either in Toronto or at Dodger Stadium against Seattle. The Mariners beat the Blue Jays 6-2 earlier Friday to take a 3-2 lead in the ALCS, which continues Sunday at Rogers Centre.

The Dodgers had never swept an NLCS in 16 previous appearances, but they became only the fifth team to sweep this series while thoroughly dominating a Milwaukee club that led the major leagues with 97 wins during the season. Los Angeles is the first team to sweep a best-of-seven postseason series since 2022, and the first to sweep an NLCS since Washington in 2019.

“Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,” Roberts shouted to the crowd during the on-field celebration. “Let's get four more wins and really ruin baseball!”

The NL Central champion Brewers were eliminated by the Dodgers for the third time during their current stretch of seven playoff appearances in eight years. Even after setting a franchise record for wins this season, Milwaukee is still waiting for its first World Series appearance since 1982.

“We were part of tonight an iconic, maybe the best individual performance ever in a postseason game,” Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. “I don't think anybody can argue with that. A guy punches out 10 and hits three homers.”

The Brewers had never been swept in a playoff series longer than a best-of-three, but their bats fell silent in the NLCS against the Dodgers' brilliant starting rotation. Los Angeles' four starters combined to pitch 28 2/3 innings with two earned runs allowed and 35 strikeouts.

“I really think that to beat us four games in a row, you've got to do a lot of things right,” outfielder Blake Perkins said. “Some things had to go their way that didn't go our way. We hit a lot of balls at people. But either way, Ohtani did great today. Is he the greatest player ever? I don't know. But he sure seemed like it tonight.”

The Dodgers added two more runs in the first after Ohtani's tone-setting homer, with Mookie Betts and Will Smith both singling and scoring.

Jackson Chourio doubled leading off the fourth for Milwaukee's first hit, but Ohtani stranded him.

Struggling Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen allowed two more baserunners in the eighth, and Caleb Durbin scored when Brice Turang beat out his potential double-play grounder before Anthony Banda ended the inning.

Roki Sasaki pitched the ninth in the latest successful relief outing for the Dodgers' unlikely rookie closer.

            At this point, even the concept of an “AI bubble” seems to be a bubble. (In fact, Deutsche Bank analysts said last month that the “AI bubble” bubble has already burst.)
    


            Perhaps some corners of the internet are bored of the bubble talk. That's not making the market any less, um, bubbly.
    


            Just this week, the Financial Times wrote that 10 AI startups — not a dollar in profit among them — have gained nearly $1 trillion in market value over the past 12 months. (That is, to use a technical term, bananas.)
    


            Even as Wall Street analysts and tech media increasingly question the hype, drawing uneasy comparisons to the late 1990s, the AI industry's response has been to shrug and watch their valuations tick higher and higher. The AI faithful believe the technology will disrupt (in a good way, hopefully!) virtually every aspect of modern life, from phone operating systems to pharmaceuticals to finance. And even if there is a bubble, proponents say, the dot-com bubble gave us companies like Amazon, and the internet became, well, the internet.
    


Yet another OpenAI financial entanglement is renewing fears of a repeat of the dot-com era



            There are plenty of skeptics countering the AI hype machine, though few professional market analysts have done so as stridently as Julien Garran, a researcher and partner at the UK firm MacroStrategy Partnership.
    


            Earlier this month, Garran published a report claiming that we are in “the biggest and most dangerous bubble the world has ever seen.” Garran concludes that there is a “misallocation of capital in the US” that makes the current frenzy 17 times bigger than the dot-com bubble and four times bigger than the 2008 real-estate bubble.
    


            That is, needless to say, a bold claim about a phenomenon that is famously hard to predict.
    


            I sat down (virtually) with Garran earlier this week to talk bubbles and why he thinks the AI fervor is, to quote his report, not just “a bit bad” but rather “the antithesis of socio-economic progress.”
    


The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. 



Nightcap: Your latest AI report made a lot of waves among finance and tech media junkies like myself. Can you walk me through the top lines? 



            At the heart of the note is a golden rule I've developed, which is that if you use large language model AI to create an application or a service, it can never be commercial.
    


            One of the reasons is the way they were built. The original large language model AI was built using vectors to try and understand the statistical likelihood that words follow each other in the sentence. And while they're very clever, and it's a very good bit of engineering required to do it, they're also very limited.
    


            The second thing is the way LLMs were applied to coding. What they've learned from — the coding that's out there, both in and outside the public domain — means that they're effectively showing you rote learned pieces of code. That's, again, going to be limited if you want to start developing new applications.
    


            And the third set of problems, in terms of how it's built, is around the idea of scaling. There's a real problem at a certain point in terms of how much you have to spend to improve them. I'd say it's definite that (developers) have hit a scaling wall. Otherwise they'd be releasing demonstrably better and better models each time they came to came to market with a new product. And since ChatGPT 4 came out in March of 2023, they haven't actually raised the bar significantly.
    


Nightcap: What about the argument that ChatGPT, while not perfect, is capable of doing some low-level grunt work could increase productivity?



Garran: There are certain bullsh*t jobs out there — some parts of management, consultancy, jobs where people don't check if you're getting it right or don't know if you've got it right. So you can argue that you can replace bullsh*t with bullsh*t, and, yes, OK, I'm prepared to accept that you probably can, but that doesn't really make it more broadly useful.
    


Nightcap: So how should regular people think about all the huge sums of money churning through the industry? 



Garran: The AI ecosystem can't really sustain itself. You have Nvidia making a ton of money … Anybody else — the data centers, the the LLM developers, the software developers that use LLMs — they're all heavily loss-making.
    


            Consequently, to maintain the process, you need to have a continued funding, which is why it looks like a permanent funding tour. But despite all of this, there's no obvious way that they actually turn this around to a profit. It's hope over realistic expectation … When you run out of investors, then the whole thing is going to roll over.
    


Nightcap: Are investors actually pulling back?



Garran: The amount of (venture capital) willingness to fund some of these startups, especially the software developers, is beginning to diminish because they're valued so highly. That leaves you with with basically SoftBank, which has had to raise a lot of debt against its shares to fund the first tranche of the OpenAI commitment that it made, and it's still got a bigger second tranche to fund.
    


            You've got foreign states like, say, Saudi Arabia. But there aren't many countries who have unlimited spending power. And that then leaves Nvidia as sort of last man standing.
    


Nightcap: Are we in the process of deflating, or is the bubble still growing?



Garran:  With AI, I can't say it's starting to deflate. We're just a week past all-time highs, so it'd be kind of arrogant to say that was definitely the top. But it's certainly drawing closer.
    


Nightcap: I have to ask, because I ask myself this all the time: What if you're wrong? What if the hype is real?



Garran:  Well, there are two ways I'd be wrong.
    


            One is, it just takes longer to break than I thought. Which, to be honest, it already has. And what happens if I'm wrong in that way, is simply that they continue building things that aren't fundamentally useful to the economic society.
    


            If it carries on for another year or another two years because they managed to persuade someone to provide funding, the more people are doing stuff that's not going to make a return. The future is not going to be as bright. Future (gross domestic product) will be lower than it would be if they didn't do this stuff, and they just went about doing some mundane things that people actually valued.
    


            And if I'm completely wrong… (and) someone could come up with “superintelligence,” well, that completely changes the world, and we'd be depending on whoever controlled the systems. We could be in a utopia of sorts, or we could be in “Brave New World.” Or we could be in a utopia like “Player Piano,” the Kurt Vonnegut book where everyone's employed, apart from some people living in their ivory towers.
    


            To be honest, I think that is beyond our current capability as an industrial society to pull it off. If that starts changing, then I'll change my mind very quickly. I just haven't seen it.

            As President Donald Trump weighs military action inside Venezuela, building up forces in the Caribbean and flying B-52 bombers off the country's coast this week, Nicolás Maduro is responding in kind, repositioning troops, mobilizing “millions” of militia and denouncing US activity in the region – a sign of defiance from the strongman as the two leaders are locked in a standoff.
    


            Trump administration officials have privately acknowledged that the intensifying US pressure campaign is aimed at ousting Maduro, a goal that was also a target of Trump's first term in office when the White House recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of the country in 2019. But as the Trump team ratchets up the pressure this fall, Maduro has in turn ramped up the rhetoric and propaganda for Venezuelans while calling for new military exercises by the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, which has some 123,000 members.
    


            In recent weeks, the US military has moved warships and other weaponry into the region and has targeted boats off the Venezuelan coast it says are transporting drugs. Then on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he'd authorized the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela and said the United States was considering strikes on Venezuelan territory.
    


            “We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,” the president told reporters Wednesday.
    


Trump's politically dicey saber-rattling in Venezuela



            Maduro has claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops' training. As of October 17, 20 out of 23 Venezuelan states have been militarized as part of the Maduro's military mobilizations, called Independence 200.
    


            On his Truth Social account last month, Trump mocked a video of women, some who appeared to be overweight, running with guns during a purported training for the Venezuelan militia.
    


            The Trump administration has been quietly laying the groundwork for potential military action inside Venezuela for months by tying Maduro to drug traffickers and cartels that officials have designated as terror groups who pose an imminent threat to the US. But to date, there is no indication that Trump has decided to take that step or target the Venezuelan leader directly.
    


            Instead, the goal has been to pressure Maduro to step down on his own, sources told CNN, in part by establishing a credible threat of US military action if he does not. The recent strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean are a clear message to Maduro, the sources said, noting the administration has been very intentional about linking the Venezuelan leader to trafficking groups and cartels.
    


            Trump said Wednesday that he authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on the flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation, but stopped short of saying they would be attempting to remove Maduro. The remarks are Trump's most expansive comments on his decision to expand the CIA's authority to conduct lethal targeting and carry out covert action in the region, which CNN first reported last week.
    


            In a televised speech Wednesday, Maduro denounced what he described as the CIA's record of regime change and coups d'état around the world.
    


            “But our people are clear, united, and aware. They have the means to once again defeat this open conspiracy against the peace and stability of Venezuela,” he said on state television.
    


Trump's moves against Venezuela sound familiar for a reason



            In Venezuela, daily life has continued despite the looming possibility of armed conflict with the United States. Near downtown Caracas, at the Teresa Carreño Theater, a sold-out musical premiered just days after a well-known salsa party brought together more than 1,000 people in the west of the city.
    


            But Venezuelans are increasingly discussing the US warships in the Caribbean Sea and the fear of a possible US attack. “Venezuelans live in anxiety thinking about what might happen,” said Ivonne Caña.
    


            Caña, who is a cook, said she lives in uncertainty and, worried about her family, has been buying a little more food than usual to stock up at home. The fear, she said, is felt most at night: “We don't sleep well.”
    


            Some Venezuelans are cautiously showing their support for the US pressure on Maduro. In recent days, banners bearing messages such as “It's happening… freedom loading 95%” have been displayed on at least 10 university campuses across the country — a form of peaceful protest in spaces where political issues are seldom addressed due to fear of government reprisal.
    


            Meanwhile, Maduro has further cracked down on civil liberties in Venezuela. At the end of September, the government announced that the president had signed a decree of “external commotion,” which he described as “a constitutional defense tool in case the country faces a military aggression.”
    


            The state of emergency decree would allow Maduro to restrict constitutional guarantees and, according to analysts, would grant him broad political, social and economic powers.
    


            As Maduro has accused the US administration of trying to steal the country's oil wealth, the nearby American military presence has drawn closer. Three US Air Force B-52 bombers flew off the coast of Venezuela for more than four hours on Wednesday, according to open-source flight data reviewed by CNN. The bombers took off from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana before dawn.
    


            Two of them kept their location beacons activated inside Venezuela's flight information region (FIR), at one point coming within 53 miles of La Orchila Island, where Maduro's forces carried out drills last month.
    


            At their closest point, the planes flew 132 miles from the Venezuelan mainland, at around 11:20 a.m. local time. The bombers remained in a part of Venezuela's flight information region that is international airspace but controlled by the country's aviation authority. Venezuela's FIR extends far beyond the country's airspace.
    


            Multiple sources told CNN that the recent US military strikes on drug boats are just the beginning of a larger effort to rid the region of narcotics trafficking and potentially dislodge Maduro from power. The military has carried out at least six strikes to date on six separate boats in the Caribbean.
    


            The argument that drug traffickers pose an imminent threat to Americans is at the core of the Trump administration's classified legal justification for carrying out military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean — and potentially beyond.
    


            The Justice Department opinion also includes a secret and expansive list of groups the Trump administration argues can now be treated as enemy combatants, rather than criminals, and thus summarily killed without due process at the president's direction.
    


            The opinion is significant, legal experts said, because it appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of groups and potentially offers a pretext for unilateral US military action against a broad array of targets in the region.
    


            At the Pentagon, some military lawyers, including international law experts within DoD's Office of General Counsel, have raised concerns about the legality of the lethal strikes on suspected drug traffickers, sources familiar with the matter said.
    


            But multiple Pentagon lawyers previously told CNN that internal dissent is unlikely to dissuade the Trump administration from continuing its military campaign in the region.

            The latest indication of internal concerns over these strikes emerged on Thursday when the admiral overseeing US Southern Command, which has responsibility for forces in the Caribbean, announced he is retiring just one year into his tenure.
    


            Tensions had been simmering between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Adm. Alvin Holsey for weeks before the admiral announced he was leaving, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            Hegseth did not believe Holsey was moving quickly or aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Caribbean, and he complained about not being given the information he needed about the operations, the sources said. But SOUTHCOM was concerned about the operations not being lawful, the sources added.
    


            Then, on Friday, the US military detained two survivors of its sixth known strike of alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. This is the first time an American strike has not immediately killed everyone on board, and the two survivors, CNN has reported, are currently detained on a US Navy vessel, raising a host of new legal questions to an already murky picture.

AI headshots are becoming popular on LinkedIn and in professional portfolios as job seekers look for affordable profile pictures to give them an edge.

Since first impressions happen almost entirely through a screen, a clean, appealing photo is as important as a strong resume. And in a competitive job market, a good headshot can make a big difference. But professional photography has long been a financial barrier for many job applicants with an average starting cost for a professional headshot in the U.S. that can easily run up to hundreds of dollars.

Now job seekers are using fast and inexpensive AI tools to replace costly studio sessions.

"When I was at Yale, it was $200 for a 15-minute session for students," said Melanie Fan, head of growth at Plush, an AI-powered online search platform for personalized shopping. "It was really expensive. The process of getting the pictures back, rendering them, looking at which ones I looked the best in, and then sending it back to the photographer for edit."

This frustration has fueled the explosion of AI headshot tools like InstaHeadshots, PhotoPacksAI, HeadshotPro and Aragon AI, services that promise a professional image in minutes starting at under $50. Users simply upload selfies, pick a background, and receive dozens and no photographer is needed.

"After I changed my LinkedIn photo, the amount of inbound I've been getting from companies has skyrocketed," Fan said. "Three to four times more messages from companies."

Design company Canva recently launched its own AI headshot feature, with the goal of offering users a quick way to create realistic headshots and still be able to retouch or restyle them.

According to a recent Canva job market research report, 88% of job seekers believe a polished digital presence influences hiring decisions, which is up 45% from the year before. This is in line with the general uptick in use of AI as part of the application and hiring process, with 90% of hiring managers saying they have used AI to help with the hiring process, and 96% of job seekers who used AI in the application process saying they received callbacks.

Danny Wu, Canva's head of AI products, said the goal wasn't to replace real photography, but to make high quality imagery attainable to everyone no matter the budget or location. Once a user uploads an image, Canva can use AI for adjusting or changing the background, placing something in a different place, and for styling. "This is just a more accessible way to get professional and unique headshots," Wu said.

Anyone with a phone can get a LinkedIn-ready headshot, but the technology's rapid adoption has created new questions about ethics and trust. Many candidates fear looking fake or deceptive and recruiters are on the lookout for AI-generated portraits that look overly smooth or stylized, saying authenticity matters the most.

"It is perceived as risky to use an AI headshot," said Sam DeMase, ZipRecruiter career expert. "While recruiters accept them, a bad AI-generated headshot will put off most recruiters," DeMase said. "A poorly done AI-generated headshot is easily recognized, reads as inauthentic, and can hurt the candidate's chances of being selected."

However, recruiters are struggling to tell if a headshot is AI produced, and the technology will only get better. "It's becoming more and more difficult to tell whether a headshot has been enhanced or generated by AI," DeMase added. 

Chris Bora, founder and principal AI architect of Bora Labs and a former Meta engineer, said he built his own headshot generator, Nova Headshot, after being disappointed by existing options. "Some made me look taller and skinnier," Bora said. "The other ones, they made me look lighter, so it wasn't really me," he said. "You don't need to spend thousands to look professional anymore. You just need a tool that makes you look like yourself on your best day. With Nova, it takes less than ten minutes," Bora said.

Amber Collins, an AI headshot user, said she still feels uneasy about it, especially since not every app gets it right. "There are a lot of bad apps out there," Collins said. "Seven fingers, half a necklace, and the rest of it is gone from your neck. I feel guilty using AI. There's a stigma. I'd 100% prefer to get actual get headshots done," Collins said.

But ultimately, she says, the benefits outweighed the risks. "In this economy, you have to be mindful of where you're going to put your money. I don't need to have my face out there excessively, but having a couple of really good, solid, professional looking headshots is worth it to me," Collins said.

Wu said the goal for job applicants seeking a headshot should be to use Canva's tool to balance realism and creativity without losing their identity.

The tension between tech innovation and accessibility on the one hand, and authenticity on the other, will remain.

A LinkedIn spokesperson told CNBC what while the platform does allow the use of tools, including AI, to enhance or create profile photos, "the photo must reflect your likeness."

"Profile photos that don't comply with our user agreement or professional community policies may be removed," the LinkedIn spokesperson said.

DeMase noted that many job candidates remain hesitant to use an AI headshot. "A headshot is one of the few places you can inject humanity into the job search," he said.

But with job seekers now able to provide the appearance they had access to the same studio lighting, camera, and editing team as the pros, the trend is unlikely to stop. 

A recent survey found that headshot use among job seekers is the highest within the Gen Z and millennial generations. And while recruiters may say they still prefer real photos, AI headshots are becoming harder to spot, and less likely to even be reviewed by humans in the first stages of the application process. A recent study from the HR trade group SHRM found that 66% of human resource professionals are using AI to generate their job descriptions, and 44% are using the technology to review or screen applicant resumes.

Protesting the direction of the country under President Donald Trump, people gathered Saturday in the nation's capital and communities across the U.S. for " No Kings " demonstrations — what the president's Republican Party is calling "Hate America" rallies.

This is the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House and comes against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services, but is testing the core balance of power as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that organizers warn are a slide toward American authoritarianism.

Many protesters were especially angered by attacks on their motives. In Bethesda, Maryland, one held a sign that read "Nothing is more patriotic than protesting."

In nearby Washington, Brian Reymann carried a large American flag and said being called a terrorist all week by Republicans was "pathetic."

"This Is America. I disagree with their politics, but I don't believe that they don't love this country. I believe they are misguided. I think they are power hungry," Reymann said.

Trump himself is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.

"They say they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king," Trump said in a Fox News interview airing early Friday, before he departed for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club. Protests are expected nearby Saturday.

More than 2,600 rallies are planned Saturday in cities large and small, organized by hundreds of coalition partners.

While the earlier protests this year — against Elon Musk's cuts this spring and Trump's June military parade — drew crowds, organizers say this one is uniting the opposition. Top Democrats such as Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders are joining in what organizers view as an antidote to Trump's actions, from the administration's clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids.

"There is no greater threat to an authoritarian regime than patriotic people-power," said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, among the key organizers.

Before noon, several thousand people had gathered in New York City's Times Square, chanting "Trump must go now," and waving sometimes-profane signs with slogans insulting the president and condemning his immigration crackdown. Some people carried American flags.

Retired family doctor Terence McCormally was heading to Arlington National Cemetery to join others walking across the Memorial Bridge that enters Washington directly in front of the Lincoln Memorial. He said the recent deployment of the National Guard made him more wary of police than in the past.

"I really don't like the crooks and conmen and religious zealots who are trying to use the country" for personal gain, McCormally said, "while they are killing and hurting millions of people with bombs."

Americans abroad held smaller rallies in major European cities, waving U.S. flags and chanting slogans.

Republicans have sought to portray Saturday's protesters as far outside the mainstream and a prime reason for the government shutdown, now in its 18th day.

From the White House to Capitol Hill, GOP leaders disparaged the rallygoers as "communists" and "Marxists." They say Democratic leaders, including Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces.

"I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday," said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

"Let's see who shows up for that," Johnson said, listing groups including "antifa types," people who "hate capitalism" and "Marxists in full display."

In a Facebook post, former presidential contender Sanders countered that, "It's a love America rally."

"It's a rally of millions of people all over this country who believe in our Constitution, who believe in American freedom and," he said, pointing at the GOP leadership, "are not going to let you and Donald Trump turn this country into an authoritarian society."

Democrats have refused to vote on legislation that would reopen the government as they demand funding for health care. Republicans say they are willing to discuss the issue later, only after the government reopens.

But for many Democrats, the government closure is also a way to stand up to Trump, and try to push the presidency back to its place in the U.S. system as a co-equal branch of government.

The situation is a potential turnaround from just six months ago, when Democrats and their allies were divided and despondent, unsure about how best to respond to Trump's return to the White House. Schumer in particular was berated by his party for allowing an earlier government funding bill to sail through the Senate without using it to challenge Trump.

In April, the national march against Trump and Elon Musk had 1,300 registered locations. In June, for the first "No Kings" day, there were 2,100 registered locations.

"What we are seeing from the Democrats is some spine," Levin said. "The worst thing the Democrats could do right now is surrender."

Protesting the direction of the country under President Donald Trump, people gathered Saturday in the nation's capital and communities across the U.S. for " No Kings " demonstrations — what the president's Republican Party is calling "Hate America" rallies.

This is the third mass mobilization since Trump's return to the White House and comes against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services, but is testing the core balance of power as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that organizers warn are a slide toward American authoritarianism.

Many protesters were especially angered by attacks on their motives. In Bethesda, Maryland, one held a sign that read "Nothing is more patriotic than protesting."

In nearby Washington, Brian Reymann carried a large American flag and said being called a terrorist all week by Republicans was "pathetic."

"This Is America. I disagree with their politics, but I don't believe that they don't love this country. I believe they are misguided. I think they are power hungry," Reymann said.

Trump himself is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.

"They say they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king," Trump said in a Fox News interview airing early Friday, before he departed for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club. Protests are expected nearby Saturday.

More than 2,600 rallies are planned Saturday in cities large and small, organized by hundreds of coalition partners.

While the earlier protests this year — against Elon Musk's cuts this spring and Trump's June military parade — drew crowds, organizers say this one is uniting the opposition. Top Democrats such as Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders are joining in what organizers view as an antidote to Trump's actions, from the administration's clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids.

"There is no greater threat to an authoritarian regime than patriotic people-power," said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, among the key organizers.

Before noon, several thousand people had gathered in New York City's Times Square, chanting "Trump must go now," and waving sometimes-profane signs with slogans insulting the president and condemning his immigration crackdown. Some people carried American flags.

Retired family doctor Terence McCormally was heading to Arlington National Cemetery to join others walking across the Memorial Bridge that enters Washington directly in front of the Lincoln Memorial. He said the recent deployment of the National Guard made him more wary of police than in the past.

"I really don't like the crooks and conmen and religious zealots who are trying to use the country" for personal gain, McCormally said, "while they are killing and hurting millions of people with bombs."

Americans abroad held smaller rallies in major European cities, waving U.S. flags and chanting slogans.

Republicans have sought to portray Saturday's protesters as far outside the mainstream and a prime reason for the government shutdown, now in its 18th day.

From the White House to Capitol Hill, GOP leaders disparaged the rallygoers as "communists" and "Marxists." They say Democratic leaders, including Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces.

"I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday," said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

"Let's see who shows up for that," Johnson said, listing groups including "antifa types," people who "hate capitalism" and "Marxists in full display."

In a Facebook post, former presidential contender Sanders countered that, "It's a love America rally."

"It's a rally of millions of people all over this country who believe in our Constitution, who believe in American freedom and," he said, pointing at the GOP leadership, "are not going to let you and Donald Trump turn this country into an authoritarian society."

Democrats have refused to vote on legislation that would reopen the government as they demand funding for health care. Republicans say they are willing to discuss the issue later, only after the government reopens.

But for many Democrats, the government closure is also a way to stand up to Trump, and try to push the presidency back to its place in the U.S. system as a co-equal branch of government.

The situation is a potential turnaround from just six months ago, when Democrats and their allies were divided and despondent, unsure about how best to respond to Trump's return to the White House. Schumer in particular was berated by his party for allowing an earlier government funding bill to sail through the Senate without using it to challenge Trump.

In April, the national march against Trump and Elon Musk had 1,300 registered locations. In June, for the first "No Kings" day, there were 2,100 registered locations.

"What we are seeing from the Democrats is some spine," Levin said. "The worst thing the Democrats could do right now is surrender."

If there's a phrase of the day on Wall Street right now, it's "debasement," says Sarah Beaton, director of investment strategy at Madera Wealth Management.

"Everyone's talking about it," she told Business Insider. "That's the boogeyman right now."

So, what is it?

Essentially, investors are worried about the debasement of fiat currencies and sovereign debt assets as government spending and debt levels continue to rise. In simpler terms, they're concerned that the value of money and bonds will be inflated away.

To deal with this threat, investors are increasingly piling into what's being called the debasement trade — taking long positions in gold, silver, and bitcoin. All three of the assets have surged more than 60% in 2025, crushing the stock market.

Here's what to know about the buzziest trade on Wall Street.

Think about the collective investor as your nutty uncle who's been getting really into doomsday prepping lately. The gist of the debasement trade is to hedge portfolios against the devaluation of other investments.

There are valid warning signs that debasement is underway. The US government deficit is set to balloon further as tax cut extensions take hold in 2026. Debt, which is inherently inflationary, is mounting, and the government has piled up $38 trillion of it as of this month, according to data from the Treasury Department.

The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is slashing interest rates, adding fuel to the economy by making borrowing cheaper. Higher tariffs threaten to leak into consumer prices.

But one could also argue that the apocalypse isn't as close as some would have you believe, and that worries about debasement aren't all that severe yet. After all, long-term inflation expectations are still muted, the dollar's value hasn't declined all that much in recent months, and long-term interest rates are still below 5%.

It depends on who you ask, but some think yes, the rallies in precious metals and bitcoin can continue.

"We believe lower US real interest rates, further USD weakness, and ongoing political twists will drive prices higher," said Wayne Gordon, a strategist at UBS, in an October 3 client note.

Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX Advisors, said that gold and bitcoin should also benefit from governments buying them up.

Gold is "going into vaults in China, India, Russia, and everywhere else, and it's out of circulation. It's not unlike bitcoin being burned, frankly. And that's because people are worried about the beginning of the end of dollar hegemony," he said. "Bitcoin is just a digital version of that trade."

Others are skeptical. David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, thinks bitcoin is a fraudulent asset with no value, for instance, and that gold has a poor track record.

"It does have a standing as a central bank reserve currency. It also has industrial and jewelry uses, so it's not just pure ether like cryptocurrencies," Kelly said. "But it doesn't pay any dividends, doesn't generate income, and hasn't proved to grow wealth over time."

He continued: "Since 1980, gold has basically, through a lot of zigs and zags, just kept pace with inflation. People talk about long-term assets being 'as good as gold' — I can't think of any long-term asset that's been as bad as gold."

Some market pros have called into question investing in assets like gold and bitcoin as a play on the debasement trade.

Kelly said that a better way to play a falling dollar is to be in UK and European equities and currencies.

"I'm not a fan of gold. But if I want to make a bet that the dollar is going to come down — and I do — you could bet on gold, but I'd rather bet on foreign developed country currencies, particularly the euro, but also sterling and the Swiss franc," he said.

Beaton, the director of investment strategy at Madera Wealth Management, said that she also thinks international stocks are a better way to go, along with Treasury inflation-protected securities and real estate.

"Personally, gold is not how I prefer to get inflation protection," she said. "I think there are better ways to protect yourself from dollar devaluation — international investing is one of them."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation and written commentary from Jure Leskovec, a computer-science professor at Stanford University and cofounder of Kumo, a maker of AI tools for predicting business outcomes from company data. This story has been edited for length and clarity.

If you want to work in AI, you need to show that you can actually do the work. Launch real projects using public datasets, deploy a demo, post your work on GitHub, or write about it on a blog.

Participate in hackathons — they're a fantastic way to demonstrate initiative and teamwork in a short time. We organize hackathons ourselves and are often impressed by what participants produce. It's concrete proof of what you can do.

Even if you fail, you're showing that you're curious and proactive. By your second or third project or hackathon, you'll have gained valuable experience.

We recently hired someone who stood out because he built a generative AI tool for analyzing customer purchase data. It showed ambition, curiosity, and problem-solving, which are qualities we really value.

My second recommendation is to show adaptability — that you're the kind of person who is always experimenting with new tools, and that you can learn quickly. This is essential because AI is evolving at a pace that surprises even those of us who work in the field every day.

The best job candidates have taught themselves frameworks like PyTorch, JAX, or LLM tooling, and they stay current on areas like GenAI, multimodal models, diffusion, and reinforcement learning. Curiosity and flexibility matter more than having a fixed set of skills, because the skills in demand today may look very different tomorrow.

A top school or credential might get your application looked at, but it won't get you hired. We look for people who build things, who are adaptable and curious. In job interviews, we can tell if someone is just trying to map new ideas to what they learned in school versus truly engaging with what's new.

There's no playbook for AI. We're writing it right now. I always value it when my students bring me solutions that haven't been tried before, even if they're wrong. We're still at the experimental stage of AI in many ways, and there isn't always a clear textbook answer.

At Kumo, we conduct several interviews to see an applicant's full thought process. We pay close attention to how they approach problems and often value their reasoning as much as their final answer — if not more.

It may sound simple to say, "think outside the box," but it is more critical now than ever. Who knows? Your idea today could become the standard tomorrow.

I encourage people to sharpen their thinking by questioning assumptions, trying to solve problems without relying on familiar tools, and deliberately exposing themselves to new domains. Practice brainstorming multiple answers to the same problem, even the ones that seem impractical at first. Over time, these habits train you to see possibilities others overlook.

One last piece of advice: Don't forget to be human. Technical skills aren't everything. I look for people who can communicate clearly, work well in teams, and think carefully about the ethical and social implications of what they're building. Collaboration, empathy, and awareness of bias matter just as much as knowing how to code.

Some student-loan borrowers are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel after years of payments.

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump's administration began sending emails to some borrowers on income-based repayment plans notifying them that they're eligible to have their loans discharged.

IBR plans give borrowers monthly payments based on their incomes, with the promise of forgiveness of any remaining debt after 20 or 25 years. While the Department of Education did not specify how many borrowers are eligible for this round of forgiveness, 2 million borrowers were enrolled in IBR plans in the second quarter of 2025, according to Federal Student Aid data.

"Your loan servicer will notify you if and when your IBR discharge has been processed," the email, reviewed by Business Insider, said. "It may take some time for your loan servicer to process your discharge and for your account to reflect this change. Most borrowers will have their discharge processed within two weeks, but for some borrowers, processing could take more time."

Student-loan forgiveness has been rare under the Trump administration, given its focus on overhauling repayment and shifting away from debt relief efforts. Over the summer, the Department of Education paused IBR processing to update borrowers' payment counts, and it has also been working through a backlog of other repayment plan applications, including those for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

Here's what borrowers should know about the coming relief.

The first version of the IBR plan was created by Congress in a 2007 law and went into effect in 2009, with an updated version going into effect in 2014. The updates meant that borrowers who enrolled in the plan before July 1, 2014, had payments that were 15% of their discretionary income with a repayment period of 25 years, while those who signed up after July 1, 2014, had payments that were 10% of their discretionary income with a repayment period of 20 years.

Borrowers are able to switch from other income-driven repayment plans to IBR plans over the course of their repayment. That means payments made before IBR went into effect count toward the forgiveness threshold.

Trump's "big beautiful" spending legislation that he signed into law in July made some updates to IBR eligibility. It removed the requirement to be in financial hardship to enroll and expanded eligibility to some parent PLUS borrowers who took out loans to support their children's educations.

The government has been shut down since October 1, and federal agencies have enacted their contingency plans to ensure critical functions stay in operation. A notice posted at the top of Federal Student Aid's website said that "information on this website may not be maintained, and inquiries may not receive a response."

It added that borrowers "should continue to make payments on your federal student loans as scheduled."

The forgiveness emails that IBR borrowers received said that the Department of Education will send borrowers' discharge information to servicers after October 21, and those who want to opt out of the relief have to do so before that date. However, due to furloughed and terminated staff at the Department of Education, paperwork processing — including for forgiveness — could be delayed.

Delays could also have tax implications. A 2021 provision in the American Rescue Plan made student-loan forgiveness tax-free through 2025, so after January 1, 2026, borrowers who receive relief could face thousands of dollars in new tax bills.

The shutdown has also impacted ongoing litigation related to the department's paperwork processing backlog. The American Federation of Teachers, which includes members enrolled in PSLF, filed a lawsuit urging the department to cancel the loans of borrowers who have met their payment thresholds. The judge overseeing the case wrote in a legal filing earlier this month that the briefings will be paused due to the lapse in appropriations.

On October 17, however, the AFT and the Department of Education filed a joint status report stating that the department will recognize the date a borrower becomes eligible to have their loans discharged as the effective date of the relief, preventing those who reach the payment threshold before the end of the year from being taxed.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday he expects to meet next week with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia to try to forestall an escalation of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that President Donald Trump said was unsustainable.

Bessent made the announcement during a White House cabinet meeting and later confirmed plans for a meeting after a call with He on Friday evening. Bessent said on X the two officials "engaged in frank and detailed discussions regarding trade between the United States and China."

"We will meet in-person next week to continue our discussions," Bessent wrote.

China state news agency Xinhua reported that He and Bessent had "candid, in-depth, and constructive discussions on major issues in bilateral economic and trade relations" in a video call, and agreed to a new round of trade talks as soon as possible.

The two officials previously met in four European cities over six months to hammer out a tariff truce that brought duties down from triple-digit levels for each country. That agreement expires on November 10.

A meeting in Malaysia would shift the venue to a Southeast Asian exporter that trades heavily with both China and the U.S. and whose goods are now subject to a 19% duty imposed by Trump. Malaysia also faces a threatened 100% U.S. tariff on its semiconductors and derivative electronics devices under a national security trade review.

Trump earlier on Friday blamed Beijing for the latest impasse, a dispute over China's sweeping new export restrictions on rare-earth minerals and magnets. He has threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting on November 1 unless Beijing scraps the restrictions.

Asked whether such a high tariff was sustainable and what that might do to the U.S. economy, Trump replied: "It's not sustainable, but that's what the number is."

"They forced me to do that," he said in an interview with Fox Business Network that was broadcast on Friday.

Trump also has threatened to impose new U.S. export controls that would halt supplies of "any and all critical software."

The new trade actions were Trump's reaction to China dramatically expanding its export controls on rare-earth elements. China dominates the market for such elements, which are essential to tech manufacturing.

Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday blasted the restrictions as a threat to global supply chains.

Trump also confirmed he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in two weeks in South Korea and expressed admiration for the Chinese leader.

"I think we're going to be fine with China, but we have to have a fair deal. It's got to be fair," Trump said on Fox Business Network, which was taped on Thursday.

Later, as he was preparing to have lunch at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss efforts to end its war with Russia, Trump said: "China wants to talk, and we like talking to China."

The softening in tone and affirmation of his intent to meet with Xi helped stem Wall Street's early losses on Friday. Major U.S. stock indexes, which have been rattled over the last week by Trump's abrupt re-imposition of steep levies on Chinese imports and by credit worries among regional banks, were up in afternoon trading.

The head of the World Trade Organization urged the U.S. and China to de-escalate trade tensions, warning that a decoupling by the world's two largest economies could reduce global economic output by 7% over the longer term.

WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters in an interview the global trade body was extremely concerned about the latest spike in U.S.-China trade tensions and had spoken with officials from both countries to encourage more dialogue.

But tensions continued to run high, even as Trump and Xi prepared to meet.

Bessent took aim at China's state-driven economic practices in a statement to the IMF's steering committee on Friday, urging the IMF and World Bank to take a tougher stance on China's external and internal imbalances and industrial policies that U.S. officials say have helped China build up excess manufacturing capacity that is flooding the world with cheap goods.

And China's Commerce Ministry on Friday accused the U.S. of undermining the rules-based multilateral trading system since the Trump administration took office in 2025, vowing to intensify its use of dispute settlement actions at the WTO.

It also urged the U.S. to roll back measures that breach non-discrimination rules and align its industrial and security policies with WTO obligations.

Bessent earlier in the week had accused one of He's top aides of being "unhinged" in recent interactions with U.S. trade negotiators. China said on Friday that Bessent's remarks "seriously distort the facts."

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, in a post on X, apologized for suggesting that President Donald Trump should call the National Guard into San Francisco.

"Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco," Benioff wrote.

"My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused," he added. "It's my firm belief that our city makes the most progress when we all work together in a spirit of partnership. I remain deeply grateful to Mayor Lurie, SFPD, and all our partners, and am fully committed to a safer, stronger San Francisco."

Benioff has said this year's Dreamforce, the company's annual conference, was the largest in its history, with more than 50,000 attendees.

Throughout the conference, Benioff made repeated references to safety, and at one point said the company hired hundreds of its own security personnel.

His initial comments urging the president to call the National Guard into the city were made during an interview with The New York Times that was published on October 10.

When reached by Business Insider, Salesforce declined to comment further than Benioff's remarks. Salesforce has yet to respond to whether there's been a major safety-related incident at a Dreamforce conference.

Prominent venture capitalist Ron Conway resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, the software company's philanthropic arm, on Thursday. The New York Times reported that Conway sent Benioff an email saying their "values were no longer aligned."

"It saddens me immensely to say that with your recent comments, and failure to understand their impact, I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired," The Times reported Conway, a top Democratic donor, wrote to Benioff.

Salesforce confirmed Conway's departure in a statement.

"We have deep gratitude for Ron Conway and his incredible contributions to the Salesforce Foundation Board for over a decade," a spokesperson said in a statement.

Comedians Kumail Nanjiani and Ilana Glazer also canceled performances at Dreamforce, but did not specify the reason.

On October 12, a group of current and former Salesforce employees, as well as other tech workers and San Francisco residents, published an open letter to Benioff, criticizing his original comments and demanding that he retract his endorsement of sending National Guard troops into the city.

"If you choose not to act, we will hold you accountable," the letter reads. "We'll use every tool available to us — as employees, as alumni, as community members, as partners, as residents of this city — to ensure the public understands the gap between Salesforce's stated values and your actions. We'll make sure people know who invited troops to San Francisco, and who refused to make it right."

After his public apology, the group behind the open letter published an update saying they were "monitoring ongoing news" surrounding his apology, as well as an October 16 article by The New York Times, which reported that Salesforce had offered to aid Trump's immigration enforcement officers with AI services.

The group behind the letter to Benioff wrote that they were "still collecting signatures because we believe the threat is still real and there's more work to do."

In 2023, Benioff threatened to move Dreamforce outside San Francisco if that year's event was affected by what he called "the current situation with homelessness and drug use."

Benioff later that year announced Dreamforce would return in 2024 due to "new standards with outstanding safety measures, cleanliness, and hospitality" in partnership with the city.

This year's Dreamforce centered heavily on AI, specifically on agentic AI and featured appearances by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Athropic CEO Dario Amodei, and others in the tech, business, and entertainment space.

The $1.65 trillion chip giant Broadcom cut staff earlier this week.

The cuts on Thursday affected staff largely in sales, as well as customer success, account management, and solutions, according to LinkedIn posts and a person familiar with the matter. 

It's unclear how many roles were affected.

Broadcom has been making rolling cuts at the company, including at software firm VMware, which it acquired in late 2023. VMware's workforce has been slashed by roughly in half, Business Insider reported earlier this year. Broadcom has also been increasing prices on VMware's products. 

Broadcom has benefited from the AI boom by designing chips to power the technology. It first reached a trillion-dollar market cap late last year. On Monday, it inked a strategic agreement with OpenAI for 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators.

Broadcom did not respond to a request for comment.

Investors should exercise “discernment” when considering privately-issued stablecoins, which carry all the risks of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) plus their own unique risks, according to Jeremy Kranz, founder and managing partner of venture capital firm Sentinel Global.

Kranz called privately-issued stablecoins “central business digital currency,” which feature all of the surveillance, backdoors, programmability, and controls as CBDCs. He told Cointelegraph:

Overcollateralized stablecoin issuers, which back their blockchain tokens with cash and short-term government securities, can be subject to “bank runs” if too many holders attempt to redeem the tokens at the same time, Kranz added.

Algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins, which rely on software or complex trades to maintain their dollar-peg, also feature their own counterparty risks and dependencies, like the risk of de-pegging from volatility or flash crashes in crypto derivatives markets, he told Cointelegraph.

Kranz said technology is a neutral tool that can be used to build a better financial future for humanity or be misused, but the outcomes are reliant on individual investors reading the fine print, understanding the risks, and making informed choices about the financial instruments they choose to hold.

A plethora of opportunities and risks are coming down the pipeline

The rapid pace of innovation in stablecoins, crypto, and tokenization technologies is like “10 black swan events,” Kranz told Cointelegraph, stressing that both opportunities and risks will arise from rapid and disruptive technological progress.

The stablecoin market capitalization crossed the $300 billion milestone in October, according to data from DeFiLlama.

Stablecoins experienced heightened interest following the passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill in the United States, which drew mixed reactions from lawmakers.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a US representative from Georgia, called the bill a CBDC Trojan Horse. "This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor central bank digital currency,” she said in a July 15 X post.

“The Federal Reserve has been planning a CBDC for years, and this will open the door to move you to a cashless society and into digital currency that can be weaponized against you by an authoritarian government controlling your ability to buy and sell,” she added.

OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer unveiled plans to launch SEA token in Q1 2026, aiming to reignite NFT market growth.

On Friday, October 17, CEO Devin Finzer announced via X that Opensea will launch a native token, SEA, in Q1 2026, transitioning from an NFT marketplace to a full-suite on-chain trading platform.

OpenSea crossed $2.6B in trading volume this month, with over 90% from token trading.





This is just the beginning of our transformation, from “NFT marketplace” to “trade everything.”

NFTs were chapter one for us. In 2021, OpenSea brought the first wave of everyday internet users…

— dfinzer.eth | opensea (@dfinzer) October 17, 2025



In an X space attended by 11,100 users, Finzer outlined OpenSea's plans for a unified on-chain economy, enabling seamless trading of tokens, art, culture, and digital goods across multiple chains without compromising asset custody.

According to Finzer, 50% of the total SEA token supply is allocated to the community. Early users and participants in OpenSea's reward programs will receive significant claim allocations.

Further details confirm that 50% of OpenSea's launch revenue will be used to purchase SEA tokens. Additionally, $SEA holders will be able to stake their tokens behind favorite NFT collections and assets, embedding governance and utility into OpenSea's core interface.

He added that OpenSea's mobile app is already in the works, offering full access to on-chain trading, while perpetual trading (perps) and cross-chain abstraction features are under development ahead of the Q1 2026 launch.

OpenSea's SEA token announcement arrives as the global NFT market faces a severe contraction in the last 4 years. According to CoinGecko data, total NFT market capitalization dropped to $5.2 billion as of October 18, a stark contrast to the $25 billion peak NFTs sales in 2021, as reported by Reuters.

CryptoPunks remains the dominant collection, commanding 33.6% market share, while Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Pudgy Penguins make up the top three, with 6.02% and 5.02%, respectively.

At press time, OpenSea's trading volume has reached $2.6 billion this month, reflecting active user engagement while NFT valuations have plunged.

A Bay Area investigator who visited one of the alleged scammer's overseas compounds is sharing videos with the ABC7 I-Team.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- The Department of Justice has seized a record $15 billion in Bitcoin from a cyber fraud operation based in Cambodia that targeted Americans. An investigator from San Jose is very familiar with this case. She visited one of the alleged scammer's overseas compounds earlier this year, and now, she's sharing her videos with the I-Team's Dan Noyes.

The Department of Justice has indicted 38-year-old Chinese national, Chen Zhi, for wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy, and labeled his conglomerate of companies based out of Cambodia called the Prince Group as a "transnational criminal organization."

The government seized 127,000 Bitcoin from Chen's accounts, worth $15 billion at the time - much of it received from unsuspecting American victims.

Cyber fraud investigator Erin West told the I-Team, "If you can grab 15 billion of this, then how much has gone through that man's wallet? How much has he stolen? If we were able to take back 15 billion."

West is very familiar with Chen Zhi and his operations. The attorney retired from Santa Clara County's fraud unit and launched her nonprofit, Shamrock, to help victims. West visited one of Chen's compounds in Cambodia earlier this year.

Erin West: "They're filled, these whole dormitories are filled with people. You can see their laundry, you can see them inside, but there's no cars because nobody's going anywhere."Dan Noyes: "They're being held there."

West: "They're being held captive. This is modern day slavery. These are people that are being held against their will and being forced to scam 16 hours a day."

The cyber scam compound is disguised as an apartment building, even advertising rentals.

Guard: "What, what do you want?"Journalist: "I wanted to ask someone about renting a... renting an apartment."

West and her journalist friends approached the guard.

Journalist: "So, this one is what business?"Guard: "No, no, no."Journalist: "What's inside here?"

Chen employed violence to keep the workers in line, the indictment saying he kept photographs depicting some of his methods. The complaint also includes a picture of a rack with thousands of cellphones.

"Sending out contact after contact," West said. "And once there's a communication, once somebody wants to talk, then that gets forwarded to a regular person to continue that communication."

Then, the process called "pig-butchering" begins in which the scammer grooms a victim over days, weeks or months. "A typical romance scam and then after that, we will have shown you all along that the person you think you're in love with is a wealthy person and ultimately will say, 'Well, do you know why I'm so wealthy? It's because I invest in cryptocurrency and I'll teach you how to do that.'"

Last year, West also visited a cyber fraud compound that had been busted in the Philippines. On the scene, she said, "It's more than 35 buildings and was designed and built for the sole purpose of scamming."

She toured the opulent boss' quarters with bill counters, the massive pool, the luxury cars - a Maybach and armor-plated Range Rover. And she saw the torture room for the human-trafficked workers.

"They chain them up," a guide said. "After chaining them up, they beat them up."

While the bust in Cambodia is a good step with that record $15 billion haul, West cautions victims here about getting their hopes up for seeing their money again. "I think we need to be really cautious about setting expectations about the return of that money to victims. This is a federal case. It will go through the legal system. And I don't think it's clear right now exactly who will be getting that money."

The investigations move forward. The indictment says Chen Zhi operated dozens of business entities in more than 30 countries and that he paid bribes to foreign public officials.

Oops, something went wrong

Tom Lee and his Ethereum bet is back in the headlines this time on reports of a fresh $281 million buy that has crypto traders asking what he sees next for ETH.

Tom Lee's BitMine Immersion reportedly bought 72,898 ether, worth about $281 million, within the last 24 hours.

BitMine's Ethereum holdings have risen to 3.03 million ETH, about 2.5% of the total circulating supply, after adding roughly 202,000 tokens since Oct. 6.

Analysts noted there are no visible transaction hashes, wallet addresses, or regulatory filings to verify the purchase. BitMine has not commented publicly on the claim.

According to Coingecko data, Ether traded around $3,830 to $3,870 on Friday, posting slight daily gains of +0.8% yet still below its early-October highs.

The token remains under pressure after last week's sharp correction, when the Oct. 10–11 liquidation wave, the largest in crypto's history, briefly pushed prices into the mid-$3,400s.

Market observers say investors such as Lee appear to be accumulating during weakness, wagering that Ethereum's long-term fundamentals will outweigh short-term swings.

Crypto analyst Ted says Ethereum's next move depends on how it reacts to a large liquidity cluster between $4,400 and $4,800.

The chart shows heavy sell orders stacked in that range, a sign that many traders are preparing to exit or short near those levels.

Ethereum's rebound from below $3,600 lost strength around the mid-$4,000 zone. The chart shows a possible double top forming near $4,600, followed by a pullback.

On the downside, new liquidity has started to build around $3,200-$3,400, pointing to strong buying interest if prices fall again.

Ted said that if a US-China trade deal goes through, Ethereum could reach the upper band near $4,800 as shorts start closing.

But if market sentiment weakens, ETH may slip back toward lower support before finding a base.

Right now, Ethereum sits between two major liquidity zones, one above, one belo,w and whichever breaks first could set the tone for the next big move.

Crypto analyst Crypto Tony shared a cautious but hopeful view on Ethereum (ETH) in his latest market update on X.

His chart shows that ETH is likely in a corrective phase, not a full trend reversal.

According to his Elliott Wave analysis, Ethereum is moving within a W–X–Y corrective structure, often seen before a recovery phase.

(Source: X)

The coin is currently trading near $3,870, and Tony expects another test of the $3,300–$3,400 range, a zone that could mark the formation of a double bottom, a classic signal of seller exhaustion and potential reversal.

He noted that this projected wave (b) low fits within the ongoing correction, hinting at one final dip before a rebound.

His chart outlines a potential move toward $5,000 by late Q4 2025 or early 2026 once Ethereum builds a base at lower levels.

The analyst added that the broader structure remains “corrective but stable,” suggesting that the recent weakness may be part of a larger bullish cycle still intact.

If buyers return around support, he believes ETH could soon shift back into recovery mode.

Bitcoin is too risky to be included in investors' portfolios, U.K.'s biggest retail investment platform says.

“Bitcoin has experienced several periods of extreme losses and is a highly volatile investment – much riskier than stocks or bonds,” $225 billion asset manager Hargreaves Lansdown said last week. “The HL [Hargreaves Lansdown] Investment view is that bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn't be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals.”

Hargreaves Lansdown added that, in its view, cryptocurrencies have “no intrinsic value.”

Hargreaves Lansdown's statement came as the Financial Conduct Authority last week overturned a nearly six-year ban on the retail trading of spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes. While competitors like Interactive Investor and Saxo have largely opened their doors to cryptocurrency ETNs, HL said it will take the remaining months of the year to craft “the client journey and appropriateness assessment,” before offering cryptocurrency ETN trading to “appropriate clients.”

Meanwhile, under FCA rules, retail investors will be limited to Bitcoin- and Ethereum-based products on U.K. exchanges, such as the London Stock Exchange, Hargreaves Lansdown said. Investors may also be limited to allocating only up to 10% of their portfolio in cryptocurrency ETNs.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Hargreaves Lansdown's statement aligns with sentiments from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon.

“I'm not personally a believer in Bitcoin itself, but you're the customer—I don't like to tell customers what they can and can't do with their money,” Dimon told CNBC in August.

Still, the prevailing trend suggests that institutions are increasingly embracing cryptocurrencies. Among the prominent institutional backers of cryptocurrencies is the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).

“There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CBS' "60 Minutes" in an interview aired on Sunday, while walking back 2017 remarks that Bitcoin was an “index of money laundering.”

BlackRock runs the world's largest Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds. The company's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT) most recently held assets of just over $93 billion, while its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (NASDAQ:ETHA) held $17 billion. These assets have been accumulated in less than two years. In this short time, IBIT has become the most profitable ETF for BlackRock.

CleanSpark (CLSK) has seen its stock attract a fresh wave of attention following recent industry developments and insights from company leadership. The company is benefiting as institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to accelerate, particularly through ETF inflows and the expanding credit market.

See our latest analysis for CleanSpark.

Momentum has clearly been building for CleanSpark, as excitement around institutional adoption of Bitcoin and surging industry activity has powered the stock to a 70% share price gain over the past month and a standout 107% year-to-date return. When you look at the three-year total shareholder return of nearly 570%, it is no wonder investors are watching closely even as volatility remains a feature of the sector.

If bitcoin's recent rally has you wondering what other growth stories are out there, now is a great time to broaden your search and discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership

After such remarkable gains, the key question looms: Is CleanSpark's stock still trading at a discount, or have markets already priced in the robust growth and institutional momentum around Bitcoin mining?

CleanSpark's last close price of $19.53 sits just below its most popular narrative fair value estimate of $20.16, giving it a slight undervaluation edge as analysts look past short-term swings to focus on long-term profitability drivers. The widely discussed narrative pulls together policy tailwinds, efficient growth, and sector leadership to support its valuation, setting the stage for some compelling catalysts and assumptions.

The company's strategic focus on sourcing flexible, low-cost, and increasingly renewable energy, combined with operating in supportive states, reduces exposure to volatile energy markets and supports stable or expanding gross margins. This fosters long-term earnings resilience in an industry prone to input cost shocks. Industry consolidation, with less efficient or capital-constrained miners exiting or pivoting to non-Bitcoin compute, is increasing CleanSpark's market share (already rising from 4.3% to 5.6% of global hash rate) and strengthening its competitive position. This consolidation is likely to support continued top-line growth and improved operating leverage.

THE ARGUMENT

Joel Mokyr and Sonal Chokshi

This week, Joel Mokyr, professor of economics and history at Northwestern University, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for explaining innovation-driven economic growth. “Stagnation was the norm throughout most of human history,” the committee observed, “Despite important discoveries now and again — which sometimes led to improved living conditions and higher incomes — growth always eventually levelled off.”

But Mokyr identified prerequisites for sustained growth through technological progress, including: useful knowledge, mechanical competence, and institutions conducive to technological progress — as well as the “importance of society being open to new ideas and allowing change”.

​a16z crypto's editor in chief interviewed Mokyr in November 2016, shortly after his book sharing many of these ideas, A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy, was originally published. The book analyzes why Enlightenment culture sparked the Industrial Revolution. Why did the Industrial Revolution take place where it did, and then spread beyond?

It had to do with a competitive, open market of ideas, Mokyr argues — a transnational “Republic of Letters” — not unlike the crypto ethos of open source, decentralization, and more. We're sharing the full interview with Mokyr here, covering important themes relevant to the crypto industry and beyond, such as:

Decentralized storage is one of the most natural applications built on blockchains, and a central component of the web3 ecosystem. Yet despite a decade of active development — from IPFS and Filecoin to more recent entrants — most of these storage protocols have received limited formal analysis of their incentive properties.

Claims of incentive compatibility are sometimes made, but rarely proven.

This gap matters: Without well-designed incentives, a system may distribute storage but fail to truly decentralize it. So we analyze Shelby — a storage network protocol recently proposed by Aptos Labs and Jump Crypto — and provide the first formal proof of its incentive properties. Our game-theoretic model shows that while off-chain audits alone collapse to universal shirking, Shelby's combination of peer audits with occasional on-chain verification yields incentive compatibility under natural parameter settings. We also examine coalition behavior and outline a simple modification that strengthens the protocol's collusion-resilience.

NEWS AND MOVES

The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan integrated its National Digital Identity (NDI) platform with the Ethereum blockchain — “making it the first country to anchor a live, population-scale identity system on a public network”, as reported by Decrypt.

This week, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that regulates national banks, announced the first de novo bank to receive preliminary conditional approval (Erebor). The Comptroller of the Currency stated that “Permissible digital asset activities, like any other legally permissible banking activity, have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner.”

Meanwhile, Bridge CEO shared this week that they submitted an application “for organizing a national trust bank” to the OCC. If the charter is issued, it would allow them to provide custody, stablecoin issuance, management of stablecoin reserves, and more, he said, “under a unified federal framework consistent with the GENIUS Act”.

Citi, a global bank in 180 countries, is launching a service to custody crypto assets next year, as reported earlier this week to CNBC. Citi's global head of partnerships and innovation said that “We may have certain solutions that are completely designed and built in-house that are targeted towards certain assets and certain segment of our clients, whereas may we may use a… third party, lightweight, nimble solution for other kind of assets.”

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with $13.46 trillion in assets under management, continues to push tokenization of assets, as reported in its Q3 earnings call this week. “We're spending a great deal of time on the tech,” CEO Larry Fink stated. “I'm trying to develop our own technology related to this.”

Google reports DPRK group UNC5342 uses EtherHiding to deliver backdoors and steal crypto, marking the first nation-state use of a tactic designed for resistant attacks.

A North Korean state-sponsored hacking crew is now using public blockchains to host malicious payloads, according to new research from Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG). The campaign, which leverages a technique known as “EtherHiding,” is the first documented case of a nation-state actor adopting smart contract malware delivery to evade detection and disrupt takedowns.

Google attributes the activity to UNC5342, a group it links to the long-running “Contagious Interview” operation targeting developers and cryptocurrency professionals. First observed using EtherHiding in February 2025, UNC5342's latest toolkit includes a JavaScript downloader dubbed JADESNOW, which fetches and executes a backdoor, INVISIBLEFERRET, directly from data stored on BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum smart contracts.

The group's payload delivery mechanism hinges on read-only blockchain calls. These requests don't produce new transactions or leave visible trails in blockchain analytics tools, and because the contracts themselves are immutable, defenders can't remove the embedded scripts.

In practical terms, the technique allows threat actors to update or swap malware payloads by rewriting contract storage variables on-chain, all without needing to re-compromise distribution sites or clients. While financially motivated actors have previously used this infrastructure, Google says this marks the first time it has seen a state-sponsored crew fold the technique into its operational toolkit.

Google's report ties the blockchain infrastructure to real-world infections delivered through compromised WordPress sites and social engineering lures, including fake job interviews designed to bait crypto developers. Victims who land on these sites receive the JADESNOW loader, which then reaches out to the on-chain smart contracts, retrieves a JavaScript payload, and runs it locally. That payload in turn launches INVISIBLEFERRET — a full-featured backdoor with remote control that enables long-term espionage and data theft.

While Google does not specify how smart contract data was retrieved, previous EtherHiding research has shown that attackers often rely on standard JSON-RPC calls, which may traverse public or hosted infrastructure. Blocking those services or forcing clients to use self-hosted nodes with policy restrictions could offer interim containment. On the browser side, organizations can enforce strict extension and script execution policies and lock down update workflows to prevent fake Chrome-style alerts from gaining traction.

Colombian artist Juan Salazar, also known as Judasaca, fuses art, NFTs, and technology to create immersive experiences that redefine visual art. His distinctive creations have been exhibited in leading venues around the world. In an exclusive interview, Salazar shares his journey with Colombia One.

Salazar is a marketing and international business professional with more than 15 years of experience in the field. While his formal artistic career began in 2018, some collectors trace his earliest works back to 2014.

This path took shape while pursuing a master's degree in Barcelona, where his connection with local artists inspired him to fully embrace art. Back in Bogota and immersed in the city's creative scene through San Felipe's art district (in the north of Bogota), Salazar inaugurated his first solo exhibition in 2020.

“I not only managed to exhibit but also sold a piece at that first show,” he recalls. With his motivation fired up, he continued betting on the artistic path. In 2021, Salazar participated in his first international exhibition, where he connected with the world of crypto art, NFTs, and blockchain.

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, represent a new way of owning and trading digital art through blockchain technology. Each NFT acts as a unique digital certificate that verifies the originality and ownership of a work. For artists like Salazar, this innovation opened new possibilities:

“When I came back to Colombia, extremely motivated by this exhibition, I created my first NFT collection, which had five editions. I sold it in less than a day. That showed me that maybe this was also the path to start showcasing my work and reaching, through art, an international audience — or even, as I see it today, a global one,” he explains.

In 2021, after returning to Bogota, he joined his first international NFT exhibition — a digital show held in Panama — marking the beginning of his global journey: “I realized it wasn't just about selling or interacting in a digital market — it was about exhibiting and expanding the reach of my art across borders,” he says.

By late 2022, he followed international NFT movements in cities such as New York, Paris, and Miami, studying how artists were taking their work to new heights. Later on, Salazar became part of an international artistic circuit — one where the boundary between the digital and the physical worlds increasingly fades.

His new reality highlighted his adaptability and contemporary vision as an artist. In early 2023, Salazar was invited to showcase his art in New York — a milestone he calls a turning point in his career. His work was featured on the giant screens of Times Square as part of a global NFT exhibition.

“We were no longer just exhibiting our works digitally in a private event — we were connecting with a massive audience. For an entire day, we took over the screens of New York, showcasing our pieces and receiving that highlight as participating artists. It revealed a completely different dynamic to us,” he recalls.

Salazar's journey has also been shaped by collaboration. Together with his close friends Yuseph Zapata (YuZapata) and Lucas Zapata (Luko), he founded an artistic collective called The Art Cartel. “As Colombians, the word cartel often carries a negative meaning abroad,” he explains. “We wanted to reclaim it — to turn it into something positive, a symbol of creativity and community. After all, the word ‘art' is right there inside ‘cartel', in both English and Spanish,” he adds.

The collective was invited to NFT NYC 2024 and 2025, this time not only to exhibit but to give a talk before hundreds of attendees in New York. They shared their experience connecting art and technology through augmented and virtual reality, building immersive bridges between traditional and digital creation.

“These interactions have shown us the great potential of NFTs and how those of us who come from traditional art — since I come from painting physical canvases — can begin to find opportunities in the world of NFTs,” the artist says.

Salazar's work has traveled across the globe, reaching Miami Art Week, Art Basel, Portugal, Finland, Japan, Madrid, Mexico, and Costa Rica, among others. His growing international presence underscores his role as a digital innovator and his unrestrained, defiant artistic proposal.

Judasaca's artistic universe is built around transformation — the belief that “nothing stays the same.” Through this lens, he reimagines icons of pop culture such as Mickey Mouse, Snoopy, and Woodstock, taking them out of their familiar narratives and placing them in new settings.

His work lately invites viewers to look beyond nostalgia and discover emotions, contradictions, and reflections that echoed Salazar's life.“If the viewer takes the time to pause — to look a little beyond the surface — they realize there is a message behind it. Since my latest collection, I've started painting more of my emotions and how they are reflected in these cultural icons that shaped our childhood. Seeing them here now, we think, ‘Wow, I'm no longer five years old.' Nothing stays the same,” he reflects.

Judasaca merges his background in marketing with his artistic instinct, playing with animated icons on the canvas, challenging permanence over time. The result takes it further: a hybrid body of work that bridges the physical and virtual worlds.

His paintings, often infused with augmented or digital elements, illustrate a world in flux, where even the icons that shaped our imagination are forced to evolve. “I play with art and technology to create experiences that go beyond the canvas — and beyond the screen,” he says.

Salazar emphasizes the role of community in the international reception of his work. “In the Web3 art world, or crypto art, incredibly interesting interactions emerge through community support,” he explains. For him, these networks provide more than exposure — they are spaces where artists connect and collaborate on a global scale.

Building on his commitment to community, Salazar is a member of One Love ArtDAO, a decentralized organization that promotes artists worldwide. He also helped create Chromaverse, a platform where artists can showcase their work in both physical and digital galleries, enhanced with immersive virtual reality experiences.

In 2024, Salazar and other Latin American artists were selected for 10×10 Blockchain, a project showcasing 10 artists on the Bitcoin blockchain. “Being part of this allowed us, especially as Latin American artists, to reach a global market, sell our work, and gain recognition that can be challenging in emerging markets where art collecting is just taking off,” he says.

These experiences underscore how his bold approach — merging classic painting techniques with immersive digital experiences — has introduced his vision to a global audience. By leveraging NFTs, VR exhibitions, and community networks, Salazar has created new opportunities for Colombian art to thrive on the world stage.

During D.C. Fintech Week in Washington, D.C. this past week, I moderated a conversation about how decentralized finance (DeFi) projects could be compliant with different regulations.



You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.

Are developers liable for how their projects are used? Can they prevent criminals from using their projects? In other words, is regulation-compliant decentralized finance an oxymoron?

Developers' liability for how their decentralized projects are used has already been the subject of multiple criminal cases in the U.S. and elsewhere (see, for example, the cases against Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev). Without getting into the specifics of those cases, there is a broader general question as to how much developers can do to prevent malicious actors from using their projects, and to what extent regulators can design guide rails for DeFi.



I was privileged enough to discuss this with Maha El Dimachki, the head of the BIS Innovation Hub's Singapore Centre, Yaya Fanusie, global head of Policy at Aleo, and Lee Schneider, general counsel at Ava Labs, during a panel at D.C. Fintech Week on Thursday.



Compliance and decentralized finance inherently sound like a contradiction. Users should be able to use a truly decentralized protocol for any purpose, and the project's developers should not have any ability to interfere with these transactions. That's one theory, at least. Another is that developers are or should be required to prevent dangerous actors from taking advantage of their projects.



Developers could and should be able to build in certain tools or features to ensure compliance with certain regulations though, the speakers on this panel seemed to agree, with certain caveats.



The biggest of these caveats is that we need to come up with a specific consensus agreement on how we're defining compliance here.



Fanusie said he would describe developers' obligations more as "risk management," focusing on what issues they might encounter (alleged money launderers or other malicious actors, for example)



Schneider said that another way of describing this is that neither developers nor regulators want users to lose their money (to roughly paraphrase his comments). In that sense, both parties here are aligned in their goals for DeFi.

And El Dimachki, who was previously at the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, said outcome-based policymaking, with regulators looking to prevent malicious activity being the goal of how they could approach rules around DeFi. 



There seemed to be general agreement among the panelists that there are steps developers can take to ensure they're not running afoul of regulations, but as always, the devil is in the details.



Obviously this is an ongoing debate, and I'm curious what you all think. I'd love to gather your thoughts on the following questions:

Ripple CLO Rejects the Narrative That Crypto Is Just a Tool for 'Crime and Corruption'

In an X post, Ripple's Stuart Alderoty said two recent New York Times pieces wrongly cast crypto as only a tool for crime and corruption.

Sometimes it can be easier to say nothing at all. 

This week, stablecoin giant Tether announced a $250,000 donation to OpenSats to support Bitcoin developers—only for one of the world's best-known programmers (and Bitcoin maximalists) to publicly chastise the size of the gift. 

Twitter co-founder and Square CEO Jack Dorsey lampooned the donation Thursday on X, shortly after it was touted by Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino.

“Why only $250K?” Dorsey replied curtly to Ardoino.

why only $250k?

— jack (@jack) October 16, 2025



Tether is one of the crypto industry's most profitable companies. The USDT issuer, which posted a $13 billion profit last year, is reportedly seeking a $500 billion valuation in talks with potential investors. 

Tether said its donation to OpenSats, which funds the development of free and open-source Bitcoin software, will support the nonprofit's operations and grant-making efforts.

A representative for the company did not respond to Decrypt's request for comment on Dorsey's comment, which Ardoino did not respond publicly to.

Shortly after the comment was made, however, another X user pressed Dorsey on his own financial commitment to the cause of protecting Bitcoin developers, questioning how much he had donated.

The entrepreneur immediately shot back: “Over $21 million. You?”

over $21 million. you?

— jack (@jack) October 16, 2025



Indeed, OpenSats received a $21 million donation from Dorsey's Start Small initiative in 2024. The tech billionaire has been an outspoken advocate for decentralized technology and censorship resistance for years, and one of the most famous Bitcoin backers around.

But even Dorsey was not without his detractors. Udi Wertheimer, creator of popular Bitcoin Ordinals project Taproots Wizards, at first took Dorsey's side in the scuffle—but then turned on the Twitter inventor.

“No one should go into a pissing match with Jack when it comes to funding open-source Bitcoin development,” Wertheimer said.

The Bitcoiner went on, though, to lambast Dorsey for his investments in Ocean, a Bitcoin mining pool that previously caught heat for discouraging the processing of non-financial transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, including the creation of NFT-like Ordinals.

“You should subtract from that number whatever the size of your Ocean investment was,” Wertheimer said of Dorsey's philanthropic contributions. “Sadly, that capital is being actively deployed to slow down development.”

Alas, on Crypto Twitter, nobody's perfect.

ByJill Goldenziel,

Contributor.

Bitcoin promised unhackable, decentralized finance beyond government control. It has become a favorite of criminal networks that operate beyond government reach–and a strategic tool for governments themselves. Tuesday's US seizure of roughly $15 billion of Bitcoin during a takedown of a massive pig-butchering syndicate reveals the technology's risks and opportunities. The confiscated Bitcoin–the largest crypto forfeiture in Justice Department history–may test the Trump Administration's plan for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. It also exposes the international security risks of world governments entering the crypto markets. 

 

President Trump directed the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a national Digital Asset Stockpile in a March executive order. Both will be funded by assets seized by federal agencies, not new taxpayer money. The order set a deadline for the Treasury Secretary to report on considerations for establishing relevant accounts and the need for supporting legislation. The deadline has now lapsed, although the report may not be public.

While investors know almost exactly how much gold the US holds in Fort Knox, it is unclear how much Bitcoin is already available for the strategic reserve. Crypto industry publications estimate that US government-controlled wallets contain $36 billion worth of Bitcoin. However, that number is unverified and may be larger than what will enter the reserve itself. The executive order specifies that some US government -controlled Bitcoin may be reserved for victim restitution or other statutory purposes.

Tuesday's seizure could be the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve's single largest haul so far. On Tuesday, the Justice Department indicted Cambodian national Chen Zhi, chairman of the Prince Group, for large-scale fraud, money laundering, and human trafficking schemes. The Treasury Department and the UK Foreign Office also sanctioned 146 individuals and entities linked with the Prince Group and its payment-processing affiliate, the Huione Group, designating both as Transnational Criminal Organizations. 

The Prince Group allegedly trafficked workers into barricaded phone farms in Cambodia and violently forced them to operate “pig-butchering” scams. Just two of these compounds housed 1,250 cell phones that controlled 76,000 social media accounts. In a psychological long-con, the workers “fattened victims up” by building trust and then “butchered” them with bogus crypto schemes. 

The seizure is a win for the Trump administration's pro-crypto narrative. It shows how the US can transform illicit crypto assets into a national strength without new taxpayer spending. The Prince Group and other pig butchering schemes in Southeast Asia have been tied to larger Chinese-diaspora criminal networks, part of a web of corruption often enabled by Beijing.  As US-China competition rises and pig butchering schemes proliferate, more digital assets are likely to enter US coffers. 

But the Prince Group seizure underscores the need for legal and policy clarity regarding crypto. With the establishment of the Reserve and Stockpile, the US government is now a regulator, custodian, and influential market participant for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Questions remain over which agency has custody of seized Bitcoin, who audits and secures it, how it is valued, and how transfers occur between agencies or into the Reserve. Unlike gold or foreign currency reserves, Bitcoin's fixed supply and extreme volatility make valuation and restitution complex. Victims' claims can take years to resolve while prices swing wildly. Victims likely will expect restitution in stable fiat currencies. This valuation-timing mismatch complicates accounting and exposes the government to additional risk. 

The seizure also shows how law enforcement has become tied to national monetary strategy, with broader impacts for national security. Law enforcement is now a growth strategy for US government asset accumulation in an asset class where supply is finite. Every major seizure could affect global Bitcoin liquidity. Large government holdings or even simple transfers could jolt markets or invite speculation.  Prosecutors and law enforcement officials may be inadvertent market actors. Without clear transparency rules or congressional oversight, the Reserve could create policy risk and information asymmetry–conditions that destabilize markets. 

 

US states and foreign governments, are also establishing crypto reserves, inspired or provoked by Washington's move. Managing a massive crypto reserve is complex in a developed legal system like the United States, and more so in states with high corruption and weak justice systems. Ironclad protocols for custody, secure wallets and keys, and robust internal controls to prevent theft and corruption are crucial. Any technical or political breach could destroy confidence, tank markets, and devastate victims. If any government's crypto reserve becomes mismanaged or used as a political stunt, politicians' reputations may be destroyed, victims' assets could be decimated for a second time, and markets could roil. 

Governments accumulating finite crypto assets like Bitcoin could inadvertently or intentionally compete for market share. Hypothetically, a rival state with its own crypto reserves might deliberately dump Bitcoin to undervalue the US reserve or create market instability. Large sovereign holdings could influence regulatory policy to favor increasing the value of the government digital asset reserves. Politicians or prosecutors might push for aggressive seizure policies to pad crypto reserves. A rush to stockpile digital currencies may create incentives for prosecutors to prioritize cases where crypto is at stake. 

Large government crypto holdings ironically undermine the fundamental premise of digital currency. Crypto backers argue that decentralized digital currencies put governance in the hands of the blockchain rather than governments and institutional intermediaries, reducing potential for hacking and manipulation while reducing fees. Even if the blockchain remains secure, governments and their crypto custodial systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks, corruption, and insider threats. Government custodians of large reserves can buy, sell, and regulate crypto in ways that concentrate distribution and fundamentally change the crypto ecosystem. Crypto's promise of decentralization is colliding with governments' desires to control it. 

Tuesday's seizure may give the new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve a huge injection of value and legitimacy. But strategic reserves come with strategic risks. The growing scale of the Reserve makes the US a major player in the Bitcoin market. Such a large accumulation of Bitcoin–with more seizures likely to come–might shift how other states or private actors perceive regulatory risk and make market moves. 

Control of digital assets and the legal frameworks around them is a form of strategic leverage. Without safeguards, strategic reserves and the systems storing them could be vulnerable to attacks by adversary states. Reducing the uncertainty surrounding the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and US Digital Assets Stockpile will help protect US investors and safeguard our new national assets.

North Korean hackers are now using a blockchain-based method known as EtherHiding to deliver malware to facilitate their crypto theft operations. According to experts, a North Korean hacker was discovered using this method, where attackers embed codes like JavaScript Payloads inside a blockchain-based smart contract.

Using the method, the hackers turn the decentralized ledger into a resilient command-and-control (C2). According to a published blog post by Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), this is the first time that it has observed an actor of this scale using this method. It claimed that using EtherHiding is convenient in the face of conventional takedown and blocklisting efforts. The threat intelligence group mentioned that it has been tracking threat actor UNC5342 since February 2025, integrating EtherHiding into an ongoing social engineering campaign.

Google mentioned that it has linked the usage of EtherHiding to a social engineering campaign tracked by Palo Alto Networks as Contagious Interview. The Contagious Interview was carried out by North Korean actors. According to Socket researchers, the group expanded its operation with a new malware loader, XORIndex. The loader has accumulated thousands of downloads, with the targets being job seekers and individuals believed to own digital assets or sensitive credentials.

In this campaign, the North Korean hackers use JADESNOW malware to distribute a JavaScript variant of INVISIBLEFERRET, which has been used to carry out so many cryptocurrency thefts. The campaign targets developers in the crypto and technology industries, stealing sensitive data, digital assets, and gaining access to corporate networks. It also centers around a social engineering tactic that copies legitimate recruitment processes using fake recruiters and fabricated companies.

Fake recruiters are used to lure candidates to platforms like Telegram or Discord. After that, the malware is then delivered to their systems and devices through fake coding tests or software downloads disguised as technical assessments or interview fixes. The campaign uses a multi-stage malware infection process, which usually involves malware like JADESNOW, INVISIBLEFERRET, and BEAVERTAIL, to compromise the victim's devices. The malware affects Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.

EtherHiding provides a better advantage to attackers, with GTIG noting that it acts as a particularly challenging threat to mitigate. One core element of EtherHiding that is concerning is that it is decentralized in nature. This means that it is stored on a permissionless and decentralized blockchain, making it hard for law enforcement or cybersecurity firms to take it down because it has no central server. The identity of the attacker is also hard to track because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions.

It is also hard to remove malicious code in smart contracts deployed on the blockchain if you are not the owner of the contract. The attacker in control of the smart contract, in this case, the North Korean hackers, can also choose to update the malicious payload at any time. While security researchers may try to warn the community about a malicious contract by tagging it, it doesn't stop hackers from carrying out their malicious activities using the smart contract.

In addition, attackers can retrieve their malicious payload using read-only calls that do not leave a visible transaction history on the blockchain, making it hard for researchers to track their activities on the blockchain. According to the threat research report, EtherHiding represents a “shift towards next-generation bulletproof hosting” where the most glaring features of blockchain technology are being used by scammers for malicious purposes.

The crypto market could be heading for serious trouble. 

Economist and gold advocate Peter Schiff has issued a stark warning that the losses that are about to hit the crypto industry will be staggering. According to Schiff, the fallout could trigger a wave of bankruptcies, defaults, and mass lay-offs as Bitcoin and Ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies, are poised for a significant crash. 

Such a downturn, he suggests, would not only wipe out much of the altcoin market but could also create broader systemic risks. 

The losses that are about to hit the crypto industry will be staggering. Expect a wave of bankruptcies, defaults, and layoffs as the sector is decimated by the imminent Bitcoin and Ether crash, which will obliterate the rest of the altcoin market. There is systemic risk as well.

Bitcoin vs Gold: Schiff Stands Firm

Schiff doubled down on his bearish stance, noting that Bitcoin is now down 34% against gold since its August record high. He warns investors not to assume the crypto bear market is ending anytime soon. He has even said that gold is more likely to reach $1 million than Bitcoin, showing just how skeptical he is about crypto.

Schiff's remarks come at a time when markets are under extreme pressure. The broader market fears pushed Bitcoin below $104K levels recently, but it has since recovered to 106,898. In contrast, gold hit new highs this week above 44USDT,300. 

James Wynn Warns of Imminent Crash

Adding to the concern, crypto trader James Wynn has also warned of a market bloodbath within the next 72 hours. Wynn believes the U.S. stock market might also see a “Black Monday” event soon, with prices dropping sharply. For Bitcoin, he expects a fall to around $88,000–$92,000, raising further alarms for investors. 

Bitcoin: A Stress Indicator

But not everybody is bearish.

Strike Founder & CEO Jack Mallers points out that Bitcoin reacts first to financial stress. With yields dropping, spreads widening, and banks under pressure, BTC is already sensing trouble. 

He notes that when the Federal Reserve is eventually forced to inject liquidity, BTC is likely to move first and outperform other assets, giving some hope for investors watching closely. 

Buying Opportunity For BTC?

Meanwhile, CryptoQuant analysts note that Bitcoin's Open Interest has dropped to its lowest levels. 

When Bitcoin fell about 30% earlier this year, its Open Interest showed extreme fear, hinting the market might be hitting a bottom. Now, after a 20% drop from recent highs, the same signals are showing up again, with lots of liquidations and cautious trading.

However, when the Open Interest hit similar lows in the past, Bitcoin quickly found support and bounced back. So the latest drop could be another chance for strategic buying, especially since long-term on-chain trends still favor BTC.

Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim the $108,000-$109,000 support level. If it manages to break above, it could climb toward $112K soon, but if it fails to hold this zone, the price might slip back toward the $100K range.

This will be the first crucial level to reclaim to give some confidence.

If that happens, Bitcoin could rally towards the $112,000 level in the coming days.

A Market Reset

Despite the recent week of intense volatility, some traders believe the worst may be behind us. Trader Virtual Bacon notes that every bull market reaches a point where panic peaks, charts look broken, and everyone assumes it's over. But that moment often marks a reset, not an ending.

The recent drop helped flush out excess leverage and rebuild a cleaner base for upside. In his view, this is exactly how the market breathes, before the next move. 

FAQs

Experts like Peter Schiff warn of a significant crash for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which could trigger widespread bankruptcies and layoffs across the crypto industry.

Gold has hit new highs above 44USDT,300 as investors seek safer assets amid market stress, while Bitcoin faces predictions of a sharp correction.

Some analysts see the current drop as a potential buying opportunity, as key metrics suggest the market may be bottoming out after a 20% decline.

Predictions vary; a crash to $88,000 is possible, but a rebound to $112,000 could occur if Bitcoin reclaims the $108,000 support level.

More than $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours as a broad sell-off sent Bitcoin from above $109,000 toward $105,000, with intraday prints near $104,700 on some venues.

CoinGlass figures show roughly $717.7 million in perpetual futures liquidations alone, led by $372 million on BTC and $252 million on Ethereum (ETH). In all, almost 290,000 traders were “rekt” as cascading margin calls rippled across exchanges, amplifying volatility and slippage in thin order books.

The move follows a failed attempt by BTC to reclaim the $116,000–$123,000 resistance zone earlier in the week. Technicians now flag $104,000 as first defense and $100,000 as the next major support, while a push back above $112,000–$114,000 could stabilize price action.



Altcoins lagged as capital rotated toward Bitcoin and stablecoins during the broader risk-off move. The most significant single liquidation occurred on HYPE, where an ETH-USD position worth $20 million was force-closed amid cascading margin calls.

BNB fell double digits from recent highs; XRP slid toward $2.20 as open interest fell from $9 billion to $3.5 billion following a $610 million liquidation event, even as Volatility Shares filed for a 5x leveraged XRP ETF. Meme coins were hit hardest as on-chain data show aggressive de-risking and reduced spot depth.

The rout also claimed well-known degens. James Wynn suffered multiple liquidations on $kPEPE longs, including a wipe of 9.79 million kPEPE ($66,000) as he re-levered into subsequent dips.

Machi Big Brother saw a string of ETH long liquidations (one block of 206 ETH, $787,000) as price slipped below $3,800. Tracking services note Machi's cumulative drawdowns now far exceed earlier gains, an object lesson in the dangers of high leverage during volatility spikes.

Short term, traders are focused on:

Macro headlines (tariff rhetoric, growth data, and the U.S. government shutdown's knock-on effects) remain the wild card.

If BTC holds $104,000 and ETFs flip back to net inflows, a range rebuild is likely; lose it, and the market's gaze shifts to the psychological $100,000 round number with wider collateral effects across altcoins.

The Fed is cutting rates and, boy, is that making waves in how companies do payroll around here. Crypto payroll solutions are stepping up and they're looking like a solid choice for small and medium businesses. Bringing the possibility of quicker, more affordable, and ultimately more flexible payment options. Let me lay out how this change is reshaping finance, what the pros and cons are of adopting these practices, and what it means for work in a digital economy.

Crypto payroll is basically paying employees using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or stablecoins, instead of the usual fiat currencies. This new trend is really picking up steam with businesses, especially among SMEs who want to streamline how they pay and hope to attract a tech-savvy workforce. And with this use of digital banking for business, there's starting to be some logic to this payroll shift.

Now, let's talk about the Federal Reserve. Their decision to cut rates is sending ripples through the use of crypto payroll. Lowering interest rates will pump more money into the financial system, which makes cryptocurrencies more appealing to everyone, from investors to companies. And if borrowing's cheaper, fintech startups have more room to innovate and create crypto payroll platforms. Which, by the way, are perfect for the SMEs looking for a better way to pay.

The thing is, as interest rates fall, other income sources for businesses dwindle too. So they have to get creative. Using crypto payroll not only helps save money, but it means speed, lower costs, and global payments without borders. In a world where low interest rates are normal, companies have to adapt or risk losing out.

One of the biggest upsides to crypto payroll is its costs savings. Lower transaction fees and no need for banks means that SMEs can keep more money in their pocket. What company wouldn't want that especially if they're trying to work across borders? It's cheaper, plain and simple.

Offering crypto salaries is also a way to attract younger workers. Gen Z who are more open to using digital currency. These companies can also show they're forward-looking and modern, since crypto payroll shows they care about flexibility and new payment methods.

Crypto payroll solutions are also shaking up payroll management. They're automating things like tax compliance and settlements. That means less administrative work and more efficiency. As SMEs start using blockchain payroll platforms, they gain access to financial tools that work with both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. 

But with the good comes the bad. Market volatility is always a risk with crypto. Everyone knows the price swings can be a headache for companies trying to plan payroll expenses. To get around this, many are going for stablecoins instead since they're a more stable value than other cryptos.

Then there's regulatory uncertainty. The rules around cryptocurrencies are still being written and firms have to keep pace. This makes it tough for SMEs trying to jump on the crypto payroll train.

Low-interest is a real moment for crypto banks, right? They are looking to thrive especially as these services become more common. They might even be the new wave of Web3 banking or whatever you want to label it.

Those crypto-friendly banks are coming up with all kinds of new products that meet the needs of today's companies. From trading solutions to yield-generating products, these banks are stepping up. Plus, traditional banks are starting to notice and also integrate more crypto offerings to compete. 

Web3 banking means things are going more decentralized. Which could bring in transparency and efficiency. More businesses are getting in on this trend. Making crypto payroll mainstream. Those who can adapt have a much better chance of succeeding in this shifting financial landscape.

Basically, the Fed's rate cuts are opening doors for crypto payroll to make a mark. Cost savings, talent attraction, and operational benefits are on the table. But businesses still have to consider risks and regulatory challenges. The world is going digital, and those companies using crypto payroll might just have the advantage they need to succeed.

Ethereum (ETH) declined by 2% on Friday despite reports of key crypto investors in Asia collaborating in an effort to launch a $1 billion ETH treasury, according to Bloomberg.

Several crypto leaders in Asia have begun plans to enter the Ethereum treasury race, with Li Lin, founder of crypto exchange Huobi and chairman of investment firm Avenir Capital, joining forces with a group of investors in an effort to launch a $1 billion ETH treasury.

The cohort includes HashKey Group CEO and Chairman Xiao Feng, Fenbushi Capital co-founder Shen Bo and Meitu Inc. founder Cai Wensheng.

The initiative has already seen investors pledge about $1 billion, including a $500 million investment from institutional investors, including HongShan Capital Group (formerly Sequoia China) and $200 million from Lin's Avenir Capital, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

An official announcement regarding the treasury's launch is expected within the next two to three weeks. However, Bloomberg reported that discussions are still underway, and the details of the plan may yet be revised.

The move adds to the list of digital asset treasuries focused on acquiring ETH as a reserve asset. Ethereum treasury companies currently hold 3.6 million ETH, led by BitMine Immersion (BMNR), with 1.7 million ETH. SharpLink Gaming follows behind with over 797,000 ETH worth roughly $3 billion.

With more firms pivoting to an Ethereum treasury, experts are predicting a bubble. BitMine Chairman Thomas Lee stated that the 'bubble has burst' in digital asset treasury companies, as many trade below net asset value.

Ethereum experienced $215.9 million in futures liquidations over the past 24 hours, spearheaded by $146.1 million in long liquidations.

ETH briefly declined below the key support at $3,815, but bulls quickly recovered the level. However, the top altcoin still faces pressure at the level with a descending trendline resistance standing above it.

ETH/USDT daily chart

A failure to hold $3,800 could send ETH toward the support just below $3,500.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are below their neutral levels, indicating a dominant bearish momentum.

The total cryptocurrency market liquidations have crossed the $1 billion mark in the last 24 hours. BNB, Solana, and Cardano declined over 10% in the same time period, resulting in the largest losses among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. 

Bitcoin is experiencing its second bearish Friday in a row, trading below $105,000 at the time of writing as sentiment remains bearish in the broader cryptocurrency market. Altcoins are bearing the biggest brunt, with Ethereum dropping to $3,700 and Ripple sliding below a key support at $2.22. 

Bitcoin price continues to trade in red, below $105,000 at the time of writing on Friday, having corrected nearly 9% so far this week. Renewed geopolitical tensions fueled the pullback in BTC, and the US government shutdown pressured risk assets. 

Pi Network holds at $0.20 level, making muted moves amid the broader market pullback. The technical indicators suggest a decline in selling pressure. Pi Network's CEXs' reserves recorded a net outflow of 2.58 million PI in the last 24 hours.

• Dogecoin stabilized within a $0.18–$0.19 range after early volatility saw prices drop to $0.176.

• Large holders liquidated $74 million in Dogecoin amid broader market declines due to tariff concerns.

• Trading volumes peaked at 1.4 billion, establishing strong support near $0.18.

Dogecoin stabilized Friday after early volatility saw price drop to $0.176 before recovering into a tight $0.18–$0.19 range. The session's 7% swing came amid renewed macro jitters and reports of large whale liquidations totaling over $74 million.

What to Know• DOGE traded between $0.176 and $0.189 through Oct 17, 06:00 – Oct 18, 05:00 UTC, a 6.7% range.• Trading volumes topped 1.4B during the 07:00–08:00 UTC selloff, setting strong support near $0.18.• Large holders reportedly offloaded 360M DOGE ($74M) as broader crypto markets dropped 6% on tariff headlines.• Price rebounded steadily to close around $0.186, forming higher lows across afternoon sessions.• Futures positioning remained mixed as traders weighed Fed policy signals against inflation risks.News BackgroundThe morning dip tracked cross-market weakness following the Trump administration's 100% tariff declaration on Chinese imports — a move that sent risk assets lower across Asia. DOGE faced early liquidation pressure but found stability as whales and market makers absorbed supply near $0.18. Analysts noted a heavy concentration of bids around that level, suggesting accumulation rather than capitulation. Meanwhile, derivative funding rates normalized after a brief spike in short positioning, indicating sentiment is stabilizing.Price Action Summary• Sharp decline from $0.188 → $0.176 at 07:00 UTC on >1.4B volume — the day's capitulation move.• Recovery through mid-session saw DOGE reclaim $0.184–$0.187, consolidating for remainder of the day.• Final hour (04:22–05:21 UTC): test of $0.1853 low met with 10.5M volume spike, followed by steady bounce to $0.1862.• Resistance persisted at $0.188–$0.189 zone with multiple failed breakout attempts.• Tight late-session range ($0.1860–$0.1862) and declining volume signal positioning pause ahead of catalysts.Technical Analysis• Support – $0.175–$0.180 remains a critical accumulation zone; buyers defended lows with high conviction.• Resistance – $0.188–$0.190 marks upper consolidation band; breakout could target $0.20+.• Volume – Peak activity at 1.4B; volume compression late session supports equilibrium formation.• Pattern – Narrow band consolidation following morning flush indicates volatility coil.• Momentum – RSI neutral near 49; MACD flattening — neither trend dominant yet.What Traders Are Watching• Confirmation of $0.18 as a short-term base ahead of weekend sessions.• Renewed whale flows — whether accumulation continues after $74M disposal.• Potential rotation into meme assets amid ETF optimism next week.• Fed commentary on tariffs and liquidity impact on speculative flows.• Breakout above $0.19 as trigger for retest of $0.20–$0.21 zone.

Cyberattacks feel pretty inescapable at the moment. They've always been there but in recent months there have been countless high profile attacks which have potentially huge consequences, including: 

However, smaller businesses or even those not 'in the spotlight' can't rest easy in the hope hackers won't care about them. In fact, they may even be low hanging fruit. For example: 

It's clear that 'no one is safe' and those behind these attacks show no signs of slowing down. A representative from the National Crime Agency suggests she has seen incidents double in the last two years to around 35 – 40 per week. Recent research based on a survey of over 200 cybersecurity professionals in the UK whose companies were subject to a ransomware attack between January – March 2025 also shows that the median demand is over £4 million, which could be devastating for small businesses. 

ICO's Top Tips 

It's, therefore, unsurprising that the ICO have issued a list of practical steps small businesses should take: 

1. Back up your data 

Data should be regularly backed up, but you also need to check it has worked/is working as intended. Equally, you'll need to make sure the back up isn't connected to the live data source to ensure that, if there is malicious activity, it won't reach the back up.  

If you use an external storage device, don't forget to (a) keep it somewhere other than your main workplace; (b) encrypt it; and (c) lock it away, if possible. 

2. Use strong passwords and MFA 

If your password is 'password', 'Password1', 'Password123', etc. (you get the jist), it's probably time to update it!  Always consider strong and unique passwords which would be difficult to guess (e.g. the National Cyber Security Centre recommend picking three random words for passwords). 

Where you have the option, always consider enabling multifactor authentication (MFA). Although it may be inconvenient waiting for your code to be text/emailed, this second layer of security is always a useful measure to implement. 

3. Be aware of your surroundings

One to remember next time you want to do some work on your morning commute. It's important to exercise caution when working out and about. Whether you're on the phone or using a screen when people are around, sending a few extra emails is probably not worth the headache of potentially needing to deal with a security incident. 

4. Be wary of suspicious emails

It's always important to ensure you are cautious of suspicious emails. Sometimes it may just be an odd new request, but things like bad grammar, a need to act urgently, and requests for payment are typical signs something may not be real. It's also worth checking email addresses carefully, e.g. a capital 'i' (I) looks near identical to a lower case L (l).  

However, things like generative AI and spoofing technologies are enabling threat actors to become more sophisticated. A phishing email may not be as implausible as it once was or written with poor English. Equally, it could appear to come from the sender you know (see, for example, where deepfakes were used to convince someone to transfer $25 million on what they believed were the instructions of the CFO).   

5. Install anti-virus and malware protection (and keep it up to date)

Whether in an office or working from home/away, you need to ensure your devices are secure. Anti-virus software is a useful tool to protect against malware which may be sent via phishing attacks. 

6. Protect your device while it's unattended

Whenever you are temporarily away from your desk, at least lock your screen. If you're going to be away for longer, make sure your screens are in a secure place. An unlocked and unattended laptop in a cafe is a threat actor's dream.  

7. Make sure your Wi-Fi is secure

Even if you're conscious of your surroundings and locked your screen as recommended while in a cafe, if you're using the public Wi-Fi or an insecure connection you could still be risking personal data. 

Always make sure you are using a secure connection when connecting to the internet, and if you use the cafe's public network, it's worth also using a secure virtual private network. 

8. Limit access to those who need it

Not everyone in the business will need access to everything, so there should be access controls to ensure people can only see the data they need to. This also needs to be kept in mind where people leave the business or if they're absent for a long period, as you'll need to suspend their ability to access the systems. 

9. Take care when sharing

Showing someone the wrong thing is hardly new, but it still happens. A lot. For example, you may be sharing your screen in a meeting and have tabs or documents which are confidential or include personal data open which can easily be accidentally shown. Equally, make sure notifications are turned off if you're sharing a screen to avoid someone else sending something to you being seen by others. 

If you're emailing lots of people which could reveal sensitive information about recipients, consider alternatives to BCC'ing them, such as bulk email or mail merge services. It's not uncommon for people to CC rather than BCC people, but in certain contexts this could reveal sensitive, if not special category, personal data (see for example, the charity which was fined by the ICO in 2020 when they CC'd 105 members of an HIV advisory board on an email which meant people could be identified). The ICO do also have guidance on sending bulk communications via email. 

10. Don't keep data for longer than you need it 

Not only does this limit the amount of personal information which is at risk if you are subject to an attack or there is a breach, but it will also free up storage space and is likely cheaper! 

11. Dispose of old IT equipment and records safely 

When someone leaves the business, or they get new equipment, make sure there is no personal data on the devices (whether they are laptops, smartphones, or any device) before they are thrown away. For peace of mind, you may want to consider using deletion software or engaging a specialist to wipe any data. 

Is cybersecurity a priority for your business? 

The ICO is clear that "[m]ost small businesses hold personal information and conduct business digitally, so cyber security must be a priority". Ian Hulme (Executive Director for Regulatory Supervision at the ICO) also added that "[w]hile cyber attacks can be very sophisticated, we find that many organisations are still neglecting the very foundations of cyber security". 

Of course, all types of organisations need to ensure their systems are resilient against complex attacks, and they are able to meet their security obligations under data protection law. However, it's important to get the basics right too (we need to walk before we can run!). 

Equally, no system is infallible and it's not uncommon, for example, for cyber criminals to simply buy their way in by 'paying off' an employee. Things do go wrong, even for small businesses, so it's important to think about what you will do when things go wrong, before they do. It may also be worthwhile considering obtaining insurance to cover the costs of a cyberattack (although you'll still need to have a good standard of security in place to ensure you don't void any such insurance). 

If you'd like to discuss your security obligations or how best to mitigate the chance of and prepare for a cyberattack, or would like training for your organisation, please do reach out to your usual Lewis Silkin contact.

Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, appears to be walking back comments calling for the National Guard to patrol San Francisco.

“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” Benioff said in a post on X. “My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused. “

Benioff stirred up controversy last week after giving an interview with The New York Times in which he declared his support for President Donald Trump's threats to deploy National Guard troops in San Francisco and other cities led by Democratic politicians.

While Benioff's comments were apparently prompted by his concerns over public safety costs at the massive Dreamforce conference that the company held in San Francisco last week, the previously liberal-leaning billionaire also used the interview to embrace Trump, at one point saying, “I fully support the president,” and adding that Trump is “doing a great job.” (At the end of the interview, he reportedly asked his shocked PR person, “Too spicy?”)

And although Benioff's pro-Trump stance seemingly aligns with a larger rightward shift among tech executives, his call for the National Guard to come to San Francisco quickly led to pushback from longtime allies and Democratic politicians. Well-known VC Ron Conway stepped down from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, with Conway reportedly telling Benioff in an email, “I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired.” 

An event scheduled to feature Benioff and San Francisco Mayor Dan Lurie was also canceled, with organizers citing rain.

State Senator Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, told Politico, “I'm grateful that Marc walked back his call for the National Guard to be deployed in San Francisco. Marc has done so many good things for our city — and supported so many civic needs — and I'm glad to see this shift.”

Trump has already deployed the National Guard in other cities including Washington, DC and Chicago, while a judge has thus far blocked his attempts to do the same in Portland. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has repeatedly described this as an “invasion” of his state.

Veteran technology journalist Ed Bott has “seen things,” after more than 30 years of covering Microsoft and the PC industry, and he recognizes a pattern in the company's latest AI features for Windows. 

It's part of a high-stakes effort to put Windows at the center of the next big platform shift — attempting to avoid what happened to the company in the mobile revolution, while learning lessons from its rocky early rollout of the Recall AI feature for Copilot+ PCs.

“Probably the single most important thing to know about Microsoft is that when they do something and fail at it, they don't just bury it,” he said. “They'll deal with it for a while, and then they'll come back and they'll try to do it again in a different way.”

Ed joins the GeekWire Podcast to analyze this latest bet, digging into the new “Hey Copilot” voice commands, the promise and security risks of “Copilot Actions” that can work on your local files, and Microsoft's strategic shift to bring AI features to all Windows 11 PCs, not just the premium Copilot+ PC models. 

“I hear from a lot of people who say, ‘Please stop putting AI in everything. I don't need it. I don't want it,'” he said. And yet, Microsoft has a business imperative to make AI unavoidable, because the company believes that its long-term success depends on it.

We also discuss whether users will ever really want to talk to their computers, and the timing of it all, right as Windows 10 support comes to an end.

The crowd at T-Mobile Park has been waiting all week to move the earth again for the Seattle Mariners. They got their chance Friday night.

An eighth-inning grand slam by Geno Suarez sent more than 46,000 fans into a frenzy and triggered seismic activity registered by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN). The organization, which monitors earthquakes and volcanoes in Washington and Oregon, installed a sensor inside the stadium for the Mariners' home playoff games.

Suarez's second home run of the game put the M's ahead of the Toronto Blue Jays 6-2 and sealed Game 5 of the American League Championship Series, which the Mariners now lead, 3-2. The team is one win from its first ever trip to the World Series as the best-of-7 series shifts back to Toronto.

PNSN's device — nicknamed “Richter Rizzs” after longtime Mariners broadcaster Rick Rizzs — picked up sizable seismic energy a week ago when Jorge Polanco hit a game-winning single to win a 15-inning marathon against the Detroit Tigers in Game 5 of the American League Division Series.

The device, which measures vertical ground motion, registered activity after big plays throughout Friday's game, including an earlier home run by Suarez that gave the M's a 1-0 lead and a home run by Cal Raleigh that tied the game at 2-2. 

The grand slam was the biggest show.

PNSN has done monitoring during Seattle Seahawks games — including for the famous “Beast Quake” — and at concerts.

The idea to measure shaking at T-Mobile Park came after Raleigh said he could feel the stadium vibrating during Game 2 of the ALDS earlier this month.

A video during the Suarez slam on Friday (below) showed the PNSN team contributing to some of the shaking in right field as a laptop displayed the seismic activity in real time.

“After Geno's grand slam, I'm not sure I've heard that building any louder than that,” M's manager Dan Wilson said after the game. “You can't say enough about the support we've received from these fans this year.”

When Mike McSherry set out to build a digital health startup, the veteran entrepreneur wanted to create a company that would become ubiquitous in healthcare.

Xealth didn't quite reach that ambitious goal. But its digital health software platform did gain traction — and drew the attention of a global tech giant.

Samsung completed its acquisition of Xealth on Friday. The deal, reported by Modern Healthcare at about $115 million, signals Samsung's deeper push into digital health as it competes against Apple, Amazon, Google, and others.

It's also a major milestone for Xealth, which helps healthcare providers prescribe and manage digital health tools. The company has 55 employees and plans to keep growing in Seattle under the same Xealth brand. 

Samsung wants to triple the team's headcount, said McSherry, who previously co-founded Swype, the predictive-text keyboard acquired by Nuance for $100 million in 2011.

Xealth spun out of Providence Health & Services in 2017. The company's software lets clinicians prescribe and monitor digital therapeutics, devices, and health apps directly through electronic medical-record systems. Since launching eight years ago, Xealth expanded to services like transportation and meal delivery.

McSherry said adaptability — and deep relationships with 15 hospital systems and strategic investors including Novartis, Philips, ResMed, and Samsung — helped the company gain credibility and traction in an industry notoriously slow to adopt technology.

McSherry said U.S. healthcare remains stuck in economics where hospitals are reimbursed for treatment, not prevention.

He pointed to the lack of reimbursement for digital mental health apps despite widespread employer adoption.

That economic misalignment can slow the adoption of digital tools in healthcare, even as AI and connected devices make it easier to monitor health outside the clinic.

“What might be good for a patient is not necessarily good for the hospital finances or the insurance company finances,” McSherry said. “And what might be good for the hospital system can be detrimental to the patient or the insurance company.”

McSherry is bullish about teaming up with Samsung. The company has hundreds of millions of smartphone users and is expanding its line of smartwatches, health rings, and connected appliances.

“Ultimately, that's going to be a doctor in your pocket, or a doctor on your wrist or ring,” he said. Those devices — along with advances in AI — will help intervene and notify consumers that they should schedule a doctor's appointment or take a certain action, McSherry said. 

Samsung is also a top-selling home appliance brand. McSherry sees an opportunity to embed health into the home environment itself — from detecting falls to promoting healthy routines.

Samsung has been seeking FDA approvals for health monitoring features such as AFib and sleep-apnea detection. 

McSherry, who will remain CEO at Xealth, said his team will help build out Samsung's health app store, curating digital-health solutions for consumers.

For startup founders in digital health, McSherry advised to understand who their real buyer is — and what motivates them.

“Who's buying your solution? What are their economic incentives and motivations for buying that? And what are the repercussions to the other players that sit alongside them that may or may not play a role in reimbursement strategies or deployment strategies,” he said.

McSherry co-founded Xealth with Aaron Sheedy, his former colleague at Swype, which also raised investment from Samsung. Xealth raised north of $50 million.

“With the addition of Samsung, hopefully with their brand and their marketing and their prowess and distribution and assets, we can truly create a global platform — which was ultimately the goal at Xealth,” he said.

If you're drowning in charging cables scattered across your desk, nightstand and every outlet in your house, this charger can transform how you power your devices. The Anker Prime 250W charging station is hitting an all-time low of $99 on Amazon, down from $169, but here's the catch: this is a flash sale and only 40 percent of the available stock remains.

See at Amazon

The 250W total output is distributed across six ports: four USB-C and two USB-A. This configuration handles modern devices while accommodating older accessories that still use traditional USB. The first USB-C port delivers a massive 140W on its own which is enough to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent in just 25 minutes. That kind of speed matters when you're racing against a deadline or need to top up quickly before heading out. The remaining ports intelligently share the remaining power based on what's connected, so you can charge your laptop, phone wireless earbuds, smartwatch and portable battery simultaneously.

The GaN Prime tech is what enables this to be delivered in an ultra-compact form factor: Gallium Nitride components produce less heat and waste less power than standard silicon chargers and this enables Anker to put extreme power inside a desktop unit that won't take over the entire workspace. GaN chargers also stay efficient under prolonged load, and keeps the charger cool whether you're using all six ports at full capacity for hours on end.

The 2.26-inch LCD display turns charging from guessing game to accurate monitoring: Real-time wattage is displayed on the screen for each device you plug in, allowing you to see exactly how much power is being delivered to your laptop compared to your phone. This information tells you what's being properly charged at optimal speeds and what could be moved to another port to yield improved results. Tech buffs who appreciate the art of charging efficiently will appreciate the transparency.

The smart control dial adds another layer of customization: Instead of accepting whatever power distribution the charger automatically assigns, you can manually adjust output to prioritize specific devices. Need your laptop charged faster for an urgent meeting? Dial up its power allocation. Want to slow-charge your phone overnight to preserve battery health? Dial it down. This level of control is rare in multi-port chargers, where most models simply distribute power automatically without user input.

The port selection covers every scenario. USB-C handles modern laptops, phones, and tablets. USB-A accommodates wireless earbuds cases, older accessories, and devices that haven't made the transition yet. The combination means this charger remains relevant even as your device ecosystem evolves. At $99 for 250W across six ports, you're paying roughly $16 per port for premium charging capabilities.

But advanced packaging is still conducted in Taiwan

Nvidia and TSMC on Friday announced they had reached a significant milestone with the manufacturing of the first production Blackwell wafer at Fab 21 near Phoenix, Arizona. The achievement of making one of the most complex chips in history in the U.S. has strategic, symbolic, and political importance for both companies, but there is a major catch.

"This is a historic moment for several reasons," said Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, at the commemorative event. "It is the very first time in recent American history that the single most important chip is being manufactured here in the United States by the most advanced fab, by TSMC, here in the United States. This is the vision of President Trump of reindustrialization — to bring back manufacturing to America, to create jobs, of course. Still, also, this is the single most vital manufacturing industry and the most important technology industry in the world."

Production of Nvidia Blackwell B300 silicon (we presume these are the B300 chiplets, though as it is unconfirmed) in the U.S.— one of the most complex chip ever created — using TSMC's 4N fabrication process (a custom 4nm-class node for Nvidia) means that TSMC's Fab 21 is capable of making such large chips presumably with good yields (which apparently took some time to achieve), which may indicate that the fab is indeed as capable as ones that TSMC runs in Taiwan (something that we have already heard from TSMC's own comments, but those were made about smaller chips).

Strategically, it fulfills a key goal of the U.S. government's industrial policy: bringing more advanced semiconductor manufacturing to American soil. Therefore, Nvidia can now claim that it produces one of its most essential products in the U.S. and avoid tariffs if they are imposed on Taiwan-made goods. The same applies to TSMC as it spreads its production across the world, reducing risks for its business from potential interruptions caused by China. Eventually, TSMC is set to build Fab 21 phases that will produce chips on N3, N2, A16, and A14 process technologies in Arizona.

For decades, Nvidia — the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $4.5 trillion — has produced its chips exclusively in Taiwan with a brief production of the NV40 silicon at IBM's microelectronics fab in New York. Producing its key AI GPUs in the U.S. has a deep symbolic meaning for Nvidia, which is an American company.

For the U.S., the achievement has a deep political meaning too. For decades, the world's most sophisticated chips were developed in the U.S. and then almost exclusively made in Taiwan, which created heavy dependence on a nation located in a high-risk geopolitical region. Producing Blackwell — the most advanced and demanded AI GPU — in the world, in the U.S., now gives Washington a tangible outcome from years of subsidies and incentives under the CHIPS Act (and before it), and pressure from the Trump administration. To some degree, this even gives Washington political leverage when negotiating with partners.

While Nvidia's Blackwell silicon is now built in the USA, to make an actual Nvidia B300 out of them, they must be transported back to Taiwan and then integrated using CoWoS-L advanced packaging technologies with HBM3E memory at a TSMC facility. This not only makes these chips more expensive than those produced in Taiwan, but to a large degree, this strikes strategic and political advantages, leaving only the symbolic part.

Still, this strategic dependence on advanced packaging in Taiwan is not going to last long. Both TSMC and Amkor are building advanced packaging facilities in the U.S., so when they come online, sometimes towards the end of the decade, that dependence will get significantly lower. Also, Micron and SK hynix are building DRAM production (Micron only) and HBM packaging facilities in the U.S., which will mark another significant step towards onshoring of production of strategically important components.

New system, new disc drive.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft ended official support for Windows 10 last week, which means an entirely new population has been forced to move to Windows 11, or be left behind. While the tech-savvy gentry can work their way around the artificially imposed red tape, most people would want to adhere to policy. That's what's happening in Japan. According to IT Media, shops in Tokyo's bustling Akihabara area are suddenly experiencing a meteoric rise in Windows 11 demand, alongside one other oddity — optical drives.

Yes, disc drives are apparently back in fashion in Japan as interest in switching to Windows 11 has "peaked" and only continues to increase there. People upgrading to the new operating system want to likely keep their physical media collection accessible, which has made disc drives a commodity. Unfortunately, they're out of stock pretty much anywhere, especially if you're looking for an internal Blu-ray drive (BD-R), which are a tier above the standard DVD-R options... but even those are scarce.

 




"Many people may prioritize writing speed and want an internal drive. With external drives, there's inevitably a limit to how fast they can be," says Dospara Akihabara Main Shop, a popular computer parts vendor in the region. Another retailer explained how internal disc drives are largely overlooked now since most modern PC cases don't have slots for proper optical drives. In pursuit of cleaner aesthetics and SSDs becoming mainstream, it doesn't make sense to account for the heat dissipation of an internal drive, especially with power-hungry GPUs.

There's little sense of urgency in upgrading from Windows 10 to 11, compared to how quickly people adopted Windows 10 when its predecessors became outdated. Still, the demand to carry over physical media support, especially in the age of perpetual licensing, seems to be more alive than ever. People building new systems solely for the reason of getting on board with Windows 11 are now in the market for disc drives, which is likely the main driver behind this sudden trend.

Another shop in Akihabara, TSUKUMO eX., highlighted how "There are quite a few people who want to install an optical drive in their machine in a Windows 11 environment, just like they did in Windows 10," corroborating that even if the West has generally moved on, Japan still loves its discs.

Meta-owned chat app WhatsApp changed its business API policy this week to ban general-purpose chatbots from its platform. The move will likely affect WhatsApp-based assistants of companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Khosla Ventures-backed Luzia, and General Catalyst-backed Poke.

The company has added a new section to address “AI providers” in its business API terms, focusing on general-purpose chatbots. The terms, which will go into effect on January 15, 2026, say that Meta won't allow AI model providers to distribute their AI assistants on WhatsApp.

Providers and developers of artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies, including but not limited to large language models, generative artificial intelligence platforms, general-purpose artificial intelligence assistants, or similar technologies as determined by Meta in its sole discretion (“AI Providers”), are strictly prohibited from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether directly or indirectly, for the purposes of providing, delivering, offering, selling, or otherwise making available such technologies when such technologies are the primary (rather than incidental or ancillary) functionality being made available for use, as determined by Meta in its sole discretion.

Meta confirmed this move to TechCrunch and specified that this move doesn't affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a travel company running a bot for customer service won't be barred from the service.

Meta's rationale behind this move is that WhatsApp Business API is designed for businesses serving customers rather than acting as a platform for chatbot distribution. The company said that while it built the API for business-to-business use cases, in recent months, it saw an unanticipated use case of serving general-purpose chatbots.

“The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said in a comment to TechCrunch.

Meta said that the new chatbot use cases placed a lot of burden on its system with increased message volume and required a different kind of support, which the company wasn't ready for. The company is banning use cases that fall outside “the intended design and strategic focus” of the API.

The move will effectively make WhatsApp unavailable as a platform to distribute AI solutions like assistants or agents. It also means Meta AI is the only assistant available on the chat app.

Last year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT on WhatsApp, and earlier this year, Perplexity launched its own bot on the chat app to tap into the user base of more than 3 billion people. Both of the bots could answer queries, understand media files, answer questions about them, reply to voice notes, and generate images. This likely generated a lot of message volume.

However, there was a bigger issue for Meta. WhatsApp's Business API is one of the primary ways the chat app makes money. It charges businesses based on different message templates like marketing, utility, authentication, and support. As there wasn't any provision for chatbots in this API design, WhatsApp wasn't able to charge them.  

During Meta's Q1 2025 earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg pointed out that business messaging is a big opportunity for the company to bring in revenue.

“Right now, the vast majority of our business is advertising in feeds on Facebook and Instagram,” he said. “But WhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly [active users], with more than 100 million people in the US and growing quickly there. Messenger is also used by more than a billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.”

Recovery teams working on the Titan submersible have found the vessel's specialist stills and video camera intact. Fascinatingly, while there was some damage to the camera's housing and internal components, tech and science enthusiast Scott Manley reveals that the internal SD card was “undamaged.” Contents of the memory card have since been investigated, and 12 stills and nine videos have been recovered.

Click 'See more' for images.

In the images, you can see a SubC-branded Rayfin Mk2 Benthic Camera, recovered from the wreckage of the ill-fated submersible operated by OceanGate. This still and video camera is rated to withstand depths up to 6,000m (19,685 feet, 3,281 fathoms). The titanium and synthetic sapphire crystal constructed device features both onboard and expansion memory (the titular SD card).

 




Inside the camera's tube-like form, it is observed that the PCBs had suffered some slight damage. For example, connectors between two boards were sheared off, and some surface mount components were similarly damaged.

In some images of the PCB that are shared, you will notice details are blurred at the request of the Canada-based underwater imaging specialist and Rayfin Mk2 Benthic Camera manufacturer. However, SubC's requested trade secret obfuscation hasn't stopped internet sleuths asserting that they know exactly what components have been redacted.

Picking through Manley's Tweet thread replies, the key PCBs in the camera were likely an Inforce 6601 System on Module (SoM) based on the Qualcomm SD820 processor, which comes with 4GB of RAM on board and 64GB of UFS storage. Another component is thought to be the Teensy 4.0 or 3.2, which acted as an MCU. Last but not least, the undamaged SD card is almost certainly a SanDisk Extreme Pro 512GB ($62.99 at the time of writing), though it was de-branded in the photos.

With an undamaged SD card, of course, investigators (and others) were interested in what details of the tragedy may have been captured and stored by this camera system. The first step was to make “an exact binary image of the SD card” so the original could be left untampered.

Check out Manley's Tweet thread, containing investigator report screengrabs, to take in the full gamut of back and forth between the data forensics investigator, Canada's Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), and SubC. To cut a long technical story short, though, the parties eventually met up at a lab/office in Newfoundland, where a recovered NVRAM chip and SD card image were interfaced with a “surrogate SoM board.” This did the trick, and 12 still and nine videos were recovered!

Recovered images were at a resolution of 4,056 x 3,040 pixels, implying a pretty common 12.3MP sensor was used by the SubC Rayfin Mk2 Benthic Camera. Videos were at a more standard 3,840 x 2,160 pixels – commonly referred to as 4K Ultra HD (UHD) video.

Somewhat disappointingly, the images and videos shared in the report were taken in the vicinity of the ROV shop at the Marine Institute, also in Newfoundland. The location was the logistical base for Titanic dive missions. No deep-sea shenanigans around the Titanic wreck were revealed. Manley explains in his Twitter thread that “the camera had been configured to dump data onto an external storage device, so nothing was found from the accident dive.” Nothing particularly pertinent to the tragic accident, that is.

Speaking at a Citadel Securities event on October 6, the Nvidia CEO blamed U.S. export controls and said the company now assumes no revenue from China in its forecasts.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week that the company's share of China's advanced AI accelerator market has collapsed from roughly 95% to zero as US export controls continue to bite. The comment came during a live interview at Citadel Securities' Future of Global Markets 2025 event in New York on October 6, in which Huang said, “At the moment, we are 100% out of China,” adding, “We went from 95% market share to 0%.”

A full video of the interview was published on YouTube this week by Citadel Securities and marks the first time Nvidia has publicly quantified the scale of its retreat. Huang didn't name specific products, but his remarks point squarely to Nvidia's data center GPU line, which has faced rolling waves of export restrictions since October 2022. The company's China-focused A800 and H800 parts were rendered noncompliant by export prohibitions in 2023, while a newer design — the H20 — has faced licensing hurdles of its own.

“I can't imagine any policymaker thinking that's a good idea, that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world to 0%,” Huang said of the outcome.

Nvidia has previously disclosed that China represented between 20% and 25% of its data center revenue — a segment that generated more than $41 billion in its most recent financial results, representing a 56% year-over-year increase. While that figure includes cloud customers across a wide range of workloads, AI infrastructure remains the company's growth engine. A prolonged clampdown could reshape both demand and supply chains.

The US government has tightened controls over AI accelerators sold to China as part of a broader strategy to limit Beijing's access to cutting-edge semiconductors. But Huang's comments highlight how quickly the dynamic has shifted on the ground. “In all of our forecasts… we're assuming 0% for China,” he said. “If anything happens in China… it will be a bonus.”

Nvidia's cautious guidance comes amid signs of deeper fragmentation in the AI stack. China's hyperscalers and AI labs have increasingly turned to domestic silicon or alternative hardware in response to the export curbs, accelerating efforts to localize compute infrastructure. That's a trend Huang flagged earlier this year, when he warned that blanket restrictions could spur the development of competitive substitutes.

While Huang said that he has hopes that Nvidia's business can return to China in the future, the company has effectively written off the country for the moment.

SpaceX got caught sending data on the wrong frequency.

An amateur satellite tracker accidentally discovered a subset of classified military SpaceX satellites that are transmitting data on the wrong radio frequency. According to NPR, Canadian Scott Tilley found the mysterious signal while working on his hobby of monitoring satellites at home, when he inadvertently set his system to scan for radio frequencies that usually didn't have traffic. To his surprise, he saw a signal emanating from space in the 2025-2110 MHz band, which satellites use to receive data from ground stations.

It is somewhat unusual, as this should've been empty, so Tilley recorded the transmissions for a few minutes. “It was just a clumsy move at the keyboard. I was resetting some stuff and then all of a sudden I'm looking at the wrong antenna, the wrong band,” Tilley told NPR. “[It] should have nothing there. I got a hold of my mouse and hit the record button and let it record for a few minutes.” He then compared his data to a satellite tracking database maintained by other amateurs and enthusiasts, which allowed him to identify the offending satellites. “Bang, up came an unusual identification that I wasn't expecting at all. Starshield.”

Starshield is SpaceX's classified satellite constellation, used primarily by the U.S. military for Earth observation and communications. It currently has over 200 satellites as part of the network, operated by the National Reconnaissance Office. Tilley says that he's detected the unusual signal from 170 Starshield satellites, all within the same frequency range.

The 2025 to 2110 MHz spectrum is typically quiet because it's reserved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for satellite uplinks, which are usually conducted in short bursts, rather than the reverse. Because of this, SpaceX's use of this frequency for sending data back to Earth can potentially cause interference with other nearby satellites — whether commercial, scientific, or even military — causing them to become unresponsive to commands. “SpaceX is smart and savvy,” Tilley said to the publication, and it's likely that the company just went to “do it and ask forgiveness later.”

It's unlikely that SpaceX's circumvention of global standards has caused a significant disruption, as no other satellite operator has complained so far. Still, Tilley said that he published his findings on the open-access research repository Zenodo.org so that different operators are aware of this potential interference.

Technically speaking, an engine is a device that converts some form of energy into mechanical energy. Taking that definition to heart, physicists harnessed the strange rules of microscopic physics and created the hottest engine ever—which also happens to be the smallest engine ever made.

In a forthcoming paper for Physical Review Letters, researchers describe a tiny engine crammed inside a microscopic particle trapped in electrical limbo. Using this setup, the engine reportedly achieved a temperature of 10 million Kelvins, or about 18 million degrees Fahrenheit—colder than the Sun's core (27 million degrees F) but much hotter than the corona (up to 3.5 million degrees F).

“By getting to grips with thermodynamics at this unintuitive level, we can design better engines in the future and experiments which challenge our understanding of nature,” Molly Message, study lead author and a PhD student at King's College London (KCL) in the United Kingdom, said in a statement.

In the engine, electrodes trap and levitate the microparticle in a near-vacuum setup called a Paul trap. When the researchers applied a noisy voltage to the electrodes, the particle started to aggressively jiggle, causing exponential increases in temperature for the overall system.

The results were intriguing. According to the researchers, the engine fluctuated between being highly efficient and outright defying the basic laws of thermodynamics. In some cycles, the engine's power output exceeded the energy it consumed.

Other times, the engine randomly cooled down when subjected to conditions that should have made it hotter. This was likely on account of unseen forces at play, given the tiny size of the system, the researchers noted.

“We can see all these odd thermodynamic behaviors, which are totally intuitive if you're a bacterium or a protein, but just unintuitive if you're a big lump of meat like us,” explained James Millen, study senior author and a physicist at KCL, to New Scientist.

Due to the engine's small size, it probably won't end up in cars or household appliances, at least not any time soon. Instead, the researchers envision more theoretical applications for their small powerhouse. For instance, the trap is ideal for simulating other microscopic phenomena, such as how proteins fold inside our body, driving various metabolic processes.

“Proteins fold over milliseconds, but the atoms [that] make them move over nanoseconds,” explained Jonathan Pritchett, study co-author and a postdoctoral researcher at KCL, in the statement. “These divergent timescales make it very difficult for a computer to model them. By just observing how the microparticle moves and working out a series of equations based on that, we avoid this problem entirely.”

That's just one example of many, the researchers added. As the engine demonstrates, the physics of the microscopic world work in mysterious ways—mysteries that perhaps require microscopic tools to solve.

T-Mobile has turned the wireless industry on its head with an offer that sounds too good to be true: free iPhone 17 devices for practically anyone who walks through their doors. Whether you're a loyal customer or someone fed up with your current carrier's inflated prices, T-Mobile is handing out Apple's latest flagship phones at zero cost.

See iPhone 17 at T-Mobile

Trade in any smartphone in any condition and claim an iPhone 17 Pro without spending a dime. New customers joining the Experience More or Experience Beyond plans don't even need a trade-in to secure a standard iPhone 17. And if you're bringing the entire family along, T-Mobile will give you up to four lines of unlimited service for just one hundred dollars per month, with each line qualifying for its own complimentary iPhone 17.

This isn't a limited-time offer gimmick meant only to pull in a few customers before reverting back to stealth mode: T-Mobile's got the infrastructure and faith backing such aggressive promotions because they run the fastest network in America, according to Ookla's Speedtest Intelligence data. Their first quarter 2025 readings revealed T-Mobile's decisive lead over the competition in speed and total performance. The company's been methodically growing its coverage area with 5G and adds towers and bandwidth that yield concrete improvements you can expect the moment you begin to use your brand-new device.

T-Mobile's ambitions extend beyond traditional cellular coverage with their T-Satellite service, which leverages orbital technology to reach locations other providers simply cannot access. This innovation ensures strong signals even in remote areas where competitors' networks fade into uselessness. The company has also optimized its integration with iOS, making these iPhone 17 promotions a natural extension of their network strategy rather than a desperate attempt to attract subscribers.

The economic benefits add up quickly for switchers: T-Mobile claims existing customers from competing networks can save up to twenty percent each month with a switch to an Experience plan. Those plans include in-flight Wi-Fi and Magenta Status benefits among others, but the large benefit remains in that no-cost iPhone 17 in the palm of your hand with your monthly fees lowered.

Earlier this week, Nvidia's DGX Spark AI mini-PCs were released to the masses. Symbolic of the splintered state of the AI industry, though, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered DGX Spark systems to Elon Musk and Sam Altman — separately. Altman and Musk once worked closely together, for a common cause, as co-founders of OpenAI, where Jensen once hand-delivered the original DGX-1 nine years ago, long before the AI boom began.

The last time we saw such a star-studded DGX photo-op was when Huang hand-delivered the original DGX-1 to Elon Musk, in his role as co-founder of non-profit OpenAI. Once partners seeking to further the development of safe AI for the benefit of humankind, Musk and Altman have become the fiercest of rivals. The rivalry isn't very sportsmanlike, either, with the pair now regularly trading barbs and public insults, and even engaging in some acrimonious legal tussles. Since 2023, we have also had two distinct competitive AI products addressing the same market, albeit from different angles: ChatGPT and Grok.

 




Musk received his DGX Spark while wearing his ‘Chief Engineer at SpaceX' hat. Huang quipped that he was “delivering the smallest supercomputer next to the biggest rocket,” at the Starbase, Texas facility.

 




We are reminded by the Nvidia blog that the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip-powered DGX Spark packs 128GB of unified memory and delivers a petaflop of AI performance. It is claimed to have enough resources and muscle to run models with 200 billion parameters locally. Moreover, the Green Team's blog highlights that it has been nine years since Huang personally delivered the DGX-1 to Musk at OpenAI.

Things have come a long way since the delivery of the DGX-1 9 years ago; amazing to see... https://t.co/bgG5HTSzzcOctober 15, 2025

Sam Altman also reminisced about Huang's previous little parcel. “Things have come a long way since the delivery of the DGX-1 9 years ago; amazing to see...” mused the OpenAI boss. Altman was commenting on the President and co-founder (another one) of OpenAI, Greg Brockman's, shared photo. The picture shows Huang nestled between Brockman and Altman.

Huang famously started his career washing dishes, bussing, and waiting at Denny's. Now he's back as a server, but on the menu are slices of AI-accelerating silicon, delivered in person to a select few fellow tech industry giants.

Nvidia's Jensen-powered delivery service isn't standard, even though the DGX Spark has gotten a third more expensive since it was first announced. The Nvidia first-party DGX Spark MSRP is now $3,999, and it is shipping direct from Nvidia, Micro Center, and a number of partners.

The first batch of DGX Spark systems was also put into the hands of researchers at AI-processing hungry companies like Anaconda, Cadence, ComfyUI, Docker, Google, Hugging Face, JetBrains, LM Studio, Meta, Microsoft, Ollama, and Roboflow.

If you are interested in the DGX Spark, and its integrated Nvidia AI stack with full CUDA library support, the firm's partners are also cooking up systems, featuring their own special saucy tech - but they all look fairly similar. DGX Spark systems are being made and marketed by Acer, Asus, Dell Technologies, Gigabyte, HPI, Lenovo, and MSI. You definitely won't get Jensen-powered delivery with these, though, you'd be lucky to get a free MSI dragon plush toy.

Honey, wake up, new EU regulation just dropped


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The standardization of USB-C on phones and tablets received a big push by the EU's 2024 mandate, which also includes a similar provision for laptops come 2026. This time around, the bloc is aiming for a 2028 standardization of power bricks and wall warts on USB-C with detachable cables for a good chunk of consumer electronics, including gaming consoles, monitors, routers, wireless chargers, set-top boxes, and even Ethernet PoE injectors.

The new EU legislation targets power units of all types, referring to them as External Power Supplies (EPS). The primary goals are interoperability and sustainability, allowing buyers to use one EPS and/or cable for multiple devices, as is already the case for phones and tablets. The refreshed laws apply to power supplies of up to 240 W, requiring them to include at least one USB-C port and have a detachable cable. Naturally, the power delivery comes by way of the USB-PD standard.

The legislation also forces manufacturers to display power ratings on the EPS itself, the charging port, and even the cables themselves. The rated wattage must be for continuous charging without voltage drops, presumably to prevent inflated, unrealistic figures. A new "Common Charger" logo should make it easy for users to identify compliant chargers.

On the efficiency front, the laws say that EPS units capable of pushing more than 10 W (nearly all of them) must have minimum efficiency requirements at 10% rated load, and "more stringent" average and no-load efficiency requirements. Likewise, wireless charging pads must have lower idle power consumption, and their power supply circuit should be external so that it's replaceable and/or reusable.

Interestingly, the technical requirements also include a level of mandatory surge protection, as wall-warts for routers and Wi-Fi APs tend to include such measures. Some categories of devices are excluded from these requirements, namely, but not limited to, UPS units, medical devices, certain toys, electric scooters and bikes, emergency lighting control gear, and devices for use in wet conditions.

The law also notes that stand-alone EPS (such as third-party chargers) are covered, as well as manufacturer-supplied units. It's perhaps worth noting that, contrary to popular belief, the EU does not prevent manufacturers from bundling a power supply or charger with a device (looking at you, Apple, Google, & Co).

Besides the practical benefits to consumers, the EU expects these measures to save 1,070 TWh per year by 2030, as it estimates that 400 million ESDs are sold with devices every year. Ironically, these new laws arguably do a better job of standardizing USB-C power delivery than the USB-IF standards body and its alphabet soup.

I don't know about you, but for me, there's something infinitely appealing about compact gadgets. I loved the iPhone Mini (RIP) and love (present-tense) the very much still-existent Samsung Galaxy Z Flip (not RIP). And don't even get me started on tiny gaming handhelds like Panic's Playdate. Seriously, take one look at that thing and tell me it's not the cutest goddamn handheld you've ever seen. If I could, I'd pinch its Simpons-yellow cheeks.

But as much as I love compact gadgets, there's something that loses me once portable Bluetooth speakers come into play. Maybe I'm just too much of an audio snob to fully enjoy a portability-focused speaker, but sometimes bigger is better in the audio space, and with speakers, that's partly just a matter of physics. Bigger speakers move more air, which in turn equates to more bass, higher volume, and often, less distortion. Nevertheless, you're not going to catch me walking around with a car-sized boombox any time soon, which means some level of compromise in the audio department is always inevitable.

But how much s appropriate at $129? Bose's latest tiny Bluetooth speaker may have just answered my question.

Bose SoundLink Micro (2nd gen)

Bose's tiny Bluetooth speaker has great sound and a much-improved battery life.

Pros

Cons

Bose's $129 SoundLink Micro (2nd gen) is maybe the first ultra-portable Bluetooth speaker that I've felt like I could use on a regular basis, and it's thanks in large part (no pun intended) to its big emphasis on sound quality. Like the recent SoundLink Plus, which I reviewed this year, the SoundLink Micro sounds great, but does so in a form factor that's about a third of the size, if not less.

Don't get me wrong, you're not going to get anywhere near as much bass or volume from the SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen) as you will out of the SoundLink Plus, but you'll still get a lot more than you might expect. I carried the SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen) around Washington Square Park in Manhattan and was pleasantly surprised by not only the volume, but also the quality of the sound it was putting out.

It's not as loud as competitors like the recently released JBL Grip, the unofficial tall boy of Bluetooth speakers, but that's more than okay in my book, because it sounds a heck of a lot nicer. I played a few different genres on the SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen), including jazz/funk, ambient, and rock, and all three had the nuance you'd expect from Bose. Bass was punchy and natural, but not overpowering, which means you can still hear mid and high frequencies where vocals and guitars live.

This isn't going to contend with bigger speakers in terms of sound quality, nor should you ever expect a speaker of this size to do so, but if you're looking for audio that doesn't suck, the SoundLink Micro (2nd gen) has it. There are inevitably moments where its limitations come into focus, particularly at higher volumes, or in the speaker's handling of treble sometimes (in some songs I listened to, higher frequencies sounded almost a little too sharp and snappy), but its faults weren't enough to change my overall impressions. This speaker sounds pretty good and even better next to competitors from JBL.

I'm not often in a position where I need to emphasize portability above all else (usually an average-sized speaker like Soundcore's Boom 3i or one of JBL's Charge line is small enough to fit into a bag), but if I were at a premium for space, the SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen) would easily be among my first picks for which speaker I grab before I go backpacking in the Carpathian Mountains or whatever; and believe or not, there's more than one reason for that.

In the second-gen SoundLink Micro, Bose ups the durability, giving it an IP67 rating. That means it's able to deal with dust but also withstand pretty much any water that you may encounter in a normal, non-biblical flood setting. To test that out, I have the SoundLink Micro, a little rinse in the sink after getting some dirt on it, and sure enough, it worked just fine afterwards. Bose says the SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen) is also more durable, though I don't do any intensive drop testing, so on that front, you'll have to take Bose's word. Anecdotally, the speaker feels solid and sturdy enough to withstand some drops.

Another area in which Bose's second-gen SoundLink Micro improves is battery life. I've not tested the first-gen version of this Bluetooth speaker, but from what I can tell, the battery life was, well… bad. Even by Bose's official estimate, it's only rated for 6 hours of audio playback, which is more than enough in the context of one sitting, but annoying when you consider that almost no one remembers to charge their Bluetooth speaker every day. Those 6 hours are going to be all used up before you know it.

This time around, Bose doubled the battery life, and based on my testing, its estimates are pretty accurate. After over an hour of listening at about 50% volume, the SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen), which was at 60% when I started, didn't budge. Obviously, battery life is contingent on lots of things, particularly the volume you're playing music at, so your exact mileage may vary, but in my experience, Bose's speakers seemed to hold up well. To be clear, 12 hours isn't the longest battery life in the world, but it feels like a good amount for a speaker this size, especially when considering competitors like JBL's Grip, which is also rated for 12 hours on a full charge.

Another notable tweak from the last generation is the velcro strap, which, this time around, is both removable and replaceable. There's not much to say here, really. I strapped the SounLink Micro (2nd Gen) to the belt loop on my pants and walked around, which made me feel like a dork, but it didn't fall off. Being able to remove and replace the band feels like a welcome change, given the fact that it's just a piece of fabric. If it should get torn or tarnished in any way, you may want to swap it out.

One thing you will not get this time around is a microphone. Bose's SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen) does away with an integrated mic that could be used for talking via speakerphone, as well as activating a voice assistant. I guess it's a bummer to lose a feature, but I'm not sure that will be a major drag for most people, since the vast majority of us aren't itching to yell into a tiny Bluetooth speaker for calls (or, really, for any other reason.)

One other nice-to-have this time around is the switch from microUSB to USB-C, which is more a matter of timing than anything else, since the first-gen SoundLink Micro was released all the way back in 2017. There's also more functionality with the Bose app that lets you do more granular stuff, like three-band EQ. That upgrade is augmented further by a new “shortcut” button on the speaker that can be programmed to do various things. By default, the button is used to link two Bose speakers so they can play at the same time, but it can also be programmed to play Spotify on your device with a single press. There's also your typical array of buttons that let you skip tracks, play/pause, power off/on, and connect to Bluetooth.

If there's one gripe I have with the SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen), it's the same one I have with most speakers of this size, which is that the ability to hitch it to things just doesn't make a ton of sense for a front-firing device. Sure, you could strap the product to your bike or belt, but then your music is blaring rather than at you. That can feel a little silly, or obnoxious at worst, but it's just a fact of any speaker meant to be used in this way. One thing I can nudge Bose for, though, is not having a way to stand the SoundLink Micro up. The JBL Grip, which I recently tested, can stand upright, making positioning the speaker so that it actually plays toward you much easier. I would've loved to see a kickstand or something similar here, but I guess precariously perching the speaker upright works well enough of the time.

Tiny Bluetooth speakers aren't for everyone. They serve a specific type of person in a specific type of scenario. But if you're looking for something very portable, Bose is holding that category down well. The latest SoundLink Micro costs $30 more than JBL's Grip, but given the difference in sound quality and the parity on battery life, I think the Bose premium is worth it here. If you want something on the louder side, JBL still has the SoundLink beat, but Bose will be the better pick for most people.

You should never expect the world out of a Bluetooth speaker this size, but Bose has also proven that you can expect a solid package. Coupled with other quality of life improvements over the last generation, this is firmly the only SoundLink Micro speaker worth buying at this point, and one of the most appealing I've used so far.

The T-Force Z54E brings lightning-fast PCIe 5.0 storage to consumers via the Phison E28 SSD controller.

TeamGroup has announced its new T-Force Z54E, a PCIe 5.0 SSD designed to trade blows with the best SSDs on the market. Notably, the Z54E isn't just another PCIe 5.0 drive but the first retail SSD to launch with Phison's high-performance E28 SSD controller, setting it apart from the competition.

The E28 controller signifies a substantial advancement over its predecessor, the E26 controller. Utilizing TSMC's 6nm process technology, the E28 delivers enhanced performance and superior power efficiency. Furthermore, the E28 serves as Phison's response to Silicon Motion's SM2508, which has been expanding its presence within the PCIe 5.0 market segment. With the introduction of the E28, Phison endeavors to reestablish its position as the leading manufacturer of PCIe 5.0 controllers.

The Z54E will be one of many consumer PCIe 5.0 M.2 2280 drives employing the Phison E28 controller. TeamGroup does not specify the particular type of flash memory used in the Z54E, only indicating that it is constructed with "high-density 3D TLC NAND flash." If an inference must be made, it is likely to utilize a 232-layer NAND, suggesting that TeamGroup may potentially be sourcing the flash from Micron or YMTC.

The Z54E delivers sequential read and write speeds up to 14,900 MB/s and 14,000 MB/s, respectively, in its 4TB and 2TB configurations. The 1TB model, representing the lowest capacity SKU, operates with a sequential write speed approximately 300 MB/s lower. TeamGroup has not disclosed the random performance metrics for the Z54E. The drive is equipped with a DRAM cache; however, the capacity has not been specified by TeamGroup. Additionally, the company has not released the random performance figures for the Z54E.

Endurance performance on the Z54E is not too bad. The 1TB model is rated for 600 TBW, a figure that is subsequently doubled as capacity increases. The endurance levels are comparable to those of competing drives, such as the Sandisk WD Black SN8100 and Samsung 9100 Pro.

The Z54E will be equipped with TeamGroup's patented ultra-thin graphene heatsink to enhance heat dissipation. It appears that the company is not providing a version incorporating its T-Force Dark Flow active SSD cooler on this occasion. Considering that the E28 draws a maximum of approximately 7W, the Z54E is likely adequately cooled without the need for a chunky active cooling solution.

TeamGroup supports the Z54E with a limited five-year warranty. The company did not disclose the pricing or availability; however, we have contacted them for further information. We will provide updates to this report once the company responds.

Audien Hearing made waves last year when it launched the Atom One, one of the few hearing aids to hit the market for under $100. The only problem is one you probably figured out already: They just weren't very effective as hearing aids, providing a blunt amplification of every sound, whether you wanted to hear it or not—underpinned with a steady layer of hiss.

Audien has repeatedly tried again in this low-end part of the market, cranking out at least five models of low-cost hearing aids. While they have gently ratcheted up the price, most cost under $300. Its latest release is the Atom X, another spin on the same in-the-ear design but with some fancy new features and a $389 price, inching ever upward.

The hearing aids themselves aren't exactly striking: Earplug-like and beige, with a weight of 2.20 grams each, the simple devices each have a fat button on the outward-facing surface. These buttons control everything from volume (independently in each ear) and streaming media to hands-free calling, depending on whether they are connected via Bluetooth and how long the button is pressed.

The oblong design looks a bit odd at first, but it turns out they are fairly comfortable for longer listening sessions and reasonably discreet, only barely visible when in place in the ear. Three sets of differently sized ear tips in two different shapes, both unvented, are included in the box.

The surprising and much bigger news involves the case, and I can safely say that the Atom X has the most advanced and useful case of any hearing aid product I've tested to date—more powerful than the case included with products that are 10 times the cost. The secret sauce is a touchscreen on the front, letting you easily tap to control volume, environmental mode, and toggle Bluetooth on and off.

When streaming over Bluetooth, the touchscreen changes to control media volume and access to the transparency level (the amount of noise cancellation). Yet another mode kicks in when you are interacting with a phone call. The case also displays the real-time battery level for each hearing aid independently and the battery level of the case itself. Audien says you can expect 20 hours from the aids (without streaming) on a full charge and 28 additional hours of charge from the case before it needs to be topped up via a USB-C connection. Those estimates were reasonably accurate in my testing. As a bonus, the case even includes a built-in UV sterilization system.

I really enjoyed having all of this power at the ready without having to use an app, which is especially handy because Audien doesn't have an app. Streaming functions largely work like they would on a standard set of Bluetooth earbuds, and all hearing aid settings have to be managed through the case.

That lack of control has long been the problem with Audien's products, which are blunt amplifiers that can't be tuned outside of changing the volume and picking one of the four environmental modes. There is no hearing test function and no way to shape the frequencies where you need the most help, which means everything gets lifted, more or less. For users accustomed to more refined control, it's a jarring experience, though Audien suggests that over time “your brain will adjust” to the overload of background sounds and your own booming voice.

The four environmental modes can be of some help here, but the best in my experience was the default Comfort mode, which “reduces the sharpness of high-frequency sounds and overall intensity, creating a more comfortable, balanced listening experience.” The Atom X's Conversation mode was too sharp for much use, while the Crowd and TV modes didn't make a big impact in comparison to the Comfort mode.

I immediately noticed that there was a much lower level of hiss on the Atom X than on previous Audien hearing aids, but the overall experience still wasn't all that effective. By blasting out lower frequencies I didn't need amplified, I found I often heard worse with the hearing aids in than with them out—and this was exacerbated the louder I pushed the volume. At very low levels of amplification (10 or 20 percent at most), the hearing aids were at their most effective for me. Anything beyond that threatened to get painful.

At $389, the Atom X is a tough sell compared to the $249 Apple AirPods Pro 3, which have a tuning system, app control, outstanding noise cancellation, and overall better-quality hearing support. Yes, they are much larger and more visible than the Atom X aids, but if you never actually wear your hearing aids because they don't provide a great experience, how much does discretion even matter?

This past Monday, October 13, Starship Version 2 launched for the last time, ending its nearly two-year run on a high note. The megarocket's 11th suborbital test flight marked the final launch of this iteration of Starship, making way for an upgraded version that's larger and equipped with more efficient Raptor engines.

Starship's Version 3 is set to debut in 2026, marking the beginning of SpaceX's orbital tests of its launch vehicle. This version of Starship will carry payloads to orbit and fly missions to the Moon and Mars. The upgraded vehicle will be about 5 feet taller (1.5 meters), capable of carrying more propellant, and equipped with new docking adapters for in-orbit fuel transfer.

Starship's latest flight was another big success. SpaceX carried out several in-flight demonstrations to prepare for the launch of the rocket's upgraded version. The second-generation prototype flew on a suborbital trajectory, similar to its previous missions, and deployed eight Starlink simulators.

Starship's last two flights were successful, but they followed a string of mission failures that plagued the rocket's first three launches of the year. Although Version 2 ended on a high, it did have a rather turbulent run. Nonetheless, the company is now turning its attention toward the upgraded version of its rocket.

“Focus now turns to the next generation of Starship and Super Heavy, with multiple vehicles currently in active build and preparing for tests,” SpaceX wrote in a statement. “This next iteration will be used for the first Starship orbital flights, operational payload missions, propellant transfer, and more as we iterate to a fully and rapidly reusable vehicle with service to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.”

The next-generation upgrade to the current prototype features a larger vehicle that's capable of carrying more propellant. The rocket will also use a more powerful and efficient version of its engines, the third-generation Raptor engines.

“We're also getting energy storage upgrades, tons of avionics changes—a lot of things that will enable longer-duration missions,” SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot said during Starship's 11th test flight webcast.

In order to prepare the rocket for missions beyond low Earth orbit, the company also needs to equip Starship with a ship-to-ship propellant transfer system to refuel the vehicle in space.

“One notable thing you'll start seeing on the outside are these new docking adapters, which we'll use when we bring two Starships together for propellant transfer,” Huot said. “That's a core capability of Starship that we're going to demonstrate next year.”

As with any new vehicle prototype, there will be a learning curve with the next-generation Starship. During an interview in September, SpaceX's founder Elon Musk revealed that “pretty much everything changes on the rocket with version 3.” The upgraded Starship “might have some initial teething pains because it's such a radical redesign,” he added.

Considering the rocket's new developments, it may take a while for Starship Version 3 to perfect those orbital flights. Musk had previously stated that he would like to send an uncrewed Starship to Mars during an upcoming launch window next year, but it's not clear whether the rocket will be ready to travel to a new world by then.

Honor, a Chinese phone brand that primarily sells its devices in Europe and Asia, announced a new smartphone in its Magic series this week, dubbed the Magic8. It's notable because it's one of the first phones to be powered by the recently unveiled Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5—that's the flagship processor that will power many of the top Android phones in 2026. It also has a positively massive 7,200-mAh silicon-carbon battery cell, but it's actually a very different Honor phone that steals the limelight from the Magic8.

That'd be the Robot Phone. This is a concept, but Honor says it plans to reveal more details about it at Mobile World Congress 2026 in Barcelona next March. Based on the accompanying launch video—which appears to have been largely created using generative AI—the Robot Phone features a camera module that flips out, functioning like a pan-and-tilt camera on a gimbal. It doesn't just take photos of subjects, but also reacts to people, and even plays peekaboo with a (fake) baby.

While we haven't seen a phone with a flip-out camera on an arm, there was a time when pop-up selfie cameras were all the rage. Devices like the OnePlus 7 Pro had an uninterrupted display with zero notch or in-display camera; instead, a camera mechanically popped out from the top edge of the phone. Honor's concept Robot Phone is much more advanced. But even more advanced are the purported capabilities of this little robot camera. I'll be surprised if the final version will be able to do even half the things shown off in the video.

The Robot Phone wasn't the only attention-grabbing smartphone this week. Motorola is gearing up to launch an ultra-slim phone that is marginally thicker than the iPhone Air and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge at 5.99 millimeters. The Moto X70 Air will launch in China first, and will make its way to Europe later this year. It's not just slim and lightweight; this phone also has a bigger battery (4,800 mAh) compared to its svelte peers, which should give it a leg up. However, it's not a flagship smartphone, powered by the decidedly midrange Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 4.

It's the last wellness frontier—figuring out what your pee and poo are telling you. In 2023, Withings unveiled the U-Scan, a toilet bowl sensor that sits inside your toilet bowl and detects basic biomarkers via a replaceable cartridge. This week, renowned toilet bowl manufacturer Kohler announced the launch of Kohler Health, a foray into the digital health and wellness space with a similarly white, smooth device called the Dekoda.

You clamp the device on the rim of your toilet bowl and log into every, er, session with a fingerprint scanner. Spectroscopy sensors (i.e., cameras) peer down at whatever you put in there to record signs of gut health, hydration, and blood. Your personalized results are sent to the Kohler Health app (which is on both iOS and Android). Unlike a wrist-worn fitness tracker, the Dekoda does seem to assume that you will mostly be doing your business at home. At least it doesn't need a subscription. It retails for $599 and will be available starting October 21. —Adrienne So

When it comes to software, functionality, and premium materials, there's just no competing with Garmin in the sports watch department. But if you appreciate value and functionality, you will love Coros, and I do. This week, Coros launched the Apex 4 ($479), its latest mountain watch. It has truly insane battery life—I've had it on for almost two weeks and it's still at 55 percent—and a Memory-In-Pixel screen that I can see in broad daylight. There are several premium features, like a titanium bezel and sapphire glass screen, topographic and landscape maps, and other mountain-sport-specific features, like automatic route detection for rock climbing.

Coros is a great choice if you want long-lasting battery life, a watch that won't break, and you don't want to pay over $500 for a watch. However, it's worth noting here that even though it has a speaker and a microphone for hands-free calls with LTE connection, it does not have what I suspect will shortly become a standard feature on many outdoor sports watches—satellite communications, which showed up on the Google Pixel Watch 4, the Apple Watch Ultra 3, and the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro this year. Not a deal-breaker, but something worth thinking about. —Adrienne So

Losing your suitcase is the worst; there's nothing that ruins a vacation quite like having to spend the entire time wearing the same pair of pants and a windbreaker from the drugstore. That's why Australian luggage manufacturer July launched CaseSafe, a built-in tracker on top of its suitcase that works with both Apple's Find My and Android's Find Hub networks. Unzip the suitcase, pull out the plastic tab, and find your suitcase in your respective locator-things app.

Prices start at $325 for the carry-on version, $375 for the checked size, $395 for a larger checked version, or $995 for the entire family set. I am planning on using the carry-on version this weekend, and it easily paired with my iPhone. In every other respect, it's a normal bag—it has your standard polycarbonate shell with a (I have to say) garish embossed July logo on the side; smooth-rolling wheels, bumpers, and leather finishes. There's also an inset ejectable USB-C battery.

July's CaseSafe makes it so you don't have to fuss with AirTags, but that still doesn't stop me from saying you can upgrade your current carry-on similarly with an AirTag and a power bank, and it won't cost you anywhere near $300. —Adrienne So

Fujifilm announced the Instax Mini LiPlay+ this week, an update to its 2019 Mini LiPlay camera. The LiPlay+ is, like its predecessor, a hybrid camera and Instax printer. In fact, little about the main camera seems to have changed. It still has a 28-mm equivalent f/2 lens that records roughly 5-MP photos to the sensor.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

Fujifilm has added a second camera on the back, though, for taking selfies. It's a 23-mm equivalent f/2.2 lens, but what is kind of fun is the ability to create what Fujifilm calls "layered photos," shooting both lenses at the same time, superimposing, for example, a circle of a selfie on top of a background. Alas, there does not seem to be a way to make this an actual double-exposure image, which feels like a missed opportunity (especially since Fujifilm's other cameras, like the X100 series, have long had a double-exposure mode).

The other new feature here expands on the original LiPlay's ability to record audio and attach it to a print via a QR code. Now it's not just audio but an animated video with sound and music. The Fujifilm Instax Mini LiPlay+ will be available later this month for $235. —Scott Gilbertson

The security-focused, Android alternative operating system GrapheneOS has announced it will soon be available on phones other than the Google Pixel. The developers said in a post on Reddit that a "major OEM" will soon be added to GrapheneOS's list of supported phones. No brands were mentioned, but many users are guessing it will be OnePlus, given the company's past support for CyanogenMod, another Android alternative. The GrapheneOS developers do say that whichever phone it turns out to be, it will be similarly priced.

In a follow-up post, the developers clarified that the phone maker is "definitely serious about working with us. That's how we have security partner access." They also explicitly say it is not Fairphone, which sells a separate version running another Android alternative, e/OS. —Scott Gilbertson

Roku has announced some nifty software upgrades coming soon to its popular streaming devices and TVs, and they lean heavily on artificial intelligence. Roku Voice now features AI searches, allowing you to ask things like “What's Barbie about?” or “How scary is The Shining?” and get a helpful answer. Roku is also adding easier access to movie trailers, better searching for shows to watch, and a simpler interface to help you understand what is streaming where.

Sports like college football will now have live scoring (though you can opt out if you hate spoilers). You can also set up reminders for upcoming games, whereby you'll be notified to watch via the Roku app on your phone. In addition, Bluetooth Headphone Mode is coming to Roku Streaming Stick models, allowing folks to pair headphones for late-night viewing.

Any news about Omega's iconic Speedmaster seems to send the watch world into the stratosphere. So no surprise then that this week's release of a bunch of new Dark Side of the Moon Speedys has been met with considerable fanfare. The range was introduced back in 2013, but these all-new 2025 Dark and Grey Side of the Moon models each measure 44.25 millimeters and boast ceramic cases.

The pick of the litter for WIRED is perhaps the slimmer manual-winding Black Edition with red center seconds hand and 60 hours of power reserve. But if you really want to go into full stealth mode, check out the super-dark “Black Black” model with darkened movement components, a black Grand Feu enamel tachymeter scale, laser-sandblasted black ceramic dial, and polished-brushed black ceramic case. Even the glowing Super-LumiNova on the dial is black—though, thankfully, it glows green in the dark. From $15,700. —Jeremy White

Across the world, more than 1.5 billion people suffer from chronic liver disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that it kills more than 52,000 people a year in the United States alone - the ninth most common cause of death in the nation.

Despite this significant impact on society, alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) remains largely unaddressed by medical research. Texas A&M University researcher Dr. Jyothi Menon aims to change that with a promising new therapy that she's developing. Her findings were recently published in Biomaterials.

Liver diseases are rapidly increasing around the world, and there's a significant risk of them slowly progressing to more dangerous conditions like cancer. Being able to use our technologies to develop effective solutions against this progression is what's driving me and driving this research."

Dr. Jyothi Menon, Associate Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Texas A&M University

While current treatments for ARLD focus on alcohol cessation and anti-inflammatory medications, Menon and her collaborators at the University of Rhode Island are taking a much more focused approach. They have developed microscopic nanoparticles that are a thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. These safe and biodegradable nanoparticles can seek out and attach to damaged liver cells. By binding to the cells, the nanoparticles help stop them from fueling disease progression.

In healthy humans, the liver is a naturally self-healing organ, capable of regenerating most of its function even when 70% to 80% has been damaged. A key part of this healing process involves immune cells called Kupffer cells that protect the liver from infection and harmful substances. In a healthy liver, they also produce proteins that promote an anti-inflammatory response in other liver cells.

In chronic liver conditions, when liver damage progresses and repetitive injury occurs, the organ's self-repairing functions also become damaged. Then, the liver unintentionally begins harming itself. The Kupffer cells, which previously fought inflammation, start releasing protein signals with the opposite effect - increasing inflammation and encouraging other liver cells to form scar tissue in a process called fibrosis. 

The result is life-threatening organ dysfunction and even fatal liver cancer.

The Menon Lab's nanoparticles are engineered to stop this damaging process. Their surface is designed to recognize and selectively bind to a protein found only on Kupffer cells in the liver, allowing them to avoid other liver cell types. This protein functions as a receptor in the cell's membrane, receiving chemical signals and triggering cell behaviors in response. When it is activated by the nanoparticle's coating, it promotes beneficial, anti-inflammatory behavior in the Kupffer cells instead of increasing inflammation and scarring. The nanoparticles also release anti-inflammatory therapies as they break down, delivering medicine directly to the cells that need it most. 

"Instead of going for the cells which are producing the scar tissue, we're going one step behind and targeting the Kupffer cells themselves so that we can prevent them from stimulating other cells in the liver and causing this fibrosis progression," Menon said.

The result is far greater than the sum of its parts.

"The individual components on their own did not have much of a therapeutic effect," Menon said. "But when we gave our final formulation with everything combined, it reduced inflammation and lipid droplet formation seen due to fat buildup in the liver. It was the combination of all of these things that actually had an effect."

Getting to this point was no easy feat. Because Menon's team is one of the first to attempt this kind of approach, there was no prior research to lean on.

"As one of the first groups to even approach something like this using nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, there wasn't any sort of prior literature to help us figure out what roadblocks there could be when we took up this research," Menon said. "The first time we were able to confirm that these particles can target Kupffer cells, it was very exciting for us."

While Menon is currently focused on alcohol-related liver disease, her nanoparticle therapies have much broader applications. Targeted nanoparticles could be the future of disease treatment across numerous parts of the body.

"What we have generated is very promising preliminary work that shows that this formulation can selectively target a specific cell population in the liver to deliver therapies and can potentially have a meaningful impact on the treatment of chronic ARLD," she said. "Our formulations are versatile, so they can be adapted or modified for treating other kinds of inflammation and fibrosis in other organs."

Plastic is ubiquitous in the modern world, and it's notorious for taking a long time to completely break down in the environment - if it ever does.

But even without breaking down completely, plastic can shed tiny particles - called nanoplastics because of their extremely small size - that scientists are just now starting to consider in long-term health studies.

One of those scientists is Dr. Wei Xu, an associate professor in the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences' Department of Veterinary Physiology & Pharmacology. Xu's current work is focused on what happens when nanoplastics interact with seawater, where they can pick up some curious hitchhikers in the form of chemicals and organic components.

When particles are released into the environment, they can interact with a lot of different materials that modify their surfaces, possibly including proteins, chemicals, and toxins. Most people are concerned with what happens when you accidentally ingest nanoplastics, but our work looks at how they might be getting into the body through the skin and what they might be bringing with them."

Dr. Wei Xu, associate professor, Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences' Department of Veterinary Physiology & Pharmacology

As they demonstrated in a recent publication, Xu and his team have discovered that nanoplastics with environmental coatings can sneak past some of the skin's defenses at the microscopic level.

"We found that particles with the environmental coating accumulated in certain areas inside the cell and seemed successful at avoiding its 'garbage disposal' system, which might try to kill or expel them," Xu said. "It's like they're wearing camouflage that allows them to stay inside the cell longer."

While the long-term health consequences of nanoplastics in the body are still being studied, Xu's research highlights the importance of the skin as a target for nanoplastics and the ability of the environment to alter particles before they're absorbed by the body.

"While the nanoplastics themselves are a health concern, we also want to better understand these environmental coatings and what those may do once inside the body," Xu said.

To understand how nanoplastics affected by the environment enter the skin, Xu and his team created their own nanoplastic beads augmented by ocean water.

"There are vendors that produce nanoplastic particles for scientific research, but these particles have never been out in the environment," Xu said. "So, before we conducted the toxicity assessment, we used water collected from the ocean off the coast of Corpus Christi."

After letting the particles interact with the seawater for one to two weeks, Xu and his team were able to analyze the particles' environmental coatings to see what kind of changes occurred. Then, they tested how the particles make their way inside cultured skin cells.

"We had conducted previous research using plain nanoplastic beads that showed how they induce a reaction from skin cells," Xu said. "It was significant seeing how the beads with environmental coatings were better able to avoid the attack by the immune system."

Xu's research on the skin and environmental effects of particles is helping scientists understand that some of the trickiest problems in toxicology are even more complex than they had previously realized.

"In our research, we had to focus on a specific type of environmental coating, so we looked at proteins," Xu said. "But what about those from algal blooms or other toxins? What happens when there are floods and water mixes with other contaminants? We haven't had the chance to explore how these things intersect yet."

Even if researchers do find solutions to preventing absorption of nanoplastics with certain kinds of environmental coatings, there's no guarantee that those will continue to work.

"What if the environment is totally changed in 10 or 20 years and there are different coatings on the particles? We may have to keep coming up with new strategies to control them," Xu said.

The first step, according to Xu, is for there to be better standardization for research on nanoplastic particles, which he hopes his research will help drive forward.

"I've had students look at publications on the same particle and find different results because other researchers aren't required to consider environmental coatings," he said. "We need better consistency for the long term."

Another step is to fully analyze all the coating types that Xu and his team found in their study of seawater.

"We've already had people ask us about other types of coatings besides proteins," he said. "It will be a lot of work, but it's critical if we're to understand the full scope of the problem."

Dominika Pilat, PhD, and Ana Griciuc, PhD, of the Department of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital are the lead and senior authors of a paper published in Neuron, "The Gain-of-Function TREM2-T96K Mutation Increases Risk for Alzheimer's Disease by Impairing Microglial Function."

Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience?

Our team wanted to understand how immune cells of the brain, called microglia, contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. It's known that subtle changes, or mutations, in genes expressed in microglia are associated with an increased risk for developing late-onset AD.

Our study focused on one such mutation in the microglial gene TREM2, an essential switch that activates microglia to clean up toxic amyloid plaques (abnormal protein deposits) that build up between nerve cells in the brain. This mutation, called T96K, is a "gain-of-function" mutation in TREM2, meaning it increases TREM2 activation and allows the gene to remain super active.

Through our research, we explored how this mutation impacts microglial function to increase risk for AD. We generated a mutant mouse model carrying the mutation, which was bred with a mouse model of AD to have brain changes consistent with AD. We found that in female AD mice exclusively, the mutation strongly reduced the capability of microglia to respond to toxic amyloid plaques, making these cells less protective against brain aging.

Q: What question were you investigating?

We asked whether the T96K mutation in the TREM2 gene helps or hurts the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This led us to investigate how this mutation affects microglial function in mouse models of AD.

Q: What methods or approach did you use?

To analyze the role of this mutation in Alzheimer's disease, we combined studies of human genes, a novel TREM2-T96K mouse model, and lab tests on microglial cells. To examine the brain tissue, we used an optical imaging technique called confocal microscopy and protein tracking tools, including ELISA. Finally, we used single-cell RNA sequencing of microglia isolated from the mouse brain and bioinformatic analysis to map out exactly how the T96K mutation changes the microglia activity over time.

Q: What did you find?

Our study is the first to show that a gain-of-function mutation in TREM2 (not just a loss-of-function mutation) is associated with Alzheimer's disease risk, and that it impairs the uptake of toxic amyloid beta (Aβ). Additionally, the specific T96K mutation we focused on decreased the total area covered by the microglia "cleanup crews" and suppressed their disease-fighting response, specifically in female AD mice.

Q: What are the implications?

Our study on TREM2 gain-of-function mutations shifts our understanding of TREM2 function – not only from a genetic perspective, but also from a therapeutics perspective.These findings should help guide novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, based on targeting TREM2.

Notably, our results also underscore the need for more studies addressing whether novel AD therapies aimed at enhancing TREM2 activity could have adverse, as opposed to beneficial, effects on AD pathogenesis.

Q: What are the next steps?

Future work will focus on investigating the role of TREM2 gain-of-function mutations in modulating immune functions, microglial lipid metabolism and cellular aging in human microglia-like cells and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.

Like the surface of the moon, new research published today in Cell finds the existence of craters on the surface of melanoma cells that serve as immune hubs, becoming major sites for tumor killing. These craters could serve as good markers for immunotherapy success.

This research provides insight into a key function of immune check-point blockade (ICB) cancer therapy that was previously unknown. ICB works by re-activating CD8+ T cells against tumors which shrinks and eventually kills the cancer cells. However, what facilitates local tumor killing by the infiltrating CD8+ T cells has remained a mystery. Using a zebrafish model, researchers were able to monitor the infiltrating CD8+ T cells for up to 24 hours as they moved through the 3D architecture of endogenous melanoma tumors. Zebrafish provide the only tumor model where continuous live imaging over a 24 hour time period is feasible.

We found that rather than patrolling the entire tumor surface, CD8+ T cells aggregated in pockets on the melanoma border, forming prolonged interactions with melanoma cells. We termed these pockets Cancer Regions of Antigen presentation and T cell Engagement and Retention (CRATERs) and saw that, following immune stimulation, the CRATERs expanded and facilitated an effective immune response against the tumor."

Leonard Zon, MD, Director of the Stem Cell Program at Boston Children's Hospital and lead investigator of the study

Zon, first author Aya Ludin, and the team also discovered CRATERs in human melanoma samples. Moreover, they saw similar structures in human lung cancer, indicating that CRATERs are likely not limited to melanoma and may form in other solid tumors.

To date, efficacy of therapeutic response to ICB therapy has been assessed mainly by estimating the degree of tumor necrosis and fibrosis. Indicators of CD8+ T cells infiltration has been associated with patient survival and treatment outcome, but direct evidence of effective immune cell-tumor cell interaction has been missing.

"Pending thorough clinical verification and taken together with other measurements, CRATERs may serve to more accurately assess the efficacy of an ongoing treatment and improve treatment outcomes," said Zon.

The research team is now planning a prospective clinical trial to test if CRATERs are the best marker of ICB success.

A new review in Clinical Epigenetics synthesises growing evidence that paternal lifestyle and environmental exposures such as diet, obesity, smoking, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and stress alter sperm epigenetic marks (DNA methylation, histone retention, and small non-coding RNAs). These changes can influence sperm quality and fertilising ability, early embryo development, assisted reproduction outcomes, and long-term health risks in offspring.

Key findings

Paternal factors leave epigenetic "signatures" in sperm (DNA methylation, histone modifications, sncRNAs) that accompany the genome at fertilisation.

Obesity and diet (high-fat/high-sugar or folate deficiency) are linked to altered methylation and sncRNA profiles, impaired sperm parameters, and metabolic dysfunction in offspring.

Smoking associates with differentially methylated regions in genes tied to anti-oxidation, insulin signalling, and spermatogenesis, and with reduced motility/morphology.

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) (e.g., BPA, phthalates) can induce transgenerational DNA methylation changes, affecting fertility and disease risk.

Stress in fathers before conception correlates with altered sperm miRNAs/piRNAs and methylation, with behavioural and metabolic effects detected across generations in animal models.

ART implications: Male BMI, diet, and alcohol intake correlate with embryo quality and ICSI outcomes; epigenetic sperm profiles show promise as biomarkers to improve ART success.

Clinical takeaway: Preconception interventions weight management, smoking cessation, balanced diet (including folate), physical activity, and reduced toxin exposure may help reverse adverse sperm epigenetic marks.

Research context

While maternal epigenetics is well studied, this review highlights mounting evidence for paternal epigenetic influences, notes confounders (genetic background, fluctuating behaviours), and calls for longitudinal, controlled human studies using modern methylation and RNA-sequencing platforms.

Why it matters

Male preconception health is a modifiable lever for improving fertility, embryo viability, and the lifelong health trajectory of children. Incorporating epigenetic screening or lifestyle programmes into fertility care could enhance ART outcomes and reduce intergenerational disease risk.

Next steps

Large, longitudinal human cohorts to establish causality and dose-response.

Standardised epigenome assays (e.g., MethylationEPIC, small-RNA profiling) in andrology/ART workflows.

Trials testing preconception lifestyle interventions on sperm epigenetic readouts and clinical endpoints.

Practical guidance 

Maintain healthy weight; prioritise balanced diet with adequate folate.

Avoid smoking, excessive alcohol, and high-fat/high-sugar patterns.

Reduce exposure to EDCs (e.g., minimise plastics/heat, check workplace risks).

Manage stress; support sleep and physical activity.

Discuss preconception health with fertility specialists; consider participation in studies monitoring sperm epigenetic markers.

Enzo Maresca revealed why he is "not worried" about Chelsea's disciplinary record after Malo Gusto became the latest player to be sent off towards the end of their Premier League clash against Nottingham Forest on Saturday. The Blues have now had to cope with sending off in four out of their last six matches across all competitions. Despite being a man down, Maresca's side comfortably clinched a 3-0 win over Forest.

Lamine Yamal marked his return with an assist as substitute Ronald Araujo rescued a late winner for Barcelona against Girona, sparing a wasteful Marcus Rashford's blushes in the process. In a frantic end to the game, that Barca won at the death 2-1, head coach Hansi Flick was sent off - a costly red card that means he'll be forced to watch next week's Clasico from the stands.

Injury-hit Barca were looking to end a two-game losing run and all without Joan Garcia, Robert Lewandowski, Dani Olmo and Raphinha, with Flick forced to name a weakened team due to the absentees. Yamal, available again after injury, did make the starting XI, though, and provided his fourth assist of the season for Pedri early in the first half as the hosts made their dominance count. 

Girona were level in the 20th minute through an acrobatic Axel Witsel effort and could have doubled their advantage had Wojciech Szczesny not made smart stops to deny Vladyslav Vanat and Portu in quick succession. Rashford then smashed a free-kick off the crossbar on the half-hour mark as the Blaugrana aimed to make home advantage count.

Barcelona continued to huff and puff after the break, with Fermin Lopez, who was introduced at half-time, looking lively having struck the woodwork shortly after the restart. Pau Cubarsi then saw a second-half goal ruled out, while Rashford fluffed his lines from close range as Girona edged closer to securing an unlikely point.

However, the resolve was broken in second-half injury time as Araujo bagged a late winner and Barcelona's superiority paid off right at the death.

By Martina Alcheva

There are a few soccer players whose careers defy time, whose elegance on the ball and leadership off it elevate entire clubs. Luka Modric has proven to be one of those rare figures. Having joined Milan at 39, the Croatian maestro has transformed the club's midfield and spirit, breathing new life into a side that only a season earlier had finished eighth in Serie A. 

Yet, as remarkable as his late-career renaissance has been, whispers from Spain suggest that Modric's journey is far from over — and that his next chapter could take him back to the place where his legend was born.

From the moment Modric arrived, Massimiliano Allegri built his Milan around the Croatian's mind and movement. Installed as a deep-lying playmaker, the veteran became the metronome of Allegri's system, orchestrating play from the base of midfield. His positioning under the ball has made the Rossoneri's build-up seamless, offering defenders constant passing options and dismantling pressing traps with simple yet intelligent movements.

Beyond tactics, Modric's presence has reshaped the atmosphere at Milanello. The team's performances have improved, but so has its belief. His arrival coincided with a surge in commercial success. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, sales of Milan shirts featuring Modric's No.14 have surpassed those of Rafael Leao and Christian Pulisic, especially the club's striking yellow third kit. Simply put, Modric has brought prestige and purpose back to Milan, proving that even at 40, his artistry remains timeless.

Before arriving in Italy, Modric's farewell to Real Madrid was emotional. During those years, he collected six Champions League titles, five Club World Cups, and four La Liga crowns, becoming one of the club's most decorated players.

But now, as reports from Spain suggest, the 40-year-old superstar may soon reunite with Los Blancos — though not as a player. According to Defensa Central, the Croatian has already accepted an offer from Florentino Perez to return after his retirement, possibly as a coach or club ambassador.

The plan, reportedly, is for Modric to take a one-year sabbatical after his Milan career ends, whether that's next year or in 2027, to spend time with his family. Afterward, he intends to complete UEFA coaching courses and begin working with Madrid's youth academy, fulfilling a dream he's quietly nurtured for years.

Luka Modric of Real Madrid presents his Ballon d'Or Trophy to the crowd.

Despite planning his future, Modric remains fully focused on Milan and on one final international goal — the 2026 World Cup, where he hopes to lead Croatia one last time. His physical condition remains extraordinary, and both he and the Rossoneri are reportedly open to extending his current deal, which runs until June 2026, with an option for an additional year.

At this stage of his career, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner has nothing left to prove — yet he continues to redefine what greatness looks like in soccer. From commanding the Bernabeu to mastering San Siro, his influence stretches beyond the field, touching every player and supporter who witnesses his craft.

Erling Haaland continued his incredible goalscoring form as Manchester City claimed a 2-0 victory over Everton on Saturday afternoon. The in-form striker netted a second-half brace as Pep Guardiola's side, if only temporarily, moved above title rivals Arsenal and Liverpool and stretched their unbeaten run to eight games in all competitions at the Etihad Stadium.

In a tight opening 45 minutes which saw City limited to a handful of half chances, Everton striker Beto had the best opportunity to break the deadlock but he was unable to convert for David Moyes' men, who performed admirably in the first half.

However, City made the visitors pay after the interval, taking the lead through Haaland after the Norway international headed home from Nico O'Reilly's cross. And the forward had a second just five minutes later when his low drive found its way past Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, taking his tally up to 11 goals in just eight league games.

Haaland almost had a hat-trick late on but he was thwarted by Pickford as City moved to the top of the table ahead of Arsenal's trip to Fulham later on Saturday, with Liverpool set to host Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday.

Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso provided a key update on Kylian Mbappe's fitness ahead of the club's La Liga fixture against Getafe this weekend. The star forward picked up an injury while on international duty with France. He limped off the pitch late on during Les Bleus' clash with Azerbaijan and missed their World Cup qualifier against Iceland after being released from the French squad.

Chelsea made it back-to-back Premier League victories with a 3-0 win over troubled Nottingham Forest on Saturday afternoon. Second-half goals from Josh Acheampong, Pedro Neto and captain Reece James saw the Blues build on their last-gasp triumph over Liverpool and heap more misery on under-fire Forest manager Ange Postecoglou at the City Ground.

Feeling the absence of midfield stars Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez - the former on the bench with the latter missing out completely - Chelsea struggled in possession as Forest passed up chances to score through Elliot Anderson and Morgan Gibbs-White. Despite being second best in the first half, the visitors almost took the lead through Andrey Santos but he fired wide of the post.

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca, in the stands following his red card for wildly celebrating against Liverpool, rang the changes at half-time, bringing on Caicedo, Jamie Gittens and Marc Guiu, and his substitutions were effective in injecting energy into his side's play. And it didn't take the Blues long to take the lead in the second half - Acheampong heading home Neto's pinpoint cross after 49 minutes. The winger was at it again as he doubled his side's advantage just three minutes later with a free-kick which found its way past Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels.

Forest continued to pose a threat but it was simply not their day in front of goal, as Neco Williams blazed over from close range before Igor Jesus hit the crossbar. And the hosts' misery was compounded when James netted a third for Chelsea, who were reduced to 10 men when Malo Gusto was sent off late on.

FIFA has backed away from a potential conflict with President Donald Trump over his assertion that he could move some of next summer's World Cup matches out of U.S. cities he deemed unsafe.

In suggesting earlier this week that parts of Boston had been "taken over" by recent unrest, Trump said FIFA president Gianni Infantino would "very easily" move 2026 World Cup matches away from designated host cities if he asked him to.

In response, FIFA conceded that host countries are ultimately responsible for making sure their World Cup venues are safe.

"Safety and security are the top priorities at all FIFA events worldwide. Safety and security are obviously the governments' responsibility, and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety," a FIFA spokesperson said in a statement.

Earlier in the day, Boston mayor Michelle Wu implied the city was ready for a faceoff with Trump if he tried to move the matches scheduled for Gillette Stadium in nearby Foxborough.

"Much of it is locked down by contract so that no single person, even if they live in the White House currently, can undo it," Wu said on the "Java with Jimmy" show. "We are going to continue to be who we are and that means, unfortunately, we are going to continue to be in a conversation in a way that is targeting Boston's values."

The United States is scheduled to host 78 of 104 matches in the 2026 World Cup, expanded to 48 teams for the first time. FIFA had no comment on any of the cities or stadiums mentioned by Trump.

Trump also suggested that he would consider moving the 2028 Summer Olympics out of Los Angeles for similar reasons.

"If I thought L.A. was not going to be prepared properly, I would move it to another location if I had to."

FIFA just released merchandise for its upcoming 2026 World Cup tournament, including hats, t-shirts, sweatshirts, and posters themed around each host city.

The merchandise for Seattle, being one of the host cities, is predominantly purple in color, with gold, white, and blue accents. The text “We Are Seattle” and “26 FIFA Seattle” adorn many of the city-themed shirts and hoodies.

To browse FIFA's merch catalog, click here. Hats are priced at $45, hoodies are $100, and shirts are $50, with slight reductions in price for youth sizes. An alternative, less expensive T-shirt is available, along with cheaper gifts such as posters and magnets.

Seattle is one of 16 cities hosting World Cup matches between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico starting in June 2026. Seattle is actively preparing to host six games, including two knockout stage matches.

The first game at Lumen Field will be on June 15, 2026, for the Group G Stage match.

Drivers may have to pay more to use the State Route 99 (SR 99) tunnel during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which is expected to bring hundreds of thousands of visitors to Washington.

The Washington State Transportation Commission is considering two temporary toll hike options—either 50 cents or $1.00—applied 24/7 for six weeks from June 1 to July 15, 2026. The goal is to manage the extra traffic and help fund maintenance.

At Tuesday's commission meeting, one member expressed reservations about the proposal, calling it a “slippery slope” to increase tolls for a single event.

“The World Cup is a uniquely large event,” Washington State Transportation Commission Deputy Director Carl See told KIRO Newsradio. “It does not necessarily portend to, if this, then necessarily we do it for other activities.”

Good to Go! rates for two-axle vehicles currently range from $1.25 to $2.80. Officials said the temporary hike would represent a significant increase and acknowledged that residents and businesses would also be affected.

The Washington State Department of Transportation is encouraging fans to consider transit, walking, and biking to get to the matches.

See told KIRO Newsradio that, as early as December, the commission will decide whether or not to proceed with this potential toll rate increase based on the assessment that is currently underway.

“If the commission does decide to proceed at that time, the next step would be the public-input process in support of the rate-setting,” he said.

Public input will be solicited in early 2026.

When Mike Trucano in Virginia heard the men's World Cup soccer tournament would be back in the U.S. next year, he and his family were thrilled.


"We were just so excited that it was coming," Trucano says.


Trucano is a bit of a soccer obsessive. He's been to every World Cup since 1994, when the U.S. last hosted the tournament, a stretch of eight tournaments that has taken him all over the world — from South Korea to South Africa.


He's seen some awesome games and goals. There was that famous one Landon Donovan scored against Algeria in the dying minutes of a game in South Africa in 2010 that secured America's place in the playoffs. Or Brian McBride's goal against Portugal in a game the U.S. won in South Korea in 2002.


So Trucano planned to take his wife, two kids and his 80-year-old dad to next year's World Cup, hosted by the U.S., along with Canada and Mexico. That's before Trucano saw the prices FIFA would be charging for this World Cup.


Most seats in the opening round of the tournament will cost at least several hundred dollars, with a tiny section of the stadiums available at $60. That's significantly higher than at the last World Cup in Qatar when prices at the same stage of the tournament ranged from about $11 to just over $200.


Games for the U.S. men's national team are even more expensive. Many of the seats for the first U.S. game will cost over $2,700 — a lot more than the most expensive ticket for the final in Qatar.


Trucano was stunned.


"I mean, my word, if it's five of us and it's $1,000 ... and $5,000 in this economy?" Trucano says. "In a great economy that's a no-go, let alone the economy we have right now."




Prices rise even more in the later stages of the tournament, jumping to thousands of dollars for a handful of the playoff games. Many seats for the final in New Jersey will cost over $6,300, exponentially higher than even the most expensive seats for the last World Cup final in Qatar, which cost the equivalent of about $1,600.


There are several other wrinkles in the way FIFA is selling the tickets. First, it has introduced a type of dynamic pricing, meaning prices will adjust based on demand.


Another unusual thing: FIFA is offering what's called a right to buy a ticket that offers buyers a guaranteed ticket for the game of their choice.


These "RTBs" cost hundreds — and even thousands of dollars. And that's before you buy the actual ticket. FIFA will determine that ticket price at a later stage.

Jim Waian in California was outraged. "To me this is madness," he says. "It's absolute madness."


Waian is another World Cup obsessive. He's been to seven World Cup tournaments so far and to six finals, including in Paris in 1998, when France beat Brazil and many of the fans were singing "La Marseillaise" as the home side clinched the trophy.


But Waian says he refuses to pay the prices FIFA is charging next year.


"It's much more than I would want to spend," Waian says. "There's other things I'd rather buy for that money that would last more than two hours."




In a statement to NPR, FIFA says it is adapting to "industry trends." Watching sports in the U.S. is expensive. For comparison, the average NFL ticket price was just under $300 when the season started, according to The Athletic.


FIFA also notes that more than 90% of the revenue generated across the U.S., Canada and Mexico will be reinvested around the world to further develop the game of soccer.


"Ticketing and resale fees align with industry trends across various sports and entertainment sectors," FIFA says. "It is important to note, as a not-for-profit organization, the revenue FIFA generates from the World Cup is reinvested to fuel the growth of the game (men, women, youth) throughout FIFA's 211 member associations globally."


But Waian still doesn't understand why growing the sport means that ticket prices next year have to jump so much.


"Everything they've done so far seems to be just concerned about maximizing profit and nothing, absolutely nothing, else," Waian says.




Trucano in Virginia is also unsure what to do. Should he go alone? Will he have to choose between his wife, dad and children.


"I have to think really hard about taking my family and who, you know, who do we cut out and who do we don't?" Trucano says.


Ticket prices could still come down. FIFA will be selling tickets in stages all the way until next year's tournament.

Trucano is hopeful that will happen. In the meantime though, he's angry and disappointed.


"I think they see us as consumers," Trucano says. "As just big wallets. Big fat wallets that they can take as much money out of as they can. I don't think that does anybody any good."


Fans like Trucano and Waian got to travel all over the world to see World Cup games. Turns out the one that's being held in their own country — in the U.S. — may be the one they have to watch on TV from their homes.

Mjallby supporters pictured during an Allsvenskan match against Djurgarden Michael Campanella/Getty Images

In the wake of Sweden's national side sinking to its lowest point in decades, there is, at least, likely to be a feel-good story in their domestic league this weekend.

Mjallby, who play in the southern fishing village of Hallevik — population of just 1,500 — are about to win the title. They are 11 points clear at the summit of the Allsvenskan with four matches remaining. It's a case of when, rather than if, they will become the most unlikely champions of a European league since Leicester City in 2015-16. At that point, Mjallby were in the third division.

Scandinavia has thrown up a series of rags-to-riches stories in recent years. Midtjylland from Denmark and Bodo/Glimt from Norway have risen from relative obscurity to become admired across Europe.

Sweden was overdue for a similar tale. In a league that prides itself on its fan-owned '51 per cent model' and has produced more title winners (eight) than any other European league in the first decade of this century, Malmo had threatened to turn Sweden's Allsvenskan into another predictable top flight, winning eight of the last 12 titles. Mjallby's imminent success serves as the perfect antidote, partly because they are operating on a budget estimated to be around 15 per cent of Malmo's.

And this is a miracle in two different ways.

First, it's remarkable that a club like Mjallby are simply in the top half of the Allsvenskan in the first place. Their success is the consequence of an attitude based around the simple concept of ‘being the best at the things that are free': having an identity, building good team spirit and preparing for matches thoroughly.

Their coach, 59-year-old Anders Torstensson, has dipped in and out of professional football over the past 20 years and is now in his third spell at the club. He is assisted by Karl Marius Aksum, a tactics guru who boasts a PhD in ‘visual perception in football'. A now-familiar emphasis on data-based recruitment has led them to make excellent signings from afar, such as Gambian attacker Abdoulie Manneh, and a realism about their status has resulted in them happily selling their best youngsters for considerable fees, reinvesting that in the squad.

But second, it's remarkable that Mjallby are top considering their underlying numbers.

Using expected goals (xG), Mjallby have only the joint-seventh best numbers in the Allsvenskan. Malmo and Hacken, who account for the last five Swedish titles between them, have better xG numbers yet sit seventh and ninth in the table. This is a historic overperformance, as the graph below demonstrates.



As the graph shows, Mjallby's return of 2.42 points per game would typically have been achieved by an xG difference of around 0.75 per game, rather than their rate of 0.18. In fact, their xG numbers are very similar to those of Vasteras last season, who were relegated, leaving coach Kalle Karlsson ruing “sitters, open goals, crazy stuff”.

So what's the difference?

First, it's worth working out at which end Mjallby are overperforming. In attack, they're about 6.6 goals ‘up' on what you would expect from the positions of their shots; a decent overachievement, but nothing particularly startling.



If you'd only watched Mjallby in recent weeks, you'd suspect they were overwhelmingly reliant on set pieces, as six of their last nine goals have been from this route, and another was a penalty. But this has been a relatively recent trend, since opponents have increasingly realised their quality and sat deep. After scoring from a set piece on the opening day, they subsequently had a run of 30 goals when none were from set pieces.

Mjallby play genuinely good football, usually in a 3-2-4-1 shape: a box midfield who play quick combinations, and two wide players who storm up and down, always arriving at the far post at the right time. Left-sided Elliot Stroud has thumped in goals from all sorts of angles, bringing to mind Alex Grimaldo's contributions to an unlikely title-winning campaign at Bayer Leverkusen.

As well as creating a string of chances fired home from point-blank range, often from cutbacks, Mjallby have been particularly efficient at forcing high turnovers, then striking when the opposition defence is out of position. They're getting unusually ‘clear' shots at goal.

But where Mjallby have really overachieved is defensively. In that respect, they've allowed 35 goals' worth of chances, but only actually conceded 17; just under half of what you would expect. Single-game xG numbers should be used cautiously, but in each of their last 17 league games, Mjallby have conceded fewer goals than their xG numbers would suggest.



Part of this, undeniably, is about wayward opposition finishing, but there are two other notable things.

Mjallby are very compact without possession, particularly when defending deep. When attacks break down, Mjallby get their midfield line back into position incredibly quickly.

It's rare to see the opposition attempting a shot when under severe pressure from multiple players. Some xG models are starting evolve, but the basic numbers, as they are, probably overestimate how good chances like this are, with so many players between the player taking the shot and the goal.



In addition, Mjallby have a truly outstanding goalkeeper. Noel Tornqvist, 23, is 6ft 6in (198cm) and notable for his Petr Cech-style protective headgear.

Tornqvist has received rave reviews for his distribution skills, as is increasingly common for promising young goalkeepers. But he's also an excellent shot-stopper. In particular, he's decisive in one-against-one situations, sprinting out of his goal to close down the shooter incredibly quickly, smothering shots quickly, such as this one against IFK Goteborg.





Only one goal all season — a long-range free kick — could reasonably be considered a Tornqvist error. He's recently received a call-up to Sweden's senior side after their long-serving No 1 Robin Olsen stood down. It's no surprise that a bigger club has already snapped up Tornqvist: Cesc Fabregas' Como, who bought him in August but loaned him back to Mjallby. He will move to Italy once the title celebrations are over.

It's also worth pointing out that ‘game state' comes into play. It helps that Mjallby have scored first in 21 of their 26 matches — the opposition have regularly been chasing the game, pushing men forward and trying to score against a packed Mjallby defence, while leaving their defence understaffed. Still, they have to put away the chances at one end and block them at the other. Their logic-defying results have attracted plenty of praise — and a little confusion — from their rivals.

“Mjallby are a really good side. They've been absolutely fantastic, they've exceeded all expectations,” said Kim Hellberg, manager of second-placed Hammarby. “It's also a team that has got an exceptional amount out of what they've created. If you look at the underlying numbers, they've been overperforming quite a lot.”

If Hellberg's side don't win a Stockholm derby against AIK on Sunday, the title will be heading to the village of Hallevik, regardless of Mjallby's final four results. But there's still an incentive for them to keep on winning: five more points will bring the highest points total in Allsvenskan history. If they break that record, it's because they seem to have broken expected goals.

Ekaterina Alexandrova exacted her revenge on Diana Shnaider, avenging her loss in the Monterrey final by defeating her compatriot 6-3, 6-4 in 1 hour and 32 minutes to advance to the Ningbo final. There, she'll face Elena Rybakina, who she holds a 3-1 record against in her career.

Two months ago, Ekaterina Alexandrova suffered a heartbreaking three-set loss to Diana Shnaider on a rain-soaked night in the Monterrey final.

But that was a different Alexandrova -- the one who had come so close but hadn't yet cracked the top 10. The new version, fresh off her top 10 debut earlier this week, wasn't about to let this match slip away.

On another rainy Saturday night, this time in Ningbo with the benefit of indoor play, Alexandrova earned her revenge in straight sets. She defeated Shnaider 6-3, 6-4 in 1 hour and 32 minutes to reach to the final of the 2025 AUX · Ningbo Open, where she will face Elena Rybakina.

It marks Alexandrova's fourth final of the season, all at the WTA 500 level.

She enters with a clear mindset.

“Honestly, I have no expectations,” Alexandrova said after the match. “I'll go on court tomorrow and enjoy the atmosphere and the match. I'll try to do my best because she's a great player and she has a really tough serve, so it'll be super difficult. But I'll enjoy my time here and do my best.”

Here's how she flipped the script on Shnaider and what lies ahead for the 30-year-old:

Withstanding pressure: Shnaider had her chances. She earned 10 break points in the two-set match, including eight in the first set alone.

But Alexandrova held firm, especially in key moments. After Shnaider broke her trailing 5-1 in the first set, she nearly did so again down 5-3 before Alexandrova put an abrupt stop to the rally.

In the second set, Shnaider again tried to mount a charge. She saved two match points on her serve and three more as Alexandrova tried to close out the match. Finally, on her sixth match point, Alexandrova was able to send her compatriot packing with one last forehand winner.

Shnaider converted just two of 10 break points on the night, while Alexandrova went 4-for-7.

Advantage, Alexandrova: The world No. 10 dominated on serve, outperforming Shnaider across the board:

It's the kind of performance that makes Alexandrova tough to beat -- one she'll need to replicate in Sunday's final against Rybakina, one of the few players on tour with a serve as strong, if not stronger, than her own.

What's next: When she takes the court against Rybakina, Alexandrova will do so with a head-to-head advantage, having won three of their four career meetings.

Their last matchup came in Adelaide to open the 2024 season, where Alexandrova won in straight sets.

If she can beat Rybakina again and capture the trophy in Ningbo, it would give Alexandrova her second title of 2025 and the sixth of her career.

Ekaterina Alexandrova exacted her revenge on Diana Shnaider, avenging her loss in the Monterrey final by defeating her compatriot 6-3, 6-4 in 1 hour and 32 minutes to advance to the Ningbo final. There, she'll face Elena Rybakina, who she holds a 3-1 record against in her career.

 Jannik Sinner and Alexander Bublik could reignite their see-saw 2025 rivalry next week at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna. 

 Top seed and 2023 champion Sinner and eighth seed Bublik would face off in the quarter-finals at the indoor hard-court ATP 500 if they both make it that far. Bublik is one of just three men to have defeated the No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings in a tour-level match this year, having stunned the Italian in three sets en route to the Halle title in June. Either side of that defeat on the German grass, Sinner eased to straight-sets victories against Bublik at Roland Garros and the US Open. 

 Before thinking about a potential rematch with the Kazakhstani, Sinner will first concentrate on a first-round clash with Daniel Altmaier, who previously upset the Italian in a five-set thriller at 2023 Roland Garros. Sinner won their most recent meeting in Shanghai earlier this month to earn a 2-1 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

 Tomas Machac and Flavio Cobolli are potential second-round opponents for Sinner in a stacked top half of the draw in Vienna. Bublik opens against Chengdu champion Alejandro Tabilo, while third seed Alex de Minaur plays home wild card Jurij Rodionov. De Minaur is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and well placed to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the second consecutive year. 

 Still in with an outside shot at reaching Turin, seventh seed and 2020 Vienna champion Andrey Rublev opens against Cameron Norrie. The winner of that match will take on a big-hitting righty: Alexei Popyrin or Matteo Berrettini.

 In the bottom half of the draw, second seed and 2021 titlist Alexander Zverev begins against a qualifier. The German, who is fourth in the Live Race, is seeded to meet his fellow Top 10 star Karen Khachanov in the quarter-finals. 

 Lorenzo Musetti, who is eighth in the Live Race, seeks a deep run in Vienna to maintain his push for a Nitto ATP Finals debut. However, the Italian faces a tough opener in the Austrian capital against former World No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas. A potential quarter-final opponent for Musetti and Tsitsipas is sixth seed Daniil Medvedev, who on Sunday will contest his second ATP Tour final of the season when he meets Alex Michelsen or Corentin Moutet at the Almaty Open.

Eighth-placed Lorenzo Musetti is currently 480 points ahead of Auger-Aliassime, and after the Italian was upset by Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the last eight, Auger-Aliassime can close that gap to 330 points with the title. The 2022 champion when the event was held in Antwerp, Auger-Aliassime can first gain another 65 points on the Italian if he beats Belgian wildcard Raphael Collignon in Saturday's semifinals.Read more: Which bubble player is most likely to qualify for the ATP Finals?The 25-year-old is bidding for his first appearance at the ATP Finals since 2022, when he reached his career-best ranking of No. 6.

The union says the new agreement saves their health care fund, which was projected to face a deficit next year.

	Actors' Equity has reached a tentative agreement with the Broadway League over a new contract, averting the possibility of a strike.


	The union, which represents actors and stage managers, stated that they had reached an agreement over the Broadway contract after a mediation session that started Friday and lasted until 6 a.m. ET Saturday. The contract will still need to be ratified by members.




	“After a marathon mediation session lasting until 6 a.m., Equity and The Broadway League have reached a tentative agreement on the Production Contract. This three-year agreement saves the Equity-League Health Fund while also making strides in our other priorities, including scheduling and physical therapy access. Now we will bring the deal to our members for ratification, and in the meantime, we are putting our full support behind AFM Local 802 as they work with the League to reach a deal that averts a strike,”  Al Vincent Jr., executive director of Actors' Equity, said in a statement,

	Details of the agreement were not immediately available, but Equity had pointed to health insurance contributions from the League as a prior sticking point in negotiations. 


	Leading up to the tentative agreement, Equity had voted to authorize a strike if necessary and had members sign strike pledge cards. A mediator stepped in recently after weeks of negotiation. The union's three-year contract expired Sept. 28.


	Local 802 AFM, which represents musicians on Broadway, is still negotiating its contract with the League and recently voted to approve a strike, if necessary, as well. Their contract has also expired. 

	











	“We are thankful that our brothers and sisters in labor at Actors' Equity have reached an agreement. Local 802 is still in negotiation for a fair contract, and everything remains on the table, including a strike,” Local 802 union President Robert Suttmann said in a statement.

	It must be the season of the witch, as Bette Midler is summoning her inner Sanderson sister for another round of Hocus Pocus.


	The 2x Oscar nominee recently revealed that a script has been completed for Hocus Pocus 3, but the producers are working out “all those logistical things” before they can return to complete the trilogy.


	“Well, you know, they sent a script. And a lot of it was brilliant,” she told host Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live.


	“So, I got very excited,” added Midler. “And now we're trying to figure out what it is and where it's going to be and how much it's going to cost and all those logistical things.”

	After starring as Salem witch Winifred Sanderson in the original Hocus Pocus (1993), Midler reunited with her onscreen sisters Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy for the long-awaited 2022 sequel, which set a streaming record for Disney+ with 2.7 billion minutes of viewing in a week.


	Following the sequel's success, Sean Bailey, President of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, confirmed a third movie was in development.


	In July, Parker said there are “no more developments other than we would like to do it. We've been having some conversations.”

While I will take more of the Sanderson sisters, I dont see the need for a third movie. The second one was only decent because we got to see them reacting to the 21st century. The new characters were meh.

I'd like to see a third movie with characters from both of the previous films coming together to stop the Sanderson Sisters

	As he finally makes his directorial debut with Good Fortune, Aziz Ansari still hopes to revisit the scrapped project that was meant to be his first outing behind the camera.


	Following the misconduct allegations against star Bill Murray that led to production on their movie Being Mortal being suspended indefinitely in 2022, the Golden Globe winner recently said he “would love to finish” the project.


	“At some point, it'd be great to finish it. I have some of the stuff edited. There's so much stuff in it that we're all really proud of,” he told Entertainment Weekly.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Although plot details were kept under wraps, Being Mortal is based on the 2014 #1 New York Times bestseller by Dr. Atul Gawande, which tackles the hardest challenge of his profession: how medicine can not only improve life but also the process of its ending.

	











	“I think we just have to wait and see,” said Ansari, noting that he has “a bunch” of projects he hopes to tackle in the future.


	“I'm not sure what I'm gonna do next. But I would love to finish that,” added Ansari. “The project is something that means a lot to all of us, and it definitely comes up. Maybe there's a world where we'll finish it at some point.”


	After Ansari set Being Mortal as his directorial debut in February 2022, also set to star alongside Murray, Deadline reported exclusively that April that Searchlight Pictures had suspended production following allegations of inappropriate behavior against Murray. It was later reported that Murray allegedly kissed and straddled a “much younger” female crew member.

	











	Before the details of the accusation were revealed, Murray called the incident a “difference of opinion,” explaining: “I did something I thought was funny, and it wasn't taken that way. The company, the movie studio, wanted to do the right thing, so they wanted to check it all out, investigate it. and so they stopped the production. But as of now, we're talking and we're trying to make peace with each other.”


	“I really think that's a really sad puppy that can't learn anymore. I don't want to be that sad dog and I have no intention of it,” added Murray. “What would make me the happiest would be to, you know, put my boots on and for both of us to go back into work and be able to trust each other and work at the work that we've both spent a lot of time developing the skill of, and hopefully do something that's good for more than just the two of us, but for a whole crew of people, a whole crew of movie makers. and the movie studio as well.”

Diane Keaton's daughter, Dexter White, is honoring her late mother in a heartfelt way following the Oscar winner's death at 79. In her first Instagram Story since Keaton's passing, White shared a touching message that reflected her mother's lifelong love of animals and advocacy for rescue causes. The post encouraged followers to donate to Race for the Rescues, a charity dedicated to saving animals in need.

“There's still time to donate! Please consider making a donation to my race. There is no amount too small. Together we can help save animals' lives,” the message read.

White added that every contribution helps:

Dexter's first post is a fitting tribute to Keaton's compassion and lifelong advocacy for animals. Keaton left behind not only an extraordinary film legacy but also a lasting message of love and compassion.

According to AOL, one of the most touching details to emerge after her passing is that the Oscar-winning actress left $5 million in her will to care for her beloved golden retriever, Reggie, and to support several animal charities she championed throughout her life.

Reggie, whom Keaton adopted in 2020, was far more than a pet; he was her constant companion and daily source of comfort. In her final Instagram post, shared on National Pet Day, Keaton posted a photo of Reggie with the caption, “My heart on four legs.”

A post shared by Hudson Grace (@hudsongracesf)

Entertainment journalist Rob Shuter told AOL, “Reggie was her world. Diane used to joke that her great loves were her children, Al Pacino, architecture, and that dog.”

Sources close to the actress said Keaton made careful arrangements for Reggie's future, ensuring he would be cared for by trusted handlers and continue living in comfort. “She wanted Reggie to live with the same dignity and humor she did,” one insider shared. “It's the most Diane thing ever — kind, generous, and full of love.”

In a statement shared with People, Keaton's loved ones confirmed she died from pneumonia on October 11 in California. They also thanked fans, friends, and colleagues for the outpouring of love and support they've received.

A post shared by The Tonight Show (@fallontonight)

“The Keaton family are very grateful for the extraordinary messages of love and support they have received these past few days on behalf of their beloved Diane, who passed away from pneumonia on October 11,” the family said.

Keaton's film career spanned more than five decades. She rose to fame in the 1970s with her role as Kay Adams in The Godfather films and her collaborations with Woody Allen.

She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Annie Hall in 1977 and later starred in beloved films, including “The First Wives Club”, “The Family Stone”, “Because I Said So”, “Book Club”, and “Finding Dory”.

Keaton also explored directing and producing, helming projects such as Heaven (1987), Hanging Up (2000), and an episode of “Twin Peaks”. Her career was marked by humor, authenticity, and a timeless individuality that made her one of Hollywood's most admired figures.

Born in Los Angeles in 1946 as Diane Hall, Keaton built a life defined by creativity, independence, and love. She adopted her two children, Dexter and Duke, in 1996 and 2001, often sharing how motherhood gave her life new meaning.

Keaton chose not to marry, devoting herself instead to her family and career. “Today I was thinking, I'm the only one in my generation of actresses who has been a single woman all her life,” she told People in 2019. “I'm really glad I didn't get married. I'm an oddball.”

Admired for her wit, warmth, and fearless individuality, Keaton inspired generations of artists and fans. Her daughter's heartfelt tribute, and the immense public outpouring of love reflect the impact she made both on-screen and in life.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM w/chart: In what has been a heavy-loaded horror year, every other studio seemed to be winning with the genre except Blumhouse. Until now: the horror house of Purge & Five Nights at Freddy's finally makes a comeback this weekend with Black Phone 2 which in its opening is ahead of its predecessor with a 3-day of $24.4M. 


	Important to note how profitable the sequel will be as the original Black Phone cleared $67M after all ancillaries, a $161M global gross, and an $18M production cost, and $72M global P&A. Scott Derrickson directed both pics.  


	The sequel throughout last night continued to trend up against comps, which is a great sign for a horror film. A -22% ease from Friday is expected today with $8.3M. That's better than the first Saturday of 2021's Black Phone which declined -26% from Friday with a $7.5M take. Overall CinemaScore is a B, which is very good for a horror film on that exit poll's scale. In ComScore/Screen Engine's PostTrak, women under 25 (who showed up at 22%) loved the R-rated movie the most at 85% positive score and 76% definite recommend along with 13-17 year olds (12%, more than Tron:Ares‘ 6% last weekend for the demo) who gave it an 88% positive score and massive 83% definite recommend. Overall definite recommend, the barometer for success on PostTrak, is a great 63%.  

	











	Audiences are picking up Black Phone 2 in the West, Midwest and South Central. Shared PLFs with Tron: Ares are driving close to a third of the gross with the AMC Burbank the nation's highest grossing cinema with close to $31K so far. 


	Latino and Hispanic audiences are first in line for Black Phone 2 at 39%, followed by 35% Caucasian, 15% Black and 5% Asian American. Strong 18-34 turnout at 63% in addition to under 25 at 47%. 


	Universal communicated far and wide on social with Black Phone 2 counting a social media reach of 307M, 37% above horror franchise genre norms before opening. That's almost as big as New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines (353M), bigger than last fall's Smile 2 (160M), and the original Black Phone (141M). Social media stars are Mason Thames (2.3M fans), Ethan Hawke (1.5M) and Madeleine McGraw (900K). Notices RelishMix, “Convo runs positive for The Black Phone 2 as fans bless the sequel logic, saying the first already had ghosts, so a supernatural return makes sense. They rally behind Ethan Hawke and melt for the Alice in Chains needle drop, noting Layne's voice gave them chills and the song goes hard. Trailer moments land well as the ice-skate glide looks genuinely scary, the ‘Vengeance is mine' line hits, and Finny's grown-up look fuels return-ticket energy. Feeds are full of, ‘I'm going, can't wait, and sequel I never knew I needed.'”

	











	The weekend's other starry wide entry, Lionsgate's Good Fortune, which at net $30M cost as much as Black Phone 2, ain't faring well with $5.7M-$6.1M. B+ CinemaScore, and a pretty good 59% definite recommend, but nobody is going. At a time when we want comedies to truly make a return at the box office, this Keanu Reeves, Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari feature isn't calling the masses out despite good reviews at 78% certified fresh and a 77% audience score out of its TIFF world premiere. The film, an homage to movies like Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait, is playing ala a specialty movie, on the coasts. Largely guys over 25 (42%) and women over 25 (39%) with hardly anyone under 25 at 19%. The movie was greenlit given its conceit: two historically strong box office genres –angels among us and body swap comedies– have traditionally fared well. While Reeves is known of late for his John Wick streak, returning him to his comedy chops, particularly as a gentle angel, was an m.o. that wasn't out of the norm. That said, while conceived as a commercial play, audiences are perceiving this as an arthouse title. You can see that in the turnout. 


	Perhaps the word of mouth will get Good Fortune to a bigger multiple. Women (who showed up at 47%) and men (53%) respectively gave it sold definite recommends at 54% and 65%. 


	With a 166 million reach across TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and X, Good Fortune‘s social media universe is paced 13% behind other comedy norms, RelishMix comping the Ansari directed movie to Naked Gun, Caught Stealing, Joy Ride and Honey Don't. Rogen counts 24.5M social media followers, Keke Palmer is 23.2M, with full force from Ansari at 11.9M. Reeves is still off the grid for his films. As far as the sniping online, RelishMix noticed “Mixed-negative leaning chatter for Good Fortune hits on recycled looks, AI vibes, and some misplaced casting. Keanu's Wick-hair-and-beard fatigue is real with complaints like, ‘You'd think Keanu would change his look for this movie. Instead it's John Wick with costume store wings. Looks lame to me.'”.


	The freefall of auteur driven sophisticated cinema this fall at the box office in the wake of pics by Derek Cianfrance, Darren Aronofsky, Ronan Day-Lewis, Benny Safdie and Kogonada continues with Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt which in its weekend 2 expansion from six NYC to LA theaters to 1,238 theaters isn't wowing with a $1,2K theater average and $1.6M second frame. The domestic box office gross endgame for this Amazon MGM Studios movie is $5M and God knows, it didn't cost that much to produce with Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield starring. At 38% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics, and 35% with audiences, nobody is buying this psychological thriller about sexual politics at the university level. As always, Amazon can absorb the cost in a way that other motion pictures distributors cannot with a parachute for this film on Prime Video. 


	Angel Studios period WWII movie Truth & Treason walks away with the weekend's only A CinemaScore thanks to its faith-based followers, but not much of a flock with a $2.5M opening. All the money is in the faith-based tracks of South, Mountain, and Midwest with the top grossing cinema being the Megaplex Theatres in Geneva, UT with just over $7K.  


	Total weekend is $67.6M for all movies as of this minute, just -2% off from mid-October a year ago. This is a big weekend for teeing up a horror tentpole in the pre-Halloween corridor and Black Phone 2 is it. You'll remember, Blumhouse's Halloween opened in this same exact frame back in 2018 charting the 6th best opening of October with $76.2M.

FRIDAY MIDDAY UPDATE: Blumhouse is looking at its biggest opening year-to-date after four movies with Black Phone 2, which is shaping up for a $23 million start after a Friday and previews of $10.1M at 3,411 sites.


	After an autumn of lost hopes, thank God. That's $600,00 lighter than the 2021 first installment's opening, and we'll take it.


	Giving the Universal release some extra power are 1,000 exhibitor PLF screens as well as 170 AMC-only Dolby Cinema screens.


	Second place goes to Disney's Tron: Ares at 4,000 sites with a 65% second-weekend decline, steeper than the movie's pre-Covid comp Blade Runner 2049, which was down 53% in its weekend 2. The Jared Leto movie's three-day is $11.5M, and its second Friday is $3.3M. The 10-day running total by Sunday will stand at $54.9M, 10% behind Blade Runner 2049 at the same point in time and -37% behind 2010's Tron: Legacy (its 10-day was $87.3M) which had the beneficial bounce of Christmas.


	Third belongs to Lionsgate's Good Fortune at 2,990 theaters, with $2.5M today and bad fortune at $6M for the net $30M feature.


	Warner Bros' fourth weekend of One Battle After Another at 2,532 sites is seeing $3.8M over Friday-Sunday and $1M today, for a running cume by Sunday of $61.7M.


	Fifth is Paramount/Miramax's Roofman at 3,370 with a second Friday of $1.1M and a second weekend of $3.65M (-55%), for a 10-day total of $15.4M.


	Angel Studios is opening the Matt Whitaker-directed WWII period movie Truth & Treason at 2,088 theaters to $2.2M for the weekend after $1M today. The plot: One teen risks everything to expose the truth as he questions his loyalty to his German homeland. With the Gestapo closing in, he must decide what it really means to be a good German.


PREVIOUSLY, Friday AM: Universal and Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 dialed up $2.6 million in previews Thursday at 2,900 theaters from showtimes that began at 2 p.m. That's just under the $3M the original 2021 movie pulled in before bowing to $23.6M.


Black Phone 2 previews are in line with that of Paramount's Smile 2, which opened in the same weekend a year ago with $2.5M in previews and a three-day total of $23M.


	The hope is that Blumhouse, after seeing a lackluster streak in a horror-laden box office year for the industry, can actually get a break and post an opening that's robust. The Scott Derrickson-directed sequel is figured to land between $20M-$30M. Reviews are solid at 74% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The first Black Phone was 81% with RT critics and had a B+ CinemaScore.


	The setup for Black Phone 2 is that Ethan Hawke's The Grabber is out there in the real world, not holed up in some neighborhood house in 1970s suburbia. Watch out. Production cost for Black Phone 2 is net $30M.

	











	After the less-than-par opening for Disney's Tron: Ares, and sophisticated adult movies in free-fall (I'm sorry, One Battle After Another is the exception and faring better at a near $58M than everything in its wake, i.e., Roofman, A Big Bold Beautiful Journey, Caught Stealing, etc.), it's doldrums time at the autumn box office, though according to ComScore for, from Labor Day through last Sunday, the season is flat with a year ago at $770.7M. It would be nice to finally see a movie meet its tracking forecast.


	Meanwhile, Lionsgate has the comedy Good Fortune, directed by and starring Aziz Ansari along with Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogen. It's expected to ring up under $10M at 2,985 locations. The movie cost a net $30 million in line with other Lionsgate movies; the pic, you'll remember, was impacted by a start-and-stop with the writers and actors strikes. Coming out of its TIFF world premiere, Good Fortune is 79% fresh. Previews last night were $725,000 at 2,500 sites. Note that Roofman, another adult-skewing (largely guys, ironically, for a Channing Tatum movie) title last week, did $1M in previews before posting an $8M start.


	Check out our interview below with Ansari at our TIFF studio:


	Disney's Tron: Ares ends the week with $43.4M, a number many were hopeful the net $180M production would open at. This movie is pacing slightly behind another Jared Leto sci-fi property, also with a finite fan base, 2017's Blade Runner 2049, which posted a first week of $45.4M. Blade Runner 2049 with an A- CinemaScore held at -53% in weekend 2 with $15.4M, and Tron: Ares is expected to be steeper with -60% off its B+ CinemaScore. Tron Ares will keep the Imax and majority of PLFs and their great showtimes this weekend.

One Battle should have been released mid-late October.
It could have had a surge 1 month out with Thanksgiving + GG noms + CC noms…
Now it'll be streaming by Thanksgiving.

WB has NOTHING releasing in November or December. The winter holiday corridor is the best, most lucrative time of the year and WB just gave up on it.

Its quite obvious why they did that. Whatever awards buzz OBAA had would have been completely stolen by Wicked For Good. Much like how The Dark Knight stole whatever buzz WALL-E had

The movie business is so dead for filmmakers.
It's near impossible to get Keannu Reeves in your movie. Falls under the “don't even bother trying” type of “a” lister.
Same exact thing goes for Seth Rogen…

And a movie they are both in, bombs. 

Good night & Good Luck filmmakers.

Can you name a blockbuster that Seth Roger headlined within the last 10 years?

Seth was part of the photorealistic Lion King 2019 ensemble and arguably the biggest male name in that cast.

Or a hit movie of Reeves not called John Wick over that same period?

Sonic and Toy Story off the top of my head.

Not Keanu Reeves movies.  Not in the least.  Would've made the exact final dollar amount without him.

OBAA is hardly an exception. 58 million after 3 weeks for a £150-75 million dollar tentpole is shockingly bad

The budget was $130m, confirmed, with $70m marketing – and it's at $150m global take by the end of this weekend. It's not a tentpole/IP/comic book movie, dude.  For an adult drama, that's great these days. It'll probably take another year or two for it to be in profit after streaming/rentals, but long-term investments are how these things are mapped out at this point. Besides, Warners did over $4 BILLION this year and literally lined up a stream of releases to ALLOW for “OBAA”. They're thrilled with it.

The mental gymnastics you people are capable of to justify dismal results is impressive

Your insistence that no movie ever makes money is just as bad. There's a long tail after theatrical that box office watchers consistently forget about. Studios greenlight these types of movies with their eyes open

Mike and Adam, I get what you mean, but there is a counterpoint…the goal should be for all films to make a profit before all ancillary. That's obviously very tough to do, and maybe not feasible in all cases, but it at least should be an ambition on the part of filmmakers/producers/studios. Using a loss-leader model before ancillary is one reason why, in my opinion, the movie business is so risky.

Both your numbers and currencies are kinda off.

I saw the original Black Phone twice in the theaters in 2022. The performances of the child actors blew me away-in particular the young girl who played Finney's clairvoyant sister. She had me in tears. 

Looking forward to seeing it this weekend. Hope it doesn't disappoint.

Maybe a hobby?

	The right to protest has defined the United States of America since its founding. It's protest that led to the nation's founding in the first place, and it's protest that lies at the heart of the Constitution's First Amendment.


	It sure seems like Donald Trump isn't a big fan of any of this, as he repeatedly suggests that media outlets who report on him should be prosecuted, and as his administration takes steps to crack down on nonprofit organizations and others who demonstrate against him. Trump put it bluntly last week while signing an executive order aimed at punishing anyone who chooses to protest by burning an American flag.


	“We took the freedom of speech away,” the president said.


	This weekend, millions of Americans are expected to take to the streets across the nation to protest this increasingly oppressive administration. It will be the second widespread demonstration this year by the “No Kings” movement, the first coming on June 14, the same day the president held a military parade in Washington, D.C., on his birthday. Republicans have cast “No Kings” protesters as antifa extremists and anti-American “terrorists” — but few things are more patriotic than exercising one's right to free speech to protest authoritarian rule.

	“[We] want to be out there carefully, peacefully speaking our minds,” Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen, one of the organizations participating in the protest, told Rolling Stone this week.  “The one thing we cannot be in this moment is cowed by what [Trump] is threatening, and we won't be bullied into fear and silence in this moment.”

	











	Music has been an integral part of protests movements across generations, the present one being no exception. We released our Top 100 Protest Songs of All-Time earlier this year — chronicling how artists from Woody Guthrie to Public Enemy have inspired millions to stand up for their rights — and ahead of this weekend's “No Kings” demonstrations we've put together a playlist fit for the moment, filled with anti-authoritarian anthems in which some of our favorite artists put their foot down and give an emphatic middle finger to the idea of a king.

If you asked every Kelly Reichardt fan to blindly predict how the auteur would follow the 2022 release of “Showing Up,” nobody would have guessed she'd make an art heist movie set in New England. But watch a few minutes of “The Mastermind” and you'll see that it's a Reichardt film in every sense, even if it externally seems like a departure from the themes and locales she usually prefers.

Loosely inspired by a 1970 news story in which an art museum in Worcester, Massachusetts, was robbed while two teenage girls did homework in the gallery, the ironically titled film stars Josh O'Connor as a working-class family man who ruins his life in record time after making the impulsive decision to rip off his own local museum. Unsurprisingly, the film is far more interested in exploring the psyche of O'Connor's J.B. Mooney than dazzling you with art heist spectacle, and Reichardt's long, meditative takes pair beautifully with the lonely moments in which Mooney slowly realizes that he can't go home — and wouldn't have much waiting for him if he could.

But it's missing one major common denominator of a Reichardt film: a Pacific Northwestern setting. Save for her 1994 debut “River of Grass” (which was set in her native Florida), and her 2016 masterpiece “Certain Women” (which moved the action a whopping two states over to Montana), all of Reichardt's previous films have been set in Oregon. But Reichardt, who spends most of her time on the East Coast due to her teaching job at Bard College in upstate New York, was itching for a change of cinematic scenery.

 










“I wanted to get out of Oregon for a bit and have a new landscape to look at,” Reichardt said during a recent interview with IndieWire. “Being from New York and originally from Florida, Oregon was so unique to me and so inspiring and exciting because it just was so different than flat Miami or New York City, where I lived. So that was all cool. A lot of those stories were written with Jon Raymond, and we built a little world out there to work from. And Oregon's a really diverse state, so you have forest and desert, and we never really made use of the ocean, but I needed a change. I teach in New York on the East Coast, and I've lived on the East Coast for a long time, and suddenly I could sort of see the light of the East Coast, literally the light, feel the difference of it [compared to] the West Coast… You can see something when you spend time away from it.”

“The Mastermind” moved the action to Framingham, Massachusetts, and the original newspaper story that Reichardt found about the Worcester art heist gave her a starting point to explore a story about the tragically dated concept of a small town having its own art museum. The setting catches America at a point of transition between an era of middle-class prosperity and the economic decay that was on the horizon.

 










“I really wanted to shoot something on the East Coast. And this size of city, the industrial town that has little museum, that the sort of middle class residents are keeping going, that's Massachusetts to me,” she said. “That happens to be a place where I went to art school. And so that seemed right. And the Worcester Museum robbery with the young girls, that was a good jumping off point.”

The role of Mooney wasn't written for O'Connor, but Reichardt was inspired to work with him after being drawn to his “timeless face” and meeting him through a mutual friend. There was an instant chemistry on set (along with O'Connor's co-star Alana Haim, who gives a brilliantly understated performance as Mooney's fed-up wife trying to hold the family together amid his antics). Reichardt said that shooting “The Mastermind” was the best filmmaking experience of her life (“First Cow” is the runner-up, if you were wondering). The fact that it came after the stressful experience of filming “Showing Up” during the pandemic only added to the joy. 

What does a filmmaker like Reichardt, who has spent her entire career making delicate, unapologetically uncommercial films, think about the current indie film landscape? The auteur is as stressed as any of us, but she's not convinced that it was ever much better. 

 










“It always feels precarious, and it feels precarious now. I mean, AI is a threat on every level. That makes life feel precarious, much less filmmaking,” she said. “Who's going to keep financing films? When you're putting a film out, you have to compete in this realm with films that are just cranking in so much money that it just makes the smallest film so expensive. But I have to say that's been the story of independent filmmaking since I started. And somehow, here we are. But I don't know, to be honest, the whole world seems so precarious. I mean, the state of independent filmmaking is probably not our biggest problem. But obviously I care because that's what I'm into, and I hope it keeps going. But I kind of always have a feeling when I'm making a film like, ‘Well, this is probably the last one. Can't believe we're getting another one done.'”

Reichardt might enjoy a bit of gallows humor about her own career longevity, but she's hoping that “The Mastermind” isn't anything close to her last film. She doesn't need filmmaking — her day job as a teacher is a lot less stressful — but Reichardt said that she has enough film ideas to keep her band of repeat collaborators like cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt, assistant director Chris Carroll, and production designer Anthony Gasparro busy for the rest of their lives. 

 










“I mean, it's a lot easier to teach than to make films, to be honest,” she said with a laugh. “Filmmaking is super, super challenging. I mean, just as far as the craftsmanship of it, of shooting and editing. And just the idea of visual storytelling is forever interesting to me. And I don't think I could accomplish it all in one lifetime. I don't know, you choke, you get better at things. But new challenges bring new trials. And yeah, oh, my God, we still have, if we're allowed, we have lots we'd like to do.”

A MUBI release, “The Mastermind” is now playing in theaters.

EXCLUSIVE: The creator of Tilly Norwood, the AI actress who got Hollywood hot under the collar, has stressed that she was not developed using funding from the British Film Institute (BFI). 


	Eline Van Der Velden, the UK-based technologist, shared a statement with Deadline clarifying how her company, Particle6, used a grant from the BFI's UK Global Screen Fund.


	Her intervention comes amid concerns in the acting community about the creation of Norwood and how avatars like her could ultimately replace lower profile performers.

	Alexa Morden, an actress who hosts The 98% Podcast, spotted the Particle6 grant and said she was alarmed that the BFI could be using “public funding to support creation of technology that literally replaces creatives.”

	Van Der Velden said the £120,000 ($161,000) grant Particle6 received from the BFI in November 2023 was “entirely unrelated” to the creation of Norwood. A BFI spokeswoman echoed this sentiment.


	Van Der Velden's position is that Norwood was funded and developed through Xicioa, a seperate company established by the technologist in February. The IP is owned by Xicioa, with Particle6 providing support under a service agreement.


	It is a more nuanced picture than the one described over the summer, when Norwood was soft launched and Particle6 repeatedly and proudly claimed credit for creating the computer generated star. In a LinkedIn post at the time, Van Der Velden said: “Tilly is Particle6's fully AI-generated actress.”

	











	Van Der Velden told Deadline: “In 2023, Particle6 was proud and deeply grateful to receive support through the BFI UK Global Screen Fund's International Business Development strand.


	“In line with the terms of the grant, all funding was dedicated exclusively to advancing our international growth strategy. This included key initiatives such as attending overseas markets and conferences, acquiring new IP, and engaging a head of international outreach — all of which were fully approved and communicated with the BFI. This outreach role began as a consultancy position, and as our ambitions grew, the senior industry executive who initially served as our consultant became Particle6's chief commercial officer in summer 2025.”


	“It's important to note that this grant is entirely unrelated to Xicoia, which was established later, in February 2025 (and formally announced in September). Xicoia — and its first AI talent, Tilly Norwood (launched publicly in July 2025) — were fully funded by my own personal investment. 


	“Today, as an AI talent studio, Xicoia operates as an independent company while maintaining a service agreement with Particle6. Particle6 continues to thrive as a diverse production company, creating across AI, traditional television, and commercial formats.”


	A BFI spokesperson said: “The UK Global Screen Fund award was granted to Particle6 and is entirely separate to Xicoia's development of Tilly Norwood, with no crossover in activity or resources. The BFI was not aware of any intention for the development of Xicoia Ltd or of Tilly Norwood at the time of application.”


	Van Der Velden added: “The BFI plays a vital role in strengthening and future-proofing the UK's screen sector, and countless creative companies, including ours, have benefited from its support. We share the BFI's belief that innovation and responsibility must go hand in hand. 


	“Its June 2025 report, AI in the Screen Sector: Perspectives and Paths Forward, outlines a clear, forward-looking framework for ethical, sustainable AI integration. Particle6 and Xicoia are proud to align with this vision and remain committed to contributing positively to the UK's reputation for creativity, innovation, and integrity.”


	Particle6, which describes itself as an AI production company, was founded in 2015. As well as funding from the BFI, the company has secured backing from Channel 4 and Creative UK.

Michael Mann addressed his move from Warner Bros. to Amazon MGM Studio division United Artist with his long gestated upcoming feature Heat 2 at a press conference on Saturday at the Lumière Festival in Lyon, where he is being feted with its honorary Lumière Award this year.


	The director was asked if the deal with the steaming giant could compromise the film's theatrical release in the same way as Ferrari, which bypassed cinemas in a number of key European territories such as France and Europe.


	Mann said he expected Heat 2 to get a U.S. theatrical release on 4,000 cinemas for at least 45 days, and added he felt the streamer was entering a new era with regards to exhibition and distribution.

	“Amazon is in transition, which is why they bought Bond. They're in a transition to become something more than a streaming service. They have ambitions be a major, I don't want to speak for Amazon, a major figure in exhibition, in theatrical.”


	“The potential, because the movie would come out in almost two years from now, the potential of the synergy within Amazon is massive,” he added.


	He said the move to United Artists with Heat 2 had been due mainly to the high cost of making the movie, linked partly to the fact it is shooting in multiple territories.


	“Heat 2 is… an expensive movie to make, but I believe it should be made at the proper size and scale. It's going to shoot in Chicago, Los Angeles, Paraguay, and possibly some parts in Singapore,” he said.


	“It's complex. People make dramas at a certain budget level… because of the costs, Heat 2 is probably double that. So, if it was at a low, low price, I could have made it anywhere. But it's complex. I can't get into all the politics of it, but we moved from Warner Brothers to Amazon and United Artists.”


	Earlier in the conference, Mann was asked (by Deadline) about his opinion on AI and whether he had or planned to use the technology, given his reputation for being at the cutting edge of using new technological advances in his work throughout his career.

	











	He said he had not used the technology as yet but was mulling the use of AI in Heat 2 to support the aging and de-aging process of the characters of Detective Vincent Hanna, Neil McCauley and Chris Shiherlis, with the film revisiting their stories prior to the original's 1995 setting. 


	“I don't experiment with technology gratuitously. [If] I have a dramatic need or aesthetic need for it then I go deep into what I need,” he said. “For example, aging and de-aging will be very important in the film (Heat 2),” he said.


	Asked why he was so keen to revisit the characters of Heat, when he had never done sequels in the past, Mann revealed it was due partly to his deep connection with the characters.


	“The characters of Heat are so alive to me that I know everything about outside the boundaries of the film. I know what De Niro's character looked like when he was basically state raised as an 11-year-old, wearing clothes that didn't match, being ostracized, which then made them aggressive and violent, which led to juvenile facilities,” said the director.


	“I know everything about these characters. I always wanted to do more with these people, but I couldn't figure out how to do it because one's dead at the end of Heat,” he said.


	“Then the idea occurred to me based on the rapport between the two lethal adversaries, Pacino's Hanna and De Niro's Macaulay about how to do both before the events of Heat and after.”


	Mann said Heat 2 would not deal with the events of 1995 in the original movie but would start rather one day after, with only Hanna's associate Chris Shiherlis, played by Val Kilmer still alive.


	“Only Val Kilmer is alive, and he has to flee United States and then it goes seven years earlier. It's 1988. Hanna is a detective in Chicago, not Los Angeles… In 1988, they are not the same people as they are in 1995. It's the events of 1988 which then turned them into the characters of 1995.”


	“For example, Macaulay, De Niro, who has an idea of no attachment, having nothing in your life that you can't walk up from in 30 seconds flat. 1988 he has a wife, he has a stepdaughter. He has a nuclear family that is very attached to him.”

So he's basically admitting that they already know the film is going to be a financial disaster but YOLO, Amazon.

Is there anyone who really thinks this will live up to the greatness of the first one?

I'd say no… but once this definitely succeeded in film history: with “Godfather II.” So, we shall see.

He is wishing Amazon into being something it doesnt want to be. Everything is about Prime.

Bro, Amazon has big Amazon Fresh grocery stories, Whole Foods, and Amazon physical book stores, why wouldn't they want to have Amazon Theaters too and supply those theaters with their own films like Bond and Heat2? 

Some people want to read books on Kindle, some like physical books. Some people like groceries delivered to their doors, some like going to the grocery store. Some people like watching movies at home, others like the shared experience at the theater. Some people like all these options, depending on the day. People like a variety of experiences. People like choice.

Bond is a theatrical play. It is too expensive to be streaming only.

The movie about an immigrant finding community and meaning stars Isabella Wei and world premiered at the BFI London Film Festival.

	A small circus coming to rural England turns out to open up new opportunities and perspectives for a young woman in Calif Chong's feature film High Wire, which world premiered at the 69th edition of the BFI London Film Festival (LFF), which wraps on Sunday.


	“Go-Wing's future feels predetermined,” reads a synopsis for the movie, which Chong co-wrote with Jackie Lam. “Days are filled with working at her father's Chinese takeaway and studying. Beneath her sense of duty is a crushing loneliness and the prospect of a life unfulfilled. So, when an acrobatic circus comes to town, with a little accidental blackmail, Go-Wing is able to join them and finds the promise of community, artistic release, and a fulfilling future lived on her own terms.”

	Isabella Wei, Dominic Lam Kar Wah, and Jose Palma star in High Wire, a Silent D Pictures production in association with Make a Difference Films and Ajamax Productions. The cinematography was handled by Matthew P. Scott. Check out a film clip here for a first taste of what to expect. 


	The film marks the feature directorial debut for Chong, who has mostly worked as an editor.


	She, Wei, and Scott talked to the press at a LFF afternoon tea event this week.


	“The circus was the perfect place for my dream to tell an immigrant story that's set in the food business environment, because I myself experienced working in a restaurant in Chinatown in Manchester,” Chong told THR. “I felt very weird because I was there to chase some sort of dream. I hate this word, by the way. People say dream. I'm here to make a career, and it's not meant to be a dream.”

	











	Wei recalled going for the lead role. “I submitted a self-tape audition, and I think just a few hours later, I heard back from them that I was cast in a role,” she told THR. “So, it was super-exciting. And it was such a beautiful role.” 


	She didn't audition locally, though. “I was in Hong Kong at the time, but it was really nice to be telling the story of someone from Hong Kong, or ethnically Hong Kong, in the U.K., which is where I spend some of my time,” she said. “And it incorporated a lot of really creative, expressive, especially physically expressive, outlets.”


	Before she found Wei, Chong realized the challenges of casting for a circus performer role. “It was a hard casting. At some point, I thought, ‘Why did I write this?' The bilingual ability was one thing,” she recalled. “But they also had to be able to dance and rollerblade,” and more. “So, when I saw her tape, I was like, ‘Oh, god is saving me'.”


	As Chong's partner, Scott had the advantage of being part of planning discussions, which allowed him to be ready for many scenes. “But, technically, probably the hardest scene was the final high wire act, because it's very hard on set doing that much visual effects work,” he told THR.


	Wei found other parts more challenging. “For me, some of the hardest scenes were probably in the takeaway,” explained the star. “Because we needed that relationship between me and my dad, and I think creating that relationship or dynamic to make it look like we have been living together and coexisting in this really tight, narrow space for so long was quite a challenge.”

“Dancing with the Stars” professional dancer and Season 34 judge Derek Hough has shown a vulnerable side to himself recently as he bravely revealed the childhood bullying he has endured and the tremendous impact it had on him, and, more recently, he has opened up about his loss. 

A post shared by Hayley Erbert Hough (@hayley.erbert)

Hough and his wife, Hayley Erbert, are expecting their first child, and they could not be happier. Fans have loved witnessing their pregnancy journey, which the couple has chosen to share publicly, but many people would not have realized that this is their rainbow baby. The couple is opening up about a miscarriage that happened before this pregnancy and how they are navigating their emotions going into this new chapter of their life. 

They posted a joint video on Instagram on October 15. In the video, the text reads, “Although we are so excited to be welcoming our rainbow baby so soon, we honor our baby that never made it Earthside.”

“There are some things in life that change you forever. For us, this is one of those things,” the caption of the joint post between Erbert and Hough reads. “A chapter of love, loss, heartbreak, and everything in between. As we are now in October, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, we share this part of our story to honor our baby that never made it earthside. One in four pregnancies end in miscarriage, a silent heartbreak so many families know, and one we unfortunately had to experience. As we share this, know that there's a rainbow not far behind.”

This is something Hough and Erbert had not spoken about publicly before, but doing so now helps to raise awareness for miscarriage. It may also be of some solace to those going through similar experiences. 

A post shared by Hayley Erbert Hough (@hayley.erbert)

Fans have flooded the comment section with messages of support, but one of the messages that stands out is one from Hough's sister, professional dancer and DWTS co-host, Julianne Hough. 

“Witnessing your journey and how you have moved through each life-changing moment in the last few years has been the greatest testament of resilience and the power of love – I'm forever in awe of your strength and vulnerability in loving completely! I love you so much,” Julianne commented on the post. Her comment has been liked over 2,000 times from fans who are showing their support for her message.

	Instagram livestreaming hit the big screen during the 69th edition of the BFI London Film Festival (LFF), courtesy of actor-director Bradley Banton and his feature film More Life, which world premiered during the fest.


	“Framed within the hyper-performative world of Instagram livestreaming, this is an impressive, fresh and beautifully observed debut,” notes the LFF website.




	The movie, backed by Michael Fassbender's DMC Film, stars Tuwaine Barrett (Hard Truths), Dipo Ola, and Jordan Peters. For a glimpse of what to expect, check out a clip from More Life here.

	Banton and Barrett talked to THR about how More Life came to be and what audience reactions they noticed in the cinema.


	“I was watching a Nicki Minaj livestream,” Banton recalled. “I was just like, ‘This is so entertaining. There's something that needs to be done about this.' And then we just built it from there.”


	Originally, the movie was going to be set in London. “And then I was like, ‘You can live stream anywhere.' So, let's go to my favorite city, Copenhagen, for live streaming,” he explained.


	It didn't take weeks or months of production for this one. But the question was whether to do it in one continuous go or not. “Originally, it was going to be one long take,” Banton told THR. “But we thought that was a bit too crazy, especially because we only had four hours to do it. I've seen Boiling Point and Victoria. But I thought that would be a bit too crazy. So, we ended up doing glitches in order to splice together different takes.”

	











	Given that the mobile phone is the typical livestreaming device, that also had an impact on the film and its format. “We knew it was always going to be vertical,” Banton said. But he is curious if some younger audiences will also end up watching the film on their cellphones down the line. 


	The cinema experience at the premiere saw some behavior that was atypical for mobile users. “When we had the premiere, there was a young lad in front of us,” Barrett told THR. “He was just so involved. He was locked in. He didn't play with his phone once. And I think that was because he recognized on screen something that he related to.” 


	Concluded the star: “He's probably always on Instagram, looking at reels, looking at live feeds. So to see that on a big screen, he was just like ‘wow'.”


	Will the duo make another livestreaming feature? Banton is down for it, “if we had any excuse to go to another country.” Adds Barrett with a laugh: “We'll need a budget. Just give us the money!”

 Best New Reissue

Genre:

Label:

October 18, 2025

In the summer of 2015, Carly Rae Jepsen was looking to the future: “My desire now,” she told an interviewer, “is to see how far I can stretch pop.” Her latest moves had evolved from the good-enough charm of Kiss—the album that contained her unexpectedly planet-dominating hit “Call Me Maybe”—into glossier, vintage-inspired territory: gated drums, squealing synths, a couple saxophone solos. '80s pop rehashed for the new millennium feels staid in its omnipresence today—but remember when it actually felt like a bold new idea, when embracing that moment, in all its schmaltz and sentiment, could represent a genuinely surprising artistic turn?

The first step in claiming Jepsen's future was E•mo•tion, a record of diamond-sharp songs—now a decade old, re-released as a deluxe 10th anniversary edition. In countless interviews, she has rejected the notion that pop music—hers or anyone else's—ought to be considered a “guilty pleasure,” and E•mo•tion is, fittingly, a record of full-on pleasure: unselfconscious, effervescent, no irony to be found. These are songs about big feelings, matched by big-budget production, evincing a shameless devotion to pure pop: uptempo, tightly structured, stuffed with singable hooks and lyrics that don't exactly hold up perfectly under scrutiny yet nonetheless scan as immediately relatable. “Run Away With Me” is the aural equivalent of a confetti cannon, the sonic translation of the way a crush makes you feel invincible. “Boy Problems” is neon and buoyant with its groovy bassline, chorus of na na nas, and percussion stabs like the kind of text you send with 15 exclamation marks. The exceptions to the bubblegum bangers formula are equally rewarding: The brooding, breathy “Warm Blood” and the poised ballad “All That” gently widen Jepsen's sound without becoming a distraction.

No pop star yearns quite like Jepsen, and her best songs thrive in moments of uncertainty and indecision. The tracklist ticks through not-quite-love and sort-of-breakups and headrush crushes and conflicted kiss-offs. She doesn't just like you—she really likes you, repeating that word five times in a row to indulge the absurdity of infatuation. On “Your Type” and “Gimmie Love,” she's begging to cross the line from friendship into romance; on “When I Needed You,” she sings like she's still trying to convince herself to leave an ex in the past. Jepsen always sounds like she means it, her voice all full-on dedication—and rather than rendering her rigid, she only comes across more ebullient. Sure, she claimed she vaped for a week straight to get some rasp in her delivery on “Your Type,” but her voice is still irrefutably sweet; her lyrics are loaded with odd come-ons—“Here I come to hijack you,” or, “Who gave you eyes like that/Said you could keep them?”—but she knows how to land them convincingly.

E•mo•tion's 10th anniversary edition includes the original 11 tracks plus six bonus tracks from various previous deluxe editions. It's also got the genuinely euphoric “Cut to the Feeling,” which was written for the album but saved for a Canadian-French animated film in 2016. (No overlap here, it should be noted, with E•mo•tion: Side B, the first edition in Jepsen's ongoing series of album sequels.) As for as-of-yet unheard material: There's two “Run Away with Me” remixes (one aqueous, courtesy of Kyle Shearer; one stadium-sized, courtesy of Rostam) and four previously unreleased tracks. The singer said she worked on more than 200 songs to make E•mo•tion, and while these cast-offs are conventionally Carly Rae, hearing them after E•mo•tion proper makes their absence from the original tracklist self-evident: “More” sounds like it could have landed on Disco Sweat, an album Jepsen wrote and scrapped after E•mo•tion in the midst of an ABBA phase (she claims that record “will probably never be released, and shouldn't”); “Guardian Angel” and “Back of My Heart” are a touch too cute; “Lost in Devotion” is a lovesick but lesser ballad. Still, stans hoping for E•mo•tion: Side C will be well-fed.

In writing those supposed 200 songs, Jepsen spent numerous sessions with a range of producers. Big-name hitmakers like Max Martin and Jack Antonoff could have perhaps helped her parlay the success of “Call Me Maybe” into continued virality or commercial domination, but neither producer made it into the final cut. (According to her manager, Scooter Braun, hits weren't the goal anyway: “We had the biggest single in the world last time and didn't have the biggest album,” he told an interviewer in 2015. “This time we wanted to stop worrying about singles and focus on having a critically acclaimed album.”) The producers and co-writers Jepsen stuck with for E•mo•tion—Ariel Rechtshaid, Dev Hynes, Rostam Batmanglij, a pre-Olivia-and-Chappell Daniel Nigro—had bragging rights of a different sort: They'd made their reputations by helping knit together underground and pop sensibilities for artists like Haim, Solange, and Sky Ferreira.

Maybe that's why there was so much critical anticipation around E•mo•tion, the kind of major-label pop record that didn't ordinarily get fawning blog coverage a decade ago. This very publication did not review Taylor Swift's 1989 at the time of its release—which was both a massive commercial success and a clear zeitgeist companion to E•mo•tion's '80s-inspired pop—but not only reviewed E•mo•tion; it designated one E•mo•tion song Best New Track and dedicated a 1300-word roundtable to another. What made Jepsen catnip for music journalists: the verified indie cred of her producers? The allure of an underdog trying to break free of one-hit-wonder stigma? The relative lack of narrative in a moment of girlbossing, toxic positivity, and self-referentiality? Was it that the boys' club of music criticism was being proudly infiltrated by a new generation of writers from the demographics best suited to take this kind of music seriously (especially if it came with the signoff of tastemakers): young women and queer listeners? Was it that the record emerged at a time when “poptimism” still felt fresh—before the concept was downgraded to its role as a misunderstood weapon of clickbait; when that idea could still be challenged, debated, and perhaps even embraced among true music nerds; when it felt thrillingly possible to reimagine “pop” not as a lowest-common-denominator commercial category, or the manufactured result of a studio system, but as a lineage of sharp, smart songwriting that didn't have to be watered down to have broad appeal? The magic of perfect pop music, of course, is that it defies logic; perhaps that's why E•mo•tion was undeniable.

Despite the critical enthusiasm, E•mo•tion did not make Jepsen a mega-star. “I Really Like You” was her last song to hit the Billboard Hot 100, and the album only reached No. 16—a position that none of the sometimes glossy, sometimes wispy, always lovelorn albums she's released since have managed to clear. And despite her intention of pushing pop music past its limits, it's hard to believe that, after E•mo•tion, Jepsen truly committed to her vision, especially when you consider the freaky pioneers and international sounds and chart-topping regional styles and unexpected crossovers that have fallen under the “pop” umbrella in the last decade.

But in a way, she did stretch the concept of a pop career. The album marked the moment when Jepsen became a different kind of star, riding the cresting poptimism wave into what you might call pop's middle class. Though she wasn't the first to chart this kind of path, she did so before it was common knowledge that being dubbed royalty by a small army of very online fans could more or less keep a career afloat—a sort of godmother of the khia asylum. The record's lack of commercial success provided Jepsen with an underdog identity that left her fans fiercely hungry, as has the fact that her later releases haven't quite matched E•mo•tion's technicolor glow. Listening to the record today, it sounds neither like a relic of our poptimist past nor like musical clairvoyance nor like the work of an indie darling. It just sounds like one of the best pop albums of the 21st century—a guiltless delight.

Kristoffer Polaha is in the throes of watching a nearly lifelong dream come true. The beloved Hallmark star, who will appear next in the network's “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas,” is mere months away from seeing his directorial debut — the feature film “Mimics” — premiere at theaters nationwide.

“I am so proud of this,” he told EntertainmentNow after Panoramic Pictures acquired the movie, with plans for a limited release in theaters on February 6, 2026. “I can't express to you the joy and the pleasure that I feel in knowing that I've brought this little thing into the world with the help of a lot of people. It takes a lot of people saying yes to make a dream come true.”

Polaha and his filmmaking partners, including producer Ken Carpenter, released the first trailer for the “genre-bending” movie on October 16. In addition to directing “Mimics,” Polaha stars in the movie alongside a star-studded cast that includes A-list creator and actor Kevin Lawson, Latin country artist Mōriah, Stephen Tobolowsky, “SNL” alum Chris Parnell, Jesse Hutch, Jason Marsden, and Austin Basis.

According to the logline, Polaha plays “down-on-his-luck impressionist” Sam Reinhold, who “makes a pact with Fergus—a wicked, strings-attached puppet—that holds the promise to propel Sam to stardom, unleashing a nightmare that threatens the safety of those he holds dear. Kristoffer Polaha steps behind (and in front of) the camera for his directorial debut, MIMICS — a mix of horror, fun and romance, that'll have you laughing one minute… and looking over your shoulder the next.”

After a 15-day shoot in his hometown of Reno, Nevada, during the summer of 2024, Polaha told EntertainmentNOW that it was “the joy of my career so far” to finally realize his dream of directing a feature film, from being intimately involved in the script development to securing funding to overseeing the filming. 

He said, “The idea of 50-odd people coming together collectively, using their imagination to lift up the story, to tell a story, is a remarkable thing when it's done right.”

As the cast and crew filmed “Mimics,” it was not lost on Polaha that it had been exactly 30 years since he sat in a theater, the summer before his senior year of high school in 1994, watching Quentin Tarantino's “Pulp Fiction” and realizing his dream was to make movies, he told EntertainmentNow. 

He recalled, “I go home and I lock myself in the bathroom, and I'm sitting there looking in the mirror, and I'm thinking to myself, ‘That's what I want to do. I want to make movies. I want to make a movie, and I want to do it outside of the studio system. I want to do it independently. That's exactly what I want to do, and I want to help do it by becoming an actor. I'll break in that way.'”

Polaha's acting career has spanned TV (including series like “Life Unexpected,” “Backstrom,” and “Condor”) and movies (from “Wonder Woman 1984” to “Jurassic Park: Dominion”), and he's become one of Hallmark's biggest stars since his first rom-com on the network in 2016, opposite Meghan Markle, months before she fell for a handsome prince in real life.

But all the while, he held on to his dream of directing an independent film, noting, “I sat on this dream for 30 years. And it just happened in this weird way of just gently pushing something up the hill, just gently pushing and nudging and saying, ‘You know what, I want to do this thing, and I want to get this thing made, and I'm going to do it someday.' I didn't know how, but I wanted it to be in my hometown.”

“And it really is a wild thing to be standing at the finish line,” Polaha marveled. “I hope it does well, of course, but even if it doesn't make a penny, the fact is, this thing got made, and it's something that I'm actually really proud of.”

The world premiere of “Mimics” took place in Reno in late September. Panoramic Pictures is planning a “limited release” of the movie to about 400 theaters on February 6, Polaha told EntertainmentNow, with hopes that excitement about the film will prompt it to move to wider release. 

“Hopefully it grows and grows, and then we'll come to a city near you,” he said. “Let's seehow we do week one, and if we can stick it, then we keep going.”

I can't WAIT to see Mimic!! I was fortunate to meet Mr. Polaha this July in Dahlonega, Georgia, and he told us about it. Loved seeing his excitement as he talked about it!  Congratulations on achieving this milestone!!  On to your next directorial endeavor!!

Or they can already be bald.

	Have hair? No entry.


	For Yorgos Lanthimos‘ upcoming film Bugonia, a special screening is being held in Los Angeles on Monday, where attendees must be either bald or shave their heads to watch it. The moviegoers who participate will match Emma Stone‘s bald-headed character in the film.




DoLA's Instagram posted the requirements, with a caption that reads in part, “Have hair? A barber will be on-site starting at 6 p.m. to shave it all off. Screening starts at 8 p.m. This is real. And yes, part of it will be filmed.”

	The screening will take place at the Culver Theater, and participants have to RSVP as the tickets are first-come, first-served and are 18+ only.

	











Bugonia marks the fourth time the Oscar winner has teamed up with Lanthimos, after previously working on The Favourite (2018), Poor Things (2023) and Kinds of Kindness (2024). It sees Stone play a powerful CEO who is kidnapped and accused of being an alien. Additional castmembers include Jesse Plemons, Aidan Delbis, Stavros Halkias and Alicia Silverstone.


	Earlier this year, Stone opened up about shaving her head in real life for the project. She told Vogue that while the experience was like “No better feeling in the world,” it was also personal to the actress. Before the haircut took place, Stone recalls she “burst into tears in her trailer” because she was thinking about her mother, Krista Stone, who previously shaved her head from breast cancer treatment. 

	











Focus Features‘ Bugonia will release in U.S. theaters on Oct. 24.

	As California voters weigh Prop 50 ahead of the crucial upcoming midterm elections, Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher to campaign against the bill.


	Following Gov. Gavin Newsom‘s ‘Election Rigging Response Act‘, sparked by recent Texas redistricting efforts that benefit Republicans, Schwarzenegger told Maher he thinks “that Prop 50 is a big scam,” noting that “there's gerrymandering going on all over.”


	“Do you know who I want to win? The people,” he said. “The people have to win. See, I'm a Republican, but I'm not a Republican hack. I'm not a political hack. I don't serve the party, I always serve the people. The people are first.”

	Schwarzenegger continued. “We cannot undo something and rip away the power that the people in California have and give it back to the politicians. We fought that for too long. Let's not do that. Let's be a good example. Let the Democrats outperform the Republicans, and therefore, because of their performance, win and get the House back.”


	Maher quipped, “I don't think that's very realistic.”


	The former governor went on to champion the independent California Citizens Redistricting Commission that was formed in 2010 with support from Schwarzenegger. 


	Newsom previously trolled the Twins (1988) actor on social media in August when his co-star Danny DeVito contributed a $1,000 donation to the Yes on 50 campaign.

Someone please tell me why Californians are supposed to listen to a man who was the most incompetent, partisan, blowhard of a governor the state has ever “elected”? His policies decimated CA's manufacturing economy, drove millions of its citizens into poverty, gutted the programs that helped those citizens who were driven into poverty by his policies, then flaunted his “moral superiority” by humiliating his wonderful wife in front of the whole world. The CA statehouse is NOT a movie set! Please just go away!

Was he this naive when he was governor?  It's the argument of a toddler who didn't get his fair his and seek time.

Why is he being so naive? Democrats need to fight fire with fire.

Call Texas, Arnie.   Then, get to the choppa and shut up.

He's a Republican who wants the Democrats to always lose. What do you expect him to say?

If there's one decent thing you can say about living in the future, it's that the quality, quantity, and diversity of TV and film clips that enterprising animators have rendered in the style of popular Danish rectangular prism firm LEGO has really exploded. For instance: Have you ever asked yourself what one of the single funniest scenes of HBO's Succession would look like with a little plastic Matthew Macfadyen and a little plastic Zack Robidas facing off?

﻿

We speak, of course, of the frequently passed-around sequence from the show's second-season episode “Panic Room,” in which Macfadyen's typically feckless Tom Wambsgans is forced to try to vet news network anchor Mark Ravenhead for possible Nazi ties, and finds that his quarry fails to bat away even the softest of softballs. That scene, like many before it, has now become the subject of animator Trevor Carlee, who has very successfully rendered the sequence into a more blocky form, as he has with shows ranging from Abbott Elementary to It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia‘s famous “The Implication.”

Carlee isn't using actual LEGO pieces here, obviously, instead animating the scene in Blender. (If you're curious, Carlee lays out the full process he uses, starting from building sets and pieces in a couple of different apps, in an interview here.) But the effect is pretty impressive—especially as it applies to facial expressions. (It also highlights one of the weirder facts of the original Succession scene, i.e., the presence of present-day Secretary Of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on the TV in the background. Carlee has taken some, ahem, liberties with how Noem, who was a House Rep. for South Dakota when the episode was filmed, is depicted.) Above all, it's a strong reminder of just how good Macfadyen—placed in a rare straight man role—is here, his expertly timed delivery coming through in either flesh or plastic. (God, the way he hits “It seems you're short a few million,” when Ravenhead is listing off the casualties of World War II, is just golden. Wait, are we going to fall back into a Succession re-watch because of an online LEGO video?!)

Live With Kelly and Mark won outstanding daytime talk series.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	After five years of winning in at least one of her two categories, Kelly Clarkson was shut out at the 2025 Daytime Emmys. The awards were held at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, Calif., on Friday (Oct. 17). Mario Lopez hosted the show.


	Drew Barrymore won outstanding daytime talk series host for The Drew Barrymore Show. This is the second year in a row that Clarkson has been upset in this category (which she won the four years before that). She lost last year to Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos, the married stars of the syndicated Live With Kelly and Mark.

	











	This year, Live With Kelly and Mark won outstanding daytime talk series, ending (or at least interrupting) The Kelly Clarkson Show's four-year hold on the category. This is the second top program award for the long-running Live franchise. Live! with Regis and Kelly (when Ripa teamed with talk show legend Regis Philbin) won outstanding talk show – entertainment in 2012.




	Neither Barrymore nor Ripa and Consuelos attended the ceremony, a sign perhaps that they didn't expect to win.


	Barrymore has had a multi-faceted career, starting as a child star Altered States in 1980 and her breakout role in E.T. The Extra Terrestrial in 1982. In 2000, she co-starred with Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu in Charlie's Angels, which spawned Destiny's Child's smash single “Independent Women Part I,” which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 11 weeks. She also co-starred in three films with Adam Sandler. In 2018 she was the subject of Bryce Vine's Hot 100 hit “Drew Barrymore.”


The Drew Barrymore Show also won best directing team and best hairstyling/makeup, for a total of three wins. The Kelly Clarkson Show won two – best lighting direction and best live sound mixing/sound editing.


General Hospital won seven awards, tops for the night, followed by The Drew Barrymore Show, The Secret Lives of Animals and Secret Lives of Orangutans (three awards each), and Black Barbie, Days of Our Lives, Delicious Miss Brown, Disney Parks Magical Christmas Day Parade, Entertainment Tonight and The Kelly Clarkson Show (two awards each).


Entertainment Tonight won outstanding entertainment news series for the sixth consecutive year, while the host team (Cassie DiLaura, Denny Directo, Kevin Frazier, Rachel Smith and Nischelle Turner) won outstanding daytime personality – daily. But an ET-branded program remembering a TV legend, Bob Newhart: A Legacy of Laughter, An Entertainment Tonight Special, surprisingly lost outstanding daytime special to Disney Parks Magical Christmas Day Parade.


	Sir David Attenborough, 99, won outstanding daytime personality – non-daily for the Netflix program, Secret Lives of Orangutans. In so doing, he set a new record as the oldest person to win a Daytime Emmy, beating Dick Van Dyke's record by one year. Van Dyke won outstanding guest performer in a drama series last year at 98 for his performance on Days of Our Lives.

	











Selena Gomez's Food Network series Selena + Restaurant was nominated for outstanding culinary instructional series, but lost to Delicious Miss Brown on the Food Network. Gomez has now gone 0-3 at the Daytime Emmys, 0-5 at the Primetime Emmys and 0-1 at the Children's and Family Emmys. (Bottom line: She is due for a win.)


	Three top entertainment media brands – Billboard, Variety and The Hollywood Reporter – were recognized in the nominations (though none wound up winning). Billboard Presents was nominated for outstanding short form program. Variety Studio: Actors on Actors and Off Script With the Hollywood Reporter were both nominated for outstanding arts and popular culture program. 


Billboard Presents are the video cover profiles that Billboard produces for some of its cover artists. The specific episode submitted for the series was the cover video with conductor Gustavo Dudamel. Other Billboard Presents segments include cover videos with A$AP Rocky, Tyler, The Creator and Charli XCX. 


	The In Memoriam segment included talk show pioneer Phil Donahue; game show hosts Chuck Woolery, Peter Marshall and Wink Martindale; fitness guru and personality Richard Simmons; televangelist Jimmy Swaggart; acting legend James Earl Jones; and Food Network star Anne Burrell.


	The awards are presented annually by the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. If it seems like more than a year has gone by since the last Daytime Emmys, you're right. Last year's Daytime Emmys were held on June 7, 2024 the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles.


	Unlike the past five years, when the show aired on CBS, this year's program streamed live on watch.theemmys.tv and on the Emmys app.

	











	Veteran broadcast journalist Deborah Norville received a lifetime achievement honor.

General Hospital dominated the 2025 Daytime Emmy Awards with seven total wins, while Sir David Attenborough broke a record that was set just one year earlier.


	Attenborough notably beat Dick Van Dyke's record as the oldest-ever winner of a Daytime Emmy, which he set at the 2024 show. Dyke was 98 when he won the award, while Attenborough is 99. 




General Hospital won the coveted best daytime drama series award and took home the most awards with seven trophies, including best drama actress (Nancy Lee Grahn), best supporting drama actor (Jonathan Jackson) and daytime drama writing.

The incumbent won nearly 71 percent of the vote in an election that concluded on Friday and saw Joshua Staheli elected president.

	The results of the latest Teamsters Local 399 elections are in, and Lindsay Dougherty has been re-elected to the union's top staff post.


	Dougherty won nearly 71 percent of the vote and her political slate swept the election in a contest that concluded on Friday. A little over 1,600 ballots were cast, according to results the union posted to Instagram. 




	Teamsters Local 399 represents drivers, casting and locations professionals, animal experts, chef assistants and mechanics working in entertainment in the greater Los Angeles area. The union reported around 5,700 members at the end of 2024.

	“I am proud to have the confidence of our members to serve and represent for the next 3-years,” Dougherty said in a statement. “It's no surprise to industry workers that these last several years have been difficult. The work to stabilize our industry alongside our strong members, and Hollywood Unions and Guilds, continues. Nothing moves without the Teamsters from drivers, locations, casting, caterers and more. Our team is ready to continue the work to fight for and represent our members every day to build a better and stronger future.”

	Also triumphant in the election was current vice president and business agent Joshua Staheli, who was appointed president of the union after current president Kenny Farnell announced he was retiring. Sitting trustee Shaun Ryan was elected vice president and current communications and operations director Amy Gorton was elected recording secretary.

	











	Trustees of the union for the 2026-2028 term will include locations manager Robert Paulsen, incumbent trustee Joe Mora and current recording secretary Philip Quansah.


	All of the elected officials ran on the Hollywood Teamsters United slate, which promised to augment the power of the union through strong contracts and visibility within the larger labor movement.


	“Leadership is about understanding the issues, engaging with members face to face, negotiating strong contracts, owning the difficult times, celebrating the success of our members in the good times and growing our relationships in the labor movement to build member power,” said Dougherty in a promotional video during the campaign.


	The election saw mudslinging on both sides, with opposing slate Our Union, Our Future accusing Dougherty of negotiating a weak contract in 2024 and her slate of creating a “biased” election process. Dougherty in turn blasted the opposition's “unhinged Facebook videos” that spread “false claims of corruption.” 


	The Our Union, Our Future slate, led by transportation coordinator Michael Sparks, called for greater transparency, an equal emphasis on all classifications and a membership-driven approach.


	The Local is set to return to the bargaining table with studios and streamers in 2027.

Waylon Jennings notches his first top 10 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart with the debut of the from-the-vaults collection Songbird. The set flies in at No. No. 6 on Top Album Sales (dated Oct. 18), while also entering the top 10 on four more charts: Top Current Album Sales (No. 6), Indie Store Album Sales (No. 7), Americana/Folk Albums (No. 8) and Vinyl Albums (No. 9). It also starts at No. 17 on Top Country Albums, No. 18 on Independent Albums and No. 116 on the all-genre Billboard 200.

Songbird was compiled and mixed by Waylon's son Shooter Jennings, and consists of previously unheard recordings by Waylon produced between 1973-84. Songbird is the first of a trio of previously unheard albums from Waylon.


	Waylon Jennings died in 2002 after a stellar career on the charts, including 16 No. 1s on Billboard's Hot Country Songs ranking, and 11 No. 1s on Top Country Albums.


Songbird marks Waylon's first top 10 on the 34-year-old Top Album Sales chart, as it starts at No. 6 with nearly 9,000 copies sold in the United States in the week ending Oct. 9, according to Luminate.


Songbird is one of three debuts in the top 10 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart, where Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl storms in at No. 1 with 3,479,500 copies sold (the largest sales week for an album in the modern era, since Luminate began tracking data in 1991). Stray Kids' former No. 1 KARMA rises 5-2, the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack steps 4-3, Sabrina Carpenter's chart-topping Man's Best Friend climbs 10-4, AFI's Silver Bleeds the Black Sun debuts at No. 5 (nearly 10,000; marking the fourth top 10 for the act), P1Harmony's EX falls 2-7 in its second week, KATSEYE's Beautiful Chaos jumps 16-8, Cardi B's AM I THE DRAMA? is a non-mover at No. 9 and Mariah Carey's Here for It All falls 1-10 in its second week.

Long-running wrestling outfit the WWE has revealed its intention to enter a new era of “AI-based storytelling.” Per a report in the Wrestling Observer, the entertainment company recently hired former Buzzfeed guy Cyrus Kowsari to serve as its new senior director of creative strategy, i.e., the guy whose job it will be to cram artificial intelligence into every inch and crevice of WWE's creative singlet.

Kowsari—who also spent several years at MMA company ONE—was introduced to WWE staffers back in September by chief creative officer Paul “Triple H” Levesque, who called him someone who would lead the company into an “inevitable” “transition into AI-based storytelling,” as well as fronting a push to “integrate AI into creative services like video and graphics.” The latter of which, we can kind of get: If you're not that worried about things like quality, respecting copyright, or the environment, AI can crap out a lot of graphics really quickly. But the idea of letting AI write storylines for what is still one of the planet's biggest wrestling promotions feels aggressively silly, especially when we're talking about a form of entertainment that has had to fight off years of allegations that its storytelling was slapdash and inconsistent.

Among other things, the Wrestling Observer piece cites reporting from the site's own Dave Meltzer, who wrote in his regular wrestling newsletter that recent attempts by WWE to use writing AI to generate storyline ideas produced unusable nonsense, with the models having little ability to keep track of, say, which wrestlers actually worked for the company. Again, you probably could filter through the massive amounts of garbage you'd get with this approach to find a usable idea created by jamming together five old ones. Which feels ridiculously harder than just stocking a writers room with a small collection of people who actually know the company's output. But, hey, what do we know? We've never even suplexed one person through a folding table. Maybe this really is the future of wrestling.

In other Canadian music industry news this week, groups including SOCAN and Music Canada raise AI concerns.


	Lowell is embarking on a new creative partnership with Universal Music Canada.


	The Canadian songwriter and producer, born Elizabeth Lowell Boland, has struck up a strategic collaboration with the major label, fusing her creative knowledge and hitmaking prowess with UMC's A&R team.


	Lowell is a proven powerhouse in the music industry, working with artists like pop it-girls Beyoncé, Charli XCX, Tate McRae and homegrown talent including The Beaches, Lu Kala, Sofia Camara and more. From producing to writing to A&R, Lowell has a skilled hand in artist development.


	Lowell was a part of the Grammy-nominated songwriting behind Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter hits “Texas Hold ‘Em” and “Bodyguard,” and she helped pen Camara's charting hit “Girls Like You,” which has made waves across the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 and Billboard Canada airplay charts.


	“Universal Music Canada and I have been unofficially working together all the way back to our joint work with bülow, and more recently, Valley, Sofia Camara, and more. I'm so excited to be able to be even more involved with the team and all their amazing artists,” says Lowell.


	In this new partnership, Lowell will work alongside UMC's A&R team, led by Amanda Kingsland and Shawn Marino, who were named co-heads of A&R this year.


	“Her remarkable success as a songwriter and her ability to craft global hits speak volumes, but more than that, Lowell has an exceptional gift for finding and nurturing talent while helping artists grow into their best selves,” shares Kingsland.


	UMC's president & CEO Julie Adam (and Billboard Canada Women in Music Executive of the Year) emphasizes the label's renewed mandate to sign, develop and elevate the next generation of Canadian artists globally.


	“Lowell is a creative force,” says Adam. “Her incredible passion and fearless approach to music make her one of one. We exist to help artists achieve artistic and commercial success on a global stage out of Canada, and we are so excited, and grateful Lowell is joining us to supercharge that mission.”


	Lowell echoes a similar sentiment, detailing her excitement to work with Adam, calling them “kindred spirits,” as she embarks on this new journey.


	“I have so much respect for her, not only what she has already achieved in a short time in her position but what I know she will do moving forward,” she shared. “She has quickly shown me her uniquely immense respect for creatives, and in thinking outside of the box, which is imperative in this rapidly changing industry. Her willingness to grow and learn even from the top inspires me.”

	Mgk is headed to Winnipeg.


	The rapper and singer will headline this year's Grey Cup halftime show at Princess Auto Stadium on Nov. 16, the Canadian Football League (CFL) has announced.


	The Grammy-nominated hitmaker, born Colson Baker, is known for defying boundaries and crossing genres to reach fans of hip-hop, pop, rock and alternative — making him a prime performer for the football crowd. Mgk's work has been a success on the charts, with his most recent album, Lost Americana, reaching No. 9 on the Billboard Canadian Albums chart.


	“Canada has some of the best fans, so I'm excited to play the Grey Cup halftime show and to see some epic Canadian football,” the singer said in a statement.


	While the CFL's flagship game often includes Canadian performers, the last few years have seen American artists take the stage for halftime. Last year, the Jonas Brothers headlined the halftime show at the Grey Cup in Vancouver, while Green Day played the year before.


	It's clear Mgk has an affinity for Canada. In August, he played a surprise show at Toronto's Horseshoe Tavern, debuting a couple of unreleased tracks before his seventh studio album came out.


	Following his Grey Cup halftime show performance, Mgk kicks off his highly anticipated Lost Americana Tour in support of his seventh studio album of the same name, with stops in Calgary, Edmonton, Hamilton, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. Billboard Canada Women in Music Global Rising Star Julia Wolf will join for select dates.


	Joining Mgk as Grey Cup performers are Canadian alt-rockers Our Lady Peace, who are opening the festivities at the Grey Cup kickoff show, and emerging singer Catie St. Germain, who will perform the national anthem.


	“We're delivering a remarkable sound and atmosphere that will match the world-class action and entertainment on the field,” said CFL commissioner Stewart Johnston in a statement. “An iconic Canadian band to kick things off, a powerful Manitoban voice to honour our anthem and a rising megastar to electrify halftime. It's going to be a show as unforgettable as the game itself!”

	Music industry stakeholders are speaking up about AI before the Canadian House of Commons.


	On Wednesday, Oct. 8, representatives from some major music industry groups (SOCAN, Music Publishers Canada and Music Canada) appeared before the House of Commons' Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, which is studying the effects of technological advances in artificial intelligence on the creative industries.


	The committee is talking to many groups in the cultural and creative industries, but it is an especially hot topic within music, where the use of AI has exploded at a rapid rate.


	One of the people who spoke in Ottawa was Music Publishers Canada (MPC) CEO Margaret McGuffin.


	“The committee was very interested in hearing our perspectives,” she tells Billboard Canada. “Nearly every song ever written by a Canadian songwriter has already been scraped and stolen by these AI companies without consent, credit or compensation. Imagine that someone accessed your paycheque without permission and that this behaviour was normalized. This is an important issue for creators and businesses in the creative industries and it is wonderful that the Heritage Committee is listening.”


	SOCAN CEO Jennifer Brown also spoke at the hearings. Along with MPC, the organization has major concern for fair compensation and royalties for rightsholders.


	“The Standing Committee engaged in a good dialogue with the witnesses,” says Andrea Kokonis, SOCAN chief legal officer and general counsel.  “Jennifer Brown reinforced the importance of a healthy licensing market, as well as SOCAN's long-standing expertise in licensing and royalty distribution — across every new technology that's reshaped the music industry — positioning us to help ensure fair, practical solutions for both creators and AI companies.”


	To McGuffin and MPC, the current situation is alarming.


	“Unfortunately, the music industry has seen mass theft of copyright-protected songs by AI companies, both on the input side — for the purpose of training AI models — and output side — the development and publication of unlicensed generative AI models.”


	“This poses serious risks for Canada's creators and the companies that invest in them. To derive fair value for the use of this copyrighted material, the music publishing industry routinely grants licences to technology companies. AI developers should be no different. The emerging market for licensing music to AI developers should be encouraged, including by requiring AI companies to disclose and maintain records of all their training data,” she explains.

	Earlier this month, a woman named Katelynn Smoot shared a heartwarming video of her young daughter, who is battling cancer, watching the music video for Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia.” In the clip, little Lilah points at the screen and says, “That's my friend!”


	The video quickly went viral, with fans flooding Smoot's @standwithlilah social media page with messages of love and support for Lilah, who is fighting an aggressive form of brain cancer. Just a few weeks later, on Friday, Lilah received a touching surprise from her “friend” Swift — a $100,000 donation to her GoFundMe for medical care, and a sweet message: “Sending the biggest hug to my friend, Lilah! Love, Taylor.”

I cannot say thank you enough. I'm truly in shock. This means we don't have to worry about anything other than Lilah. Truly such a blessing. Thank you @Taylor Swift 


	The quiet donation from Swift, spotted by Swifties, has inspired other fans of the pop star to follow suit by contributing to the fundraiser, each in increments of $13, in honor of Swift's favorite number. As of publication, the fundraiser has raised over $167,000 in donations from more than 2,000 people.

	











	After the six-figure donation, Smoot shared a video of herself and Lilah dancing to “The Life of Ophelia,” reacting to the news and sharing their gratitude for Swift's generosity. “Thank you beyond words, Taylor Swift. We can now just focus on being here with our girl. Truly, we are so grateful… You have no idea what this means to our family,” she captioned the post.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	On the page, Smoot has shared her and her daughter's love for Swift — and how she birthed a “little Swiftie” after attending the Eras Tour while pregnant with her. “Lilah's name was originally going to be Willow,” Smoot explained in one video, referencing the Folklore favorite. “We were set on that name my whole pregnancy, but ultimately ended on Lilah.”

	On the GoFundMe, which has been running since Lilah started chemotherapy in March, Smoot explained baby Lilah was diagnosed with a “very rare aggressive form of brain cancer” earlier this year after suffering a seizure. An MRI found a stage 4 tumor, which was removed in March, and she has since been undergoing chemo. In an August update, the Smoots updated donors about the treatment.


	“After [an MRI and LP], she will start 6 weeks of proton radiation, where our family will have to travel to [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia] for her to receive,” they wrote. “We will be a few hundred miles away from home. All the donations we receive will help us with travel expenses and paying bills as we are still out of work while Lilah is in treatment.”

The metal band says an anonymous internet user has been using the domain to advertise counterfeit merchandise since 2001.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Slipknot says a cyber-squatter has been using the URL slipknot.com to advertise counterfeit merchandise for more than two decades — and the heavy metal band is now waging a legal battle in pursuit of the domain name.


	A federal lawsuit filed on Wednesday (Oct. 15) alleges that an anonymous web operator has held the domain slipknot.com since 2001. Unable to use this domain for Slipknot's official website, the famously masked metal band hosts its store on the clunkier URL slipknot1.com.


	Little is known about the slipknot.com cyber-squatter, other than the fact that they own a post office box in the Cayman Islands. The band, which has been recording music and touring since the 1990s, says this individual clearly had bad intentions from the outset.


	“The domain name was registered in an effort to profit off of plaintiff's goodwill and to trick unsuspecting visitors — under the impression they are visiting a website owned, operated or affiliated with plaintiff — into clicking on web searches and other sponsored links,” writes Slipknot's lawyer Craig Reilly.


	The lawsuit claims slipknot.com hosts pay-for-click advertising that directs users to counterfeit Slipknot merchandise, including versions of the band's signature masks, t-shirts and sweatshirts emblazoned with the band's trademarks. These sponsored links hurt sales of official Slipknot merch, the band alleges.


	“A fan of plaintiff or someone who otherwise wanted to purchase authorized Slipknot merchandise would undoubtedly visit the slipknot.com website assuming it belonged to plaintiff and then purchase the slipknot merchandise linked to on the site, causing damages to plaintiff,” writes Reilly.


	Slipknot is now bringing claims under the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, a 1999 federal statute that created a pathway for individuals to reclaim domain names through litigation. They're asking a judge to enter an injunction giving them ownership of slipknot.com.


	The case also accuses slipknot.com's unknown site operator of trademark infringement and unfair competition. Slipknot is seeking unspecified financial damages in addition to an injunction.


	A Slipknot rep did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday (Oct. 17).

A NASA scientist has offered perhaps the most sensible explanation as to why aliens have been ghosting us for all these years.

No matter what camp you're in - either you think aliens are real or aliens are not real - it is mad how unfathomably big the universe is without having any visitors.

Even if a handful of the 'UFO sightings' over the years were actually legit, surely it wouldn't take too long for a quick 'hello' or a nod. While Ridley Scott and others may portray aliens as frightening, it's uncertain what the reality might be.

Well, according to scientist Dr Robin Corbet, aliens are probably having these exact same thoughts about us.

The astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center reckons extraterrestrial civilizations may not be as technologically advanced as we make them look in the movies.

In his new research paper, 'A Less Terrifying Universe?', he says there is a 'lack of strong evidence for the presence of technology-using extraterrestrial civilizations (ETCs) in the Galaxy'.

This principle is also known as the 'Fermi paradox', where no species has 'achieved technology levels sufficient to accomplish large-scale astro-engineering or lack the desire to do so'.

"In the mundane perspective, where other civilizations are not that much more advanced, a limit to exploration would arise," he said.

Advert

For instance, if you take a look at a 'promising' location for life to exist, such as Proxima Centauri b, it would take 100,000 years for human beings to even reach it.

Dr Corbet hypothesises that aliens' tech isn't much better than ours, and the idea of sending out 'swarms of interstellar robotic probes' just isn't possible.

"The Fermi paradox may be explained if the galaxy contains a modest number of technological civilizations, with technology levels that, while more advanced than contemporary Earth, are nowhere near the 'super-science' levels that could result in readily detectable astro-engineering," Dr Corbet said in his paper.

Other scientists also reckon that aliens might actually be scared of us, which sort of makes sense.

Advert

The fact that a human-made nuclear war could wipe out the planet in a matter of minutes must be a scary sight if you're watching from another planet.

Dr Gordon Gallup, a biopsychologist at the University of Albany, said in a 2022 paper: "If there is intelligent life elsewhere, they may view humans as extremely dangerous.

"Maybe this is why there is no proof or compelling evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence.

"We pose too great a risk, and they do not want to be discovered."

You can just imagine the conversation: "Fancy a trip to Earth?"

"Pollution, greed, wars, traffic, waste, lies, politics, nah I'm good thanks pal," is how I think it would go down.

A private company at a high-powered Army conference demonstrated a unique aircraft at the event — and allegedly took responsibility for setting off last year's drone and “UFO” pandemonium in New Jersey, a source told The Post.

At the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August, a private contractor conducted a live demonstration of a manned aerial craft that wowed the crowd with its unconventional appearance and unorthodox flight-movements, an attendee told The Post.

“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” an employee of the unnamed contractor claimed to a small group after the demonstration, according to the source who was invited to the summit.

The company was in the air over the Garden State in November 2024 to “test out their capabilities,” the contractor's employee claimed to the source — adding they were not required to disclose their activity to the public because of a private government contract.

In video provided to The Post, the roughly 20-foot across four-winged flier zooms through the skies just above the tree-line, drawing the attention of dozens of soldiers on the ground.

“I thought it was the military testing something out on the other side of the base,” the source, a military veteran and drone expert, said of their first impression of the flying object on Aug. 12 at Fort Rucker. 

“It feels like it's a UFO because it defies what you're expecting to see,” they said, adding there was an “uncanny valley feeling” when watching it quietly motor through the sky.

“When it turned you almost completely lose sight of it,” the source said, of the roughly 30-minute demonstration in the controlled airspace of Fort Rucker.

“Which is why I think people were seeing this up in the sky and why there were reports of people seeing it and saying it disappeared.”

All conference attendees were approved by brass at Fort Rucker, which enacted strict rules for participation, including the exclusion of any drone or craft containing any Chinese-made parts, the source revealed.

“It would definitely have to be cleared,” they said, adding, “Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that.”

Fort Rucker, which is the headquarters for the Army's Aviation Branch, could not be reached for comment. 

The rash of supposed drone sightings in New Jersey began on Nov. 13, 2024 over Army base Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and continued across the state through early December.

President Trump's Federal Aviation Administration announced in January that many of the reports of mystery drones were hobbyists, recreational pilots, and private individuals.

A private company at a high-powered Army conference demonstrated a unique aircraft at the event — and allegedly took responsibility for setting off last year's drone and “UFO” pandemonium in New Jersey, a source told The Post.

At the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August, a private contractor conducted a live demonstration of a manned aerial craft that wowed the crowd with its unconventional appearance and unorthodox flight-movements, an attendee told The Post.

“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” an employee of the unnamed contractor claimed to a small group after the demonstration, according to the source who was invited to the summit.

The company was in the air over the Garden State in November 2024 to “test out their capabilities,” the contractor's employee claimed to the source — adding they were not required to disclose their activity to the public because of a private government contract.

In video provided to The Post, the roughly 20-foot across four-winged flier zooms through the skies just above the tree-line, drawing the attention of dozens of soldiers on the ground.

“I thought it was the military testing something out on the other side of the base,” the source, a military veteran and drone expert, said of their first impression of the flying object on Aug. 12 at Fort Rucker. 

“It feels like it's a UFO because it defies what you're expecting to see,” they said, adding there was an “uncanny valley feeling” when watching it quietly motor through the sky.

“When it turned you almost completely lose sight of it,” the source said, of the roughly 30-minute demonstration in the controlled airspace of Fort Rucker.

“Which is why I think people were seeing this up in the sky and why there were reports of people seeing it and saying it disappeared.”

All conference attendees were approved by brass at Fort Rucker, which enacted strict rules for participation, including the exclusion of any drone or craft containing any Chinese-made parts, the source revealed.

“It would definitely have to be cleared,” they said, adding, “Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that.”

Fort Rucker, which is the headquarters for the Army's Aviation Branch, could not be reached for comment. 

The rash of supposed drone sightings in New Jersey began on Nov. 13, 2024 over Army base Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and continued across the state through early December.

President Trump's Federal Aviation Administration announced in January that many of the reports of mystery drones were hobbyists, recreational pilots, and private individuals.

It's a grave new ranking for New York.

The Empire State is officially the most haunted state in America, a spine-chilling new study found. 

Researchers from Casino.ca pinpointed the most common spots for phantom sightings by analyzing more than 1.8 million Ghosts of America records — a series of books and related websites for paranormal stories — over the past century, plus reports from social media platforms like Facebook, TikTok, X and online forums.

New York racked up a hair-raising 160,198 spirit encounters — or about 81 run-ins per 10,000 residents — over the last 100 years, researchers found. 

“New York seems to have the perfect mix of history and atmosphere to keep spirits lingering,” said data analyst Katt Rodrigues. “It's not entirely surprising given the state's deep history and countless older buildings with stories of their own.”

The spookiest spot in the state is Manhattan's storied Morris-Jumel Mansion, which was built in 1765 and is famous for being the borough's oldest house.

The Washington Heights property at 65 Jumel Terrace, which is now a museum, has hosted historic legends from first US president George Washington and third vice president Aaron Burr to jazz music icon Duke Ellington along with, apparently, a few guests who never left. 

Paranormal Investigations NYC founder and director Dom Villella didn't see any spirits during an hours-long visit to the mansion in October 2009 — but he felt them, he told The Post. 

“I felt very uneasy there. You know when you walk into a room and the room's just got a really heavy feeling to it, and the energy feels weird? That's the Morris-Jumel Mansion. You walk in there and you just feel very uncomfortable until you leave,” he said.

“In my opinion, what you feel at the mansion is residual energy — it's not literally haunted, it's just replaying energy of people who were there over time. Structures, especially old buildings, will absorb the energies of people who spend a lot of time there, and if the conditions are perfect, it will replay it,” explained Villella, who has investigated more than 1,000 buildings in Manhattan since 2003.

“I think that's probably why people see images or hear voices there. And especially because of all the artifacts that [the mansion] contains, it's more likely to have that residual energy replaying,” he continued, and noting his electromagnetic field detectors got “high readings” at the mansion.

The landmark has frequently been cited in paranormal cycles and is rumored by spirit seekers to house five distinct ghosts, researchers noted.

Overall, nearly one in four Americans claim to have seen a ghost over the past century, with a bone-chilling 1.84 million encounters logged nationwide, or about 2,329 per 10,000 residents.

Texas ranked second for spirit spottings, with 77 encounters per 10,000 people, followed by Louisiana (74), California (72) and Utah (65). 

Ghost run-ins were hauntingly less common north of the border. 

Yukon led Canada with 39 sightings per 10,000 residents, followed by British Columbia (34), Ontario (33) and Alberta (32).

As online debate has become more about flaming the opposition than ever before, pouncing on the individual themselves can be more significant than the fact that they saw a flying saucer in the sky.

A cannonade of comments, though, may not be the worst thing, as when a UFO sighting gains online traction, it moves to the top of social media and gets more attention.

Devoted outlets like MUFON (exclusive to UFOs), The War Zone (primarily for military and defense), and The Galileo Project (scientific research) back up the cause with content.

And as for the sharer, the focus needn't be on whether they believe you or not, but how to capitalize on their content, like other influencers and social media figures.

We sounded out Barna Donovan, a professor of communications and media culture at Saint Peter's University in New Jersey, to get his two cents on the topic.

Firstly, like any other market, the algorithm feeds the hunger. As Donovan points out, the idea is to “produce as much content as possible” to feed the attention market.

But Donovan sees a conundrum. 

“Along with the appetite for stories of possible alien contact comes a wariness over online hoaxes and misinformation,” he said.

For the mainstream news consumer, UFO stories remain a weird niche and would have to be aired on primetime by the big players to warrant their attention.


Those trying to decide which claims of alien content are believable will tend to take stories more seriously if they are also given attention by mainstream media outlets. A UFO story featured on CNN or Fox or any of the broadcast networks will carry more weight with viewers.


For more vertical discussions into sightings, coverups, and whistleblower accounts, there's a whole treasure trove of content available.

The Why Files, for example, with over five million subscribers, follows its own unique trajectory to grant license to the viewer to make their own mind up.

“The usual format of each show begins with an overview of an alleged paranormal phenomenon, but then midway through the show, Gentile adds his signature line, ‘But is any of this true?'” Donovan explains.

When whistleblowers themselves feel a sense of disclosure fatigue, it can be down to channels like The Why Files or Jeremy Corbell's Weaponized podcast. These podcasts have featured prominent whistleblowers like David Grusch and Matthew Brown, whose immaculate constellation document revealed the Pentagon's secret UFO program.

Audience members who are rewarded are those who exhibit a kind of interactive skepticism and do not get too bogged down in a tangent on a Reddit thread.

For Donovan, UFO coverage now blurs genres. 

“Journalists doing stories about claims of alien contact will, up to a point, be entertainers, or perhaps infotainers, aware of the popularity of UFO stories.” 

After all, they might be writing for a True Crime audience, who appreciate their stories a bit noir.

On The Proof Is Out There, for example, UFOs are a cornerstone topic alongside other paranormal ones. Popular episodes include jellyfish UFO sightings and spaceships almost colliding with planes at airports. The show has also pointed out hoaxes, too, by using scientists and special effects experts.

The strategy seems to be to straddle science-heavy explainers and mystical ingredients so curiosity can be satisfied, especially when those in office aren't giving the game away. Call it half enquiry, half showmanship.


In truth, only a flying saucer landing on the White House lawn or a gigantic mothership hovering over a major city for all to see will constitute incontrovertible proof...


Credibility can be lost, and trust bottoms out with the circulation of fake content, as was the case in 2023 with Reddit's beloved r/UFO subreddit. VFX artists created two elaborate videos, later named “the Reddit UFO” and “Tesla UFO,” with the latter so meticulous that it had many fooled.

Still, the belief economy endures, and witness recognition seems poised for a bigger breakout.

“The truth about aliens is still out there,” Donovan says, “and the work of fraudsters or sloppy journalists won't deter true believers.” Most often, it isn't what you say, but how you say it.

Have you ever thought about who the internet is? Or who owns the internet? It is very interesting to learn about such conspiracy theories, which often revolve on Reddit. “Google is the internet.” That is a bold belief floating around a recent Reddit thread on r/IndiaTech, and it is the kind of statement that makes you pause mid-scroll. The conversation started when user @limsus shared a tweet by X user Arin Verma, and it is a doozy.

Verma laid out the case like a tech manifesto: Google owns 14% of Anthropic, 8% of SpaceX, runs AI platforms like Gemini, powers Claude with its own TPU chips, dominates search with 90% of global queries, and runs YouTube. Oh, and it also controls Android, manages ads, email, cloud, and browsers, while quietly mapping the world via Google Maps. “Google is the internet,” Verma highlighted.

Cue the Redditors with a sense of perspective and humour. One commenter pointed out that TATA Communications runs one of the largest fibre optic networks in the world, carrying perhaps a quarter of global internet traffic. “If they shut down, Google will have to mail your search results by post :P” they quipped. The comment garnered laughs, but it also pinpoints an important truth: what we see online may not be the whole story.

The thread quickly turned into a debate about what “the internet” really is. Google's reach is undeniably massive and shaping what billions see, search for, and watch daily. But the physical backbone—the cables, servers, and networks that make our instant access possible, is a far less glamorous world, run by telecoms, data centres, and undersea fibre.

It is a classic case of perception vs. reality. For most of us, Google feels like the internet. We search, stream, navigate, and communicate through its ecosystem. But take a step back, and the internet is a sprawling, distributed beast, powered by countless invisible hands and yes, even companies you have probably never heard of.

In the end, the Reddit discussion is not just about tech stats or corporate power. It is a reminder of how deeply intertwined our digital lives are with a few dominant players and how much of the magic behind the scenes may go unnoticed.

While both claims are unverified, these Reddit theories could lay the foundation for strong possibilities.

Candace Owens has been trying to get to the bottom of who she believes assassinated Charlie Kirk.

Along the way, she has put out many conspiracy theories, and has offered up a new one, RadarOnline.comcan confirm.

On the latest episode of Candace, Owens alleged there's new evidence that raises questions as to what truly transpired on the day Kirk was murdered.

"We were told that Charlie had healthy bones, and it was a miracle that his spine stopped a bullet," she claimed. "I can now officially debunk that story."

Owens went on to discuss media reports claiming Kirk had briefly survived due to his strength and bone density, disputing those assertions.

She also insisted investigators had gotten key facts about the case wrong, putting doubt on the type of weapon that was allegedly used to murder Kirk.

"The idea that it was a .30-06 just didn't happen," she claimed, regarding the rifle police claimed Tyler Robinson used to shoot Kirk.

"That means he was shot with a completely different kind of gun," she alleged.

Owens also discussed witness statements and official records she feels leave gaps in the investigation.

"It looks likely there were two people with weapons that day, someone in the audience and someone positioned elsewhere," she claimed. "And one of the supposed witnesses worked in local law enforcement. Why was she at the event in the middle of a workday?"

Owens then turned her topic to the FBI and her issues with how they've handled the investigation surrounding Kirk's death.

"They look at us as if we're nothing and say, 'What are you going to do about it?'" she shared. "You wanted to traumatize us and then look us in the face and go, 'How dare you ask questions?' People are grieving. Yeah, we're grieving because you assassinated Charlie Kirk in front of the entire world."

Next, Owens addressed what she feels are contradictions in the medical paperwork regarding Kirk's death.

"Charlie's neck did stop the bullet, and a fragment was recovered from his neck. They didn't recover a .30-06 round, that's simply not reflected on the death certificate," she claimed.

As RadarOnline.comreported, Owens has been accused of "profiting" off Kirk's death as she continues to spew her conspiracy theories.

After one of her latest theories involving an Egyptian plane, an X user shared the following: "She's obviously not all there, but all of this is also malicious and calculated."

"No single person has made more money profiting off Charlie Kirk's death than Candace Owens. All based on lies," they added.

Another X user accused the controversial conservative commentator of grifting, writing, "She's grifting hard to pay for her legal defense in the Macron case. They are seeking punitive damages, and there is a good chance she'll lose. Expect her to try and sell more merch and continue with the wild podcasts. Her actions with Charlie's murder will be used against her in the Macron case. She's desperate, and she will be humbled."

Owens is currently the throes of a lawsuit brought on by Brigitte and Emmanuel Macron after her insistence that Brigitte was born a man and transitioned to a woman.

Ace Frehley was told he'd live to be 100 years old in the months before his death at age 74.

“Luckily, I have good genes. My dad lived to be 96 and my mom lived to be 86, but her older sister lived to be 99,” the founding KISS member and guitarist told the Aquarian in March 2025. “I mean, we have longevity in the family on both sides.”

He added, “‘I just spoke to a psychic. She goes, ‘Ace, you're going to live to be a hundred.' So I said, ‘No problem!”‘

Frehley divulged during the interview that a previous injury had presented challenges to his musical career.

“I hurt my arm about two-and-a-half years ago — I fell down a flight of stairs,” he divulged. 

“It's been a struggle because I landed on my right arm, and that's the arm that I strum with when I play guitar,” Frehley continued. “So it feels great to get up onstage because I wasn't sure if it was ever going to get back to the way it used to be.” 

The iconic guitarist died on Thursday, his family confirmed in a statement.

“We are completely devastated and heartbroken. In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth,” the statement read.

“We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!”

The rocker's former bandmates from KISS, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, released a heartfelt joint statement following the news of Frehley's passing.

“We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley,” they wrote. “He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history.” 

“He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy,” the statement continued. “Our thoughts are with [his estranged wife] Jeanette, [daughter] Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.”

An official cause of death has not been disclosed. The glam metal rocker had reportedly been placed on life support in the hours leading up to his death. 

According to TMZ, the musician suffered a fall in his studio a couple of weeks ago, resulting in a brain bleed. The outlet reported that though Frehley had been on a ventilator, his condition had not improved, leading family to consider taking him off life support.

On Oct. 6, Frehley had nixed all remaining 2025 shows on his tour due to “ongoing medical issues,” an Instagram announcement read. 

The hitmaker founded the iconic band alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. After nine years with the flamboyant group, Frehley left the band in 1982 — only to return for their 1996 reunion tour. Frehley continued on with KISS for six additional years, until 2002.

By East Texas A&M Marketing and Communications

From campus legends to congressional hearings, East Texas A&M's fascination with UFOs spans decades of wonder, debate and discovery. 

This feature is part of East Texas A&M's annual October Spooky Stories Series. Stay tuned for more eerie tales and campus curiosities throughout the month.



“These flying saucer stories are getting bigger and better all the time,” proclaimed an article in the March 31, 1950, issue of East Texas A&M's student newspaper. Indeed, whether it's 1950 or 2025, or somewhere in between, students, faculty and the community have long been curious about mysteries hidden in the night sky.

East Texas A&M hasn't shied away from the topic of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over the years. The university has hosted scientific experts, offered astronomy and chemistry courses that explore life beyond Earth, and provided a platform for speculation about what might be out there.

In March 1950, before the term “UFO” was widely used, The East Texan published the article referenced above called, “Students Offer Explanations for Flying Saucers.” In it, students shared their theories about UFOs. Some thought they were government experiments, while others speculated they were visitors from another solar system. One student's reply was simply, “They're watching us.”

Less than a month later, in April 1950, The East Texan published another article on the subject. Titled “Saucer Theories Include ‘The Impossible,'” the article theorized that perhaps Hollywood was to blame for flying saucers, or carefully thrown hubcaps, or “Texas mosquitos fitted with neon lights and radar screens,” or simply hallucinatory tricks of the mind.

The article even mentioned a Texas farmer who claimed flying saucers sprayed his land with kerosene to help keep the bugs away. How kind of the aliens to turn the man's farm into a blazing inferno waiting to happen!

These varied—and often wild—explanations continue in 2025. Conversations on campus reveal that modern students hold various opinions about what UFOs might be—from aliens and government projects to natural phenomena.

It's not just students who have speculated about UFOs over the years at East Texas A&M. There have also been educational pursuits with links to UFOs and alien life.

Like any field of study, ufology (the study of UFOs) has its share of experts. In this age of easy media, when documentaries and clickbait videos about UFOs are as common as hot days in a Texas summer, the experts can be hard to differentiate from the charlatans. But East Texas A&M has, in fact, been visited by a few prominent figures from the world of ufology.

Though Roswell, New Mexico, has long been the site of the most well-known UFO incident, the Lone Star State is no stranger to happenings of a similar nature.

In fact, according to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), there are 6,583 UFO report entries for Texas alone. Four of those reports come from Commerce, the most recent in 2013, when someone lounging by their swimming pool one night claimed to have seen two stars flying side by side across the sky.

Here are some of the more prominent UFO cases in Texas:

At East Texas A&M and beyond, people often see things in the sky they do not understand. Even today, there is regular testimony in front of Congress from former military personnel about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP)—the latest hot term in this field of study, which is meant to be a broader term that encompasses more than just objects in the sky.

Dr. Curt Carlson, professor in the Department of Psychology and Special Education at ETAMU, who has conducted research into eyewitness memory for over 20 years, feels that unreliable memories may be to blame for some reports.

“The fundamental principles of memory that apply to eyewitnesses of crimes would also apply to eyewitnesses of UFOs,” Carlson said. “For example, if reporting a UFO sighting from many years ago, memory has become too contaminated since the original event to be trustworthy.”

Taking into account more recent sightings, Carlson continued, “As for an eyewitness reporting a UFO sighting from just a day ago, false memory is not as significant an issue. But misperception of common objects as UFOs certainly is.” 

Indeed, many of the reports on the NUFORC website come in mere days, if not hours, after the alleged events occurred. So, is it possible that so many people are just misinterpreting what they see in the sky?

Quarles thinks there may be another explanation besides misidentification.

“Sure, some of the sightings are probably misidentified natural phenomena,” he said. “And some are going to be satellites and drones. But I suspect much of it is secret military projects. Obviously, for something secret, the military can't just come out and say it's us.”

If some, maybe even all, UFO sightings can be explained by misinterpretation, the fog of memory and secret government projects, does that mean aliens don't exist?

Not necessarily.

“Microbes of some kind probably exist elsewhere in the universe,” Quarles said. “But aliens up and around talking like us…who knows. It's possible, but communication across vast distances would be so difficult, we're not even sure it can be done. The closest star outside of our Sun is four light-years away. We'd be better served, for now, looking for evidence of life on Mars.”

So, what do we do with this information?

The question of UFOs and aliens has been something people have wrestled with for many years. Even at East Texas A&M, the topic has occasionally arisen for at least three-quarters of a century, likely longer.

And the discussion will most assuredly continue for many more years—at least until flying saucers land on the White House lawn—or maybe the Great Lawn at East Texas A&M—in grand Hollywood fashion.

(NewsNation) — A documentary that says it reveals a long-standing government cover-up of UFOs will be released on Amazon Prime on Nov. 21.

“The Age of Disclosure,” which originally premiered at the South by Southwest film festival, will also have a limited release in theaters in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., beginning on the same date.

Directed by Dan Farah, the film includes interviews with current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community.

Those featured in the film include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, retired Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet and former Pentagon employee Lue Elizondo.

The documentary made a splash when it premiered, highlighting what it says is an 80-year cover-up by the government to conceal the existence of UFOs and extraterrestrial life and efforts to reverse-engineer alien technology. 

The film includes shocking moments, including former Defence Intelligence Agency officer Jay Stratton saying that he has seen nonhuman craft and nonhuman beings.

Rubio also notes the secretive nature of the project, saying in the film that even presidents are not fully read into the program and are briefed on a need-to-know basis. 

UFOs have been a subject of fascination in recent years and a rare bipartisan issue for Congress, where an informal UAP Caucus has held hearings over the possibility of secret UFO programs.

Farah worked on the film for three years in secret, interviewing what he says are high-level, credible sources on the subject. 

Critics have noted that the film does not attempt to corroborate the statements made by the interviewees, taking the statements they make at face value.

The Pentagon has repeatedly denied the existence of any secret UAP-retrieval programs and says there is no evidence that unexplained sightings are extraterrestrial in nature.
