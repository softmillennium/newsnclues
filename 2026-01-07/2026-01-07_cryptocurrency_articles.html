                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wyoming's Frontier Stable Token (FRNT) is now available to the public, marking the first state-issued stablecoin in the United States. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selected Franklin Templeton to manage the token's reserves, with affiliate Fiduciary Trust Company International serving as custodian. Franklin Templeton, which manages over $1.6 trillion in assets, brings expertise in both traditional finance and digital assets to the partnership. While the firm has significant blockchain experience, having launched the first tokenized money market fund issued by an incumbent asset manager and operating nodes on multiple blockchain networks, its role for FRNT focuses on conventional reserves management. The firm's fixed income division oversees reserves invested in US dollars and short duration US Treasuries. While the commission originally announced FRNT would launch across seven blockchain networks – Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and Solana – the token is initially accessible only through two intermediary platforms. Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken offers FRNT on the Solana blockchain, while Rain, which provides a Visa powered card platform, supports the token on Avalanche. Want the full story?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities in Cambodia just caught up with Asia's biggest alleged crypto criminal. The report comes after Zhi and Prince Group, the multinational where he acts as chair, have faced a heightened crackdown from authorities in recent months. In October, US authorities, including the Department of Justice's National Security Division, filed a civil forfeiture complaint for 127,271 Bitcoin tied to Zhi, worth approximately $15 billion at the time. Later that month, the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control updated its sanctions list with 25 new crypto wallet addresses belonging to Zhi that contain some $780 million worth of Bitcoin. Since approximately 2015, he has acted as the chair of Prince Group, which operates dozens of businesses in more than 30 countries. International authorities and human rights groups say the multinational runs and oversees dozens of forced labour scam compounds across Southeast Asia. Victims are lured to the compounds, often with offers of well-paid jobs in IT and administration. Pig butchering scams involve criminals building deep trust with victims through fake online relationships before convincing them to invest heavily in fake crypto or investment platforms and then stealing all their money. The funds stolen through these scams are then laundered through a complex network of over 100 shell and holding companies worldwide, according to a press release from the US Treasury Department. In 2024, criminals stole over $4 billion through pig butchering scams, a 40% increase from 2023, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain security firm. Victims interviewed by the human rights organisation reported slavery, human trafficking, child labour, and torture being carried out by criminal gangs running the compounds on a vast scale. Zhi's arrest will likely deal a significant blow to these operations. Tim Craig is DL News' Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grvt (pronounced Gravity), a hyper-scalable crypto exchange, has announced the launch of Grvt Institute, an education-focused initiative aimed at improving global crypto and blockchain literacy. As its first program, Grvt Institute is rolling out a crypto literacy pilot in South Korea in partnership with the Korea Insurance Institute, one of the country's leading financial education bodies. Designed around a professional certification model, the pilot program in South Korea will offer offline, cohort-based education open to retail participants regardless of prior experience. Grvt, which recently raised $19 million in Series A funding to scale privacy-focused on-chain finance, plans to expand the initiative into a global online curriculum following the initial offline cohorts. The broader objective is to lower barriers to crypto and blockchain adoption by emphasizing foundational knowledge, disciplined risk awareness, and practical security education. Global adoption of crypto and blockchain technology has moved faster than education, leaving many users without a clear grasp of core concepts such as blockchain mechanics, self-custody, and risk management. This gap has contributed to avoidable losses, poor decision-making, and weakened public trust in the sector. Grvt Institute was created to address this imbalance through neutral, foundational education that prioritizes understanding over speculation. Developed in partnership with trusted institutions such as the Korea Insurance Institute, the curriculum combines blockchain fundamentals with established financial risk-management principles. South Korea was chosen as the launch market due to its high level of digital adoption and strong engagement with emerging financial technologies. Through its partnership with the Korea Insurance Institute, Grvt Institute combines blockchain-focused expertise with long-standing experience in financial education and consumer protection. The curriculum focuses on blockchain fundamentals, key digital asset categories, market structure, and risk awareness. Grvt Institute aims to function as foundational educational infrastructure for a safer and more sustainable digital asset ecosystem. Grvt's view is that responsible, long-term adoption of crypto and blockchain technology requires as much investment in public understanding as in technological development. “Crypto and DeFi represent a meaningful shift in how financial systems can work, but technology alone is not enough,” said Hong Yea, co-founder and CEO of Grvt. Grvt Institute is our commitment to helping people understand what crypto and blockchain actually are, how to use them safely, and how they can create real value beyond speculation.” CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move extends JPMorgan's digital cash beyond its existing internal infrastructure and onto a public blockchain designed for institutional use. The initiative follows JPMorgan's recent pilot deploying JPM Coin on Coinbase's Base network for institutional clients. Bank executives have said the token will roll out across multiple public blockchains over time, with Canton becoming another pillar in that multi-chain approach. The Canton Network is a public, permissionless layer-one blockchain built for institutional finance. Unlike bank-specific ledgers, Canton is designed as a neutral settlement layer where multiple institutions can transact across asset classes. By bringing JPM Coin onto Canton, JPMorgan and Digital Asset are attempting to solve a long-standing limitation of bank-issued tokens: isolation. Tokens that live only on internal ledgers restrict interoperability with tokenized securities, onchain collateral, and other blockchain-based workflows. Under the plan, JPM Coin will be issued, transferred, and redeemed directly on Canton rather than bridged in from private systems. The partners are taking a phased approach through 2026, beginning with technical integration and business frameworks that allow near-instant settlement onchain. Unlike permissionless stablecoins, JPM Coin remains a regulated deposit liability of JPMorgan. Transfers will operate within institutional compliance standards, but execution and settlement occur on a public blockchain rather than through legacy clearing systems. The goal is to let regulated cash interact directly with tokenized assets, margin workflows, and atomic settlement models. Demand for onchain money is rising from both crypto-native firms and traditional companies experimenting with tokenized assets. Institutions want cash that settles instantly, remains available outside banking hours, and fits within existing regulatory expectations. Public blockchains offer speed and interoperability, but institutions have been reluctant to rely solely on third-party stablecoins. JPMorgan's approach offers an alternative: deposit-backed digital cash that stays within the banking system while operating on public rails. Interest in its native Canton Coin has risen alongside speculation about its role as a settlement asset within institutional decentralized finance-style workflows, though the network's focus remains on infrastructure rather than retail activity. Further details on transaction volumes, regulatory scope, and client adoption have not yet been disclosed. If successful, the Canton deployment would place JPM Coin alongside other public blockchain pilots and reinforce a wider shift in market structure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When a Bitcoin owner wants to generate yield from their holdings, they typically go to a third party. That middleman is usually a stablecoin issuer or exchange like Tether or Coinbase that allows the holder to swap their Bitcoin for collateral—in the form of stablecoin or wrapped BTC—to be used in lending protocols like Aave. Now a Stanford professor named David Tse is promoting a new alternative to those systems. Tse is the co-founder of a startup called Babylon that has created a decentralized protocol, called BTCVaults, which offers users a more direct way to collateralize their Bitcoin. Tse did not disclose Babylon's valuation in an interview with Fortune. There are certain downsides when Bitcoin owners send their holdings to a third party, Tse says. Tse views his company's competition as the centralized services like Coinbase, Kraken, and Tether. For now, Babylon does not generate revenue but hopes to after the launch with Aave. The company currently has more than 40 employees. David Tse co-founded Babylon in 2021 with Fisher Yu. He has a PhD from MIT and taught at UC-Berkeley for 18 years. Deliverables in academia, he says, are research papers, which he equates to pieces of artwork that can only be admired by a few people. “A startup is the natural way of converting research, innovation, and ideas into a product that people can use,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Internet Computer has been expanding its utilities, with chainkey fusion technology attracting new liquidity to DeFi, and Caffeine dApp helping to burn millions of tokens in recent weeks. DeepSnitch AI is creating a new platform concept that blends AI with on-chain analytics, turning into one of the most promising projects for 2026. This presale already surpassed $1.1 million in funding, and being a relatively new crypto, it offers significant long-term upside with 100x potential. For many investors, it's the best altcoin to buy now. For a long time, many blockchains sacrificed one aspect to prioritize others, like Bitcoin prioritizes security and decentralization, but is slow. The advantage of Ethereum overcoming this scalability trilemma is that it becomes the only blockchain that can scale to billions of users, without sacrificing decentralization, speed, or security, growing to a trillion-dollar valuation. With the biggest challenge resolved, Vitalik believes Ethereum is ready to go to the next level, creating a new roadmap for ETH to advance towards global adoption by 2030, involving businesses, banks, and even governments. Goldman Sachs is predicting in its latest report that the S&P500 index will surpass 7,600 points in 2026, driven by macroeconomic acceleration and AI adoption. Considering that the AI ​​sector currently represents 40% of the index, artificial intelligence should play a significant role in global economic growth this year. DeepSnitch AI is building an advanced platform that uses artificial intelligence to track several on-chain activities, creating real-time reports to help traders with information about tokens, projects, or even to anticipate market movements. But it's still possible to pay a low price to invest in this AI project that offers great upside in the long term (only $0.03269). So, if the entire AI sector really explodes in 2026, and even the S&P 500 hits record highs because of it, new projects like DeepSnitch AI could reasonably rise 100x. That's why this is undoubtedly one of the best altcoins to buy now. Grok stated that ICP is his pick for the 2026 bull run. The message was a reply in a thread, and Grok explained that his choice was based on the fact that Internet Computer offers decentralized cloud storage (competing against AWS and Google Drive), smart contracts, while also building AI on blockchain (running AI directly in canisters). Being the only blockchain capable of running everything from websites to dApps, 100% on-chain, Internet Computer (ICP) is currently seen as one of the most undervalued altcoins. After several days of decline, it reclaimed key horizontal support at $3.00, and the price is now holding above this level at $3.25. Its next major resistance is at $3.49, and surpassing this level will likely initiate a new upward rally to $4.50 and then upwards to $10. Also, the recent partnership with Xiaomi makes SEI a promising altcoin for 2026, as its wallet will be installed on millions of new Xiaomi smartphones sold starting this month. This gives SEI very interesting long-term potential, making it one of the best altcoins to buy now. If it manages to break through its resistance at $0.14, it will form a bullish pattern, with the next target at $0.255 (a potential 100% increase). Internet Computer is becoming a full-fledged blockchain with numerous features. Both are promising Layer 1 blockchains, but their high market cap limits explosive gains for investors. For those seeking opportunities with 100x potential, DeepSnitch AI is the best altcoin to buy now. Because it's still in presale, it offers investors the chance to pay a low price for a project with much more upside potential in 2026. DeepSnitch AI blends artificial intelligence with on-chain analytics and is still in presale. Its early stage, fast growth, and AI focus make it one of the most promising high-upside crypto projects for 2026. Among the best altcoins to buy, DeepSnitch AI looks more promising because it is a project that mixes artificial intelligence with crypto. Also, being still in presale, it offers much higher growth potential than established large-cap altcoins. DeepSnitch AI is newer, offers greater upside, and has a realistic 100x potential due to its early presale stage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market succumbed to a wave of selling pressure during the Asia session, prompting a drop to about $91,530 at 10:00 a.m. UTC from around a local high of $93,750 at midnight. Bitcoin is now trading firmly back in December's range, which saw various spikes between $85,000 and $94,500, even as it extended the decline that started in October. Wednesday's drop reflects a rise in risk-off sentiment from traders. Exchanges have liquidated crypto futures bets worth $465 million over the past 24 hours, with longs accounting for over 50% of the tally. Still, cumulative open interest (OI) in crypto futures listed worldwide remains steady above $143 billion, the highest in nearly two months, with moderately positive funding rates indicating a bullish positioning. OI in XRP, DOGE, SUI and ZEC fell 5%-6%. This is likely linked to profit-taking following recent price surges in these tokens. Still, overall positioning remains light compared with a year ago, when OI stood at above 191K BTC. On Deribit, put skews for BTC and ETH continue to weaken, although bullishness is yet to emerge. BTC block flows show a mixed profile, with strangles suggesting a bullish volatility bias and call spreads indicating upside price expectations. In ETH's case, straddle, also a volatility strategy, was the most preferred play. Memecoins and privacy coins were Wednesday's two worst performing sectors, with zcash (ZEC) leading the privacy plight, dropping by 4.5% since midnight UTC. CoinDesk's Memecoin Index (CDMEME) fell 1.5%, about twice as much as the CoinDesk 5 index, which measures the price of BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL and ADA.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SUI and XRP price have surged over the past seven days, with double-digit gains since the beginning of January, as fresh capital continues to flow into altcoins while Bitcoin remains above $92,500. The total crypto market cap added just over $250Bn in less than a week, since 2026 began. According to CoinGecko, over the week, SUI is up about +31%, and is up about +21%, surpassing Bitcoin's +5% gain in the same period. This move comes as traders shift from a Bitcoin-only mindset toward higher-risk altcoins, trying to front-run what many analysts believe is an upcoming ‘altcoin season'. has shown strong resilience and a modest bounce after falling to $85,000 at the end of 2025, and is now up around 10% from there, currently trading above $92,500, prompting some traders to take profits and seek further upside in altcoins. and XRP faster, as investors seek out promising major-cap tokens with smaller market caps than Bitcoin in search of bigger gains. So far, that play is working out, as both SUI and XRP price are up around 3-4x more than BTC USD since the beginning of 2026. Sui is a newer Layer-1 blockchain that launched in 2023 and can be thought of as another protocol similar to Solana or Avalanche. Developers recently pushed a significant upgrade: the Beluga Consensus Improvement, which is designed to process more transactions more efficiently, according to OKX. Additionally, XRP spot ETFs remain a popular investment choice among retail investors, attracting over $1.15Bn in inflows since their launch in November 2025, according to CoinGlass data. (SOURCE:BlockchainCenter.net) Short answer: not yet, but the pieces are lining up. The Altcoin Season Index now tilts toward a more pro-altcoin environment, according to BlockchainCenter.net, and meme coins and AI tokens already reacted first, with some AI names like Render posting +80% weekly gains. That behavior indicates traders feel more comfortable with risk again. Then, large-cap altcoins like XRP price rise, driven by factors such as ETF inflows and CME derivatives. After that, newer Layer-1 chains, such as SUI, and rivals like Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano begin to attract flows as traders bet on the “next big base chain.” So what does this mean for your wallet today? It shows that money is no longer parked solely in BTC USD. Traders are willing to move into coins with clear stories: payments for XRP, fast smart contracts for Sui, and emerging viral memes such as WHITEWHALE, rather than random small caps with no momentum. What's the Smart Way to Play This Without Getting Rekt? This is the risky part of any potential bullish market cycle. Now, double-digit daily moves feel great when the candles are green, but those same gains when going down can come just as fast. Prediction markets on Myriad still price only a 17% chance of a full-blown alt season in Q1 2026, so the crowd does not yet agree that this is an easy, straight-line uptrend. (SOURCE: Myriad) Beginners should treat the likes of SUI and XRP as beta plays around a core holding of Bitcoin or Ethereum, not as a full-stack investment. Never chase a vertical green candle, and definitely not with money you can't afford to lose. Keep position sizing small, use limit orders instead of emotional market buys, and accept that altcoin rotations often end with painful pullbacks, remembering to take profits all the way up to avoid the dreaded 'round trip'.

Aspire Biopharma Announces Successful Pre-IND Meeting with FDA fo... Rezolve Ai to Take Center Stage at NRF 2026 as Agentic Commerce E... HIVE (NASDAQ: HIVE) reported strong December 2025 production and full‑year results, driven by higher hashrate and fleet efficiency across a geographically diversified platform. HIVE continues to operate at >2% of the global Bitcoin network. Peers showed mixed moves: crypto-related names like BTBT -0.9%, BITF -1.71%, and FUFU +2.01% traded in different directions, while AMRK +2.17% and OPY +0.47% also diverged, suggesting stock-specific factors for HIVE rather than a broad sector move. Positive crypto/AI growth updates have often coincided with upward moves, while production beats can still see occasional short-term pullbacks. Over recent months, HIVE has highlighted rapid expansion in Bitcoin production, hashrate, and renewable-powered infrastructure. Key milestones include record Q2 FY2026 revenue of $87.3 million with 717 BTC mined, multiple updates showing network share above 2%, and commissioning of 300 MW in Paraguay with plans for 400 MW. This December 2025 production update extends the same theme of scaling BTC output and efficiency against rising network difficulty. This announcement details robust December 2025 performance, with 306 BTC produced, 197% year-over-year growth, and average hashrate of 23.3 EH/s at 17.5 J/TH efficiency. Full-year output reached 2,311 BTC despite higher network difficulty. This news release constitutes a "designated news release" for the purposes of the Company's prospectus supplement dated November 25, 2025 to its short form base shelf prospectus dated October 31, 2025. San Antonio, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - January 7, 2026) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (BVC: HIVECO) (the "Company" or "HIVE"), a diversified global digital infrastructure company, today reported strong December 2025 Bitcoin production results, highlighting exceptional year-over-year growth, continued quarter-over-quarter momentum, and sustained month-over-month operational strength, despite seasonal weather volatility impacting parts of the Northern Hemisphere. HIVE continues to operate at more than 2% of the global Bitcoin network, underscoring the Company's scale, reliability, and disciplined execution across its globally diversified fleet. While extreme cold weather across parts of the Northern Hemisphere temporarily impacted peak hashrate availability, HIVE's geographically decentralized operating model-spanning three continents, nine time zones, and five languages-enabled the Company to maintain high uptime, operational resilience, and production consistency. This growth was achieved despite the Bitcoin halving and sustained all-time highs in global network difficulty (notably the Bitcoin mining annual average difficulty was 46% higher in 2025 compared to 2024), highlighting HIVE's operational leverage and technology leadership. HIVE intends to develop an additional 100 megawatts ("MW") of hydroelectric-powered data center capacity at its Yguazú campus in Paraguay, with full commissioning targeted for calendar Q3 2026. The Company will deploy this capacity using a disciplined return-on-invested-capital ("ROIC") framework, optimizing free cash-flow from green-energy powered data centre infrastructure. Upon completion, HIVE's renewable energy footprint is expected to reach approximately 540 MW, including: Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman, stated: "At HIVE, we view Bitcoin as bundled, portable energy. Our green data centers convert surplus hydroelectric power into a globally liquid digital asset that can move instantly, without transmission constraints. As Bitcoin enters its next cycle and AI compute demand accelerates, our dual-engine model allows us to fund growth organically while maximizing the value of renewable energy." Aydin Kilic, President & CEO, added: "December's results demonstrate the strength of HIVE's global operating platform. Seasonal weather events reinforce why we believe in decentralization across multiple geographies. Operating daily across nine time zones allows us to optimize uptime, protect margins, and scale efficiently. We are very pleased with the consistent performance and uptime in our Paraguay operations. Our assets generate cash flow today while remaining flexible for tomorrow, positioning HIVE to compound value through 2026 and beyond." Founded in 2017, HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. is the first publicly listed company to mine digital assets powered exclusively by green energy. HIVE's twin-turbo engine infrastructure-driven by Bitcoin mining and GPU-accelerated AI computing-delivers scalable, environmentally responsible solutions for the digital economy.
