            America's next conquest might become Trumpland.
    


            President Donald Trump is looking for new acquisitions for his 21st-century empire-building project after removing the head of Venezuela's hateful regime.
    


            During his first term, his designs on Greenland were considered a joke — just another brazen boast of a president who loves to shock.
    


            Even last year, when Donald Trump Jr. flew to the vast island on his father's jet with a presidential bobblehead in the cockpit and, later, when Vice President JD Vance donned a parka for his own whistle-stop visit, there was an element of US trolling.
    


            But no one's laughing anymore.
    


            European leaders, who on Tuesday reaffirmed the island's sovereignty and Denmark's claims over its autonomous territory, are taking the president's threats seriously.
    


            This is hardly surprising, since the administration — flush with hubris after its Venezuela win — now claims the entire Western Hemisphere as Trump's domain. And his top aide Stephen Miller warned Monday on CNN that the US was not following the “iron laws” of a world governed by strength, force and power.
    


            But Trump's public rationale that the US must have the icebound territory for its own national security didn't fully add up — even before the White House on Tuesday rocked jittery NATO allies by refusing to rule out military force to get it.
    


            The president is spot-on that Greenland is strategically vital and getting more so.
    


            It's always been an important mid-Atlantic bridgehead. In World War II, it gave its name to the feared Greenland Air Gap ocean tract, out of range of land-based aircraft, that Nazi U-boats turned into a killing ground for Allied merchant convoys.
    


            In any new major war, whoever controls Greenland would master the vital Atlantic Sea lanes. And an existing US base on the territory already plays an important role in US early-warning missile detection systems.
    


            Eight decades after World War II, Greenland is becoming a hotter spot literally and geopolitically, as melting ice opens new shipping routes on the roof of the world. China and Russia understand just as well as Trump how strategically critical it could be.
    


            But the flaw in Trump's argument is that there's nothing stopping him from reinforcing Greenland if he believes US national security is at risk.
    


            After all, Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of a NATO member. Its vast empty spaces could easy accommodate a new garrison, bases and thousands of military personnel. Despite offensive jokes by administration leaders that Denmark is only defending the island with dog sleds, the US has a treaty with Copenhagen that permits huge latitude for US landings and takeoffs; anchorages; harbors; living facilities; and other basing needs.
    


            Greenland is also rich in yet-to-be-tapped offshore oil and gas fields, and as its tundra thaws, its rare earth mineral deposits, which could fuel new age technologies and weapons, will become easier to mine. 



            If it's rare earths that Trump cares about, then both Danish and Greenland officials have said they are open to partnership agreements.
    


            But there's no sign that Trump — who is coming to resemble 19th-century US presidents who craved new lands, wielded tariffs as weapons and dreamed of matching European empires — is looking to share. The US base on Greenland flies the Danish flag as well as the Stars and Stripes. This administration leans more towards the thinking of Miller's wife, Katie, who posted a social media picture of the entire island covered in the red, white and blue.
    


            The world has changed in the last few days.
    


            Trump's insistence that he was “running” Venezuela and was in charge following Maduro's capture suggests he's moved from a being a rhetorical imperialist to a practicing one.
    


            An announcement Tuesday that Venezuela would turn over up to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the US to be sold — and that Trump would control the proceeds to benefit Americans and Venezuelans — further fueled concerns that he is bent on gaining plunder from sovereign states.
    


            Trump's aggressive new pitch for total control of the Western Hemisphere coincides with his accelerating obsession with his physical legacy, including his plans for a huge White House ballroom and the splashing of his name above that of an assassinated American president on the Kennedy Center in Washington.
    


            How Trump would love to go down in history alongside President Thomas Jefferson, who purchased Louisiana for 1803 for $15 million and almost doubled the size of the United States. Or one of his administration's historical heroes, President William McKinley, who annexed Hawaii in 1898. Trump would almost surely go one better and name the vast new icy American territory after himself.
    


            It still seems almost unfathomable that the world is now coming to see Trump as a threat to Greenland.
    


            It's not that there haven't been concerns about its security in the past. But almost everyone thought that the danger to NATO would emanate from Moscow or Beijing — not from the alliance's mightiest power.
    


            For all of Trump's belligerence, there's no imminent sign that the president is planning a military venture, which would raise the unthinkable theoretical possibility of American troops raising their guns against their NATO brethren.
    


            The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers Trump wanted to buy Greenland, even though its leaders and Denmark have repeatedly made clear it is not for sale.
    


            But these are unhinged times. No one can predict what Trump will do next. And unlike his first term, there's almost no one penning him in. It's hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth trying to talk the commander in chief out of an order to send Marines to plant a flag on Greenland.
    


            “I know the Danes pretty well. They're tough people. It wouldn't surprise me to see them put a military force there to stand in opposition to a US force,” retired Adm. James Stavridis, a former NATO Supreme Commander, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday. “This is the end of NATO we're talking about. Let's avoid that.”
    


            But reality is in the eye of the beholder. After all, on the fifth anniversary Tuesday of the assault on the Capitol by supporters trying to overturn Trump's election loss, the official White House website was transformed into a propaganda organ. It blamed Democrats and the Capitol Police for a MAGA mob that beat up officers and desecrated the chambers of Congress.
    


            Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy warned Tuesday that Trump's designs on Greenland were no joke. “I certainly was among those who, 12 months ago or six months ago, dismissed his talk of taking over Greenland as an intentional distraction,” Murphy told CNN's Kasie Hunt. “I think now you have to really think about what's in the president's brain.”
    


            The leaders of France, Germany Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom joined Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in declaring Tuesday that “Greenland belongs to its people.” Mark Carney — the prime minister of Canada, which shares a small land border and a vast maritime boundary with Greenland — announced a high-level delegation to the country next month.
    


            Carney has had his own brushes with Trump's territorial expansionism. If the president had not alienated millions of Canadians with his demands that their country become the 51st US state, conservative leader Pierre Poilievre — a MAGA-lite-style populist — probably would have won last year's election.
    


            Geo-strategic implications of any US swoop on Greenland are enormous. Frederiksen has already warned that any US attempt to take Greenland by force would immediately destroy NATO and its mutual defense guarantee, which has been the bedrock of Western security since World War II. An attempt to seize a European territory would fracture US relations with Europe.
    


            Growing ill-feeling toward Trump's America would also intensify. Denmark might be weaker than the United States. But it was strong enough to send 43 of its soldiers to die in US wars in Afghanistan and another 7 in Iraq, according to icasualties.org. This is an extraordinary rate per capita in a country of 6 million people. Friends treated in such an insulting manner may not be around next time America calls.
    


            But the White House is applying power because it can.
    


            Europe's reliance on the United States for its defense gives Trump great leverage. It's surreal to say so, but there's no prospect that European or Danish forces could defend Greenland from US troops if it came to it. “Nobody is going to fight the United States over the future of Greenland,” Miller said.
    


            Europe's strong statement in support of Greenlanders on Tuesday came after several days of its leaders dancing on the head of a diplomatic pin as they struggled to respond to the Venezuela raid without alienating Trump. Most opted for condemning Maduro while citing the need to uphold international law, which the US trampled with its incursion.
    


            The European Union's delicate position, given the continent's defense needs, was also evident last year with the bloc's decision not to wage a counter-attack with its own tariffs against Trump. No one is sure, given Trump's anti-NATO rhetoric, that he won't just quit the world's most successful military alliance.
    


            This imbalance in the power dynamic between Europe and the United States gives Trump an advantage if he seeks to lure Denmark into an “Art of the Deal” showdown over Greenland. And it's surely not a quirk of history that he's appointed Jeff Landry, the Republican governor of Louisiana — the state that America bought — as his special envoy to Greenland.
    


            Still, a Greenland purchase might be beyond even Trump. The logistics of such a move might require acts of Congress, ratification by the European Union, and complex negotiations and treaty arrangements.
    


            Then there's the question of how much it would cost, even if it's not currently for sale. And are US lawmakers really going to stump up hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars, at a minimum, to buy the world's largest island when their constituents are struggling to pay for health care, housing and groceries?
    


            Some American statesmen hope that Trump's bluster cools before it destroys the West.
    


            “Let's not push this into an apocalyptic ending. We can work with the Europeans. We have for decades,” Stavridis, a senior CNN analyst, said. “It simply needs to be done with diplomacy, military engagement, economics.”
    


            But such temperance isn't in vogue in a White House that is only becoming more belligerent after its humiliation of Venezuela.

The US has demanded that Venezuela cut economic ties with Russia, China, Iran, and Cuba if it wants to pump more oil, ABC News reported on Tuesday, citing three people familiar with the White House's plan.

US commandos abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, during a nighttime raid on Saturday, in what the oil-rich South American country has denounced as a violation of its sovereignty.

According to ABC, the White House has demanded that Venezuela partner exclusively with the US on oil production and favor it when selling crude oil. President Donald Trump has insisted that American companies have access to Venezuela's oil industry, which he claimed was unfairly nationalized by Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez.

On Tuesday, Trump claimed that “the interim authorities” of Venezuela would be “turning over” between 30 and 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to be sold under Washington's control.

Delcy Rodriguez, a Maduro ally sworn in as acting president on Monday, declared that neither the US nor any other “foreign agent” would control Venezuela. Authorities in Caracas have demanded the release of Maduro and Flores, both of whom pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and weapons charges when brought before a New York court on Monday.

“The military operation, without a declaration of war or a UN Security Council resolution, represents an illegal act of armed aggression of a terrorist nature,” Venezuelan Prosecutor General Tarek Saab said.

Speaking at the UN Security Council on Monday, Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzia slammed Maduro's abduction as “a cynical crime that cannot be justified.” Chinese envoy Sun Lei also condemned the US, saying its military intervention in Venezuela poses a threat to peace and security in the region.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told US lawmakers that President Donald Trump wants to buy Greenland from Denmark rather than take the Arctic island by military means, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Rubio reportedly made the remarks during a briefing after top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer asked whether Trump was planning to use the military in places like Greenland and Mexico.

Trump, who initially voiced his intent to acquire Greenland during his first term in office, has linked ownership of the strategically located island to national security and competition with Russian and Chinese navies.

“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it's vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. She added that using the military is “always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal.”

European NATO members released a statement on Tuesday backing Denmark and affirming Greenland as its self-governing territory. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stressed that no NATO member “should attack or threaten” another member, and that an armed conflict between the US and Denmark would render the alliance pointless.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also asserted that a US invasion would be the end of NATO. “If the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops,” she said.

Greenland's leading political parties have long advocated gaining either independence or greater autonomy from Copenhagen. Icelandic singer Bjork posted a message to her 2 million Instagram followers on Monday stating that she supports the island's fight for independence, while expressing hope that Greenland could follow the example of Iceland, which broke away from Danish rule in 1944.

NEW YORK, January 7. /TASS/. The US authorities demand that Venezuela should sever economic ties with Iran, China, Cuba and Russia as a condition for increasing oil production, ABC News television channel reported.

According to the US-based television broadcaster, Washington put forward several demands to the acting President of Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez.

Firstly, the Bolivarian Republic will have to ""expel China, Russia, Iran, Cuba and sever economic ties"" with these countries.

Secondly, Caracas is required to agree to ""exclusive cooperation with the United States in the field of oil production,"" ABC News reported.

US President Donald Trump announced earlier in the day that the interim Venezuelan authorities agreed to hand up to 50 million barrels of oil over to the United States.

On January 3, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto said that the US had attacked civilian and military targets in Caracas. He called Washington's actions military aggression. A state of emergency has been declared in the country. US President Donald Trump confirmed that his country had launched large-scale strikes on Venezuela. According to him, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his spouse were captured and taken out of the country.

On January 3, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto said that the United States had struck civilian and military facilities in Caracas, describing Washington's actions as military aggression. A state of emergency was declared in Venezuela. Trump later confirmed the strikes and announced the seizure and removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife from the country.

They were taken to the United States and held at a detention facility in Brooklyn, southern New York. On January 5, Maduro and his wife appeared before the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. US authorities accuse them of involvement in drug trafficking, allegations both defendants have denied.

Trump also claimed that the United States would assume interim governance of Venezuela. In addition, the US president expressed confidence that Washington would secure compensation from Caracas for US oil companies.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Scientists predict increased disease outbreaks after Trump officials no longer recommend third of childhood vaccines

The bombshell announcement that the Trump administration no longer fully recommends a third of childhood vaccines means the US moved from leading globally on vaccination to lagging behind other high-income nations in preventing disease, experts say.

The move is the latest and most significant escalation against vaccines from Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime vaccine skeptic and current secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

“It's the largest change in our vaccination schedule in modern American history,” said Jake Scott, infectious diseases specialist and clinical associate professor at Stanford University School of Medicine.

It is an “astounding” decision made without scientific evidence or public input that will worsen vaccine access and increase disease outbreaks, said Daniel Jernigan, former director of the National Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.

US health officials, led by Kennedy, “want fewer vaccines”, Jernigan said, adding that they're inflating the risks while burying the benefits of vaccines and “sowing confusion” for parents and providers.

Some shots are now only offered to “high-risk” groups – including hepatitis A, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis B and vaccines to prevent two types of meningitis. The dengue vaccine will continue to be recommended in high-risk areas only. Other vaccines are offered only under shared clinical decision-making, a previously rare designation that usually requires a doctor's recommendation – including influenza, rotavirus, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Covid vaccines were limited in this way in November. The CDC will also recommend one dose of the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine instead of two.

Health officials said in a press release this will move the US closer to “peer, developed countries” as instructed by Donald Trump in December. Yet most other high-income countries have similar vaccine schedules to America's now-jettisoned recommendations.

The UK, Canada, Australia, Japan and most European countries have universal childhood recommendations for influenza, rotavirus and hepatitis B. All of them except for Japan routinely recommend vaccines against meningococcal disease to children. Canada, Japan, and most European countries recommend the RSV shot for all newborns, while Australia and the UK recommend the RSV vaccine for all pregnant people and the shot for high-risk newborns. The UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, and European countries recommend hepatitis A vaccines for high-risk populations.

Several of these countries also routinely recommend vaccines the US does not.

Japan added the rotavirus shot in 2020, and the UK just moved to recommend chickenpox vaccine to all. Decisions like these are frequently made because of the evidence accumulated by the US of the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. The US policies “used to be considered leadership in the public health policy space”, Jernigan said.

Many of these countries are “moving towards more protection” offered by vaccines, Scott said. “A lot of countries are expanding their vaccine schedule, and a lot of them have looked to the US over the years.”

The new US schedule is now closer to that of Denmark, a much smaller nation with universal healthcare. When it comes to vaccine recommendations, “Denmark is an outlier”, Scott said. “They've got the most minimalist childhood vaccine schedule” of other high-income nations.

The US is itself an outlier, Scott said, when it comes to healthcare and social safety nets. The US is the only high-income nation without universal healthcare and paid family leave.

“We need to follow what our peer countries are doing – and have universal healthcare,” Jernigan said.

Most notably, the US has 330 million people – compared with Denmark's 6 million – and a highly fragmented health system covering a massive geography and a diverse population. There are profound health disparities in America; nearly a third of the population does not have access to primary care. Lack of healthcare access or paid sick leave means diseases spread more before Americans seek care.

Dense urban centers alongside rural areas with very limited healthcare access, and plenty of travel across state and international borders, Scott said, means “disease moves differently” in the US. Going from a small town to a huge city – to attend a major university with tens of thousands of students living closely together, for instance – might open young people up to new disease threats, such as meningitis, Jernigan said: “It's like traveling from your own country to a new country.”

In other nations with fuller healthcare systems, it can be easier to access vaccines that are recommended only to high-risk populations, instead of all children. The children of pregnant people with hepatitis B are at high risk of getting very sick, for instance, yet in the US they are the least likely to access hepatitis B vaccines because they are frequently unable to see doctors for testing or follow-up care.

Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, pointed to declining trust in public health, but did not provide evidence for how changing the vaccination schedule would affect public trust.

Even other countries with universal healthcare recommend similar vaccines as the US once did.

“I've never seen anything like that, where what other countries do is [given] the same weight as scientific evidence,” Jernigan said, comparing it with recommending that all drivers in the US switch to the left side of the road because other nations do so.

Scott said the recommendations aren't “really about aligning with peer nations. It's about finding a justification for this predetermined conclusion. They want to do away with vaccines.”

Officials also bucked the established scientific process in making the decision, with no public comment, no discussion from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and no feedback from outside scientists or professional groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Jernigan said.

“We have a sweeping health policy that has no public engagement,” he said, noting that the process for making transparent decisions on vaccines was established long ago, yet “this administration just refuses to use the process”.

Scott echoed that concern, calling it “very concerning” and “very ominous” that these “changes weren't voted on”, “weren't debated in public” and “weren't subjected to the evidence-to-recommendation framework that ACIP uses”.

Instead, the administration released a 33-page report from Tracy Beth Høeg, a frequent vaccine skeptic and now the top regulator of drugs at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician who was briefly an ACIP adviser before being appointed to the HHS.

“It lists two authors, which is very odd – to have a sweeping document that leads to significant policy change list two authors,” Jernigan said. “You end up with what is really an opinion piece.”

The announcement itself lacked transparency. A small group of journalists was selected by HHS to be briefed about the changes on Monday; the Guardian was not invited.

Even the president's directive to re-examine the schedule was unusual, Jernigan noted: “I'm trying to think if a president has ever said: ‘Atvorstatin for lowering cholesterol, I think that should be changed.'”

Officials constantly monitor vaccines for potential safety signals, and no new evidence about potential harms have been made public.

“The science hasn't changed. The only thing that's changed is who's making the decisions and what conclusions they want to reach,” Scott said.

Such unscientific changes will have outsized harm, Jernigan said, adding: “We cannot let this be the new normal of what the government's doing, because the government's basically saying ‘just quit listening to me from now on.' It's really unfortunate.”

He hopes patients will continue seeking out vaccines, and providers will continue to recommend them: “You don't want to be that parent of a child who [goes] to a college where they have a meningitis outbreak and then ends up losing a limb or dying.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

White House press secretary says US controlling Greenland would deter China and Russia in the Arctic

Several Democratic senators have emerged from the classified briefing from top administration officials on the capture of Nicolás Maduro, all criticizing the scope of the military operation.

“I heard no detailed plan,” said the senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “It is just slightly different than the mistakes we made in Iraq and Afghanistan. There, we used our military as a means to try to micromanage the country. They waited us out, and as soon as we left, chaos erupted. Why would it be any difference under these circumstances?”

The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said that the “public needs answers” as he spoke to reporters. “What the hell is going on? We need answers as to how long this is going to last,” he said.

Leavitt says: “It's too premature and too early to dictate a timetable for elections in Venezuela right now.”

Leavitt says the US coastguard is “escorting” the Sophia vessel – the second oil tanker that was seized in the Caribbean - to the US .

The US is “selectively rolling back sanctions to enable the transport and sale of Venezuelan crude and oil products to the global market”, Leavitt says.

Asked why the US hasn't ruled out military force to acquire Greenland, Leavitt says Greenland is “being actively discussed” by Trump and his national security team and they're talking about what a potential purchase could look like.

Trump, she says, has been clear that the US acquisition of Greenland “would deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region”.

Trump's first option, again, is diplomacy, she adds.

Asked whether the seizure of the Russian-flagged, Venezuelan-linked Bella-1/Marinera oil tanker risked a larger conflict with Russia, Leavitt doesn't answer the question.

She says the vessel was transporting sanctioned oil, and that the US “will enforce all sanctions”.

“The vessel had a judicial seizure order ... so that means the crew is now subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution, if necessary,” she says.

The Kremlin has already responded angrily to the US seizure, saying “no state has the right to use force against ships properly registered in the jurisdictions of other states”. The tanker had received a temporary permit to sail under the Russian flag on 24 December, it said in a statement.

Leavitt is going on about yesterday's report in the New Yorker on JD Vance's “notable absence” from the operation in Venezuela, which asked whether his “exclusion” was down to his “anti-interventionist ideology” or whether it was a political calculation.

Leavitt attacks the report as fake and says the vice-president “has been involved in all policy … including Venezuela policy”. She says he was “read in and deeply involved” in the operation from the beginning.

Asked how the US would ensure oil worker security in Venezuela and whether that could involve troops, Leavitt says that Trump “reserves the right to use the US military if necessary”.

Diplomacy is always the first option, she says, adding that Trump tried that with Nicolás Maduro “but unfortunately he was an illegitimate dictator and unserious person”.

“There is a long-term plan here,” Leavitt adds.

A meeting with oil executives will take place on Friday to discuss opportunities, Leavitt says.

Leavitt says the deal involves sanctioned oil that had been “just sitting in barrels, sitting on ships”.

She says the interim Venezuelan authorities have agreed to release that oil, and that it would be arriving in the US “very soon”.

The US has already begun marketing the Venezuelan oil, she says, adding that all proceeds will first settle in US-controlled accounts at globally recognized banks.

“Those funds will be dispersed for the benefit of the American people and the Venezuelan people at the discretion of the United States government,” she says.

Asked if the Venezuelan government had committed to turning over its oil to the US indefinitely and what happens if it doesn't, Leavitt says the deal was made between Donald Trump and his team and the interim authorities in Venezuela.

She says the US energy secretary, Chris Wright, and the energy department are working with the private oil companies and the interim Venezuelan authorities to execute the “historic deal”.

“This will benefit the American people and the Venezuelan people,” she says.

Asked who is now in charge of Venezuela, interim leader Delcy Rodríguez – who yesterday said there was “no foreign agent” running the country – or the US, Leavitt says the Trump administration is “in close correspondence” with the interim authorities in Venezuela.

“We obviously have maximum leverage over the interim in authorities in Venezuela right now,” she says. “Their decisions are going to continue to be dictated by the United States.”

And the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, is now taking questions from reporters, I'll bring you all the key lines here.

On the question of cost, Marco Rubio said today that the military operation in Venezuela wouldn't cost the US taxpayer “anything”.

The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, noted that the “level of sophistication” discussed at the classified briefing for senators today “is something only the United States of America can accomplish”.

“The world is taking notice of that. Certainly Venezuela is taking notice of that,” he added, while disparaging a question about the cost of the military operation from a CNN journalist. “The president, when he speaks, he means it. He's not messing around. We are an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”

Rubio didn't discuss the administration's recent posture on acquiring Greenland. He noted that he'll be meeting with leaders of the territory and Denmark next week. Rubio underscored that Donald Trump has expressed his interest in Greenland since his first term in office, and that he “always retains the option” for military intervention in the event of a national security threat.

Speaking to reporters after today's briefing, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said that the US is about to execute a deal to take “all the oil that is stuck in Venezuela”.

“We're going to sell it in the marketplace, at market rates, not at the discounts Venezuela was getting. That money will then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is dispersed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime,” Rubio added.

When pressed by reporters about whether the US is concerned about the interim leader's loyalty to her deposed predecessor, Rubio remained resolute.

“The bottom line is that there is a process now in place where we have tremendous control and leverage over what those interim authorities are doing and are able to do,” the secretary of state said. “But obviously this will be a process of transition. In the end, it will be up to the Venezuelan people to transform their country. We are prepared under the right conditions, using the leverage that we have, which includes the fact that they cannot move any oil unless we allow them to move it.”

Several Democratic senators have emerged from the classified briefing from top administration officials on the capture of Nicolás Maduro, all criticizing the scope of the military operation.

“I heard no detailed plan,” said the senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “It is just slightly different than the mistakes we made in Iraq and Afghanistan. There, we used our military as a means to try to micromanage the country. They waited us out, and as soon as we left, chaos erupted. Why would it be any difference under these circumstances?”

The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said that the “public needs answers” as he spoke to reporters. “What the hell is going on? We need answers as to how long this is going to last,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Good morning.

Donald Trump and his advisers are looking at “a range of options” in an effort to acquire Greenland, noting in a White House statement on Tuesday that using the US military to do so is “always an option”.

“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it's vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region. The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander in chief's disposal,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said.

How are the US's European allies responding? In a show of solidarity on Tuesday, the leaders of France, Germany, the UK and other countries issued a joint statement with the prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, urging the US to respect its sovereignty. They said Arctic security was a top priority for Nato, a defense alliance that includes the US and Greenland. “Greenland belongs to its people,” the statement said.

Trump has said Venezuela would be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the US, a negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts.

“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” Trump posted on Truth Social. Venezuelan government officials and the state company PDVSA did not comment.

What would a deal of this kind signify? Top Venezuelan officials have called Maduro's capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country's vast oil reserves. However, Tuesday's agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump's demand that it open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.

Israel is moving to start construction on a vast illegal settlement in the heart of the West Bank, designed to “bury the idea of a Palestinian state”.

The Israel Land Authority in mid-December quietly posted a tender for construction of 3,401 homes in the “E1” project, which will sever the north and south of the occupied West Bank for Palestinians, and further cut off East Jerusalem.

The tender, first reported by the Guardian, lays out terms for companies to bid for part of the work, with a deadline for submissions in mid-March.

Why is Israel advancing now? For years, construction was blocked by the US and Israel's European allies. But the Israeli far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who is a settler, said last year that Trump had dropped longstanding US opposition to the E1 plan.

What effect would starting construction have? Critics and supporters agree that moving tens of thousands of Israeli settlers into a triangle of occupied land between Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah would critically damage efforts to reach a two-state solution.

Congressional Republicans were largely silent on the fifth anniversary of the January 6 insurrection on Tuesday, even as Democrats sought to use the occasion to condemn Trump.

The California Republican congressman Doug LaMalfa has died aged 65. It cuts the Republican's House majority to 218-213.

In the UK, the health of prisoners affiliated with the banned direct action group Palestine Action has deteriorated alarmingly, supporters say, as their hunger strike continues.

Britain and France have said they are ready to deploy troops to Ukraine after a peace deal, a significant new commitment that has been discussed for months.

Authorities said safety officers had not inspected for five years the bar that caught fire in a Swiss ski resort on New Year's Eve. Forty mainly young people died, and more than 100 were injured.

The Department of Justice has released less than 1% of the Epstein files, a court filing has revealed, as Democrats step up criticism of the Trump administration's “lawlessness” for keeping records under seal. The department conceded that only 12,285 documents out of 125,575 pages have been published so far.

If you frequently experience nosebleeds, you may come to regard them as nothing more than a messy inconvenience. Yet even though most nosebleeds are mild and benign, they should not happen “if everything inside the nose is healthy”, says Dr Patricia Loftus, an otolaryngologist at the University of California, San Francisco. Here's what experts say.

The year 2025 was a major inflection point for Broadway, with New York theater finally rebounding to pre-pandemic levels with $1.89bn in tickets sold. But with a record box office came record ticket prices, as Hollywood stars such as Denzel Washington and George Clooney commanded high sums. This year feels relatively less Hollywood-y, though no less starry. Here are 12 of the most anticipated Broadway shows in 2026.

In a setback for the pesticide industry, Democrats have succeeded in removing a rider from a congressional appropriations bill that would have helped protect pesticide makers from being sued and could have hindered state efforts to warn about pesticide risks. “I just drew a line in the sand and said this cannot stay in the bill,” Chellie Pingree, a Democratic representative, said. “There has been intensive lobbying by Bayer. This has been quite a hard fight.”

Most of Europe has been gripped by an Arctic air mass pulling temperatures well below the seasonal average this week. In a snow-blanketed Paris, crowds gathered for winter sports near the Sacré Coeur in Montmartre, with some people skiing down the slopes. “It had been my dream for a while,” one said. “I thought, it's now or never.”

SOUTH KOREA

Diplomatic backing sought

President Lee Jae-myung in Shanghai yesterday said that he had urged Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) to help him curb Pyongyang's nuclear program and suggested a freeze in exchange for “compensation” was possible. Lee on Monday met with Xi in Beijing. “I would like China to play a mediating role on issues related to the Korean Peninsula, including North Korea's nuclear program. All our channels are completely blocked,” Lee said he told Xi. “We hope China can serve as a mediator — a mediator for peace,” he added. The Chinese leader in response urged Seoul to show “patience” with Pyongyang given how frayed ties between the two Koreas have become, Lee added. “And they're right. For quite a long period, we carried out military actions that North Korea would have perceived as threatening,” he said. Lee also laid out a plan whereby Pyongyang would freeze its nuclear program in exchange for compensation. “Just stopping at the current level — no additional production of nuclear weapons, no transfer of nuclear materials abroad, and no further development of ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles] — would already be a gain,” he said, adding that he had asked Beijing to convey this message to Pyongyang and that “there was consensus on these points from the Chinese.”

Curfew imposed on Birgunj

A curfew was imposed on Birgunj, a key southern border city, after Hindu and Muslim groups began protesting against each other following the vandalism of a mosque over the weekend, officials said on Tuesday. The curfew orders issued by the Parsa District Administration said that no one would be allowed in the streets, and all gatherings and demonstrations are banned. The notice also warned that violators could be shot by security forces. Armed soldiers and police officers were patrolling the streets of Birgunj, 130km south of the capital, Kathmandu. Birgunj is the key border point for importing much of the oil, goods and supplies from India. Muslim groups began protesting in the streets of Birgunj on Sunday against the vandalism of a mosque in a nearby town, which was followed by a separate demonstration by Hindu followers on the same day. Protests have continued since. There have been no major clashes between the two groups and no major injuries reported, although there were scuffles with riot police.

CIA spy dies in prison

Aldrich Ames, a CIA spy who was sentenced to life in prison for selling secrets to Moscow, costing the lives of a dozen double agents, died on Monday in custody, authorities said. He was 84, the Bureau of Prisons said. Ames worked as a counterintelligence analyst for the CIA for 31 years and, along with his wife, Rosario, was convicted of selling information to the Soviet Union between 1985 and 1993 in exchange for more than US$2.5 million. Aldrich Ames had been head of the Soviet branch in the CIA's counterintelligence group and gave the Kremlin the names of dozens of Russians who were spying for Washington. The couple's luxurious lifestyle at the time — including Swiss bank accounts, a Jaguar vehicle and annual credit card bills of US$50,000  — drew suspicion. Federal prosecutors said that Aldrich Ames spied for the Soviet Union and kept selling Russia information after its collapse until he was exposed in 1994.

Since proclaiming independence in 1945, the Southeast Asian country had continued to operate under a colonial framework widely criticized as outdated and misaligned with Indonesia's social values. Efforts to revise the code stalled for decades as lawmakers debated how to balance human rights, religious norms and local traditions in the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation.

While aboard Air Force One en route to Washington, Trump reiterated the goal.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is planning a center for international non-governmental organizations (NGO) to attract more groups to set up offices and make Taiwan a critical hub for their work in the region, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) told the NGO Leaders Forum in Taipei yesterday.

The forum, themed “Integrated Diplomacy in Action: NGO Experiences, Achievements and Outlook,” was the first major event held by the ministry this year, Lin said.

The event was an opportunity to review the achievements of NGOs and their work with the government, as well as a means to deepen public-private cooperation, he said.

The ministry has been promoting “values-based diplomacy” in line with President William Lai's (賴清德) policies, he said.

“The ministry is striving to bring Taiwan closer to the world,” Lin said, adding that he has supported the objective by integrating “values-based diplomacy, economic diplomacy and alliance diplomacy” into a comprehensive “integrated diplomacy” strategy.

“Through the promotion of NGO diplomacy, Taiwan would translate values-based diplomacy — with its focus on democracy, freedom and human rights — into visible, credible and concrete cooperative initiatives,” he said.

“Under the framework of integrated diplomacy, the role of NGOs would also evolve, as they are more than participants in policy initiatives, being essential partners that codesign and coimplement initiatives and expand Taiwan's international influence,” he said.

NGOs and governments are providing integrated support for children affected by war in Kyiv, Lin said, citing an example he learned about while attending a ceremony in Warsaw in September last year to witness the signing of a memorandum of understanding.

“Likewise, Taiwan can build platforms to boost international cooperation, accumulate trust and consolidate its indispensable role as a responsible member of the global civil society,” he said.

“Over the past year, the ministry's work with domestic and international NGOs has continued to show that Taiwan has an important role to play as an enabler of cooperation and a trusted partner in international society,” he said.

Diplomacy is about long-term commitment, sustained dialogue and partnerships that provide mutual support at critical moments, he said, adding that this is why international NGOs are deepening ties with Taiwan and establishing bases here.

“The ministry plans to launch an international NGO center in Taipei and we believe Taiwan can serve as a critical hub for their activities throughout the Indo-Pacific region,” he said.

Civil society in Taiwan has abundant resources, while NGOs in the nation are vibrant and dynamic, with experience in international affairs and professionalism, so they are an indispensable force in connecting Taiwan with the world, he said.

Marco Chiesara, president of Italian humanitarian group WeWorld, told the forum that Taiwan's public and private sectors provide essential support for children affected by the war in Ukraine.

“Partnerships like the one with Taiwan's MOFA and the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families are so vital,” Chiesara said in his keynote speech. “They turn pledges into programs and concerns into concrete change.”

The aid allowed WeWorld to “keep child-friendly spaces open, keep heaters running ... and keep hopes alive,” he said.

“Children cannot wait. They cannot wait for a ceasefire to find walls, for a construction budget to find a classroom or for the next election to find psychosocial care. They need us now,” he said.

WeWorld's most recent collaboration with Taiwan in Ukraine involved a project supporting foster families and children's mental health in Kyiv, Chiesara said.

WeWorld, the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families, and the ministry previously worked in other conflict-affected countries such as Syria and Afghanistan following major earthquakes there, he added.

US President Donald Trump is discussing options to take control of Greenland, the White House said on Tuesday, upping tensions that Denmark warns could destroy NATO.

Trump has stepped up his designs on the mineral-rich, self-governing Danish territory in the arctic since the US military seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last weekend.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that “acquiring Greenland is a national security priority” for Trump to deter US adversaries such as Russia and China.

“The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander in chief's disposal,” she said in a statement.

The Wall Street Journal reported that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers that Trump's preferred option is to buy Greenland from Denmark, adding that there are no plans for an imminent invasion.

Denmark has warned that any move to take Greenland by force would mean “everything would stop,” including NATO and 80 years of transatlantic security links.

Any US military action against Greenland would effectively collapse NATO, as the alliance's Article 5 pledges that member states would defend any of their number that come under attack.

Greenland Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Motzfeldt wrote on social media that a meeting had been sought with Rubio throughout last year, but “it has so far not been possible.”

Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Lars Lokke Rasmussen said that meeting with Rubio should “clear up certain misunderstandings.”

Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that the island is not for sale and only its 57,000 people should decide its future.

Allies have rallied around Denmark and Greenland.

The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain joined Denmark in a statement on Tuesday saying they would defend the “universal principles” of “sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders.”

French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer both sought to play down the row as they attended Ukraine peace talks in Paris alongside Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

“I cannot imagine a scenario in which the United States of America would be placed in a position to violate Danish sovereignty,” Macron said.

The US has 150 military personnel stationed at the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.

Greenland residents have rejected Trump's threats.

“This is not something we appreciate,” Christian Keldsen, director of the Greenland Business Assocation, told reporters in the capital, Nuuk. “It is not acceptable in the civilized world.”

Trump has been floating the idea of annexing Greenland since his first term.



                                                                                Indonesia yesterday began enforcing its newly ratified penal code, replacing a Dutch-era criminal law that had governed the country for more than 80 years and marking a major shift in its legal landscape.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

Ukraine's General Staff has confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck a fuel depot in Russia's Belgorod Oblast and a logistics warehouse in occupied Donetsk Oblast overnight on Jan. 7, according to a statement published on Telegram.

The Oskolneftesnab depot, located near the village of Kotel, sustained direct hits to its fuel tanks, triggering a large fire, the General Staff said.

""The oil depot is involved in providing fuel to the occupying army,"" it added. 

Russian officials and local residents reported the incident earlier in the day, saying a fire broke out at the Stary Oskol oil depot following a Ukrainian drone attack. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed several tanks caught fire and that there were no casualties. Videos of the fire were widely shared on Russian social media on the night of Jan. 6.

In the same operation, Ukrainian forces also hit a logistics warehouse used by Russia's 20th Motorized Rifle Division on temporarily occupied territory in Donetsk Oblast.

""This strike aimed to disrupt enemy logistics,"" the General Staff said, adding that the scale of the damage on both sites is still being assessed.

In the same report, the General Staff also revealed new details about a New Year's Ukrainian strike on Russia's ""Temp"" strategic fuel depot in Yaroslavl Oblast. Two large vertical fuel tanks (RVS-5000) were damaged during the earlier attacks, it said.

According to the General Staff, the Temp oil base is ""involved in the storage, receipt, release, and accounting of strategic reserves, including petroleum products.""

These strikes are part of Ukraine's ongoing efforts to undermine Russia's military and economic capabilities.

""The Defense Forces continue to take measures to erode the offensive and military-economic potential of the Russian occupiers and to compel Russia to end its armed aggression against Ukraine,"" the General Staff said.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Jan. 5 derided Russia-supplied air defenses that failed to stop the American raid and subsequent arrest of Venezuela's longtime dictator Nicolas Maduro.

During his speech at the Newport News Shipyard in Virginia, Hegseth applauded the large-scale military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3 that led to the capture of Maduro and his wife, both of whom have been transferred to the U.S. for trial.

After vowing to ""sink every drug boat headed in our direction,"" Hegseth mentioned the failure of Venezuela's defense systems to repel U.S. strikes in the unexpected morning military operation.

The Venezuelan military operates several air defense systems supplied by Russia, including the Buk-M2 and S-300VM.

""And then we saw, three nights ago, in downtown Caracas in Venezuela, as nearly 200 of our greatest Americans went downtown in Caracas. Seems those Russian air defenses didn't quite work so well, did they?"" added Hegseth.

Maduro and Putin share a lengthy history of economic and political ties, with Caracas maintaining a relationship with Russia even after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and continuing cooperation in the energy and military sectors. 

Russia's Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. ""aggressive actions and forced removal"" of the Venezuelan dictator who has been in power since 2013. The Kremlin and Putin have yet to comment directly on the matter.

The U.S. administration proclaims to no longer be ""playing the catch and release game"" with South American drug organizations whose smuggling operations through the southern U.S. border have been a major focus of President Donald Trump's second term in the Oval Office. 

Shortly after the military operation, Trump shared an image on his social media of Maduro blindfolded and on board the USS Iwo Jima assault ship, according to the caption of the post. 

The criminal case against Venezuela's dictator is already underway, with four charges being announced on Jan. 5. They include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine-importation conspiracy, and possession of and conspiracy to possess machine guns. 

His wife, Cilia Flores, has also been charged, and both have pleaded not guilty to their respective charges. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post that the couple ""will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.""

The next court appearance has been scheduled for March 17.

President mused about taking action in the South American country, where militants are pouring in from Venezuela after Maduro's capture

Before Mauricio Alvarez was threatened with death, he lived in the northeast Colombian village of La Gabarra, in an area that has farmed coca since the late 1980s.

The business of cocaine courses through both daily life and the local economy of the region, where Mr. Alvarez was the leader of 61 community associations. His attempts to negotiate better payment for small-time coca farmers earned him the fury of a criminal group that traffics in cocaine.

His experience has given him a particularly clear perspective on the trade in a narcotic that has long made Colombia a place of interest for the United States – and, now, the subject of new threats from Donald Trump. The U.S. President, emboldened after his raid on neighbouring Venezuela, openly mused this week about taking military action against the country. 

But Mr. Alvarez doubts that such action, including any bid to remove Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a loud antagonist whom Mr. Trump accuses of being a narco-trafficker, will cut the country's production of narcotics.

Cocaine in Colombia would, instead, “grow stronger,” he said, citing Mr. Petro's efforts to interrupt the work of traffickers in the country. “Planting would shoot up.”

In fact, Mr. Trump's stunning decision on the weekend to seize Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro has already bolstered the influence in Colombia of armed drug traffickers, including those that Mr. Alvarez says want to kill him. And groups that advocate for peace in the violence-torn country say they fear new problems as Mr. Trump weighs action against their country.

What happened this weekend, seen by some as a blatant violation of international law, “sets a very harmful precedent that could cause stability here in Colombia to collapse,” said Gerson Arias, a former Acting High Commissioner for Peace in Colombia who has worked extensively to end conflict in the country. 

Who's in charge of Venezuela after Nicolás Maduro's capture? The latest updates on Donald Trump's plans

Mr. Trump has celebrated the South American political upheaval he set in motion, saying Tuesday that the operation to grab Mr. Maduro from his bedroom was “an incredible thing” that had removed a “violent guy” who has “killed millions of people.” Critics, he added, “should say, you know, ‘you did a great job.' ”

Colombia has already seen reason to expect new violence.

In recent days, after the U.S. action against Mr. Maduro, hundreds of members of powerful armed groups – including those associated with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as FARC, and the National Liberation Army, known locally as ELN – have arrived from Venezuela, according to local officials, conflict research groups and the Colombian minister of defence.

The entry of such people into the country “will most likely generate conflict. It will be worse,” said Leandro Ugarte, secretary for victims, peace and post conflict for Cúcuta, a Colombian city on the border with Venezuela. 

More militants will inevitably lead to a bid for control of more territory, “and if that is what is happening at this moment, then it's like what happened on Jan. 17,” he said.

On that date last year, renewed outbreak of conflict in the Catatumbo region between FARC dissidents and the ELN led to the suspension of peace talks with the ELN. Tens of thousands of local residents fled. Dozens were killed. 

The FARC dissidents are groups who refused to disarm after a much-celebrated 2016 peace deal, which has badly frayed.

More militants entering Colombia will inevitably lead to more violence, said Leandro Ugarte, secretary for victims, peace and post conflict for Cúcuta.Yader Guzman/The Globe and Mail

Conflict in Catatumbo contributed to a grim year for Colombia with 1.6 million people affected by violence and armed conflict between January and November of 2025, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a tally three times higher than in 2024. 

The number of people who were either trapped or displaced by that violence – nearly a quarter million in total – was the highest on record since 2008, when OCHA began counting those figures.

Fresh hostilities erupted on Dec. 22, and nearly 2,000 have already been displaced, Mr. Ugarte said. 

The arrival of militants from Venezuela is of particular concern because of who is believed to be coming, said Mr. Arias, who is now a researcher with Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think tank that works on conflict resolution. An estimated 70 per cent of the central command and national leadership for ELN has been based in Venezuela. 

He believes that as much as a third of the group's armed component in Venezuela may decamp for Colombia, driven by fear that they could be a target for further U.S. operations in the country – or given up by the current Venezuelan leadership as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the White House. The ELN, one of Latin America's most fearsome militant organizations, had played a role as a paramilitary force in support of Mr. Maduro.

Colombian Defence Minister dismisses Trump's threats, says U.S. is not an enemy

Mr. Trump's order to seize Mr. Maduro also stands to further radicalize a group already hostile to the idea of the U.S. as an imperial force. By attacking Caracas, “the empire arrived and the empire is the enemy. That makes any peace process more difficult going forward,” Mr. Arias said.

In a statement released Sunday, the ELN criticized what it called “American imperialism” for once again attacking “the national sovereignty of countries in Our America and the world.”

In Colombia, meanwhile, violence has returned to the country's Venezuelan border areas as presidential elections loom, scheduled for this May. Conflict creates logistical problems with carrying out the vote. Among them are the many local leaders who have been displaced by the conflict.

“We don't know how that electoral process will be carried out because the gangs and violent actors will try to take over the leadership we have in the communities,” said Martha Maldonado, human rights secretary for the National Confederation of Community Action, which represents about 16,000 local councils throughout the country.

Mr. Alvarez is among those who have been displaced. 

He has lived in hiding for the past year after he was publicly denounced by FARC dissidents, who offered a cash reward for information about his whereabouts. He angered the group – the 33rd Front – by threatening to block the movement of its boats unless small-time coca farmers received better payment for their goods. He was then accused of doing the bidding of the ELN. 

He has also worked to encourage farmers to switch to legal crops. 

But the overt violence of armed groups in the region has sought to end that work. Any growth in numbers from militants who arrive from Venezuela, he believes, will worsen the situation.

“Their modus operandi is to discredit and remove us,” he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Oil edges down as market digests Trump's statements on Venezuela oil exports","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-oil-falls-after-trump-says-venezuela-will-supply-to-us/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:50:51 GMT","

Oil extended declines on Wednesday as investors digested statements from President Donald Trump that the U.S. ​had reached a deal to import up to $2 billion ‍worth of Venezuelan crude, a move that would lift supplies to the world's largest oil consumer.

Brent crude futures were down 40 US cents, or 0.7 per cent, to trade at US$60.31 a barrel by 11:05 a.m. ET after falling to US$59.88 a barrel ‍earlier in ​the session.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 74 US cents, or 1.3 per cent, to US$56.39 a barrel, after dropping to as low as US$55.76.

Both benchmarks slipped more than US$1 during the previous trading session, with market participants expecting ample global supply this year.

The United States and Venezuela have reached an agreement to export up to $2-billion worth of Venezuelan crude to U.S. ports, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, a move that could redirect oil shipments meant for China and ease pressure on Venezuela's sanctioned oil industry.

Reuters

The deal between Washington and Caracas could initially require cargoes that were bound for China to be rerouted, sources told Reuters.

Venezuela has millions of barrels of ⁠oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship since mid-December due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump.

The blockade was part of a U.S. pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government that culminated in U.S. forces capturing him over the weekend.

Top Venezuelan officials have called Maduro's capture a kidnapping and accused the U.S. ‌of trying to steal the ‍country's vast oil reserves.

Venezuela will be “turning over” between 30 million and 50 million barrels of “sanctioned oil” to the ‍U.S., Trump wrote in a social media post on Tuesday.

“The ‌volumes are quite small in a larger context,” SEB commodities analyst Ole Hvalbye said. “If you ⁠look at the U.S. SPR in total, that's now 413 million barrels. So comparing that to 30 or 50 million barrels, the ​volumes are not so substantial.”

Adding to geopolitical risk, the U.S. was attempting to seize a Venezuela-linked oil tanker after a more than two-week-long pursuit across the Atlantic, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday.

The seizure, which could stoke tensions with Russia, came after the tanker, originally known as the Bella-1, slipped through a U.S. maritime “blockade” of sanctioned tankers and rebuffed U.S. ​Coast Guard efforts to board it.

Providing some support to prices, U.S. crude stocks dropped by 3.8 million barrels to 419.1 million barrels in the week ended January 2, the Energy Information Administration said. Analysts had estimated a 447,000-barrel rise.

U.S. gasoline stocks increased by 7.7 million barrels in the week, the EIA said, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 3.2 million-barrel build.​

Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, climbed by 5.6 million barrels in the week versus ⁠expectations for a 2.1 million-barrel rise.

Morgan Stanley analysts estimated the oil market could reach a surplus of as ⁠many as 3 million barrels per day in the first half of 2026, based on weak growth in demand last year and rising supply ‌from OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

However, the prospect of higher, cheaply extracted Venezuelan oil exports could pause expansion of productive capacity in the U.S. and elsewhere, analysts at BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, said in a note on Wednesday.

Venezuela has been selling its flagship crude grade, Merey, at around US$22 per barrel below Brent for delivery at its ports.

“That raises the expected price of oil over the medium term, ‌especially if the Venezuelan regime survives,” the BMI analysts said.

Russia sent bombers to Venezuela to support Maduro not too long ago, but now the Kremlin has stood by and watched as the US arrested the disputed leader. What does the US surprise attack mean for the war in Ukraine?

Nicolas Maduro showered Vladimir Putin with praise during his visit to Moscow on Victory Day in May 2025. The Venezuelan leader described Russia as ""a key power of humanity"" and the two heads of state signed a cooperation agreement.

But on January 3, Russia stood back and watched as the US forcibly brought Maduro and his wife to New York, where they are being tried for drug trafficking.

Three days after the fall of the Venezuelan president, Putin remained silent. The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed its concern and called for Maduro's release and negotiations between the US and Venezuela. According to official reports, after a phone call in early December, Maduro received a New Year's greeting from the Russian president.

Maduro was one of the few heads of state who supported Russia in February 2022 when Moscow recognized the separatist pseudo-republics of Donetsk and Luhansk before the major attack on Ukraine.

In December 2018, Russia sent two Tu-160 strategic bombers to Venezuela for exercises, which experts interpreted as a sign of support for Maduro. They landed at Caracas airport — the same airport used by the US to fly out the Venezuelan leader in handcuffs.

Russian air defenses were unable to protect him, as US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has pointed out.

""Russia's support for Venezuela has been more symbolic than practical,"" Neil Melvin, an expert at the Royal United Services Institute, told DW. In his view, Russia is not in a position to challenge the deployment of US forces in the neighboring region.

German political scientist and author of a book on Russian foreign policy, Felix Riefer, also said he was not surprised by Putin's response. After Trump's return to the White House led to a rapprochement between Moscow and Washington, Russia responded to ""American hints toward Venezuela with relative restraint,"" he said. ""Russia had already abandoned Maduro.""

Both experts said that a key explanation for Putin's silence is Russia's war against Ukraine and the US's shift from being Kyiv's partner to acting as a mediator in talks. Russia is keen to avoid harsh criticism of Washington because it does not want to cause offense, according to Melvin. In his opinion, Moscow's rhetoric on the events in Venezuela would be ""significantly harsher"" if it weren't for the war against Ukraine.

The British expert saw no immediate consequences for the war in Ukraine. This could change if Trump does not stop at Venezuela but goes further and, for example, attempts to annex Greenland, which belongs to Denmark – something the US president recently hinted at again.

Melvin believes that NATO would probably not survive such a development. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed a similar view. 

Kyiv meanwhile is keeping close tabs on events in Venezuela. ""If dictators can be treated this way, then the United States knows what to do next,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry reiterated that it does not recognize Maduro as president.

Experts in Kyiv are cautiously optimistic. Markets expect relations between the US and Venezuela to normalize in the foreseeable future, which will open Venezuela up for oil production and have a significant impact on the global economy and oil prices, said political scientist Petro Oleshchuk of Kyiv National University.

""Anything that lowers oil prices is beneficial for Ukraine and could have a positive impact on negotiations. The cheaper oil is, the less money Russia has at its disposal, making the idea that Russia is prepared for an endless war seem less and less credible,"" Oleshchuk said.

Some media outlets have suggested that the US could weaken its role as a democratic negotiating partner by arresting Maduro. However, experts interviewed by DW are skeptical. According to Oleshchuk, the US military's intervention is in line with the US doctrine of the Western Hemisphere as a sphere of interest. The expert notes that it is impossible to draw parallels between Maduro's arrest and Russia's aggression against Ukraine. ""In the case of Venezuela, the US is not annexing territory and is not claiming that Venezuela is a fictitious state.""

German political scientist Felix Riefer said that Russia could try to use the case of Venezuela to justify its aggression against Ukraine. While this is a possible outcome, ""a direct comparison is flawed,"" he said. 
Riefer is convinced that Moscow's reputation in the world has been weakened: ""Those who rely on Russia cannot hope to be protected."" 

Neil Melvin, meanwhile, emphasized that this is not the first time that Putin has let an ally go. ""Russia has lost Armenia, Syria, and now Venezuela,"" said the security expert. ""Russia's international position is weakening noticeably as it escalates its war against Ukraine and lacks the resources to maintain such relationships.""

In the case of Cuba, Russia's most important partner in Latin America and one of Venezuela's closest allies, Moscow's protests may be louder, Melvin says, but Russia's options are ultimately ""very limited."" Cuba was among the countries that were recently verbally attacked by Trump.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar's visit to the breakaway region comes two weeks after Israel recognized its independence despite vocal international criticism.

Israel's foreign minister is the first official to visit Somaliland following Israel's controversial recognition of the breakaway region as a sovereign state.

Gideon Saar met Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi in Hargeisa on Tuesday to discuss bilateral ties.

""We are determined to vigorously advance relations between Israel and Somaliland,"" Saar wrote on X.

Somalia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned Saar's visit, calling it ""an unacceptable interference in the internal affairs"" of Somalia.

The visit comes less than two weeks after Israel became the only country in the world to recognize the breakaway region's independence.

The African Union, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others have rejected Israel's recognition of Somaliland.

Despite this, Saar said the Somaliland leader has accepted an invitation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit Israel.

Netanyahu had previously said Israel would pursue cooperation in agriculture, health, technology and the economy.

In a sign of deepening ties, Saar said ""local professionals"" from Somaliland's water sector would visit Israel in the coming months for training.

Prosecutors cited sabotage and arson among the possible crimes in a suspected far-left attack on Berlin's power supply. A group claiming the attack said it was targeting ""the fossil fuel economy.""

German federal prosecutors on Tuesday said they had launched a terrorism investigation into an arson attack on high-voltage cables that triggered a power blackout affecting about 45,000 households in Berlin.

Prosecutors said they were probing Saturday's attack on suspicion of ""membership in a terrorist organization, sabotage, arson and disruption of public services.""

The attack was claimed online by a far-left extremist group calling itself Vulkangruppe, or Volcano Group, which said it was targeting ""the fossil fuel economy"" driving climate change.

""In the greed for energy, the Earth is being drained, sucked dry, burned, ravaged, razed, raped and destroyed,"" the group wrote.

Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner condemned the attack, saying ""suspected left-wing extremists knowingly put lives at risk, especially those of patients in hospitals, as well as the elderly, children and families.""

As of Tuesday, about 24,700 households and 1,120 businesses were still without power.

Grid operator Stromnetz Berlin said it aims to restore full electricity supply by Thursday afternoon.

Berlin emergency services, supported by the army and charity groups, initially scrambled to help those affected to warm accommodation, including care home residents. Hotels, schools and sports centers were also used to supply shelter.

Emergency measures remain in place, with the German military providing logistic help and fueling emergency generators. Public swimming pools have been opened around the clock to allow residents to shower and warm up. About 20 schools remain closed, and public transport buses have been deployed as temporary warming shelters.

The Bundestag's interior committee is set to receive a briefing on the attack later this week, as authorities continue to rule out foreign involvement and focus their investigation on domestic left-wing extremism.

Berlin on Tuesday said it would move to cover hotel costs for residents hit by the massive and ongoing power outage in the city's southwest. The offer applies to Berlin Partner hotels charging a capped rate of €70 (about $82) per double room per night.

The White House has dismissed Britain as “weak” for its response to the daring US special forces raid to capture Nicolás Maduro.

Donald Trump's aides are infuriated by Sir Keir Starmer's lukewarm response to the arrest of the Venezuelan strongman on Saturday.

The Prime Minister should be celebrating the apprehension of a narco-terrorist, not demanding that Mr Trump answer questions about the legality of the raid, a senior White House official told The Telegraph.

It is the latest sign in Washington that a once close relationship between Sir Keir and the US president is cooling.

A senior White House official said the response from London was sadly predictable.

“It's not a surprise,” said the official. “They are just weak.”

This particular insult is one of the strongest thrown around by a White House that revels in decisive moments and pours scorn on leaders slowed by legal niceties.

The Trump administration opened the year with a bang by sending special forces on an audacious raid to arrest Mr Maduro and Cilia Flores, his wife.

The couple are now in a New York jail awaiting trial on charges of “narco-terrorism” and conspiracy to import cocaine, among others.

They deny the charges, but Mr Trump and his officials have celebrated the clinically executed extraction.

The president called it “one of the most stunning, effective and powerful displays of American military might and competence in American history”.

The US government estimates that 75 people were killed in the raid, including members of Venezuelan and Cuban security forces, as well as civilians, according to the Washington Post.

Yet the response across the Atlantic has been more muted, as British and European leaders try to balance public concern at American adventurism with the risk of angering the world's most powerful man.

They have faced a similar dilemma over Greenland, with the White House announcing plans to acquire the island from Denmark – by force if necessary: European leaders united to condemn the US president's threatened take-over on Tuesday.

For his part, Sir Keir – who is facing mounting pressure from his own party to condemn the capture of Mr Maduro – said the UK had always supported a transition of power.

“We regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime,” he said, before raising the importance of international law.

Yvette Cooper, the Foreign Secretary, went further, telling MPs that the US should explain its legal basis for the raid.

She said she had raised “the importance of complying with international law” with Marco Rubio, Mr Trump's secretary of state.

“It is, of course, for the US to set out the legal basis for their actions,” she said before UN Security Council discussions on Monday.

The response leaves the British Government in a lose-lose position, angering the Labour Left who want Sir Keir to strongly condemn the US capture of Mr Maduro, and infuriating allies in the White House.

American officials say that Article II of the Constitution makes the president commander-in-chief, with authority to order limited military operations.

As Mr Maduro was not the legitimate leader of his country, they argue, he does not enjoy any sort of immunity from American justice. They also say the operation was justified on the grounds of self-defence.

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, initially praised the capture of Mr Maduro before reversing course after public outcry.

His United Nations envoy later said the raid “chips away at the very foundation of international order”.

António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said the US had violated the international organisation's charter which requires member nations to “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”.

Mike Waltz, Mr Trump's permanent representative to the UN, said bringing Mr Maduro to justice was consistent with the president's responsibility to protect Americans.

“If the UN… and this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist and the same treatment in this charter of a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organisation is this?” he said.

Mr Trump announced on Tuesday that Venezuela had agreed to supply up to 50 million barrels of “high quality, sanctioned oil”, which would be “used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States”.

Oil has been at the centre of discussions about Venezuela's post-Maduro future.

“I am pleased to announce that the Interim Authorities in Venezuela will be turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil, to the United States of America,” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform.

“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!”

The US has also demanded that Caracas cut ties with Russia, China, Iran, and Cuba, and partner exclusively with the US on oil production.

The US is planning to seize a sanctioned oil tanker, linked to Venezuela, off the coast of Ireland after it evaded an American naval blockade in December.

The plan has prompted Russia to send a submarine and other naval assets to escort the Bella 1, according to a US official cited by The Wall Street Journal, in a sign of rising tensions between the two countries.

Russia's foreign ministry said it was monitoring the tanker's situation “with concern”, according to a state news agency.

British officials reportedly fear that seizing the tanker could provoke retaliation from Russia. However, they are also wary of alienating the US by refusing support.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, Sir Keir joined European leaders in insisting that only Greenland and Denmark could decide on the island's future.

The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, ⁠Poland, Spain, ‍and Denmark said: “Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”

However, according to one White House official, Europe's full-throated support for Greenland has not deterred Mr Trump.

Asked about the US president's drive to acquire the territory during his remaining three years in office, they said: “It's not going away.”

British spy planes and ships supported the US in its operation to seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in Icelandic waters.

The Marinera, previously named Bella 1, was sailing off the UK coast on Wednesday when it was intercepted by the US Coast Guard and special forces following a two-week pursuit.

RAF aircraft were involved and UK airbases were used as launchpads for US military aircraft.

“UK Armed Forces provided pre-planned operational support, including basing, to US military assets interdicting the Bella 1 in the UK-Iceland-Greenland gap following a US request for assistance,” the Ministry of Defence confirmed.

The US European Command said the sanctioned vessel had defied a US naval blockade of Venezuela.

A Poseidon MRA1, an RAF maritime patrol aircraft, was tracked flying over the North Atlantic before “going dark” and turning off its transponder.

The Defence Secretary said the Russian tanker was seized as part of “global efforts” to crack down on those evading sanctions.

John Healey confirmed that the UK Armed Forces supported the US operation to board the Marinera as it travelled to Russia.

Mr Healey said the ship had a “nefarious” history and was part of a “Russian-Iranian axis” that was fuelling terrorism, conflict, and misery from the Middle East to Ukraine.

He said: “The UK will continue to step up our action against shadow fleet activity to protect our national security, our economy, and global stability – making Britain secure at home and strong abroad.

“The US is the UK's closest defence and security partner. The depth of our defence relationship with the US is an essential part of our security, and today's seamlessly executed operation shows just how well this works in practice.”

On Wednesday, Russia's transport ministry confirmed that all contact with the vessel had been lost, and condemned its seizure as a “violation of international law”.

Washington later announced another seizure on the other side of the Atlantic, boarding the M/T Sophia, which it said was “conducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea”.

The seizures come amid concerns about the future of Nato as Donald Trump's administration continues to threaten to take Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, by force.

Speaking after the Marinera was boarded, Mr Trump said the US would always support Nato and that Russia and China only feared the alliance because it had the United States as a member.

“We will ‍always be there for Nato, even if they won't be there ‍for us,” he wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, said: “The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in full effect, anywhere in the world.”

Recommended

With Russian military vessels, including a submarine, in the vicinity, the operation risked bringing British and American forces into direct confrontation with Moscow in the North Atlantic.

The seizures are just one element of a plan to control Venezuelan oil. A day earlier, Mr Trump said Caracas and Washington had reached a deal to export up to $2bn (£1.48bn) of Venezuelan crude oil to the US.

Chris Wright, his energy secretary, explained how it would work, with cash from sales deposited into a US-controlled account and used for the benefit of the people of Venezuela.

“If we control the flow of oil and the flow of the cash that comes from those sales, we have large leverage,” he told an industry conference. “We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela.”

Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, told reporters that Venezuela's interim authorities had asked that oil on one of the seized vessels be included in the deal.

“They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they cooperate and work with the United States,” he said.

The moves suggest an emboldened Mr Trump is ready to confront Russian interests after repeatedly offering concessions to Vladimir Putin in the pursuit of peace in Ukraine.

Russia had dispatched a submarine to escort the Marinera, which changed its registration from Guyana to Russia in late December and altered its name from Bella 1.

The ship suddenly changed direction on Wednesday afternoon and was heading towards Britain after crossing into Icelandic waters, according to ship tracking data.

RT, the Russian state broadcaster, published an image of a helicopter hovering near the Marinera, and said it looked as though American forces were trying to board the tanker.

The US European Command said the Marinera had been shadowed by a Coast Guard vessel and was subject to a warrant issued by a US federal court.

Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, said the operation should “put the world's criminals on notice”, adding: “You can run, but you can't hide.

“We will never relent in our mission to protect the American people and disrupt the funding of narco-terrorism wherever we find it – period.”

Russian commentators were quick to condemn the action. Alexander Kots, a veteran correspondent for the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, wrote on Telegram that “nuclear war could be just one step away”.

Mr Trump has spoken openly about controlling all of Venezuela's oil reserves and Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, has indicated that he will use a blockade as leverage over the country.

A senior White House official said: “The US is already in control of Venezuela's oil supply at this time.”

Mr Trump and his administration have started the year with a string of military operations to add muscle to its rhetoric that it will not tolerate foreign interference in the Western hemisphere.

On Saturday, special forces toppled Nicolás Maduro, the former Venezuelan president in a lightning raid in Caracas.

The answer to ICE raids isn't isolation. We must keep organizing to meet material needs and protect people's dignity.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

As the Trump administration expands immigration police surges across the country, what has stood out has been the acts of resistance. Communities and organizations have put together rapid response hotlines, protested outside hotels sheltering federal agents, and carried whistles to warn their neighbors when immigration police are nearby. That resistance has kept me alive and has been so necessary. 

But living in Little Village, a neighborhood in Chicago that was targeted by “Operation Midway Blitz” in the fall, I've also seen and experienced the psychological toll of these operations, both on the communities targeted and those of us organizing to defend them.

Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino's surge of immigration police into Chicago has made national headlines for its cruelty and aggression. But what is important to understand about Border Patrol entering a neighborhood is the uncertainty. You never know when agents will show up or when they will decide to turn their presence into a public show of force. On some days, the neighborhood felt almost normal. On others, everything would shut down without warning.

First would come the whistles. People organized, warning the community that immigration agents were nearby. Within minutes, streets that were usually crowded would empty. Sidewalks where street vendors normally worked would be completely bare. Businesses closed early. People disappeared indoors. I remember sitting at my desk and suddenly hearing the Border Patrol helicopters circling overhead. I didn't need to see it to wonder which one of my neighbors they had taken. My stomach still drops at the sound of any helicopter blades.

So, many people decided to stay home. Parents stopped going to work. Children missed school. Entire communities went missing. They survived by asking friends or neighbors to pick up medicine, buy groceries, or take children to school when they felt it was too risky to leave their homes. Organizations of all kinds have stepped up to deliver food and supplies directly to people's homes. Individuals volunteered to give rides, buy groceries, collect donations, walk dogs.

During the recent immigration surge in New Orleans, I heard from friends who isolated themselves weeks before agents ever arrived. They had seen the violence in Chicago and began to take safety measures as soon as the news broke of “Operation Swamp Sweep,” the immigration police raid targeting Louisiana.

The Trump administration's assault on us is not solely about increasing deportations. It is about manufacturing fear.

The Trump administration's assault on us is not solely about increasing deportations. It is about manufacturing fear: the fear that keeps parents inside, students out of school, workers in panic, and entire neighborhoods from living with dignity. And make no mistake: this fear is intentional. It is meant to make us feel so unwanted that we make ourselves disappear.

These psychological operations are layered and intentional. Helicopters circle above Chicago as Border Patrol turns enforcement into spectacle. During these operations, teachers are abducted, children are tear-gassed, homes are invaded. People are threatened with criminalization for resisting or even filming Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol. All of this is reinforced by Department of Homeland Security ads on Univision and Telemundo, the largest Spanish-language broadcasters, threatening to “hunt” immigrants, urging undocumented people to self-deport, and spreading fear inside homes already targeted by Donald Trump's policies.

As an organizer I cut my teeth doing civil disobedience and rapid response against deportations more than 20 years ago. I am not usually the first person to call for organizing mutual aid or mental health support. But what I've seen and experienced during these months of immigration surges has left me worried. Of course we have to organize and build rapid response networks, and make sure that people know to stay inside and not open the door. But we must also build the infrastructure that allows people to make those choices without losing access to food, income, care, or community.

I don't know what the next phase of this administration will look like. I don't know where the next surge will land, what new tactic will be tested, or whose neighborhood will be turned into the next spectacle of violence. What I do know is that this is not random, and that it will continue to happen. And because of that, the answer cannot be isolation. It has to be each other. We have to keep organizing, building networks that meet material needs and protect people's dignity, creating systems of care that make survival possible even when staying home becomes the safest choice.

The damage being done to our communities is intentional, but so is our response. We will continue to organize because that is how we refuse to disappear.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Children's hospitals in Washington State, Colorado, and Minnesota face federal scrutiny for care that is legal.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

This story was originally published by The 19th.

Three children's hospitals are under federal investigation for providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth, as the Trump administration continues to use all the levers it can to block such care. 

Health and Human Services (HHS) General Counsel Mike Stuart has referred three children's hospitals to the agency's inspector general's office: Seattle Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital Colorado, and Children's Minnesota. Gender-affirming care for trans youth is legal in all three states. But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last month announced that medical practitioners who provide gender-affirming care to minors are out of compliance with federal health care standards. Now, the agency is enforcing that declaration. 

In response, Children's Hospital Colorado has reportedly paused gender-affirming care for trans youth. Children's Minnesota did not respond to a request for comment, and its website states that “at this time, our gender health services remain unchanged.” Seattle Children's hospital also did not respond. 

Another hospital, Denver Health, has also paused gender-affirming care for trans youth since Kennedy's declaration, although the hospital does not appear to be under investigation.

In earlier efforts by Trump administration officials to investigate and halt  gender-affirming care, both Children's Hospital Colorado and Seattle Children's Hospital successfully fought back against Justice Department subpoenas seeking trans patients' medical information. 

The administration previously pressured hospitals to halt gender-affirming care by threatening to revoke federal funding, which worked in many cases, but these HHS investigations mark a new escalation. They stem from Kennedy saying that, under his authority as health secretary, he can unilaterally decide that gender-affirming care — which  he calls “sex-rejecting procedures” — is not a safe and effective treatment for trans youth.

The response from states has been swift. Just before Christmas, 19 states — including Washington state, Colorado, and Minnesota — and Washington, D.C., sued Kennedy and the federal health agency over the announcement. The states' lawsuit says the declaration harms their ability to administer state Medicaid plans in accordance with local laws protecting gender-affirming care.

“To me, the declaration is the extremely clear way they are trying to just shut down this care all across the country,” said Katie Keith, director of the center for health policy and the law at the O'Neill Institute at Georgetown Law. “They are trying to ban it nationwide for minors.” 

On X, Stuart said that all three hospitals were referred to the agency's inspector general's office for failing to meet “recognized standards of health care,” citing Kennedy's declaration. 

The HHS has also proposed two new rules to restrict gender-affirming care for trans youth — both of which must still go through an approval process before they can be enforced. One rule would block hospitals from receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds if they provide gender-affirming care to trans youth. That care includes hormone replacement therapy for adolescents and puberty blockers for young kids who are experiencing dysphoria — intense discomfort or anxiety felt when someone's physical gender is out of sync with their identity. It also includes surgery, which is very rarely performed on minors. 

Another proposed rule would bar Medicaid from covering gender-affirming care for youth under 18 and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) from covering such care for youth under 19. This would disproportionately impact low-income trans youth. Technically, states could still use their own funds for coverage — but experts say that would be extremely burdensome and ultimately cause gaps in care. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics, an organization of 67,000 primary care pediatricians and other specialists, strongly condemned these proposals, saying that they misrepresent current medical consensus and create uncertainty for patients. 

“These rules are a baseless intrusion into the patient-physician relationship,” the group said in a statement. “Patients, their families, and their physicians — not politicians or government officials — should be the ones to make decisions together about what care is best for them.”The American Civil Liberties Union has said it will challenge these two restrictions in court if they are finalized.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law two months ago, required the files to be released by mid-December.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

In a legal filing made on Monday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it has only released 12,285 documents relating to its investigation into alleged child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, representing less than 1 percent of the total files on the case in its possession.

According to the terms of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was passed into law in November, “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” were required to be released by December 19. Critics allege the DOJ is in violation of that law due to the incredibly slow rollout of files.

The law also requires redactions to be made in order to protect the identity of victims. DOJ officials have maintained that the holdup is the result of ensuring those redactions are carried out.

But victims have noted the DOJ's failures, stating that there are numerous examples of unnecessary redactions, while the department has also failed at ensuring identities are concealed. 

“The public received a fraction of the files, and what we received was riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation,” a letter from 19 victims to the department said last month. 

A five-page update was submitted by the Justice Department to federal Judge Paul Engelmayer earlier this week. Within it, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blance, and other DOJ officials recognized that their release of the Epstein files was incredibly delayed.

“There are more than two million documents potentially responsive to the Act that are in various phases of review,” the document states. 

JUST IN: DOJ says it has finished reviewing *less than 1%* of the Epstein Files for potential release.Only 12,285 documents have been released while more than 2 million remain under review.storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.us…

Democratic lawmakers have criticized the slow rollout of the documents as inadequate, noting that multiple documents featured questionable redactions.

“What are they trying to hide?” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) wrote in a post on X, adding that “the Trump DOJ's lawlessness must stop.”

Americans are also troubled by the Trump administration's rollout of the files. According to an Economist/YouGov poll published on Tuesday, only 24 percent of Americans approve of President Donald Trump's handling of the Epstein case, with 56 percent expressing disapproval. 

In another question in the poll, one in two voters (49 percent) say they believe Trump, who was once a close friend of Epstein's, is trying to cover up his crimes. Only 30 percent said he's not doing so, with another 21 percent expressing uncertainty.

Speculations of a cover-up came soon after the initial release of files last month, as people recognized multiple documents that should have been included were missing, and that dozens of files that were released were suddenly removed from the database. In at least one instance, a file that was removed included a photograph of the president.

Trump has expressed various opinions about the Epstein files which appear to have been dependent on how they would help or hurt him politically. During the 2024 presidential campaign, for example, Trump expressed support for releasing all of the files, as conspiracy theorists within his base had been demanding. However, upon taking office, Trump vehemently opposed the documents' release, wrongly claiming calls to release the files were a “hoax” by Democrats.

Trump only acquiesced when it became clear that legislation requiring his administration to release the files was going to pass. Even after signing the bill into law, Trump has continued to rail against those calling for more transparency in the matter.

“DOJ is being forced to spend all of its time on this Democrat inspired Hoax,” Trump said in a Truth Social post late last month. “When do they say NO MORE?”

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

SASKIA BRECHENMACHER is a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a co-author, with Katherine Mann, of Aiding Empowerment: Democracy Promotion and Gender Equality in Politics.

 The Backlash Against Democracy Calls for New Strategies

 Saskia Brechenmacher

Three decades after the Beijing Platform for Action, the groundbreaking UN declaration that affirmed that women's rights are human rights, the global movement for gender equality and women's empowerment is under strain. Adopted in 1995 and signed by 189 governments, the ambitious framework spurred a generation of legal reforms, gains in political representation, and consolidation of norms around gender equality. Today, however, that momentum is faltering. Although some countries continue to make steady progress, a UN report released in March 2025 found that one in four countries is experiencing a backlash against gender equality. Around the world, 270 million women lack access to modern contraception, one in three women experiences gender-based violence, and women are systematically underrepresented in countries' political and economic leadership.

It is tempting to blame the current impasse on specific leaders. U.S. President Donald Trump and his cabinet are openly hostile to domestic and international gender equality commitments, dismissing efforts to promote gender equity as “woke” overreach. Hungarian President Viktor Orban, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Russian President Vladimir Putin have all built their strongman images by dismissing feminism as radical and corrosive.

Yet these leaders' hostility toward gender equality is only one symptom of a broader shift. The core assumptions that powered the global women's movement after the end of the Cold War—that the world was becoming more democratic, more multilateral, and more liberal—no longer hold. Democratic erosion, from El Salvador to Thailand, is shrinking the political space for women to organize. Multilateral institutions that once served as engines for advocacy face funding shortfalls and diminished global relevance as conservative actors promoting national sovereignty and traditional gender norms gain power.

The strategies that were successful 30 years ago are no longer sufficient. Faced with a prolonged democratic recession, gridlocked international institutions, and a surge in conservative countermobilization, proponents of gender equality and their governmental supporters need a new template for action. Multilateral forums will remain an important arena for advancing progress and protecting existing achievements. But rather than being solely technical and elite-driven, reformers committed to the women's rights agenda must expand their efforts, focusing on more collaboration at the local level, investing in initiatives that include men and boys, and connecting messaging about women's empowerment to family well-being, community resilience, and economic stability.

The post–Cold War period brought rapid breakthroughs in women's rights. Countries across the world adopted new gender quotas to boost women's political representation, passed laws against gender-based violence and discrimination, and reformed their constitutions to enshrine equality guarantees. This surge in activity built on decades of activism and coalition building. But it was also enabled by three important features of the post–Cold War order.

First, advocates and organizations benefited from a wave of democratic expansion. Across Africa, eastern Europe, and Latin America, authoritarian regimes were losing their grip, creating new channels for women to organize. Women's groups whose operations had been subject to strict state control gave way to more politically autonomous networks. From El Salvador to South Africa, women took advantage of political transitions and constitutional negotiations to press for more rights and inclusion. And they were successful.



The end of bipolar great-power competition also allowed multilateral institutions to play a more decisive role in global governance. In the latter half of the twentieth century, the United Nations had emerged as an important forum for building norms around gender equality through landmark women's conferences and multilateral agreements such as the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. These efforts intensified after the end of the Cold War, when UN gatherings on topics ranging from human rights, in Vienna, in 1993; population, in Cairo, in 1994; women, in Beijing, in 1995; and social development, in Copenhagen, in 1995, rapidly expanded international commitments to advancing gender equality. The European Union, the UN Development Program (UNDP), the World Bank, and other multilateral bodies all began integrating gender more systematically into their work, driven by new research and policy thinking that framed gender equality not only as normatively desirable but also as a catalyst for economic growth, good governance, and democratic consolidation. Gender equality advocates, connected through frequent transnational gatherings, used these expanded international frameworks to press for domestic reforms, often invoking universal human rights. In 1996, for example, feminist activists in Nicaragua used the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence Against Women, which their government had ratified, to pressure Managua to pass a domestic violence law.

Gender norms also appeared to be liberalizing across different regions. Women entered higher education and the workforce in greater numbers. As women's organizations multiplied and advocates won important legal and political victories, feminist ideas gained greater legitimacy and visibility in public discourse. Particularly in the Western world, the end of the Cold War further reinforced the belief that liberal values, including individual rights and equality, had triumphed.

This is not to say that there was no pushback. Conservative religious movements had already begun organizing more systematically and gaining greater political influence in India, Iran, the United States, and across parts of Africa. In much of the global South, women's rights activists still confronted entrenched religious and traditional institutions that enforced patriarchal norms. Some women's groups in developing countries also objected to what they saw as a Western-influenced feminist agenda, arguing that its emphasis on individual rights overlooked structural economic inequalities and communal identities. Still, the overall trajectory, underpinned by new forms of regional and transnational solidarity, seemed favorable.

Today, those enabling conditions have eroded. Democracy is no longer on the march. Instead, the world is more than a decade into a prolonged democratic recession, and the space for women to organize for political change is shrinking across all regions. Data from the Varieties of Democracy Institute show that the repression of civil society, media freedom, and free expression has increased in 41 countries since 2014.

Women's rights activists are frequent targets in countries where democracy is eroding. In India, women peacefully protesting the government's new citizenship law have been jailed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the country's primary counterterrorism law. Egyptian feminists have been subjected to protracted judicial proceedings after being accused of illegally receiving foreign funding. The Nicaraguan government, under the autocratic leadership of Daniel Ortega, has shut down dozens of women's groups that have supported marginalized communities, labeling them as “foreign agents.” Autocratization is making it harder for women's groups to build coalitions, influence policy, or secure resources without risking surveillance, harassment, and prosecution.

This closing of civic space is exacerbated by a subset of conservative autocrats and far-right populist leaders who have seized on gender equality, feminism, and LGBT rights as potent symbols of liberal overreach by unaccountable, globalist elites. Many autocrats once paid lip service to women's rights to appear pro-democratic and attract Western donor support. But today, some illiberal leaders—such as Yoweri Museveni in Uganda and Kais Saied in Tunisia—see gender as a useful wedge issue that allows them to position themselves as defenders of tradition against foreign or elite interests.



Activists who once turned to international institutions for resources and political backing find this avenue increasingly fruitless. Most prominently, the Trump administration has denounced the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, withdrawn from the World Health Organization, halted all gender-related foreign assistance, and declared its intention to no longer fund several UN institutions. U.S. officials now even oppose references to the term “gender” in international negotiations. Facing a funding crunch, UN Women, alongside dozens of other UN offices, has been asked to develop a proposal to cut 20 percent of its staff. Rather than stepping up, other donor governments once seen as reliable supporters of women's rights, including France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, are also cutting back their aid budgets.

At the same time, conservative governments and nongovernmental organizations are asserting themselves within these institutions, promoting national sovereignty, religious freedom, and socially conservative gender norms and challenging language related to gender. Governments that are resisting pressure from women's organizations can now turn to alternative norm-building initiatives such as the 2020 Geneva Consensus Declaration, which asserts that decisions around abortion and reproductive health are the exclusive prerogative of national governments and not international treaties and bodies.

The assumption that activism and generational change would inevitably drive gender norms in a more liberal direction has proved flawed. The Gender Social Norms Index, published by the UNDP in 2023, indicated that the share of people holding biased gender norms—for example, that men make better political leaders than women—decreased by only two percent between 2014 and 2022, from 86.9 to 84.6 percent. Among younger generations, IPSOS survey data from 30 countries published in early 2025 show a growing gender divergence: young women are increasingly feminist, whereas young men are more likely to agree that gender equality efforts have gone too far.

Reinforcing this trend is an increasingly well-organized and well-funded transnational movement promoting traditional gender norms. What began as decentralized religious activism has evolved into coordinated campaigns shaping policy and public discourse, often through strategic messaging centered on protecting the family, parental rights, and religious freedom. Groups including CitizenGO, a conservative Catholic advocacy organization, operate across continents to oppose LGBTQ rights and the liberalization of abortion laws. These actors draw on existing social conservatism but have also mobilized broader public support by spotlighting highly contentious issues, particularly sexual minority and transgender rights, using them to weaken the entire policy and legal infrastructure focused on gender equality and casting progressive advocates as dogmatic and out of step with popular opinion. As a result, gender equality activists face not only entrenched resistance but also well-resourced countercampaigns.

What does this altered landscape mean for gender equality advocacy? Holding the line in multilateral negotiations remains essential to preventing the erosion of existing norms and mobilizing resources to mitigate the devastating impact of abrupt aid cuts on women and girls, particularly in conflict zones. But these efforts should be accompanied by issue-focused “coalitions of the willing”: smaller circles of governments, civil society groups, and private sector actors that collaborate to tackle specific hurdles to gender equality.

One recent example is the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse, a coalition of governments, tech companies, and civil society groups collaborating to combat technology-facilitated gender-based violence, such as the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images and deepfakes. Similar efforts could focus on expanding access to reproductive health care, improving childcare and eldercare systems, tackling young men's online radicalization, and ensuring artificial intelligence tools are designed and deployed with attention to their different effects on women and men. Regional institutions could also serve as effective loci for such efforts, as could partnerships among major cities or subnational governments to share effective ideas for reform.

Funders and governments committed to advancing gender equality also need to act more strategically and with greater urgency to counter movements against gender equality. Given the importance of civic freedoms and political space to meaningful progress for women, strengthening democratic institutions will be an important element of this. Yet focusing only on democracy while neglecting specific initiatives to improve gender equality would be misguided.

For one, widespread democratic renewal appears unlikely in the short term. Many countries are stuck in the gray zone between liberal democracy and autocracy, and preventing concrete harms to women and girls in these hybrid contexts is paramount. Moreover, illiberal and antidemocratic actors intentionally use gender to polarize the public and delegitimize broader human rights and equality norms. This reality makes it all the more important for democratic policymakers and civil society actors to build broad-based support for gender equality measures as common-sense investments in welfare and prosperity while avoiding rhetoric that further reinforces cultural divides.



In practice, building such support requires funding context-specific advocacy campaigns and legislative outreach alongside popular education, cultural production, and coalition building—including with constituencies such as conservative politicians, faith communities, and media influencers who may not agree with the most progressive stance on every issue related to gender. One of the downsides of the professionalization and internationalization of women's organizations that occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s is that many of these groups now have specialized policy expertise but lack popular and digital reach. They are also underresourced: according to data collected by the Association for Women's Rights in Development, the median annual budget for feminist and women's rights organizations in 2023 was only $22,000, with most of that funding taking the form of short-term project grants lasting 18 months or less. Meanwhile, between 2019 and 2023, over $1.1 billion in funding went to 276 organizations involved in antigender activism in Europe alone. To address this imbalance, supportive governments and private funders need to shift more resources toward creative, culturally resonant communication and on-the-ground organizing for gender equality. The 2018 referendum in Ireland that approved the legalization of abortion offers one example of what such campaigns might look like: advocates won by building alliances with doctors, midwives, and faith leaders; investing in grassroots outreach; and focusing their messaging on health and compassion.

An important priority should be to frame women's rights and empowerment as central to strengthening families, communities, and societies. Over the past decade, some conservative actors have cast policies on sex education, reproductive rights, and protections against gender-based violence as threats to family values imposed by “radical feminists” or out-of-touch elites. The typical response from women's rights advocates—countering with public statements citing scientific evidence or appealing to individual rights—often fails to resonate with broader publics for whom family, religion, and tradition are core reference points. Particularly in more socially conservative societies, campaigns that leverage women's roles as caregivers and community leaders, highlighting the importance of gender equality to shared goals such as families' economic security and children's well-being, could help broaden support for practical reforms and depolarize public debates.

Finally, engaging men—especially young men—must be a core part of any strategy. Parts of the gender equality movement have hesitated to do so, fearing that addressing men's concerns might inadvertently echo the narratives of the far right or the so-called manosphere. Yet ignoring men's experiences of social isolation, the lack of positive male role models, and decreasing economic opportunities gives more space to extremist actors. Antifeminist content already saturates male-dominated online spaces, drowning out narratives that promote mutual care and respect. To address these challenges, governments and private funders should expand their support for initiatives targeting men and boys that focus on mental health, digital literacy, vocational training, and fatherhood, among others. Such investments would complement, rather than replace, programs serving women and girls. Coaching Boys Into Men, for instance, partners with high school sports coaches to engage young male athletes on healthy relationships and nonviolence, in coordination with local domestic or sexual violence prevention agencies. The goal of these efforts should be to counter negative messaging about masculinity with an affirmative sense of belonging, identity, and purpose—one that makes men stakeholders rather than enemies in the struggle for gender equality.

If organizations promoting gender equality and women's rights fail to update their strategies to today's global political environment, there is a real risk that many of the hard-won legal, social, and political gains for women will be slowly hollowed out. This may not happen in dramatic reversals but gradually, under the weight of attrition and neglect.

 How Foreign Policy Dealmaking Can Sow Violence

 Michael Brenes

The post–World War II order is dead. In its place, countries are fast adopting a values-neutral, transactional approach toward foreign policy. China was the progenitor of this approach to international relations: for over a decade, Beijing has pursued quid pro quo arrangements with countries around the world to create new markets and enhance its economic reach, generating diplomatic ties with both autocratic and democratic states. It has established itself as a great power through a model of state-capitalist economic development that eschews universal human rights or concerns about its trading partners' system of government. Its lending practices may be predatory, but the recipients of Chinese loans and infrastructure projects have willingly, if sometimes begrudgingly, participated in its model.

The United States has, in recent months, pursued its own version of a transactional foreign policy. During his second term, President Donald Trump has rejected the framework of great-power competition. Washington has punished allies, partners, and enemies alike with exorbitant tariffs in order to gain diplomatic leverage, extract resources, and win concessions on trade. And he has pursued deals with countries as varied as Argentina, China, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea, without regard to those countries' regime form, and relentlessly attacked the institutions (such as NATO) that undergirded the rules-based order. Most recently, after capturing and extraditing the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, he appears eager to secure deals with Maduro's successor to benefit U.S. oil companies.

The future into which China and the United States are leading the world resembles the past—specifically, the nineteenth century, in which a handful of empires competed for economic spheres and resources and territorial control in the absence of effective multilateral institutions and international law that could constrain avaricious and authoritarian behavior. But world leaders should think twice before they resurrect that century's transactional politics, whose fundamental instability created the urgent need for a better world order. As the historian Odd Arne Westad has argued, conflict between great powers, and the prospect of it, loomed large over the nineteenth century. And nineteenth-century-style politics cannot simply be superimposed onto the twenty-first century. The world is much more multipolar now than it was then, with smaller states exerting greater influence on the global stage. A transactional approach to foreign affairs will yield not stable spheres of influence but instability characterized by competition over who can extract the most from the international system in terms of trade and resources—and it will inhibit the development of solutions to global problems that demand collective engagement.

The values of the Enlightenment formed the basis of the vision of the rules-based order. But for centuries, those values—democracy, human rights, and the rule of law—did not actually undergird international order. The 1648 Peace of Westphalia emphasized stability, sovereignty, and great-power alliances above other aims. Enlightenment values came second, if they were considered at all. European powers' quest to achieve a balance of power led them to openly exploit communities in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.

The 1814–15 Congress of Vienna envisioned a so-called concert of Europe in which five empires—Austria-Hungary, the United Kingdom, France, Prussia, and Russia—generally agreed to respect each other's sovereignty following the devastating Napoleonic Wars. But it is a mistake to imagine that this agreement, or the subsequent explosion of international trade in the second half of the nineteenth century, brought stability to the world. It failed to prevent wars beyond Europe's metropoles, and it encouraged sea skirmishes that often led to conflagrations on land. The nineteenth century was, in fact, characterized by a form of multipolarity: the parochial interests of empires—their wish to extract resources from colonies, mostly—drove foreign affairs. No universal laws yet governed their conduct. As the historian Jürgen Osterhammel has written, “there was no sign yet of world government or of supranational regulatory institutions.”

British and French leaders had begun to speak of their empires as liberal, geared toward spreading a “civilizing mission” and individual rights around the globe. But they saw no contradiction in repressing populations in Algeria, India, Kenya, and Vietnam. The more openly illiberal empires of Prussia and Russia held territories in Africa and North America respectively, even if they were minimal and less profitable. Even after the Ottoman Empire ceded many of its European territories to the Austro-Hungarians, it retained control of Iraq and Syria.



This “age of empire” empowered transactional trading relationships, and the prioritization of economic interests blurred lines between competitors and partners. The British and Dutch had long been rivals, but starting in the 1820s, they became cooperative trading partners who mutually recognized each other's colonies in Asia. The 1860 Cobden-Chevalier Treaty, which historians consider the first modern free trade agreement, led the United Kingdom and France to lower tariffs on commodities and consolidate their imperial holdings and overseas markets. After Germany's 1871 victory in the Franco-Prussian War, France and Germany became especially bitter rivals, but even so, the two countries became reliant on each other's manufactured goods.

This liberalization of trade, however, yielded its own uncertainty and instability. Transactional economic exchange and military belligerence coincided with and reinforced each other, and suspicion and animosity ran deep. Every great or rising power knew they needed access to the products and markets controlled by their rivals, yielding economic nationalism and self-serving, short-term diplomatic arrangements. The deepening trade relationship between France and the United Kingdom, for instance, dialed up their competition over Sudan and other African colonies. So-called small wars to suppress colonial uprisings metastasized into widespread violence in Africa and Asia. As the century drew to a close, Japan embarked on its own imperial project, colonizing Taiwan and then Korea. The United States acquired the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam after the Spanish-American War of 1898, solidifying its imperial status.

This “race to empire” helped lead to the devastation of World War I. Nationalism, protectionism, expansionism, and racial supremacy returned in the 1930s, and the Axis powers brought the world into war again. Both of these world wars finally made it clear that an order premised on more universal rights, sovereignty, and emancipation from territorial acquisition was badly needed. It is true that the benefits conferred by the postwar rules-based order proved elusive for many countries, particularly those in the so-called global South. The United States dominated its institutions, and Washington's actions in the Vietnam War, the Iraq war, and most recently, the conflict in Gaza have rightly called into question its dedication to upholding the order's values. But it nevertheless provided the potential for interstate cooperation and collaboration with U.S. institutions to effectuate outcomes that benefited global democracy.

But in the broader sweep of history, the notion that values ought to undergird a global order is an aberration. And the world now appears to be returning to a nineteenth-century model in which it is supposed that economic relationships and short-term diplomatic and financial deals can undergird interstate stability. Like the empires of the nineteenth century, the United States and China are both competitors and partners—reluctant economic rivals who fear war just as much as they prepare for it.

Both nations are seeking to independently strengthen their global and regional influence while acknowledging their reliance on one another. China's internal and external development projects, including the Belt and Road Initiative, reflect a familiar nineteenth-century imperial effort focused on regional hegemony, even if these imperial means are directed toward domestic ends. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has again made the Western Hemisphere a focus of U.S. national security and revived the rhetoric of “Manifest Destiny,” preoccupying itself with the southern border and suspected drug boats in the Caribbean.

Perhaps it is no surprise that the United States and China are behaving as great powers often do. More interesting is how many other states appear to be acquiescing to the end of the post–World War II rules-based order and accommodating a more transactional, nineteenth-century model of world affairs. Consider two of the United States' closest allies, Canada and France. Both countries now seek to maintain their long-standing economic and diplomatic ties with the United States while recalibrating their relationship to China. Although French President Emmanuel Macron has put new tariffs on China, he has also encouraged fresh Chinese investment in Europe and pushed for the loosening of restrictions on Chinese tech imports to the European Union. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, meanwhile, announced a new approach to trade and diplomatic relations with China.



Other U.S. partners have also shifted into a more transactional mode. India is projected to become the world's third-largest economy by 2030, and it will remain a key exporter and trading partner of the United States. But it has sought closer cooperation with China and Russia in recent months. India's actions channel its historical commitment to nonalignment but are adapted for a multipolar order in which interests override values and ideology has less hold on world affairs. They also reflect an acknowledgment that internal autocracy increasingly aligns with external growth.

In the global South, African states such as Nigeria and South Africa are also adjusting to a new reality. Trump's claim to ideological beefs with each country—with South Africa, for purportedly pursuing “woke” domestic policies, and with Nigeria, for allegedly condoning the “mass slaughter” of Christians—obscures the reality that both remain close trading partners with the United States. At the same time, South Africa remains dependent on Russia for oil and fertilizer, and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has touted new Chinese commitments and investment in his country's economy; Nigeria is also strengthening its relationship with China, whose technology is powering Nigeria's push to build large-scale solar power installations and mine materials for future technologies.

As it did in the nineteenth-century imperial order, transactionalism tends to stymie regional cooperation. Nigeria and South Africa are well positioned to increase their collaboration on trade, but their dependence on great-power dynamics between China and the United States is inhibiting them from doing so. The same dynamic is at play in the relationship between the Philippines and Vietnam. The two countries are deepening their defense cooperation and trade relations, but each remains most focused on how to manage the U.S.-Chinese rivalry to their benefit. Trump's trade war has pushed Vietnam closer to China, but it continues to rely on the United States for security and an export market; exports to the United States constitute 30 percent of Vietnam's GDP. Like other countries in a transactional order, Vietnam is trapped between two powers that cannot fully serve its interests. The Philippines is in a similar situation, declaring to U.S. officials that Manila and Washington face a “common threat” in Beijing while striving to avoid outright confrontation with China, on whose markets it depends.

Even countries that try to resist a transactional age are forced to succumb to it. Under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil sought to elevate its status as a leader of a new global order. Yet it cannot afford to give up its economic partnerships with either the United States or China, and it lacks the economic clout to create countervailing institutions in which middle powers can collectively overcome the dominance of great-power rivalry.

Many analysts—not only Trump—seem to believe that a “transactional” approach to foreign affairs may yield even more peace than an idealistic one, presuming that costly fighting is not in most countries' economic self-interest and that the reality of global trade ties will keep great powers from outright enmity. They tend to assume that transactionalism engenders pragmatism, which will mitigate conflict, and that nuclear deterrence will prevent new world wars. This year, Chinese leader Xi Jinping convinced Trump to back down on his plan to place exorbitant tariffs on Chinese goods. The United States struck deals with China over access to strategic minerals. Parochial interests forced an end to a looming U.S.-Chinese trade war, suggesting that a transactional era could sustain peace.

But it is far from clear yet that a new transactional age will be more peaceful than the nineteenth century was. Already, the regional wars, naval skirmishes, and imperial violence that defined the nineteenth century are resurfacing. India, for instance, has already proved willing to take on more risk, a stance highlighted by its seven-day conflict with Pakistan last May (the first time it used cruise missiles against its western neighbor) and its growing border conflicts with China. The United States attacked Venezuelan ports and boats, overthrew Venezuela's president, and now threatens to annex Greenland and preemptively attack Iran. China, for its part, stepped up military drills around the coast of Taiwan after Washington's decision to send an aid package worth more than $11 billion to the island, even as Trump has praised Xi Jinping and touted his personal relationship with the Chinese leader.

In the nineteenth century, small powers forced to acquiesce to Western dominance violently resisted empire. But instability does not take only the form of outright violence. Resistance now takes multiple forms—for instance, backing revanchist Russian-led de-dollarization projects, lawfare through the International Court of Justice, or seeking membership in BRICS+ or the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. These actions may not directly mirror the nineteenth century's violent resistance against colonialism, but they do reflect a growing ability possessed by smaller powers to push back against greater ones through institutional means.

Even if the aim were to return to a nineteenth-century model of world order, doing so would not be possible. The twenty-first century has its own special conditions, particularly those that give smaller nations much more influence than their nineteenth-century counterparts: today's most strategic minerals, such as coltan and lithium, are more concentrated and often not located in great powers' territory. In the coming decades, climate change will wreak havoc on many U.S. and Chinese trading partners in the global South, forcing both countries to respond to the economic fallout. The threat of pandemics continues to loom and will mean that the concerns of smaller states cannot be easily ignored.

These new, twenty-first-century challenges will demand international frameworks. The diffusion of resources in a multipolar world presents policymakers with the potential to reframe a world order around the concerns of weaker states that are also vital economic partners. And they must do so: the truth is that today, the absence of any international order, even if imperfect, would be a problem for global stability. A world premised on one-off transactions between nations will prevent the development of the kind of long-term, grand strategic thinking required to ensure that the exploitation, imperialism, and violence of the nineteenth century does not simply resurface—or even reemerge in a worse form.

• Tankers seized: The US seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker linked to Venezuela after tracking it across the Atlantic, according to the US European Command. The US said it also seized another Venezuela-linked vessel in the Caribbean. Sigue nuestra cobertura en español.



            • Venezuela's oil to US: Secretary of State Marco Rubio said interim Venezuelan authorities wanted to use oil from one of the seized tankers as part of a “deal” in which the US would take tens of millions of barrels of Venezuela's oil and sell it at market rates.
    


• Classified briefings: Democratic and Republican senators said that top Trump administration officials laid out a detailed plan about US plans for Venezuela's oil, but there was a partisan split on whether it'll work.
    


• Spotlight on Greenland: Emboldened by his claimed control of Venezuela, President Donald Trump did not rule out military means to acquire Greenland. Rubio said he will be meeting with leaders of Denmark next week.
    


            Crackdowns on the Venezuelan population would not be consistent with the Trump administration's priorities, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday.
    


            Asked about reports that leadership in Venezuela is cracking down on public support for the ouster of Nicolas Maduro, Leavitt said, “It would not be consistent. and I'll let the president's national security team speak further on that. I know they are well aware and tracking.”
    


            CNN has reported there's been widespread apprehension in the streets of Caracas and other cities, with the people of Venezuela uncertain and government security forces on edge.
    


            Leavitt declined to say whether the administration believes the country's leadership should release political dissidents and return Americans detained in Venezuela, saying she'd let President Donald Trump “answer that question.”
    


            “I don't want to make new policy at this podium today,” Leavitt added.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that President Donald Trump is “not afraid” to continue seizing sanctioned oil tankers despite concerns that it could ratchet up tensions with Russia and China.
    


            “He's going to enforce our policy that's best for the United States of America,” she said told reporters during a press briefing. “That means enforcing the embargo against all dark fleet vessels that are illegally transporting oil.”
    


            Leavitt's remarks came after hours the US military took control of two tankers, including a Russian-flagged ship it had been pursuing for more than two weeks. She downplayed the risk that it would spark a flare-up between the US and Russia, arguing that Trump maintains a good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            “I believe those personal relationships are going to continue,” she said, adding that Trump has made clear that seizing sanctioned tankers is “the policy of this administration, and he's not afraid to implement it.
    


            Multiple GOP senators are publicly urging the Trump administration to cease any further threats of military action in Greenland, as Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday broke with the White House in suggesting that such an option is not on the table.
    


            Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska offered perhaps the strongest criticism of the White House's formal declaration on Tuesday that officials were still considering the use of the US military to seize Greenland.
    


                    “I hate the rhetoric around either acquiring Greenland by purchase or by force. And you know, I don't use the word hate very often, but I think that it is very, very unsettling,” Murkowski told reporters after a closed-door briefing with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and others.
                





            Greenland was not a central point in the administration's briefing on Wednesday, which focused on the White House's operation in Venezuela and its future steps, according to multiple senators who attended. But the concern by Murkowski and other Republicans suggest it remains a major concern within the party that will require further explanation from Trump and his team.
    


            GOP Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford told reporters that “we need to not threaten a peaceful nation that's an ally where we have a military base already.” And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said, “Military invasion of Greenland would be a terrible idea, and really shouldn't be seriously considered.”
    


            Across the Capitol, Johnson strongly downplayed the Trump administration's talk on acquiring Greenland in a separate press conference.
    


            “All this stuff about military action and all that, I don't think it's a possibility. I don't think anybody's seriously considered that,” he said.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that significant private sector interest is emerging around Venezuela's oil industry as the United States works on a potential deal with the country's interim government.
    


                    “There's a lot of private sector engagement that's happening right now,” Leavitt said, noting that Energy Secretary Chris Wright is leading the effort. “As you know, Secretary Wright, our energy secretary, who's heading up this big project, is in Florida today, meeting with some of these oil executives, and as we confirmed earlier, they will also be at the White House later this week.”
                





            Leavitt emphasized the administration's confidence in Wright to oversee the talks. “They're eager about these opportunities. And Secretary Wright is a very well, knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and energy, and he's the perfect man for the job.”
    


            CNN previously reported that President Donald Trump is expected to meet with oil executives at the White House on Friday, according to a senior White House official.
    


            Leavitt said the meeting is to discuss “the immense opportunity that is before these oil companies right now.”
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said moments earlier that the US is “about to execute on a deal” to take tens of millions of barrels of Venezuela's oil and “sell it in the marketplace at market rates.”
    


            The Trump administration is “actively” discussing the potential purchase of Greenland, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, saying that President Donald Trump is prioritizing a diplomatic solution but is “(keeping) his options open.”
    


            Greenland has catapulted to the forefront of international headlines in the aftermath of the US's capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with the Trump renewing his interest in obtaining the Arctic island, which US officials have repeatedly said is a national security imperative.
    


            An acquisition of Greenland, Leavitt told reporters, is “something that's currently being actively discussed by the president and his national security team,” describing Greenland as “advantageous for America's national security.”
    


            Trump, she added, “views it in the best interest of the United States to deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region, and so that's why his team is currently talking about what a potential purchase would look like.”
    


            Leavitt was pressed on why Trump has not ruled out military action to take over Greenland, a possibility that has prompted significant pushback from Denmark and other NATO allies.
    


            “All options are always on the table for President Trump as he examines what's in the best interest of the United States, but I will just say that the president's first option always has been diplomacy,” she said.
    


            GOP Senate Armed Services Committee member Kevin Cramer said the briefing was a like a good “movie script” and the operational details they heard were very interesting. He said he's not upset his committee was not briefed ahead of time because it had to be closely held.
    


            “I'm fine with it,” he said about not being briefed. “Frankly the more I learn about it, the more fine I am with it because the exquisiteness of it requires such a small, small circle of knowledge.”
    


            He said the tale told by the briefers was like a “move script I mean, honestly, God, it's so good.”
    


            He said they should try to declassify information for the public but said there are a lot of specific details about weapons systems and more, which will make that hard.
    


            “This particular case, the tactics and things may never be a completely declassified because you're talking about specific weapon systems, specific aircraft, specific naval craft. They're just, there's a lot, lot there.”
    


            Asked if he was surprised by anything he heard, he said yes: “The details are interesting.”
    


            Democratic and Republican senators agreed that top Trump administration officials laid out a detailed plan about what comes next for the US plans to control oil in Venezuela in a classified briefing, but there was a partisan split on whether that plan will work.
    


            Here's what they're saying:
    


﻿GOP Sen. Roger Marshall: “I think the big leverage we have is the quarantine we have around them and if you follow the flow of oil, the flow of money, that they will have to respond and listen to what we're telling them to do.”
    


GOP Sen. Josh Hawley: Secretary of State Marco Rubio “talked about some of the forward looking plans happening in phases” but said he would not reveal what those were. “I thought that was instructive.”
    


Democratic Sen. Peter Welch described the plan laid out by the Trump administration as “aspirational”: “Good riddance to Maduro but everything that he created is still in tact. They have a plan that they can impose their will by the blockade on oil, but regimes as we've all seen are willing to inflict incredible punishment on their own citizens. So will that work? That remains to be seen. But history suggests it won't.”
    


Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin: “The joke is, everyone was so upset that the neocons were going to Iraq because of the oil, and it was a big conspiracy theory. [Stephen Miller] says it out loud. He doesn't have any shame that that is what it's about. That was what the majority of our briefing was about just now.”
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he will be meeting with Danish officials next week, following renewed US interest in taking over Greenland.
    


            His remarks come after Greenland's foreign minister and the Danish foreign minister requested a meeting with the top US diplomat.
    


            Rubio — echoing the White House statement earlier this week — did not count out the possibility of a US military intervention to acquire Greenland if Trump deems it necessary for America's national security, though he spoke in broad terms.
    


            “Every president always retains the option, I'm not talking about Greenland, I'm just talking about globally, if the president identifies a threat to the national security of the United States, every president retains the option to address it through military means,” Rubio said.
    


            But Rubio said Trump's intention has always been to buy Greenland, noting that he had clearly articulated that goal during his first term.
    


            “This is not new; he talked about it in his first term. And he's not the first US president that has examined or looked at how could we acquire Greenland,” Rubio said, adding that President Harry Truman had also considered the idea.
    


            Rubio said that diplomats always “prefer to settle it in different ways.” He then made the direct connection to Venezuela saying that the Trump administration attempted in that case to settle the problem through diplomacy.
    


            “We tried repeatedly to reach an outcome here that did not involve having to go in and grab an indicted drug trafficker. Those were unsuccessful unfortunately,” Rubio said of Venezuela.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there will be “more deals to follow” with the interim Venezuelan government and said the Trump administration is planning three phases for Venezuela: stabilization, recovery and transition.
    


            Speaking after an all-senators briefing today, Rubio said they are starting with stabilization because “we don't want it descending into chaos.” He reiterated that the administration believes it has significant leverage on the interim Venezuelan government led by Delcy Rodriguez.
    


            He described the oil deal as part of the stabilization phase, noting the administration expected to soon be able to sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil and generate revenue, controlled by the US, that will be “dispersed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people.”
    


            “We're already seeing progress with this new deal that's been announced, and more deals to follow,” he said, without providing details on the additional deals.
    


            The “recovery” phase, Rubio said, “is ensuring that American, Western, and other companies have access to the Venezuelan market a way that's fair.”
    


            “At the same time,” they want to “begin to create the process of reconciliation nationally within Venezuela, so that the opposition forces can be amnestied and released from prisons or brought back to the country, and begin to rebuild civil society,” he said.
    


            The third phase will be “one of transition.”
    


            “In the end, it will be up to the Venezuelan people to transform their country,” Rubio noted.
    


            “Some of this will overlap. I've described this to (senators) in great detail. We'll have more detail in the days to follow, but we feel like we're moving forward here in a very positive way,” he said.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US is “about to execute on a deal” to take tens of millions of barrels of Venezuela's oil and “sell it in the marketplace at market rates.”
    


            The top US diplomat also confirmed the seizure of two oil tankers today and said that the interim Venezuelan authorities wanted the oil from one of the ships “to be part of this deal.”
    


            “They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they cooperate and work with the United States,” Rubio told reporters on Capitol Hill.
    


            Rubio described the deal as a result of the US' oil “quarantine.”
    


            “We are going to take between 30 and 50 million barrels of oil. We're going to sell it in the marketplace at market rates, not at the discounts Venezuela was getting. That money will then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is dispersed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime,” he said.
    


            “We have a leverage to move on the stabilization front,” he added.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer railed against the Trump administration after an all-senators classified briefing on Venezuela, saying he was dissatisfied by some of their responses.
    


            The New York Democrat said he was “totally dissatisfied” about the administration's answers about the US' designs in other territories and countries like Greenland, as well as the administration's succession plans for Venezuela.
    


            “I am totally dissatisfied about their answers of going into other countries, totally dissatisfied of what, what they might be doing in Greenland, as well as in Colombia, Mexico and other countries,” Schumer told reporters, adding, “And we're also totally dissatisfied about succession. They're relying to help them run Venezuela, help Trump run Venezuela, the most unreliable corrupt people who hate America.”
    


                    “So this is fraught with peril,” he said. “The American people, the public – not just in a classified room – the American people need answers.”
                





            He said the Trump administration must address questions in public hearings.
    


            “They're avoiding all public discussion to talk to us in this SCIF where we didn't get adequate answers even to our questions. But not let the American people know what they're doing when it's the American people who have always paid the price when we try to do this regime change in blood and treasure,” he said.
    


            Schumer added: “We need answers. We need answers to these questions, and we need them made publicly.”
    


            Some House Republicans are defending President Donald Trump's recent threats to takeover Greenland, though many also downplayed the possibility that he'll launch a military operation to do so.
    


Here's what some lawmakers are saying: 



            Russia's foreign ministry has demanded that the United States return the Russian citizens aboard a seized oil tanker “to their homeland,” according to the Russian state news agency TASS.
    


            The foreign ministry said Moscow is closely monitoring the US seizure of the Marinera, TASS reported.
    


            Until recently, the ship was called the Bella 1. US forces had attempted to interdict the sanctioned ship near Venezuela last month but did not board it after it turned around and fled.
    


            Russia then filed a formal diplomatic request – with a new name for the ship –asking the US to end its pursuit.
    


            The Russian foreign ministry also demanded that the US “ensure humane and dignified treatment” for the Russian citizens aboard the tanker and must not “obstruct” their return to Russia.
    


            As we've been reporting, two vessels linked to Venezuela were seized by the US this morning, according to US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
    


            Details on their seizure have now begun to be released. Catch up on what we know so far about what went down:
    


CNN's Nic Robertson, Natasha Bertrand, Kaanita Iyer, Darya Tarasova, Issy Ronald and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this reporting.



            One of the seized oil tankers linked to Venezuela is carrying approximately 2 million barrels of crude oil, according to Emmanuel Belostrino, senior manager of crude oil market data at analytics firm Kpler.
    


            “M Sophia is laden with around 2 million barrels of Merey crude oil, loaded from Jose Oil Terminal (JOT) around December 26-29, as confirmed by satellite imagery and port reports seen by Kpler,” Belostrino said.
    


            “The VLCC's (very large crude carrier) previous voyage was also from Venezuela, when it similarly loaded around 2 million barrels of Merey crude in early August 2025 before heading to offshore Malaysia (EOPL). The sanctioned cargo was likely transferred to another vessel via dark ship-to-ship transfer, but Kpler has not determined the partner vessel,” he added.
    


            Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says she supports US efforts to seize a Russia-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic Ocean earlier today.
    


                    “I think Russia's playing games with the shadow fleet and so I'm not opposed to seizing that ship and making it difficult for Russia to get the oil that they've been actually taking at below market rates,” Shaheen told CNN.
                





            The senator said she doesn't know any more about the situation than she has read in the news but intends to ask Trump administration officials about it in the classified briefing she was walking into.
    


            The UK provided support to the US in its seizure of a Russia-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic Ocean earlier today, according to the British defense ministry.
    


            “UK Armed Forces provided pre-planned operational support, including basing, to US military assets interdicting the Bella 1 in the UK-Iceland-Greenland gap following a US request for assistance,” the ministry said in a statement.
    


            The UK's RFA Tideforce tanker provided support for US forces “pursuing and interdicting” the vessel, while its air force “provided surveillance support from the air,” it continued.
    


                    “Today our UK Armed Forces showed skill and professionalism in support of a successful US interception of the vessel Bella 1 while on its way to Russia. This action formed part of global efforts to crack down on sanctions busting,” the country's Defense Secretary John Healey said.
                





            Healey accused the ship of being “part of a Russian-Iranian axis of sanctions evasion which is fueling terrorism, conflict, and misery from the Middle East to Ukraine.”
    


                    “The US is the UK's closest defense and security partner. The depth of our defense relationship with the US is an essential part of our security, and today's seamlessly executed operation shows just how well this works in practice,” he added.
                





            President Donald Trump touted America's might in NATO while questioning whether the alliance would come to the US' defense if needed.
    


            “Russia and China have zero fear of NATO without the United States, and I doubt NATO would be there for us if we really needed them,” Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday morning. “We will always be there for NATO, even if they won't be there for us. The only Nation that China and Russia fear and respect is the DJT REBUILT U.S.A.,” he added.
    


            The president also invoked the win he secured last year to get NATO leaders to boost their defense spending targets. “Remember, for all of those big NATO fans, they were at 2% GDP, and most weren't paying their bills, UNTIL I CAME ALONG.”
    


            Trump's latest comments on NATO come as the administration has renewed its interest in Greenland, with the White House saying on Tuesday that it's discussing a “range of options” to acquire the Arctic island, which is a territory of Denmark, a fellow member of NATO.
    


            Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Monday that Trump's desires should be “taken seriously,” warning that a US military attack on Greenland could effectively end NATO.
    


            Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said today that her country is becoming an “important supplier” of oil to Cuba amid the current tension between Venezuela and the United States.
    


            During her morning news conference, Sheinbaum denied that Mexico is sending more oil to Cuba “than has historically been sent; there is no special shipment. For many years, oil has been sent to Cuba.”
    


            Despite this regularity in shipments — which are made based on contracts or for humanitarian aid, Sheinbaum said — she also emphasized that now this oil is more important for the island.
    


                    “It's a historic shipment (of oil) that has been sent to the island and the Cuban people. And now (the shipment) is part of both the contract and humanitarian aid. … Of course, with Venezuela's current situation, Mexico obviously becomes an important supplier; before, it was Venezuela,” Sheinbaum explained.
                





Key context: Cuba depends on Venezuela's assistance to meet even half of its energy needs. Due to Cuba's outdated infrastructure and lack of maintenance, the island desperately needs the nearly 30,000 barrels of oil per day that Venezuela sent on average during 2025, according to Reuters.
    


            However, US pressure following its attack on Venezuela on Saturday has put special focus on Caracas' oil, resulting in instability for its main crude recipients, including Cuba.
    


            Venezuela is not the only country that sends oil to Cuba, but it is by far the most important.
    


            Jorge Piñón, director of the Latin America and Caribbean Energy Program at the University of Texas, told CNN that Mexico, up until the first months of 2025, was sending Venezuela about 20,000 barrels per day of “light, good quality” oil — but in recent months, the average dropped to about 7,000.
    


CNN's Gonzalo Zegarra contributed to this report.

            We're hearing now from the Russian Transport Ministry, which confirmed that it lost contact with the Marinera, a Russian-flagged oil tanker linked to Venezuela, after US forces boarded the ship at 7 a.m. ET this morning.
    


            The ministry condemned the operation, adding that “no state has the right to use force against vessels that are properly registered in the jurisdictions of other nations” under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The US did not sign that convention.
    


The US sanctioned the vessel, which was originally called the Bella 1, in 2024 for operating within a “shadow fleet” of tankers transporting illicit oil. The US Coast Guard tried to seize the tanker last month when it was near Venezuela but the ship fled across the Atlantic, pursued by the US.
    


            At some point during the pursuit, the crew painted a Russian flag on the tanker's hull and claimed it was sailing under Russian protection. Shortly afterward, the vessel appeared on Russia's official register of ships under a new name — the Marinera — and Russia filed a formal diplomatic request last month demanding that the US stop pursuing the vessel.
    


            Meanwhile, Russian senator Andrey Klishas is lambasting the US operation as “blatant piracy on the high seas.”
    


            “All of this is being done according to their notorious ‘rules' in direct violation of international law,” he said in a Telegram post.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The US has tried to acquire Greenland before","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/politics/us-greenland-trump-denmark-history-hnk","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:10:18 GMT","


            On the heels of the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump has ramped up his rhetoric around his desire to acquire Greenland, once again raising the prospect of military intervention, sparking fears across Europe and widespread condemnation.
    


            But while American expansionism has regained steam under Trump, the idea of the US controlling the self-governing Danish territory long predates the current president.
    


            Greenland, a vast island of 836,000 square miles, occupies a strategic geopolitical position, sitting between the US and Europe and astride the so-called GIUK gap – a maritime passage between Greenland, Iceland, and the UK that links the Arctic to the Atlantic Ocean. It's also home to rich deposits of natural resources, including oil, gas and rare earth minerals, making it even more strategically important.
    


            US interest in Greenland dates back to the 19th century, when then-Secretary of State William H. Seward, fresh off the purchase of Alaska from the Russians in 1867, floated the idea of buying Greenland and Iceland from Denmark.
    


            While the sale never materialized, the US continued to eye the world's largest island at multiple moments throughout history, at one point discussing a possible swap with Denmark for US territory in the Philippines.
    


            In 1946, following World War II, during which the US took over the defense of Greenland, President Harry Truman offered Denmark $100 million in gold for the island, though Denmark rejected the bid.
    


            Here's a deeper look back at the history of US interest in Greenland:
    


            In the years following the end of the Civil War, then-President Andrew Johnson's administration sought to expand US influence in the Pacific.
    


            After successfully purchasing Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867, Seward, Johnson's Secretary of State, set his sights on other Arctic territories.
    


            At the behest of Seward, Robert J. Walker, a former treasury secretary and ardent expansionist who helped broker the Alaska deal, recommended that the US add Greenland and Iceland to its inventory, “but especially the latter,” according to a report by the US State Department.
    


            “The reasons are political and commercial,” he wrote in the report, emphasizing Greenland's vast landscape and mineral wealth.
    


            “The shores of Greenland much more than those of any other country are indented with deep bays, inlets, estuaries, and fiords, some of them possibly extending from the western to the eastern coast, presenting an immense shore line, and furnishing most extensive and protected fishing grounds,” Walker wrote.
    


            “The rocks and geology of Greenland … besides the valuable coal discovered, indicate vast mineral wealth,” he went on.
    


            Acquiring Greenland, he argued, would help the US “command the commerce of the world.”
    


            However, no formal offer to Denmark was made.
    


            In 1910, then-US Ambassador to Denmark, Maurice Francis Egan, wrote to the then Assistant Secretary of State with what he called a “very audacious suggestion.” Egan proposed the US give Denmark the Philippine island of Mindanao, then a US territory, in exchange for Greenland and the Danish West Indies.
    


            “Greenland is, as you know, a Danish monopoly,” Egan wrote. “It has never been exploited, although the Norwegians are clever enough to see its possibilities, as they already see what might be done with a lesser opportunity in Iceland.”
    


            The suggestion didn't go further than that, and with World War I on the horizon, US attention became focused elsewhere.
    


            However, a few years later, the US bought the Danish West Indies (now the US Virgin Islands) from Denmark for $25 million in gold to prevent the islands from coming under German control.
    


            During World War II, after Germany invaded Denmark, the US took up responsibility for Greenland's defense and established a military presence on the island.
    


            Then in 1946, after decades of flirting with the idea, the US under President Harry Truman made its first formal offer to buy Greenland from Denmark.
    


            The offer was secret at the time and was first made public in 1991 by a Danish newspaper, two decades after the documents were declassified.
    


            In April 1946, State Department official John Hickerson attended a meeting of the planning and strategy committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and said “practically every member” agreed the US should try to purchase Greenland, the Associated Press reported.
    


            “The committee indicated that money is plentiful now, that Greenland is completely worthless to Denmark (and) that the control of Greenland is indispensable to the safety of the United States,” Hickerson reportedly said in a memo.
    


            The Cold War was beginning, and the US viewed Greenland as essential to its national security.
    


            However, Hickerson said he told the committee he doubted the Danes would want to sell, according to the Associated Press.
    


            In a follow-up memo in May, William C. Trimble, assistant chief of the State Department's division of northern European affairs, put a price on the island, suggesting the US offer Denmark $100 million in gold.
    


            He said purchase of Greenland would give the United States “valuable bases from which to launch an air counteroffensive over the Arctic area in the event of attack.''
    


            US officials also discussed swapping oil-rich land in Alaska for parts of Greenland, though Trimble said he thought the Danes would be less open to this idea.
    


            Then-Secretary of State James Byrnes made the formal offer to visiting Danish Foreign Minister Gustav Rasmussen in New York on December 14, 1946, according to a telegram from Byrnes to the US Legation in Copenhagen, the Associated Press reported.
    


            Denmark did not want to sell Greenland. However, the US was permitted to build and operate military bases there. The US had several bases, but has since closed all but one – the Pituffik Space Base, previously called Thule Air Base.
    


            In 1979, Greenland gained home rule in a referendum, giving it greater autonomy from Denmark.
    


            Despite a long history of US interest in Greenland, the Trump administration has reignited efforts for the US to once again try to acquire the island and intensified threats against the Danish territory.
    


            Trump first publicly expressed interest in buying Greenland during his first term in 2019, likening a potential purchase to a “large real estate deal.” But the idea was quickly shut down by Greenlandic and Danish authorities, who insisted the island was not for sale.
    


            Shortly after winning the 2024 election, Trump revived his first-term offer to purchase Greenland, which was again rebuffed. Nearly exactly a year ago, he held a wide-ranging news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in which he did not rule out military action to take control of Greenland – a sentiment echoed in recent days by the White House.
    


            During a speech to a joint session of Congress early last year, Trump lobbed a threat at Greenland: “I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.”
    


            In a statement Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump has “made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it's vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region.”
    


            “The President and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. Military is always an option at the Commander in Chief's disposal.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","What happens to the planet if Trump gets his hands on all of Venezuela's oil?","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/climate/venezuela-oil-dirty-emissions-methane","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:01:00 GMT","


            The largest oil reserves of any country on the planet, more than 300 billion barrels, are estimated to lie beneath the ground in Venezuela. President Donald Trump is now laying claim to these vast deposits after his capture of the country's president Nicolás Maduro.
    


            Venezuelan oil is a tantalizing prospect for Trump, who reveres fossil fuels and has already set out a vision of US oil companies investing billions to unleash this black gold.
    


            However, climate experts are sounding the alarm because this oil is among the dirtiest in the world.
    


            “Venezuela's oil is considered ‘dirty' not because of ideology, but because of physics and infrastructure,” said Guy Prince, head of energy supply research at independent think tank Carbon Tracker.
    


            The type of oil that dominates in Venezuela — mostly found in the Orinoco Belt, an expanse of land stretching across the eastern part of the country — is called heavy sour crude and is similar to Canada's oil sands. It's thick and viscous like molasses and has a higher concentration of planet-heating carbon than lighter oils.
    


            Its consistency means heavy oil is generally harder and more energy-intensive to extract. “The oil does not flow from the well as a liquid. It has to be heated, usually by pumping steam into the reservoir,” said Lorne Stockman, research co-director at the environmental non-profit Oil Change International. This requires large amounts of energy, primarily produced from planet-heating natural gas.
    


            Impacts continue beyond extraction. The oil's high sulfur content also makes it harder and more expensive to refine into useful products like gasoline and diesel. It requires specialized equipment and more energy-intensive processes, further increasing climate pollution.
    


            On top of that, “the infrastructure (in Venezuela) is old and poorly maintained, which raises the risk of methane leakage, flaring, and spills,” said Carbon Tracker's Prince.
    


            Methane is a big climate problem because this planet-warming gas is over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over short timeframes. The methane intensity of oil and gas operations in Venezuela is six times the global average, according to the International Energy Agency. In part, this is due to the country's high levels of flaring, a practice ﻿which releases large quantities of methane as excess natural gas is burned off.
    


            Currently, the climate pollution released for every barrel of Venezuelan oil produced is more than double the global average, according to Patrick King, head of emissions research at consulting firm Rystad Energy.
    


            It's possible that the climate impact could be reduced if US oil majors step in. They have managed to decrease the emissions intensity in some of their global oil operations, said Rystad's King. However, “there are limits” to how much could be reduced, he added. Venezuelan oil will still require large amounts of energy to extract and significant flare-reduction programs are very costly.
    


            Venezuela's oil also carries serious environmental concerns. The country is plagued by leaking pipelines and outdated infrastructure, raising the risk of spills.
    


            Accurate data on the number of spills is hard to come by, especially as the national oil company stopped reporting on them publicly in 2016, but other organizations have published estimates. The Venezuelan Observatory of Environmental Human Rights produced a report in 2022 which found 199 spills between 2016 and 2021 — although it noted the true number was likely far higher.
    


            “Whether in Canada or Venezuela, we should not be digging this stuff up,” Oil Change International's Stockman said.
    


Trump wants the US oil industry to thrive in Venezuela again. That won't be easy



            Not only are the climate and environmental risks high, but the economics of unleashing Venezuelan oil may simply not work.
    


            Venezuela's oil production has slumped significantly since 2016, when it stood at around 2 million barrels a day. It now produces fewer than 1 million barrels a day, due in part to US sanctions and reduced investment. Before the US military operation, the future outlook was one of further decline.
    


            It would take more than $53 billion of investment over the next 15 years just to sustain the current rate of oil production, according to data from Rystad Energy published Monday. To scale production to Venezuela's heyday of more than 3 million barrels a day would require an eye-watering $183 billion, Rystad concluded.
    


            It's a costly prospect in a world awash with oil, where prices are low and where peak global oil demand may be rapidly approaching. “In today's energy market, that simply doesn't line up with reality,” Prince said. “It would be a very expensive way to produce high-cost, high-emissions oil just as global demand growth is slowing. It's just not a credible scenario,” he added.
    


            The global climate consequences of dramatically scaling up Venezuelan oil, if that does prove possible, are hard to predict. It would very much depend on how the oil is extracted “but most likely carbon emissions would very significantly increase,” said Diego Rivera Rivota, senior research associate at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.
    


            There are other scenarios, though. Increased Venezuelan production may not necessarily mean more oil globally if production decreases in other regions, Rystad's King said.
    


            More important may be the impact on global efforts to halt the climate crisis, Prince said: “The most significant climate impact of a Venezuelan intervention wouldn't be releasing vast new carbon — it would be indirect: distracting from the clean energy transition, reinforcing a 20th century resource-conflict mindset, and creating instability that slows coordinated climate action.”

            Long before Donald Trump suggested he should be tried for treason, Mark Kelly started sitting in restaurants with his back to the wall. Not even Kelly's staff realized what he was doing every time — clocking the door, the distance, the ways someone could get at him.
    


            The 2011 attack in which Kelly's wife, then-Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, was shot in the head – 15 years ago this Thursday – wasn't the first time someone had shown up to her events with a gun. And Kelly had worried about the dangers of his job as an Arizona senator long before recording a video that drew Trump's anger. The president, who survived two 2024 assassination attempts himself, lashed out over Kelly and other Democrats suggesting troops shouldn't follow illegal orders and reshared a post calling for “traitors” to be hanged.
    


            But what's happening now, Kelly said, is frightening in a new way.
    


            “I've been shot at a bunch of times; I've had a missile blow up next to my airplane. I flew a rocket ship built by the lowest bidder,” he told CNN, referring to his time in the Navy and as an astronaut. “I don't get rattled easily, but I am aware.”
    


            After a year in which the assassinations of Charlie Kirk and former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman were just among the highest-profile horrors, managing the fear of violence has become a central feature of political campaigns. Just this past weekend, a man was arrested and accused of breaking windows at Vice President JD Vance's Cincinnati home.
    


            That fear is part of the conversations many Democrats who could be competitors for the White House are having with each other, comparing notes and anxieties, according to several people familiar with the conversations who spoke on condition of anonymity.
    


            Future campaigns will be defined more than ever by security – who needs it, how much they need, and who can pay for it – in ways that are likely to change who runs for high office and how they interact with voters.
    


            Parades, for many top contenders, are out, along with most other outdoor events. Bulletproof glass and other upgrades have been quietly made to offices and residences. Many crowds are now seeded with undercover officers, especially for governors with state trooper details. Staffers are getting used to being asked questions like whether they want protective snipers to be covered or visible.
    


            The offices of multiple prospective candidates do their own threat tracking, from having staff monitor online chatter to building out bespoke intelligence units in some cases. For members of Congress, the US Capitol Police has stepped up coordination with local law enforcement.
    


            It's not just that they're scared, though many say privately that they are. They've internalized the gnawing feeling of knowing that the news will likely come again that another politician has been attacked or killed, followed by the inevitable social media blame game. Several teared up as they confessed dark fears of children being attacked in the middle of the night.
    


            “As governor, I have incredible security around me,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told CNN. “I know I'm going to be OK. I worry about others.”
    


            But as Kelly and other Democrats start exploring 2028 White House runs — and challenging a Republican president well known for celebrating violence against his adversaries — they're balancing raising their national profiles against the threats flooding their phones and being read out to them in private reports.
    


            “You're always looking to drive down risk. But here's the thing: You can't drive it down to zero. There's just no way to do that in this job, with the exception of quitting and moving to a cabin somewhere in the Pacific Northwest,” Kelly said. “Otherwise, there's going to be some risk, and you've got to accept it.”
    


            American politicians have always had to confront the threat of assassination, long before Trump came millimeters from death in 2024. Robert F. Kennedy was murdered the night he won the California and South Dakota presidential primaries in 1968, five years after his brother John became the fourth president to be assassinated.
    


            But a political debate often portrayed as an existential war, online radicalization and easy access to guns have combined to create a volatile moment. A prospective field that includes prominent Jewish, Black, gay and female candidates, several people familiar with security arrangements tell CNN, means not just more threats but more intense ones.
    


            Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was the target of a 2020 kidnapping plot. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's official residence was firebombed last Passover by a man who was carrying a hammer to attack him. These days, when they talk to up-and-coming politicians they're encouraging to run, both spend part of their time on safety and resilience in the face of threats.
    


            Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has been speaking out against Trump has often been slammed by the president due to his opposition to immigration raids in Chicago. Pritzker had a right-wing influencer who came to the city embedded with immigration agents filming in front of his house in September calling for his followers to “take action” against the governor. That frightened him to the point of texting the Republican statehouse leader that he was dealing with “vastly increased threats on my family and myself.”
    


            Pritzker, who was first elected in 2018, told CNN he's been ratcheting up precautions over his years in office. Now his wife has her own state trooper detail and he keeps his children away from public events in hopes of limiting the identifiable images of them in public. He takes troopers with him even on trips that he used to take without them, whether on vacations or going to what he pointedly would only refer to as another state to watch what he would only describe as sports games one of his children plays in.
    


            “I've changed how I think about what I do,” Pritzker, who was seated at a political dinner with Hortman the night before she was killed, told CNN. “Occasionally I have wanted to go without protection in the past, and it has not been a problem. But it is now.”
    


            Pritzker is running for a third term. He said he hopes to keep up the kind of glad-handing campaign schedule he's used to.
    


            “I dive into a crowd even now with the understanding that maybe the threats are greater today. The people who are making those threats are in a very, very, very small minority. I'm not saying it's not serious. I am saying that I can't let it change who I am or what I'm doing. Am I a little more careful? Of course,” Pritzker said.
    


            “What's making this harder is we normally would have a president of the United States who would stand up and speak out about the violence on both sides, call for peace and call for calm. But not this president. He ratcheted up his rhetoric after Charlie Kirk. He threatened to jail me, says I am a criminal.”
    


            In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that between two assassination attempts and Kirk's death, “no one understands the dangers of political violence more than President Trump.”
    


            “But President Trump, and the entire Administration, will not hesitate to speak the truth and call out Democrats — including slobs like JB Pritzker — for smearing their opponents as Nazis, encouraging members of the military to ignore lawful orders, and enabling violent criminals to invade our country,” Jackson said. “Sharing these facts is not inciting violence and the media would be wrong to make such an accusation.”
    


            Several Democratic presidential candidates traveled with private security in 2019 and 2020, but their details tended to be one or two guards only hired once they had already started to rise in the polls.



            Now, candidates with the wealth to cover their own costs or whose offices provide security will have what amounts to a built-in advantage, not needing to raise the millions to stand up security operations of their own. Governors have state trooper details and members of Congress have Capitol Police support.
    


            The US Secret Service protects major-party nominees and can add candidates with the approval of the Department of Homeland Security, its parent agency, and a congressional advisory committee. It has taken on primary candidates before, notably then-Sen. Barack Obama in May 2007.
    


            Keeping up with campaign demands has always been a struggle, and though the Secret Service regularly conducts trainings with state and local officers to help them learn about protection, many campaigns will have to handle measures like collecting and vetting names of event attendees, particularly early in the race.
    


            “The threat landscape is something we're constantly looking at and evaluating in how we do better,” said Special Agent Joe Routh, a spokesman for the agency.
    


            Breaking through for lesser-known candidates could be harder than ever, even as social media gives any candidate freedom to vault into the public's consciousness. Barriers and burly guards may limit unscripted moments that often go viral. Colorful moments at state fairs and backyard parties won't be the same if sight lines need to be closed off.
    


            The living room meet-and-greets and town halls that have always been a feature of early primary state campaigns will be much harder to pull off if everyone first needs to be screened by X-ray machines getting lugged around.
    


            Some prospective candidates' aides tell CNN that they have already gotten complaints from skipping events. At least two governors, for example, were overruled by their state trooper details when they wanted to attend No Kings Day protests in June. Others spoke from behind bulletproof shields with snipers roaming nearby rooftops for the October round of marches. They've taken heat from local press for limiting release of their public schedules.
    


            November's off-year elections weren't just a harbinger of voter concerns about affordability or Democratic energy going into this fall. They displayed what midterm and presidential campaigns will look like in a heightened threat environment.
    


            Six days before her victory, Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger stopped at a Mexican restaurant in Alexandria. The 100 or so people who attended first had to go through a metal detector, then had two workers wand them with handheld devices. They were watched by a collection of security guards blocking the doors and threading through the crowd.
    


            A few days later, an open-air event outside of Richmond, two armed men stood on either side of Spanberger as she spoke, with others circulating through the crowd. Her security followed her on the rope line as she hugged, shook hands and took selfies.
    


            Even with her background as a former CIA case officer, the governor-elect told CNN, it was hard to process what she knew was looming throughout her campaign.
    


            “The short answer is I generally try to not think about it. And then the longer answer is, I will not be afraid, because when good people become afraid, they don't run,” she said in an interview on her campaign bus just before the election. “We'll make smart choices, and we'll convey to others we're trying to make sure that we're being as safe as possible.”
    


            Spanberger spent tens of thousands of dollars on security. So did her friend Mikie Sherrill in her own successful gubernatorial campaign in New Jersey, enabled in part by a provision tucked into this year's budget by outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy that allowed campaign funds to be used on security for candidates, their families and their staffs.
    


            In an interview over the summer, Sherrill told CNN that the worries were often on her mind, but she tried to keep them from changing her approach to campaigning because “that would be a real blow.”
    


            As his primary campaign surged in New York City, Zohran Mamdani started to speak about the death threats that began streaming in, choking up at one point in public as he said the threats “take a toll.”
    


            By the end of his campaign in the fall, Mamdani's aides said that they were so worried about violence, even though he had an official New York Police Department detail as the nominee, that they tried to hold off announcing his public appearances in advance.
    


            After one rally the Saturday before the election that he had for days been expected at, CNN observed the candidate being led out surrounded by a huddle of over a dozen officers, some plain-clothed and some in uniform.
    


            Even at a December event at the Washington National Cathedral where Shapiro and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox came together for a bipartisan discussion on lowering the temperature, attendees needed to go through metal detectors and be checked by guards.
    


            Cox and Shapiro talked about the attack on the Pennsylvania governor's mansion. They talked about how Shapiro was the first person to call Cox when Kirk was shot in Utah, and how, the Republican recalled affectionately, Shapiro “told me to speak with moral clarity and to speak from the heart.”
    


            They talked about the guilt Shapiro said he felt for putting his family in danger through his work, with the Democrat acknowledging, “there are also scars that come that are not physical, that are emotional. I think our family has grappled with that.” They talked about how just two days earlier, a man had been arrested for saying he wanted to shoot Cox in the head.
    


            Along the way, four protesters stood up at separate moments and began to approach the speakers, screaming – three about climate change, one about Gaza.
    


            Each was led off by multiple armed security officials positioned around the cathedral, prepared for exactly that.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Michael Reagan, the eldest son of President Ronald Reagan and a conservative commentator, has died. He was 80.

The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute announced his death in a post on the social platform X on Tuesday, calling him “a steadfast guardian of his father's legacy.”

“Michael Reagan lived a life shaped by conviction, purpose, and an abiding devotion to President Reagan's ideals,” the foundation said.

His cause of death was not immediately announced.

“Michael was called home to be with the Lord on Sunday, January 4th, surrounded by his entire family,” his wife, Colleen Reagan, and two children, Cameron Reagan and Ashley Reagan Dunster, wrote in a statement. “Our hearts are deeply broken as we grieve the loss of a man who meant so much to all who knew and loved him.”

Reagan was a contributor to the conservative Newsmax television network and was known for his talk radio program, “The Michael Reagan Show.”

Born to Irene Flaugher in 1945, Reagan was adopted just hours after his birth by Ronald Reagan and his then-wife, actor Jane Wyman. 

The young Reagan followed in his parents' footsteps.

After attending Arizona State University and Los Angeles Valley College, Reagan took up acting, playing in television shows including “Falcon Crest,” and he spent nearly two decades as a conservative radio talk show host, speaking of politics and culture.

In two autobiographical books titled “On the Outside Looking in” and “Twice Adopted,” he told of, at times, a difficult childhood, which included coming to terms with his adoption and his journey of faith.




Reagan penned several others, including “Lessons My Father Taught Me” published in 2016, where he detailed lessons learned growing up the son of Ronald Reagan.

Throughout his life, Reagan raised money and worked for charities, using powerboat racing as a means of fundraising for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and Statue of Liberty Restoration Fund. Reagan sat on the advisory board for Mixed Roots Foundation, which focuses on the foster care and adoption in the U.S. and globally.

Reagan served as chair of the John Douglas French Alzheimer's Foundation board for three years, working on the same disease his father succumbed to in 2004.

As president and chair of the Reagan Legacy Foundation, he championed the legacy of his father. The conservative former president was known for trying to scale back government and devoting his presidency to winning the Cold War.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that it launched what it described as the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out by the agency — with 2,000 federal agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

“The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,” the department said in a post on X, dramatically expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions. 

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents' vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that's being waged against Minnesota.”

“You're seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area's Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was “unlike any other day we've experienced.”

“It's incredibly distressing,” Coleman said. “What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it's an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.”

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

“We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,” said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE's investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks. 

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino's tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia. 

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

Delcy Rodriguez was a key contact with American press when she was Venezuela's foreign minister. Now, Rodriguez is leading the country after the U.S. captured President Nicolas Maduro. AP's Joshua Goodman explains Rodriguez's rise to power.

In remarks before House Republicans Tuesday, President Donald Trump praised the US raid in Venezuela that captured President Nicolás Maduro as “brilliant tactically” and “an amazing military feat.” He also slammed Democrats for criticizing the operation.

Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello appeared at a pro-government march on Tuesday. Whilst Cabello has been seen in public this is his first time at a pro-government event since ousted President Nicolas Maduro was taken from the country on Saturday.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela would be providing 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., and he pledged to use proceeds from the sale of this oil “to benefit the people” of both countries.

The White House is organizing a meeting Friday with U.S. oil company executives to discuss Venezuela, which the Trump administration has been pressuring to open its vast-but-struggling oil industry more widely to American investment and know-how. Representatives of Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are expected to attend the White House meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the plans.

Earlier Tuesday, officials in Caracas announced that at least 24 Venezuelan security officers were killed in the dead-of-night U.S. military operation to capture Nicolás Maduro and spirit him to the United States to face drug charges. And the country's acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, pushed back on Trump, who earlier this week warned she'd face an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not “do what's right” and overhaul Venezuela into a country that aligns with U.S. interests, including by granting access to American energy companies.

Rodriguez, delivering an address Tuesday before government agricultural and industrial sector officials, said, “Personally, to those who threaten me: My destiny is not determined by them, but by God.”

Venezuela's Attorney General Tarek William Saab said overall “dozens” of officers and civilians were killed in the weekend strike in Caracas and said prosecutors would investigate the deaths in what he described as a “war crime.” He didn't specify if the estimate was specifically referring to Venezuelans.




In addition to the Venezuelan security officials, Cuba's government had previously confirmed that 32 Cuban military and police officers working in Venezuela were killed in the raid. The Cuban government says the personnel killed belonged to the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior, the country's two main security agencies. 

Seven U.S. service members were also injured in the raid, according to the Pentagon. Five have already returned to duty, while two are still recovering from their injuries. The injuries included gunshot wounds and shrapnel injuries, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment on the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

A video tribute to the slain Venezuelan security officials posted to the military's Instagram account features faces of the fallen over black-and-white videos of soldiers, American aircraft flying over Caracas and armored vehicles destroyed by the blasts. Meanwhile, the streets of Caracas, deserted for days following Maduro's capture, briefly filled with masses of people waving Venezuelan flags and bouncing to patriotic music at a state-organized display of support for the government.

“Their spilled blood does not cry out for vengeance, but for justice and strength,” the military wrote in an Instagram post. “It reaffirms our unwavering oath not to rest until we rescue our legitimate President, completely dismantle the terrorist groups operating from abroad, and ensure that events such as these never again sully our sovereign soil.” 

With oil trading at roughly $56 a barrel, the transaction Trump announced late Tuesday could be worth as much as $2.8 billion. The U.S. goes through an average of roughly 20 million barrels a day of oil and related products, so Venezuela's transfer would be the equivalent of as much as two and a half days of supply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Despite Venezuela having the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, it only produces on average about one million barrels day, significantly below the U.S. average daily production of 13.9 million barrels a day during October.

The press office for Venezuela's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's announcement.

ExxonMobil is developing a mammoth offshore oil deposit in the waters off Guyana, Venezuela's neighbor to the east. The company's major oil discovery in 2015 prompted Venezuela to revive a century-old territorial dispute with Guyana and take steps to annex the remote region known as Essequibo, which comprises about two-thirds of Guyana's land mass.

The development has also led to wide-ranging accusations from Venezuela's government, including Rodríguez, against Guyana's leaders and ExxonMobil. Two years ago, Venezuelan lawmakers even considered banning any future operation in Venezuela of oil companies working in Guyana.

Earlier Tuesday, Trump pushed back against Democratic criticism of this weekend's military operation, noting that his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden had also called for the arrest of the Venezuelan leader on drug trafficking charges.

Trump in remarks before a House Republican retreat in Washington grumbled that Democrats were not giving him credit for a successful military operation, even though there was bipartisan agreement that Maduro was not the rightful president of Venezuela.

In 2020, Maduro was indicted in the United States, accused in a decades-long narco-terrorism and international cocaine trafficking conspiracy. White House officials have noted that Biden's administration in his final days in office last year raised the award for information leading to Maduro's arrest after he assumed a third term in office despite evidence suggesting that he lost Venezuela's most recent election. The Trump administration doubled the award to $50 million in August.

“You know, at some point, they should say, ‘You know, you did a great job. Thank you. Congratulations.' Wouldn't it be good?” Trump said. “I would say that if they did a good job, their philosophies are so different. But if they did a good job, I'd be happy for the country. They've been after this guy for years and years and years.”

Americans are split about the capture of Maduro — with many still forming opinions — according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and SSRS using text messages over the weekend. About 4 in 10 approved of the U.S. military being sent to capture Maduro, while roughly the same share were opposed. About 2 in 10 were unsure.

Nearly half of Americans, 45%, were opposed to the U.S. taking control of Venezuela and choosing a new government for the country. About 9 in 10 Americans said the Venezuelan people should be the ones to decide the future leadership of their country.

Maduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges in a U.S. courtroom on Monday. U.S. forces captured Maduro and his wife early Saturday in a raid on a compound where they were surrounded by Cuban guards.

In the days since Maduro's ouster, Trump and top administration officials have raised anxiety around the globe that the operation could mark the beginning of a more expansionist U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. The president in recent days has renewed his calls for an American takeover of the Danish territory of Greenland for the sake of U.S. security interests and threatened military action on Colombia for facilitating the global sale of cocaine, while his top diplomat declared the communist government in Cuba is “in a lot of trouble.”

Colombia's Foreign Affairs Minister Rosa Villavicencio said Tuesday she'll meet with the U.S. Embassy's charge d'affaires in Bogota to present him with a formal complaint over the recent threats issued by the United States.

On Sunday, Trump said he wasn't ruling out an attack on Colombia and described its president, who's been an outspoken critic of the U.S. pressure campaign on Venezuela, as a “sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States.”

Villavicencio said she's hoping to strengthen relations with the United States and improve cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking.

“It is necessary for the Trump administration to know in more detail about all that we are doing in the fight against drug trafficking,” she said.

Meanwhile, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom on Tuesday joined Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in defending Greenland's sovereignty. The island is a self-governing territory of the kingdom of Denmark and thus part of the NATO military alliance.

“Greenland belongs to its people,” the statement said. “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A series of mild eruptions at the most active volcano in the Philippines has prompted the evacuation of nearly 3,000 villagers in a permanent danger zone on its foothills, officials said Wednesday.

Authorities raised the 5-step alert around Mayon Volcano in the northeastern province of Albay to level 3 on Tuesday after detecting intermittent rockfalls, some as big as cars, from its peak crater in recent days along with deadly pyroclastic flows — a fast-moving avalanche of super-hot rock fragments, ash and gas.

Alert level 5 would indicate a major explosive eruption, often with violent ejections of ash and debris and widespread ashfall, is underway.

“This is already an eruption, a quiet one, with lava accumulating up the peak and swelling the dome, which cracked in some parts and resulted in rockfalls, some as big as cars,” Teresito Bacolcol, the country's chief volcanologist, told The Associated Press.

He said it is too early to tell if Mayon's restiveness would worsen and lead to a major and violent eruption given the absence of other key signs of unrest, like a spike in volcanic earthquake and high levels of sulfur dioxide emissions.

Troops, police and disaster-mitigation personnel helped evacuate more than 2,800 villagers from 729 households inside a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) radius from the volcano's crater that officials have long designated a permanent danger zone, demarcated by concrete warning signs, Albay provincial officials said.

Another 600 villagers living outside the permanent danger zone have evacuated voluntarily to government-run emergency shelters to be safely away from the volcano, Claudio Yucot, regional director of the Office of Civil Defense, said.




Entry to the permanent danger zone in the volcano's foothills is prohibited, but thousands of villagers have flouted the restrictions and made it their home or maintained farms on and off for generations. Lucrative businesses, such as sand and gravel quarrying and sightseeing tours, have also thrived openly despite the ban and the mountain's frequent eruptions — now 54 times since record began in 1616.

The 2,462-meter (8,007-foot) volcano is one of the Philippines' top tourism draws because of its near-perfect cone shape. But it's also the most active of the country's 24 restive volcanoes.

A terrifying symbol of Mayon's deadly fury is the belfry of a 16th-century Franciscan stone church which protrudes from the ground in Albay. It's all that's left of a baroque church that was buried by volcanic mudflow along with the town of Cagsawa in an 1814 eruption which killed about 1,200 people, including many who sought refuge in the church, about 13 kilometers (8 miles) from the volcano.

The thousands of people who live within Mayon's danger zone reflect the plight of many impoverished Filipinos who are forced to live in dangerous places across the archipelago — near active volcanoes like Mayon, on landslide-prone mountainsides, along vulnerable coastlines, atop earthquake fault lines, and in low-lying villages often engulfed by flash floods.

Each year, about 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines, which lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of fault lines along the Pacific Ocean basin often hit by volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Had history turned out differently, Tim Walz might be about to begin his second year as vice president. Instead, the Minnesota governor is thinking about going back to teaching geography.

“What I'm really good at is, I'm a really good geography teacher,” Walz said with a laugh at a press conference Tuesday. “I think that's something where I would find the joy in, in getting back in there, trying to teach.”

Before Walz ran for Congress and later governor, he was a teacher and football coach at Mankato West High School in southern Minnesota.

Walz's political future looked bright in 2024 when his legislative successes and folksy image helped entice Kamala Harris to choose him as her running mate. Though they lost, Walz was still seen as a rising star within the Democratic Party — even a possible presidential candidate for 2028.

But Walz, who has come under fire for failing to prevent massive fraud in government programs on his watch, on Monday abandoned his quest for a third term as governor. 

He told reporters Tuesday that he doesn't know what his future holds, except that he plans to run some marathons and defend the title that he won in his age division in a shorter “Turkey Trot” race on Thanksgiving. He said he also expects to be tied up for the next year with trying to fight off the Trump administration's targeting of Minnesota, including a surge of federal officers into the state.

“Look, I got a year of work to do here. I think it will be the most challenging year, and that includes probably COVID,” he said, referring to how he spent much of 2020 leading the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic. “I caution Minnesotans, this is going to get worse before it gets better. … For me, I'm going to do this work.”




Walz also highlighted one of his proudest accomplishments in office, the Jan. 1 launch of a paid family and medical leave program, which the Legislature passed in 2023 after Democrats took full control of the statehouse for two years.

Walz and his allies used the relatively rare break in Minnesota's usual pattern of divided government to eliminate nearly all abortion restrictions enacted by Minnesota Republicans, protect gender-affirming care for transgender youth and legalize recreational marijuana. The list of Democratic priorities they enacted also included free school meals for all students and gun safety measures.

Dan Hofrenning, a political scientist at St. Olaf College, said he thinks the end of Walz's candidacy for governor is probably the end of his career in elected office.

“One never says never on political futures, but two-term governor, vice presidential candidate, that's a pretty good run,” Hofrenning said. “And at the end of that run, pulling out of the race is a recognition that he had some strong political vulnerabilities.”

Had Walz lost, Hofrenning said, his reputation would have been further tarnished. But Walz now has the chance to move into an “elder statesman role,” he said. Walz could be a potential cabinet secretary or ambassador if a Democrat wins the 2028 presidential race, he said. 

University of Minnesota political scientist Larry Jacobs wasn't ready to write Walz off just yet. He said the governor is a “very talented politician who brings some unique skill sets” to the Democratic Party.

“After you pull out like this, it's easy to say ‘no future' because he's going out on a downer, and it looks like he has his tail between his legs, but I think that might be shortsighted,” Jacobs said. “There could be a spot in a year or two when this has blown over a bit and he's got an opportunity, perhaps, to run for U.S. Senate.”

But Jacobs isn't sure that becoming a cabinet secretary is in the cards for Walz.

“I think his stay in the national scene as a VP candidate didn't leave him in high standing,” Jacobs said. “There's a real perception of him as kind of out of his league.”

Walz earns about $127,000 a year as governor and has listed his main assets as his pension and other retirement plans. A Wall Street Journal analysis in 2024 put his and his wife's net worth at $800,000. Forbes went higher with an estimate of just over $1 million, but said he was “the least wealthy politician on a major party ticket” that election cycle.

“He's going to need employment. Maybe he finds himself a new niche, maybe in the foundation world,” Jacobs said. “But I don't think this is a guy who's going to retire in the near future.”

WAKISO, Uganda (AP) — The Ugandan presidential candidate known as Bobi Wine wears a flak jacket and helmet while campaigning to protect himself from gunfire. But the safety gear offers no protection from the stinging clouds of tear gas that often follow him on the campaign trail. 

Wine is challenging President Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986 by repeatedly rewriting the rules to stay in power. Term and age limits have been scrapped, rivals jailed or sidelined, and state security forces are a constant presence at opposition rallies as Museveni seeks a seventh term in elections on Jan. 15.

Wine, a musician-turned-politician whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, faced similar setbacks in 2021, when he first ran for president. He was often roughed up by the police, clothes ripped from his body, and dozens of his supporters were jailed. 

In a recent interview with The Associated Press, he charged that this time “the military has largely taken over the election” and that at least three of his supporters have been killed in violent campaign events. 

“It has been very violent. There's been a lot of impunity to the extent that we are denied the right to use the public roads,” he said. “We are hounded by security and followed by over 40 police and military cars. Everywhere I go to campaign, (the) day before, the military comes, beats up people, intimidates them, warns them against attending the rallies I address.”

The human rights group Amnesty International says the use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings and other acts of violence amount to “a brutal campaign of repression” ahead of the vote.

In a New Year's Eve address, the president said he recommended that the security forces use more tear gas to break up crowds of what he called “the criminal opposition.”

“Using tear gas for rioters is both legal and non-lethal,” Museveni said in a televised speech. “It doesn't kill. It is much better than using live bullets.”

Security forces, notably the military, have repeatedly broken up Wine's campaign rallies, sending his supporters scampering into ditches and swamps. 

Critics note that Museveni, in contrast, campaigns without disruption and can go wherever he wants. Some charge that the election is simply a ritual to keep Museveni in power, not a fair exercise that could possibly lead to a change of government in the east African nation of 45 million.

Wine, the most prominent of seven opposition candidates, has urged supporters to show courage before the security forces, although he has not called outright for protests. He said he wants his supporters to cast “protest votes” in large numbers against Museveni's party on election day. 

In his interview with the AP, Wine cited at least three deaths at his rallies, including a man shot by the military and another run over by a military truck. The offenses can go unpunished because the electoral authorities, the police and the army “serve the sitting government,” he said. Police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke said he was not aware of the alleged incidents.

Museveni is the third-longest-serving leader in Africa. Now he seeks to extend his rule into a fifth decade.

He first took power by force as the leader of a guerrilla army that said it wanted to restore democracy after a period of civil war and the cruel dictatorship of Idi Amin.

Decades ago, Museveni criticized African leaders who overstayed their time in power. Years later, Ugandan lawmakers did the same thing for him when they jettisoned the last constitutional obstacle — age limits — for a possible life presidency. 

His son, army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has asserted his wish to succeed his father, raising fears of hereditary rule as Museveni has no recognizable successor in the upper ranks of the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement. 

Museveni has been elected six times, nearly all of those polls marred by violence and allegations of vote rigging. He has since fallen out with many of the comrades who fought alongside him, including some who say he betrayed the ideals of their bush-war struggle. One of them is Kizza Besigye, once Museveni's personal doctor, who has been jailed for over a year and repeatedly denied bail after facing treason charges.

Besigye was Uganda's most prominent opposition leader before the rise of Wine, 43, who presents a different challenge for Museveni as the face of youthful hope for change. Wine has a large following among working-class people in urban areas, and his party has the most seats of any opposition party in Parliament.

In the 2021 election, Wine secured 35% of the vote, while Museveni, with 58%, posted his worst-ever result, establishing Wine as a serious challenger for power. 

Yet Museveni dismisses Wine as an agent of foreign interests and questions his patriotism. “Mr. Kyagulanyi and his evil foreigners that back him fail to understand that Uganda is a land of spiritual and political martyrs,” Museveni said in his New Year's Eve address.

Sarah Bireete, a government critic who runs the non-governmental group Center for Constitutional Governance, was arrested last week and criminally charged over allegations she unlawfully shared data related to the national voters' registry. The charges are yet to be substantiated.

A magistrate remanded her to jail until Jan. 21, a decision that drew condemnation from some civic leaders as politically motivated because it silenced Bireete's work as a commentator ahead of voting. 

Before her arrest, Bireete had told the AP that Museveni's Uganda was “a military dictatorship,” not a democracy. 

“The evidence is out for everyone to see that indeed Uganda can no longer claim to be a constitutional democracy,” she said.

Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence from colonial rule six decades ago. That raises the stakes as an aging Museveni increasingly depends on a security apparatus helmed by his son, Gen. Kainerugaba.

Kainerugaba has warned force could be used against Wine, including threatening to behead him in one of several tweets widely condemned as reckless a year ago.

Museveni “can't credibly claim to oppose repressive tactics that his own administration has employed for years,” said Gerald Bareebe, a Ugandan who is an associate professor of politics at Canada's York University, speaking of Museveni's advice to the security forces. 

Bareebe pointed out that some within Museveni's party think the security forces have gone too far. Even they “are outraged by the brutal tactics employed by the police and military against innocent civilians,” he said.

Exiled Crown Prince of Iran Reza Pahlavi says that the Iranian people ‘more than ever' are committed to the fall of the regime as protests continue on ‘Hannity.'

Iranian protesters intensified nationwide demonstrations over the past 24 hours, directly appealing to President Donald Trump while chanting anti-regime slogans. Footage published Wednesday showed a protester in Tehran symbolically renaming a street after Trump, while other videos captured handwritten appeals reading, ""Don't let them kill us,"" Iran International reported.

Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, posted the video on X stating, ""Since Trump's comments about the Iran protests, I've seen numbers videos of Iranian protesters either thanking him or, in this case, renaming streets after the US president.""

The appeals came as demonstrators faced a widening security crackdown, including the deployment of armed units and tear gas near major civilian sites in Tehran.

TRUMP SIGNS 'MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN' HAT ALONGSIDE LINDSEY GRAHAM

Exiled Iranian opposition leader Reza Pahlavi said the current unrest represents a historic opportunity to end Iran's Islamic Republic.

""In all these years, I've never seen an opportunity as we see today in Iran,"" Pahlavi said in an interview aired Tuesday on ""Hannity.""

""Iranian people are more than ever committed to bringing an end to this regime, as the world has witnessed in the last few days, the level of demonstrations is unprecedented in Iran,"" he said.

Pahlavi said protests have spread to more than 100 cities and emphasized the role of Iran's traditional merchant class, describing developments inside the country's bazaars as a turning point. ""We are beginning to see more and more defections,"" Pahlavi said, adding that ""Either way, the regime is crumbling and is very close to collapsing.""

Over the past 24 hours, Iran International reported continued protests and strikes across the country, including in Tehran, Tabriz, Qazvin, Kermanshah, Kerman, Shiraz, Falavarjan and Bandar Abbas. Tehran's Grand Bazaar remained a focal point of unrest, with large crowds chanting against Iran's leadership as authorities responded with tear gas and armed deployments.

Security operations expanded into sensitive civilian locations. Videos published by Iran International showed tear gas used near or inside Tehran's Sina Hospital and the Plasco Shopping Center.

Casualty and arrest figures continued to rise. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, cited by Iran International on Wednesday, reported at least 36 people killed since protests began, including 34 protesters and two members of Iran's security forces, with more than 2,000 arrests nationwide. Iranian authorities have not released updated official figures.

New footage from the past day showed demonstrators lighting fires in the streets of Shiraz and chanting ""Death to Khamenei,"" referring to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. In Qazvin, protesters were heard chanting, ""Law enforcement, return to the side of the nation.""

Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin reports on the fallout of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's decision to drop reelection bid and more on 'Special Report.'

Former pro hockey player Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., raised eyebrows Tuesday with a social media post referencing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's recent decision to not seek re-election but refusal to resign, as Walz vows to address the state's ongoing fraud issues. 

Staub's post compared Walz's determination to fight fraudsters to the infamous 1994 murder trial of former NFL player O.J. Simpson, when Simpson vowed to find his wife's killer after being acquitted for the murder of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. 

""Tim Walz staying in office to fight the fraudsters is like O.J. saying he'd look for the real killer. He should resign,"" Stauber wrote.

A Walz spokesperson responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Stauber's post. 

""Lol that is not news!"" the spokesperson said. 

Although Simpson was acquitted in the 1994 case, he later lost a civil lawsuit connected to the deaths. Simpson was found liable in civil court in 1997 and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages. Most of that judgment went unpaid during Simpson's lifetime.

Simpson died last April after a private cancer battle. Near the end of his life, he remained in Las Vegas and returned to the public eye on X, posting reactions to current events. Simpson's estate has taken a key step toward paying Goldman's family nearly $58 million — nearly three decades after Goldman won a wrongful death judgment in a civil case against Simpson, according to a November report by TMZ.

Meanwhile, Walz has been the subject of immense national scrutiny since October. He ended his bid for an unprecedented third term amid stinging criticism from Republicans and some Democrats over his handling of his state's massive welfare assistance fraud scandal.

However, Walz insisted Tuesday he will not step down from his position, and passionately declared he will stay in office to help fight the state's fraudsters who potentially stole billions of dollars in taxpayer dollars under his watch. 

""I'm not going anywhere. And you can make all your requests for me to resign. Over my dead body will that happen,"" Walz said. 

More than 90 people — most from Minnesota's large Somali community — have been charged since 2022 in what has been described as the nation's largest COVID-era scheme. How much money has been stolen through alleged money laundering operations involving fraudulent meal and housing programs, daycare centers and Medicaid services is still being tabulated. But the U.S. attorney in Minnesota said the scope of the fraud could exceed $1 billion and rise to as high as $9 billion.

Prosecutors said some of the dozens that have already pleaded guilty in the case used the money to buy luxury cars, real estate, jewelry and international vacations, with some of the funds also sent overseas and potentially into the hands of Islamic terrorists.

""This is on my watch, I am accountable for this and, more importantly, I am the one that will fix it,"" Walz told reporters last month, taking responsibility for the scandal.

President Donald Trump dedicated a speech to Republican lawmakers to Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026.

The death of Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., has shrunk the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to the minimum of 218 seats, presenting fresh challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson as the party heads into an election year.

LaMalfa, 65, died suddenly on Tuesday during an emergency surgery. He was a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and a reliable vote for Johnson's priorities. His death means Johnson can only lose two Republican votes and still pass legislation along party lines.

Trump rallied behind Johnson during a retreat for House GOP lawmakers at the Trump-Kennedy Center on Tuesday.

""A lot of times they'll say, ‘I wish Mike were tougher,'"" Trump told assembled Republicans. ""He's tough. He's tough as anybody in the room, actually. But can't be tough when you have a majority of three, and now sadly, a little bit less than that.""

SCOOP: HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS LAYS OUT GOP BATTLE PLAN AHEAD OF REPUBLICANS' HUDDLE WITH TRUMP

LaMalfa's death landed on the same day that Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation went into effect. The now-former Georgia congresswoman's seat won't be filled until a March 10 special election. Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is required by state law to hold an election for LaMalfa's seat within the next two weeks.

Democrats are also poised to refill their ranks in the coming weeks, however. Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Texas, died in March and an election to fill his seat is scheduled for the end of January. Likewise, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., was elected governor of her state in November. Her seat is set to be filled in a special election in April.

Trump dedicated his Tuesday address to LaMalfa, saying he had considered canceling the speech to Republican lawmakers.

""I spoke to Doug, but I didn't speak to him, you know? I mean, we never had a problem. I was really saddened by his passing and was thinking about not even doing the speech in his honor,"" Trump said. ""But then I decided that I have to do it in his honor. I'll do it in his honor because he would've wanted it that way.""

""He would've said, 'Do that speech! Are you kidding me? Do the speech,'"" he continued. ""He was a fantastic person. Man, that was a quick one. I don't know quite yet what happened, but boy is that a tough one. He was just with us. He was our friend. All of us, every one of us.""

LaMalfa was known as a champion of conservative causes as well as a kind man to both reporters and his fellow House lawmakers.

The congressman represented the 1st Congressional District in Northern California and was chair of the Congressional Western Caucus.

Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley joins ‘America's Newsroom' to discuss the potential timeline for Nicolas Maduro's trial and the fallout after Vice President JD Vance's Ohio home was vandalized. 

For the past 26 years, we have witnessed the devastating impact of socialism on the Venezuelan people. Today, we are filled with hope as we watch President Donald Trump take action to end that nightmare. Under Trump's leadership, the United States is not only restoring order, but also implementing a modern vision of the Monroe Doctrine — countering foreign adversaries and paving the way for security and prosperity in the region.

President Trump's actions in Venezuela are necessary and entirely lawful, grounded in well-established U.S. precedents for intervention in the Western Hemisphere. Drawing from historical examples, such as the 1983 invasion of Grenada to rescue Americans and halt a communist coup — and the 1989 invasion of Panama to oust the drug-trafficking dictator Manuel Noriega, Trump has ample legal authority under Article II of the Constitution as commander in chief. 

These interventions were justified under the need to protect U.S. citizens, combat threats to regional stability and advance U.S. interests against narcotics and communism. Similarly, Trump's deployment draws on the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) framework and executive powers affirmed by the Supreme Court, which recognizes the president's broad authority in foreign affairs. 

‘NOT EVEN IN MY MOST OPTIMISTIC FANTASIES': VENEZUELAN REFUGEE WHO FLED PERSECUTION PRAISES MADURO'S CAPTURE

These precedents underscore that when a neighboring regime poses a clear and present danger — through mass migration, drug flows and alliances with hostile powers — the U.S. has the right to act decisively. Moreover, Trump's bold strike aligns with the principles of just war theory, which justifies military action when it meets criteria such as just cause, right intention and proportionality.

Unlike previous presidents — who lacked the courage to defend America against encroaching socialism, allowing regimes like Maduro's to fester and export chaos — Trump's resolve marks a pivotal shift, invoking tools like the Alien Enemies Act and the War Powers Resolution to confront these dangers head-on. While prior U.S. administrations squandered resources on misguided foreign policy programs, including the promotion of LGBT and gender ideology initiatives that alienated traditional allies and distracted from core threats, Trump's actions have swept away such follies, refocusing American foreign policy on tangible results and moral clarity.

True to his word, President Trump is fulfilling his promises by addressing the Venezuelan crisis head-on, including securing the nation's vast oil reserves. By taking control of the oil that powered the communist regime for over two decades, Trump is reclaiming resources that have been weaponized against America. 

These moves echo Trump's ""America First"" ethos, ensuring that Venezuelan oil bolsters U.S. energy independence rather than funding anti-American forces. It's a pragmatic step toward stabilization, preventing further humanitarian collapse and stemming the tide of refugees overwhelming our borders. Importantly, Americans played a key role in developing Venezuela's oil infrastructure in the early 20th century, with American companies investing heavily to build refineries, pipelines and extraction facilities that transformed the nation into a major producer. Yet, under communist Hugo Chávez, this infrastructure was confiscated through nationalization and expropriation, stripping rightful stakeholders and leading to its decay because of communist plundering.

""Operation Absolute Resolve,"" conducted by the U.S. Department of War, represents a robust implementation of the Monroe Doctrine, originally proclaimed in 1823 to ward off European powers. Now evolved, under Trump as the ""Donroe Doctrine,"" this hemispheric strategy aims to counter contemporary threats from communist China, Cuba, as well as Russia and Iran. These adversaries have entrenched themselves in Venezuela: China through predatory loans and resource extraction, Cuba via its intelligence apparatus propping up Maduro's repression and Russia with military advisors and arms deals that destabilize the region. 

Trump's intervention is challenging this axis of authoritarianism, hopefully expelling foreign influencers and reasserting U.S. primacy in our backyard by implementing the new National Security Strategy. By dismantling these networks, we not only neutralize immediate security risks — like potential missile bases or cyber threats — but also send a clear message that the Americas will no longer be a playground for hostile forces. To ensure success, the embargo on Venezuelan oil must continue until the dictatorial regime is no longer in power.

Ultimately, Venezuela's oil must be administered by the United States to ensure a smooth transition. American stewardship provides the economic leverage needed for reconstruction and the incoming investments by U.S. energy firms will only benefit Venezuelan citizens. Under U.S. oversight, we can root out corruption, rebuild infrastructure and avoid the costly nation-building mistakes of the past that were paid for by American taxpayers.

Venezuela's liberation by Trump proves that America is back. Communist dictators in Cuba and Nicaragua should take note: Under the ""Donroe Doctrine,"" we will no longer sit idle as an axis of evil grows in our backyard.

Fox News correspondent Alexis McAdams reports on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's presser about his decision to not run for re-election amid his state's fraud scandal. Minnesota Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson gives analysis on ‘America Reports.'

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., will accuse top Minnesota government officials of being ""asleep at the wheel"" at the start of his panel's high-profile hearing into alleged fraud.

In Comer's opening statement, obtained by Fox News Digital, he is expected to question whether ""Governor Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, and Minnesota's Democratic leadership"" were negligent or ""complicit"" in the growing scandal.

""Minnesota's social services — which are funded by you, the American taxpayer — are being ripped off. The most vulnerable are suffering as a result,"" Comer will say, according to his prepared remarks. 

""The fraudsters — many of whom are from Minnesota's Somali community — have stolen from programs meant to feed needy kids, provide services to autistic children, house low-income and disabled Americans, and provide healthcare to vulnerable Medicaid recipients.""

Federal prosecutors in Minnesota have charged multiple people with stealing more than $240 million from the Federal Child Nutrition Program through the Minnesota-based nonprofit Feeding Our Future.

However, the probe has since widened to multiple state-run programs being investigated for potential fraud. Childcare providers receiving state funding, mainly within the Somali community, are also under scrutiny.

U.S. attorneys have alleged that billions more dollars could have fallen prey to fraud in the state, something Walz has pushed back on while accusing Republicans of politicizing the scandal.

""Fraudsters like these take millions to enrich themselves while providing nothing, overstating, or outright faking the services. How many children have gone hungry because fraudsters stole money that was intended to provide them with food?"" Comer will say.

""How many autistic children were denied services because fraudsters instead sent this money overseas? How many low-income seniors, people with disabilities, or those with mental illnesses were denied access to housing because fraudsters drained resources and pocketed the money for themselves?""

Comer will argue in his statement that the revelations so far are ""just the tip of the iceberg.""

Comer summoned Walz and Ellison for a follow-up hearing on Feb. 10, but it's not yet clear if they will attend.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., will also take part in Wednesday's hearing, Fox News Digital was told. Emmer is a longtime critic of Walz's administration and represents a district that's home to two out of three of the hearing's GOP witnesses.

Global powers aligned against the Western bloc, led by the United States, see President Donald Trump's implementation of the Monroe Doctrine as a glaring indicator that the rules-based world order is crumbling.

The Monroe Doctrine, named for and implemented by President James Monroe in 1823, established that the U.S. would take action to prevent colonization of foreign nations in North and South America. Trump has resurrected this imperative since taking power in his second term, with his State Department explicitly declaring: “This is OUR Hemisphere, and President Trump will not allow our security to be threatened.”

Chief among the administration's move in embracing the focus on the Western Hemisphere: Capturing and arresting former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.

Russia and Iran have been among the most prominent critics of Trump's operation against Maduro, undoubtedly due in part to their vested interests in sustaining an allied regime so close to the U.S.

“We had Russian and Iranian interests that were looking to diversify, to be able to beat sanctions — whether it's by the ghost fleet delivering the oil, or the money-laundering exercises that would get around the sanctions that were meant to put penalties in place for the rogue activity of the Venezuelan regime,” Steven Yates, a senior research fellow for National Security Policy at the Heritage Foundation, told the Washington Examiner.

“And to a degree, the Russians and Iranians, they were violating international norms and face sanctions themselves. So this does strike a blow to the sort of axis of do-no-gooders that were trying to seek advantage in our own hemisphere,” Yates continued. “And also seeking to skirt responsibility for the things they were doing — whether it's Russia versus Ukraine, or Iran versus a number of different counterparts […] in the Middle East.”

The Atlantic Council asserted in a November 2025 report that Russia has been a “vital source of military and economic aid for Venezuela” since coming to Maduro's aid in 2000.

“In return for arms and money, Russia gains a significant foothold in South America, helping to fulfill Putin's ambitions of making Russia a great power and challenging the United States in its own hemisphere,” the Atlantic Council explained. “Russia's support for Venezuela furthers the Kremlin's ability to act as a spoiler for U.S. interests, and it has the potential to pull U.S. attention and resources away from opposing Russian aggression in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe.”

The Kremlin has voiced outrage at the abduction of Maduro, characterizing it as evidence that “there is basically no international law.”

The question in Russian strategists' minds is whether the U.S. will allow other world powers to implement similar policies of regional domination.

“There is only the law ​of force — but Russia has known that for a long time,” former Kremlin adviser Sergei Markov told Reuters on Tuesday. “Is the United States really ready to recognize Russia's dominance over the former Soviet Union, or is it simply that the United States is so strong that it will not tolerate any great powers even close to it?”

The Chinese are similarly upset by the resurrection of the Monroe Doctrine.

“The U.S.'s move is in clear violation of international law, basic norms in international relations, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian told reporters on Monday. “China calls on the U.S. to ensure the personal safety of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, release them at once, stop toppling the government of Venezuela, and resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation.”

China has been the primary purchaser of Venezuelan oil since 2016, buying up approximately 80% of the country's gross production at highly discounted prices. It is not a foundational cut of the Chinese oil economy, but the full extent of its impact is difficult to trace due to the laundering of oil through Chinese “teapot” refineries that rebrand it as outside oil.

Beijing has lambasted the Trump administration for decapitating the China-friendly government, scolding its U.S. counterparts in moralized, legalistic messages characteristic of the Chinese Communist Party.

“As the US military reinforces its deployments in the region and tit-for-tat interception operations become normalized, the risk of miscalculation or accidental incidents involving frontline personnel on both sides will rise sharply,” Cui Shoujin, the director of Renmin University of China's Institute of International Development Studies, warned in the Beijing-operated news outlet Global Times on Wednesday.

Observers have speculated that the invasion of Venezuela could invigorate paramount leader Xi Jinping's timeline to act on his own goal of annexing the island of Taiwan.

Jack Burnham, an analyst for the China Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Washington Examiner that the Communist Party is unlikely to take drastic action in response to a display of American intervention.

“China's perspective on the international system is fundamentally revisionist, rooted in power over principle,” Burnham told the Washington Examiner. “Across its foreign policy, Beijing speaks the language of strength, building up its military, safeguarding its economic self-sufficiency, and increasingly preparing for the possibility of conflict within its own region.”

TRUMP DANGLES ‘REIMBURSEMENT' INCENTIVE FOR US COMPANIES TO UNLEASH VENEZUELAN OIL SECTOR IN UNDER 18 MONTHS

He continued, “Trump's moves towards Venezuela won't move up Xi's timeline for Taiwan; rather, Beijing will treat it as a reminder of the underlying righteousness of its perspective and a call to prioritize its capacity to project power.”

While Trump's National Security Strategy does place a heightened focus on the western hemisphere — calling for “a Hemisphere whose governments cooperate with us against narco-terrorists, cartels, and other transnational criminal organizations” — the administration's policy doesn't turn a blind eye to interests in other regions. 

Iran, another major partner of Maduro, is currently suffering a groundswell of popular protest against their ruling Islamic regime.

Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon has warned New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani‘s administration about anti-white discrimination.

Her warning to Mamdani's administration came after the new mayor appointed the controversial Cea Weaver as his “tenant advocate” earlier this month. An old video of Weaver was recently circulated on social media in which she expressed left-wing ideological principles regarding property ownership, specifying that there would be a transition to treating property as a “collective good” and a model of shared equity.

Weaver specifically emphasized that “white families” will have to have a “different relationship to property.”

“I think the reality is that for centuries we really treated property as an individualized good and not a collective good, and we are … transitioning to treating it as a collective good towards a model of shared equity,” Weaver said in an unearthed video making its rounds on social media.

“It will require that we think about it differently, and it will mean that families, especially white families, but some POC families who are homeowners as well, are going to have a different relationship to property than the one that we currently have,” Weaver said.

Additionally, social media posts from 2019 show Weaver commented that property ownership was white supremacy.

“Private property including any kind of ESPECIALLY homeownership is a weapon of white supremacy masquerading as ‘wealth building' public policy,” Weaver said in a post from August 2019.

“On notice!!” Dhillon said in a post on X about Weaver's rhetoric.

On notice!! https://t.co/1UaFSINTBp

“New York: Consider this your official notice from @TheJusticeDept,” Dhillon added. “We will NOT tolerate discrimination based on skin color. It is ILLEGAL. @CivilRights is paying very close attention. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

During an interview on One America News Network's Fine Point with Chanel Rion, Dhillon also said discrimination against white people is still discrimination and that it would not be tolerated.

“Just because you're white doesn't mean you have fewer rights in this country. We all have equal rights in our country, and we will not stand for New York City violating any federal law whatsoever,” Dhillon said. “They should be on notice. They are on high scrutiny.”

“And we will swoop right in and do what's necessary to protect all citizens and taxpayers and residents in New York who are there legally,” she added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The man who turns President Trump's most incendiary impulses into policy

Stephen Miller runs his daily 10 a.m. conference calls—yes, even on Saturdays—less like a government adviser and more like a wartime general. His is the dominant voice, as he plays the role of browbeater, inquisitor, and bully. He accepts no excuses, entertains no dissent.

Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy ruthlessly pursues the president's vision, especially when it comes to pushing immigrants out of the country, and he runs a tight, efficient meeting. Consensus is not the goal.

Instead, Miller demands progress reports on his mass-deportation campaign and issues orders to the full alphabet soup of federal enforcement agencies, including the FBI, CBP, ICE, HHS, and the DOD. One senior official who has participated in the calls told us that the intensity and urgency often veer into hectoring. “He pushes everybody to the absolute limit because he knows that the clock is ticking,” this person said. “He gets on the phone and he yells at everybody. Nobody is spared from his wrath.”

In May, Miller told Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials that he wanted 3,000 immigration arrests a day, a nearly tenfold increase over the number they'd arrested on U.S. streets in 2024. He demands daily updates on the ICE hiring surge too; the administration had pledged to deploy 10,000 new deportation officers by this month—more than doubling the agency's workforce. And Miller expects regular updates on detention capacity, deportation flights, and border crossings.

Miller publicly shames bureaucrats he feels are falling short or resisting orders. “If there's a problem and you're the owner, you have to fix it quickly,” another frequent conference-call participant told us. “It's not a place where you can say, ‘I have to get back to you.'”

A third official told us that the calls are unlike any other government meetings they've attended. “If you say something stupid, he'll tell you to your face. You are expected to perform at a certain level, and there's no excuse for not meeting those expectations,” this person said.

In Trump's inner circle—even with the president himself—Miller is known as a dogmatic force whose ideas are sometimes too extreme for public consumption. “I'd love to have him come up and explain his true feelings—maybe not his truest feelings,” the president joked at an Oval Office briefing in October. But in Trump's second term, Miller finds himself at the height of his powers—the pulsing human id of a president who is already almost pure id.

Miller has tried to recast the nation's partisan political disagreements as an existential conflict, a battle pitting “forces of wickedness and evil” against the nation's noble, virtuous people—a mostly native-born crowd that traces its lineage and legacy “back to Athens, to Rome, to Philadelphia, to Monticello.” He accuses federal judges of “legal insurrection” for ruling against Trump's policies, describes the Democratic Party as a “domestic extremist organization,” and dismisses the results of even legal immigration programs as “the Somalification of America.” And he has declared an end to the post–World War II order of “international niceties” in favor of a world that rebukes the weak, “that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” as he put it this week when discussing recent military action against Venezuela.

Along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Miller was the chief force behind Trump's decision to capture the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro. “We are a superpower, and under President Trump, we are going to conduct ourselves as a superpower,” Miller told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday, articulating a worldview that started with the fear of immigration but has gradually expanded to a broader national-security and rule-of-law argument. (In this Darwinian vein, Miller also declared that the U.S. military could seize Greenland without a fight, echoing a social-media post that his wife, Katie Miller, had made two days earlier, showing an American flag superimposed on a map of the icy landmass alongside the word: SOON. NATO leaders have nervously affirmed Denmark's claim to the territory.)

Miller's official titles—he is also the director of the interagency Homeland Security Council—understate the full sweep of his purview. Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and a Miller ally, describes him as Trump's “prime minister.” Miller has a role in nearly every area about which he cares deeply: immigration and border security, yes, but also national security, foreign policy, trade, military action, and policing. He may draft a flurry of executive orders one day, lead a meeting on lowering domestic beef prices the next, and travel to deliver a fiery speech of his own—think Trump at his angriest and most dystopian, without any of the president's impish humor—the following week. (Miller declined to comment for this story.)

Early in Trump's second term, he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to treat migrants as part of a foreign invasion, directed Congress to pass $150 billion in new funding for homeland-security enforcement, and captained the administration's assault on elite universities such as Harvard and Columbia. Late last year, he helped orchestrate Trump's authorization of military strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, setting the stage for the military operation against Maduro.

The force behind Miller's directives became clear during Signalgate—in which the Trump administration accidentally included The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, on a private Signal chat about a bombing campaign in Yemen. It was Miller—not Trump's national security adviser, Pentagon chief, or even vice president—who ended the debate and directed the group to move forward with the strikes. Trump has described Miller as sitting “at the top of the totem poll” inside the White House.

“He oversees every policy the administration touches,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told us. “I can't tell you the number of times a policy matter is discussed in the Oval and Trump will say, ‘Where's Stephen? Tell him to get that done.'”

To critics, Miller is the smirking embodiment of everything they view as dangerous and authoritarian about the Trump administration. He has been called a Nazi, a neo-Nazi, a white supremacist, a kapo, and Lord Voldemort. Posters of Miller—pursed lips, furrowed brow—have been plastered around the nation's capital, stamped with CREEP and FASCISM AIN'T PRETTY. His own uncle has denounced him, writing at one point that if Miller's immigration policies had been implemented a century ago, their family—which fled anti-Jewish pogroms in Europe—“would have been wiped out.” 

Yet if Miller has internalized any of the criticism, or acknowledged the parallels to his own lineage, he has not shown it, even among friends or colleagues. Miller is now acting as an accelerant for the president's most incendiary impulses and shaping the lives of individual Americans in nearly every realm. He has demonstrated neither the interest nor the ability to moderate his views—even for tactical purposes. He is apt to overreach. And he has shown that he's not afraid to use the power of the government to go after those who try to stand in his way—even his liberal neighbors, whom he has accused of threatening his family.

During Trump's first term, Miller pushed the family-separation policy at the southern border, a measure long considered too extreme to implement. It triggered such a massive backlash that Trump's wife and eldest daughter urged him to stop it. The separations became the defining immigration policy of Trump's first term, undermining his ability to run on the issue in 2020. Now that he's back in office, the latest polling shows eroding support for the president's immigration crackdown, especially among the Latino voters who helped carry him to victory in 2024.

But Miller has continued to push not just for the deportation of people in the country illegally but also for narrowing or closing legal immigration pathways, especially for people from poor, not-majority-white, non-Christian nations. His actions have struck many Americans as racist and xenophobic. (In 2019, for instance, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported on leaked emails in which Miller urged the conservative Breitbart News to promote ideas from The Camp of the Saints, a 1973 French novel popular in white-nationalist and neo-Nazi circles.) Colleagues who have worked with him for years say they have never heard him utter a racist slur, even in private. His devotion is not to white supremacy per se, they insist, but to the political and intellectual thesis he has been pushing since before he arrived in Washington. He wants to halt and reverse America's post-1960s immigration boom, and he pursues that goal with a fervor that has made him the public face of Trump's restrictionist immigration policies.

During debate prep for the 2024 campaign, Miller found himself in a contentious back-and-forth over immigration with a more moderate Trump ally. Finally, a frustrated Trump interrupted the two men: Stephen, he said, if you had it your way, everyone would look exactly like you, someone familiar with the exchange told us.

“That's correct,” Miller said, before turning back to continue sparring.

The nexus of Miller's power is a vestige of President George W. Bush's War on Terror. Weeks after the attacks of September 11, 2001, Bush established the Homeland Security Council to coordinate the government's domestic response to the new threats from abroad. More than two and a half decades later, Miller has attached that rubric of national emergency to a new target, turning the council into a daily war room to track and fine-tune Trump's campaign to deport 1 million people a year.

The September murder of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, who was close to many in the administration, including Miller, plunged Trump's already single-minded martinet into a maximalist frenzy. A portrait of Ronald Reagan hangs prominently in the Oval Office—just over Trump's left shoulder when he's seated at the Resolute Desk—but Miller has made it abundantly clear that this is no longer Reagan's Republican Party.

Former Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who retired during Trump's first term, told us that he has noticed a clear shift from one Trump administration to the next. “Before, it was more subtle, more nuanced, but now it's pretty plain. He wants to see more immigration from the Nordic countries, and not so much from the Third World countries. It's just a clear break from the huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” said Flake, who, as a senator, worked unsuccessfully to pass a bipartisan immigration overhaul. “It's not the Reagan vision. It's not the traditional Republican vision.”

Flake said that although the immigration system has serious problems, Trump and Miller's goal seems to be “to change the nature of who we are as a country.”

Beyond immigration, Miller specializes in turning the president's whims and rantings into government policy. As Trump griped about the homeless encampments near the State Department one day, Leavitt recalled that he turned to Miller and said: “Get it done.” “And within six hours,” she said, “I looked at Twitter, and there were cranes cleaning them up.”

“Stephen is the most effective political aide of this generation—and probably since James Baker,” the former Trump adviser Cliff Sims told us in a text. “No one is more deft at moving the levers of government to turn the President's policies into action.”

May Mailman, who last year worked closely with Miller to punish elite universities that the administration claims are rife with anti-Semitism and “woke” ideology, explained to us how Miller approaches a problem. In March, for instance, upset with Columbia University for several reasons—including prominent pro-Palestinian protests on campus—Trump posted a message on social media that began, “All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.” Miller told Mailman to come up with some options, but, with Trump's buy-in, Miller was ultimately the one who approved pulling federal funding from the school.

Then he carefully watched for the reaction. “If taking money from Columbia was a bad idea and backfired in some way, then Stephen would be the one to demand a course correction,” said Mailman, who first worked with Miller during Trump's first term. “But because that worked out pretty well, he then tries to figure out: How can we use that tool in other areas?”

Close observers of Miller say that his total command is a marked contrast to his role during the first Trump term, when, despite being a senior adviser, he was limited in his ability to direct others. David Lapan, a retired Marine Corps colonel and aide to former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, told us that he remembers attending a 2017 meeting at which Miller urged officials to send him examples of crimes committed by immigrants so he could publicize them. The difference then, Lapan said, is that Miller had an advisory role, and the other meeting attendees could disregard requests that they felt were too outlandish. “We came out of that meeting and said, Yeah, we're not doing that,” Lapan recalled. “We knew that Kelly would cover for us.”

“Are there stories like that out there? Sure,” Lapan said. “But they're the exception, not the rule. Cherry-picking a few bad cases to paint all immigrants in a negative light is not something that we were willing to do.”

Although Miller views himself as the president's loyal servant, Trump's stances appear to have shifted under Miller's direction. The president used to speak favorably about certain immigrant groups he liked, such as DACA recipients and the employees at his golf resorts. But lately, his occasional pro-immigrant chatter has quieted. “‘America First' is becoming ‘Americans Only,'” Lapan said.

Miller turned 40 in August and celebrated with a surprise party at the Ned, a chic members-only club blocks from the White House. The president did not show up, but just about everyone else did: White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, House Speaker Mike Johnson, conservative influencers, nearly every Cabinet secretary. Miller did not have a speech prepared but spoke self-deprecatingly, thanking Wiles for putting up with his ideas and suggestions. The turnout was a show of not just Miller's immense power but also his popularity in an administration that has been rife with infighting and backstabbing, especially during Trump's first term.

The gleeful brawler Miller plays on TV is no act, his colleagues told us, and he behaves similarly in private (although often with a dash of deadpan humor). Several people told us that they appreciate how dogmatic he is, for a possibly surprising reason: They always know where he stands on the issues, and where they stand with him. As Trump's speechwriter during the first administration, he built goodwill with colleagues by warning them when the president was about to say something contrary to their plans, so they had time to try to convince him otherwise.

“The lazy and clearly false hit on him is to call him these disgusting names,” White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told us, about the accusations that Miller is a Nazi or a fascist. “If you dig deeper and aren't suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, he's not what the media portrays him as. He's actually a very nice and cordial person who cares about this country and wants to do a good job. He's very easy to work with. I've been in Trump world a long time, and he's probably the easiest to work with.”

Several people described Miller as an exacting boss, even a micromanager, but one who looks out for his team—including younger aides. In Trump's first term, he was not yet married, and he spent many of his nights out, grabbing drinks or dinner with everyone from Cabinet secretaries to more junior staff, who were eager to get time with him. When Trump's first term wound down, Miller helped ensure that everyone on his staff (and even some not on his team) had a job lined up.

Friends and colleagues say he has rarely seemed hurt by the criticism and caricatures. But he can be vain about his appearance; in Trump's first term, he once showed up to Face the Nation with what was roundly mocked as spray-on hair. (In Trump's second term, the hair is gone.) And after a recent Vanity Fair photo shoot of senior West Wing staff, the photographer—whose close-up, often unflattering photos went viral—recounted to The Washington Post that Miller “was perhaps the most concerned about the portrait session,” asking whether or not he should smile. Colleagues also describe a proud sartorialist who regularly debated fashion and traded menswear tips with another West Wing fashionista, Hogan Gidley, a deputy press secretary during Trump's first term.

“We would talk about the difference in fabrics for seasons, and lapel size and width of ties and these types of things,” Gidley told us, before describing Miller's style as “sophisticated and smart and chic but also daring at times.”

In a recently resurfaced 2003 video, a 17-year-old Miller—prominent sideburns and tightly coiled brown hair—sits in the back of a moving school bus, opining on the war in Iraq. In the video, Miller smirkily suggests that the “ideal solution” for “Saddam Hussein and his henchmen” would be “to cut off their fingers”; he argues that torture is the proper punishment in a nonbarbaric society. (In a barbaric society, he implies, death would be the appropriate punishment.) “Torture is a celebration of life and human dignity,” he continues, briefly unable to hide his delight as his latest outlandish proclamation illicits titters from his peers—his mouth widens into a toothy grin, and he emits an audible chuckle before taking a breath and continuing.

This is Miller the troll, who has confided in friends that he enjoys starting a fire, then dousing it with gasoline. But after more than two decades relishing his role as the gleeful contrarian, the persona has now become more true character than occasional outlandish caricature. “He has a flair for the dramatic, and you can tell that now with the way he comports himself on TV,” Bannon told us. “He plays the character well, knowing he always wants to have the libs'—the progressives'—heads blow up.”

After graduating from Duke in 2007—where he vigorously defended white lacrosse players who were falsely accused of rape by a Black stripper—Miller landed a job with newly elected Republican Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. As young Capitol Hill aides, he and Sergio Gor—who recently became Trump's ambassador to India—helped launch the supernova ambitions of Bachmann, a right-wing darling whose then-fringe ideology presaged the rise of MAGA. By the time Bachmann's 2012 presidential bid flamed out, Miller was already firmly ensconced with then-Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who shared his hard-line obsession with immigration, and Bannon, who provided a broader nationalist, populist scaffolding.

Read: Trump's right-hand troll

As Sessions's aide-de-camp, Miller helped his boss sabotage the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” immigration bill, which passed the Senate by a wide margin in 2013. At the time, a post-2012 Republican autopsy was calling for a gentler, more inclusive GOP, and the proposed immigration overhaul had the support of business and tech leaders, interest groups, and wealthy donors. But Miller was undaunted, buttonholing reporters in the hallways of Congress to press his anti-immigrant case, and calling them later at home to talk—for hours, if they'd let him—about the bill's minutiae and why it would harm American workers. The bill died in the House, where it never came up for a vote.

Miller pushed colleagues to keep the same round-the-clock hours as he did, including calling meetings on Friday afternoons, when most Hill staffers were eager to skip out early to happy hours. Instead, Republican staffers sullenly reported to messaging meetings to talk about immigration.

Working with Bannon, Miller made Breitbart News the communications arm of his effort. And, understanding that data and statistics, however dubious, could lend their cause the sheen of legitimacy, they elevated obscure anti-immigration groups—the Center for Immigration Studies, NumbersUSA—into prominent sources. “The more outrageous the headline, the better,” Bannon said.

By the time Miller joined Trump's 2016 campaign—officially launched with claims that Mexico was sending “rapists” and criminals across the border—his immigration bona fides were well established, and he learned to channel Trump's voice into policy prescriptions. The baby-faced Miller quickly moved from the back of Trump's plane to the inner circle at the front.

By March 2016, Miller was Trump's opening act, riling up crowds across the country with an anti-immigrant, anti-Washington populism that sometimes threatened to overshadow Trump himself. “I said, ‘Listen, the point of an introduction is that Trump doesn't have to top it,'” Bannon said. “He was so insane over-the-top. But of course the MAGA base can't get enough of him.”

In Trump's first White House, Miller made quick use of the various levers available to him, no matter how buried in the bureaucratic bowels. He took a particular interest in the office of the staff secretary, a little-known but powerful team that vets any memo or speech or policy before it reaches the president. Not a lawyer himself, he nevertheless leaned on creative and expansive interpretations of statutes to push the president's agenda. In the early days of COVID, for instance, he successfully urged the administration to invoke a 1944 emergency public-health law to shut down the border and rapidly expel migrants to Mexico or their home country. In a White House staffed partly by amateurs, he also benefited from his deep understanding of policy issues, which he'd been honing since high school. He coached Trump and others into even more extreme immigration positions, explaining why, for instance, he believed that giving merit-based green cards to promising foreign students was problematic.

Even his allies find Miller to be something of an “acquired taste,” as one put it. Another quipped that he has the bedside manner of Heinrich Himmler, one of Adolf Hitler's earliest followers and a key architect of the Holocaust. But Mailman said that Miller could be strategic when making a policy pitch. On immigration, he instinctively understood if someone was a “type person” (who cared about the type of immigrant coming to the country) or a “numbers person” (who cared simply about the sheer number of immigrants) and often tailored his message accordingly. “He thinks about the rationale of how someone is approaching something,” she said.

Because Miller's views—especially on immigration—were so well known, he earned Trump's trust despite also, at times, vigorously disagreeing with him. “Miller is 100 percent firm in every conviction and feeling he has, and he just says it the way he believes it, and if it aligns with what the president wants to do, then great,” a first-term Trump aide told us. “And if it's nuanced or different, then Miller stakes out his position—he doesn't care if it's different from what other people think or what the president wants—but then once the president makes his position clear, Miller executes on it, whether or not he agrees with it.”

Despite his years as Sessions's protégé, Miller quickly distanced himself from his longtime mentor, several people told us, when Sessions, then Trump's first attorney general, recused himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, angering the president. In fact, the rupture was more acute than was publicly known; Miller was enraged by what he viewed as Sessions's unforgivable betrayal of Trump.

During the first term, Miller aligned himself with Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, once it became clear that they held tremendous sway with the president. The pairing was unusual, given that the president's daughter and son-in-law were seen as misguided “globalists” by much of the far-right base. One person familiar with the dynamic described Miller spending hours with Ivanka Trump on her key initiatives—paid family leave and tax credits for parents. The charitable explanation, this person continued, is that Miller was being generous with his time and expertise; the more cynical one is that Miller understood that Ivanka Trump was less likely to complain to her father about Miller's hard-line immigration policies if the two had a good relationship.

“He always understood where power lies,” Bannon said. “No matter what—he can be coaching a Little League team—Miller can very quickly analyze.”

Miller's fealty to his boss was on display right up until the end of Trump's first term. On January 6, 2021, Miller's wife—who had worked as Vice President Mike Pence's communications director—was on maternity leave but still employed by Pence. But when Trump called Miller that morning to discuss adding lines to his speech attacking Pence, Miller—ever the good soldier—did as he was told.

Later that day, angry Trump supporters marched to the Capitol, calling for the vice president to be hanged for treason.

The enemy arrived at the Millers' doorstep on a warm September morning in the form of a retired gender and peace-studies professor in a loose striped dress. Barbara Wien, who had been protesting the family's presence in Arlington, Virginia, pointed her index and middle fingers at her own eyes, then directed those fingers at Katie Miller, who was on the front porch.

Stephen Miller took the gesture at his wife, which was captured on video, as a call to violence—an offense that he uniquely had the power to punish.

The Millers had already felt under siege, facing threats and fearing that the entire family was being surveilled by sophisticated actors. A Rhode Island man had been indicted in August for publicly threatening to kill Miller and other officials. A law-enforcement official told us that Katie Miller had been surreptitiously photographed in her neighborhood—while going to the gym, and at least once while walking with her kids—and said that there was a “coordinated” and “malicious” effort to, at the very least, intimidate them. Someone had also posted flyers at neighborhood parks where their kids played, revealing their home address and calling him a Nazi. The Millers had stopped allowing their children to play in front of the house or in the backyard.

But they were not going to be intimidated by a 66-year-old activist.

“You want us to live in fear? We will not live in fear,” Miller said days later, in an appearance on Sean Hannity's Fox News program. He had gone on the program to discuss the federal response to Kirk's recent assassination, but although he was focused on “domestic terrorists,” he included doxxing on the list of related offenses. For those familiar with the Millers' personal lives, it sounded less like he was talking about Kirk's assassin than about Wien, who'd distributed flyers with his address.

“You will live in exile,” he continued, “because the power of law enforcement under President Trump's leadership will be used to find you, will be used to take away your money, take away your power, and, if you have broken the law, to take away your freedom.”

Miller set about drafting a series of executive orders, later signed by Trump, that directed federal law enforcement to refocus counterterrorism efforts on people with “anti-fascist” ideas, such as “extremism on migration, race, and gender” and “hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”

This fall, Miller also began describing a central divide in the country, pitting “legitimate state power” against what he termed left-wing “street violence.” His definition of the latter was broad. He accused Democratic politicians who called him or Trump “authoritarian” of “inciting violence.” (Never mind that he had repeatedly called the Biden administration “fascist.”) He placed doxxing—what his family faced—on the continuum that leads to violence. (Also never mind that Vice President J. D. Vance encouraged calling out those who celebrated Kirk's murder, including at their place of employment.)

As Miller announced federal policies aimed at combatting the threat, he was also fighting a private battle against the very enemy he described. In the weeks after Wien made her gesture in front of his wife, the Millers decided that they were no longer safe in their six-bedroom, roughly $3 million Northern Virginia home. They sought out military housing at a nearby base, arguing to friends and allies inside the administration that their safety depended on it.

But the legitimate powers of the state repeatedly declined to fully cooperate with the Millers' attempt to turn their own situation into a catalyst for the sort of crackdown they claimed was necessary. The FBI was initially hesitant to take a major role in the investigation of Wien, prompting the Millers to demand its involvement, according to a person briefed on their efforts. A Democratic Virginia state prosecutor became concerned about the federal involvement in a search warrant on Wien, and sought to narrow its scope. A federal magistrate judge refused to approve federal search warrants, according to a report by Axios.

Katie Miller, who hosts her own podcast, recently appeared on Piers Morgan's YouTube show and accused a progressive guest, Cenk Uyger, of attacking her Jewish children by merely having a difference of opinion with her. She then offered a veiled threat to have Uyger's citizenship revoked. (Uyger is a naturalized citizen; in a text message, he described Katie Miller's threat as “not an attack on me as much as it's an attack on America.”) When the investigation against Wien appeared to stall, Miller's longtime ally Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee chair, announced that he had opened an inquiry into the Democratic prosecutor in Virginia who had sought to narrow the search warrant and raised concerns about federal involvement.

“This is so cool,” Katie Miller said on social media. “Thank you.”

Days later, the prosecutor said that she would not cooperate with Jordan's inquiry, because the investigation was ongoing and Congress lacked the ability to intervene in a state law-enforcement matter. There were still some powers of the state that Miller did not control.

The Trump allies who previously warned against intervention have gone conspicuously silent.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

You could almost detect the clenched teeth and pursed lips in Tulsi Gabbard's social-media post. “President Trump promised the American people he would secure our borders, confront narcoterrorism, dangerous drug cartels, and drug traffickers,” the director of national intelligence wrote on X yesterday afternoon, days after the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. “Kudos to our servicemen and women and intelligence operators for their flawless execution of President Trump's order to deliver on his promise thru Operation Absolute Resolve.”

It was Gabbard's first and only comment on the raid. She has not always been so reticent about American pressure on Maduro. For many years, while serving as a Democratic member of the U.S. House, Gabbard was a leader of the clique that fiercely opposed American intervention abroad, casting it as part of a dark imperial history.

“The United States needs to stay out of Venezuela,” she posted in January 2019. “Let the Venezuelan people determine their future. We don't want other countries to choose our leaders—so we have to stop trying to choose theirs.” A few weeks later: “The US needs to stop using our military for regime change & stop intervening in Venezuela's military.” Still later that spring: “Throughout history, every time the US topples a foreign country's dictator/government, the outcome has been disastrous. Civil war/military intervention in Venezuela will wreak death & destruction to Venezuelan people, and increase tensions that threaten our national security.” She was even clear on why the U.S. kept rattling its saber at Caracas. “It's about the oil … again,” she wrote. (Justin Amash, another former representative and a critic of U.S. intervention, recently rounded up Gabbard's past comments.)

Now Gabbard is a member of the administration, and the president whom she serves, Donald Trump, is saying openly that the whole thing is mostly about the oil. (Energy Secretary Chris Wright said today that the U.S. would control the Venezuelan oil industry “indefinitely.”) She's gone from critic of imperialism to agent of it—and if she objects, she hasn't done so publicly.

Gabbard is not alone as a noninterventionist suddenly cast into a tricky position. Steve Bannon, the president's ex-consigliere, has also opposed U.S. military actions abroad. Bannon has neither the inclination nor, with a daily online broadcast, the ability to stay as quiet as Gabbard. Over the weekend, he praised the effectiveness of the military operation but questioned what comes next and whether Trump has planned for it: “So is this part of overall Hemispheric Defense, and we're going to clean up this mess in Latin America? Or is this just the neocons talking him into it?” (This position puts Bannon in line with many mainstream Democrats.)

No silence has been so conspicuous as that of Vice President J. D. Vance. One of the few beliefs that he has not been quick to jettison for political advancement is his opposition to American military interventions, which he connects to his experience serving in Iraq. This spring, in a group chat to which Trump officials accidentally invited Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, Vance grumbled to colleagues about strikes intended to preserve navigation in the Red Sea. “I just hate bailing Europe out again,” he wrote.

In recent days, though, Vance has been not only silent but absent. He was not present Friday night when the administration set up an impromptu war room at Mar-a-Lago, and he was also not part of the press conference the next day where Trump celebrated the mission and talked about taking over the Venezuelan oil industry. Instead, the front man for this operation has been Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was a foreign-policy hawk before remaking himself as a Trumpist; as it turns out, that wasn't such a transformation after all. Rubio's ascendance is notable because Vance and Rubio are widely understood as rivals for Trump's mantle. (“I'll give you $100 for every person you make look really shitty compared to me,” Vance told a Vanity Fair photographer last year. “And $1,000 if it's Marco.”)

What all of these figures understand is the importance of staying on Trump's good side. Bannon was exiled from the first Trump White House; he has since mastered the art of diverging just enough from the president that he sometimes takes flak but never gets banished from the fold entirely. Gabbard already saw the dangers of getting crosswise with the president when she implicitly warned against the bombing of Iran this past summer, before quickly falling back in line. One more break might get her sacked.

No one has as much to lose as Vance, though. He is clearly the front-runner to succeed Trump and is desperate to lead the MAGA movement once Trump leaves office, but yesterday's January 6 anniversary is a reminder of how viciously Trump can turn on a vice president who doesn't support him in all things—he even watched indifferently while a mob threatened to hang Mike Pence. Vance may not like what's going on in Venezuela, though unless he says so, no one knows. Until then, his willingness to keep his mouth shut speaks loudly. For Vance, deeply held principles are fine, but staying in power is even more alluring.

The Trump administration attempts to silence veterans.

Mark Kelly will probably be fine. The senator and Navy veteran isn't likely to be cowed by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's lawless attempt to silence him by seeking to demote him post-retirement.

“It's dead on arrival,” Gene Fidell, an expert on the Uniform Code of Military Justice who teaches at Yale Law, told me. “If this ever gets in front of a judge, the judge is going to say, ‘Fuck you.'”

The attack on Kelly may have a much broader aim, which is to silence other service members who might speak out about the Trump administration's actions by threatening their financial well-being. Veterans who lack Kelly's platform, influence, and social connections may feel that their pension isn't worth the risk of saying something critical of the president.

In a post on X, Hegseth announced that Kelly was being demoted for a video from November. He and five other Democratic lawmakers who had been service members or intelligence officers reiterated the principle that members of the military do not have to follow unlawful orders. This is a banal statement of law, one that Hegseth himself has made publicly in years past. And Kelly had good reason to warn against abuses of military power. Donald Trump, after all, has deployed federal agents and military units to American cities—apparently as a kind of punishment for being liberal—and openly speculated about using “some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”

The time may come when service members are commanded to murder fellow citizens on the president's orders, and they should know that they can refuse to do so. One wonders whether that is precisely why the Trump administration's response has been so heavy-handed: Trump officials don't want service members hearing that they do not have to follow unlawful orders, because they may someday issue them.

Nothing in Kelly's video was grounds for punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which forbids service members and retirees from using “contemptuous” language in reference to the president and some other officials, and from engaging in conduct prejudicial to “good order and discipline.” In a statement, Kelly said that Hegseth and Trump “don't get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.” Trump, however, had declared that the video was “punishable by DEATH.”

There are clearly good reasons for the code to enforce standards of conduct. When you serve for 20 years in the military, you retire with a pension defined by your rank. Officers can be demoted after the fact, on the basis of behavior that occurred while in uniform. In 2021, for instance, an Army major general was demoted for sexual abuse that occurred while he was on active duty, despite having retired in 2005.

But Kelly's statements were not made while on active duty, and were not disparaging. “There's nothing improper, much less criminal, in what they said,” Fidell said. “It's not conduct unbecoming; it is not seditious.”

“His exact words were merely a statement of the law, which is: You can disobey unlawful orders. That's factually, legally correct,” Brenner Fissell, a law professor at Villanova and a vice president at the National Institute of Military Justice, told me. “How can it be a criminal offense to state the law?”

It's not—in a democracy. But Trump and his enablers act as if they're above the law, and seem to feel entitled to punish anyone who displeases them. As the Trump adviser Stephen Miller put it in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper about the arrest of the Venezuelan president, “We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.” He called these forces “the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Miller's tedious attempts to sound like a comic-book supervillain aside, this may be the way most states have been governed, but it is also a description of the kind of tyranny the Constitution was written to prevent.

It is strange that military law continues to govern the political speech of retired service members. This is, in my view, a clearly unconstitutional quirk that Hegseth is exploiting to punish Kelly and silence others—including, potentially, other lawmakers with military backgrounds who might speak out against Trump policies.

“One of the things that I'm hoping to do is spread a little truth on the water here, so that people aren't chilled,” Fidell said. Veterans “have as much right as you or I do to speak their minds.”

A simple solution to prevent this abuse of authority would be for Congress to change the law so that military retirees are not subject to restrictions on speech or conduct that takes place after they no longer serve in uniform. “Retiree jurisdiction does not need to exist; it's irrational,” Fissell said. “You've got 99-year-old World War II veterans who are still subject to military law.”

The much broader problem, however, is that the American people elected a president who thinks it should be illegal to criticize him, illegal to oppose him, and illegal to remind others that they have the right to do so. The other Democratic lawmakers in the video aren't drawing military pensions, so are not subject to the military code of justice. Nevertheless, the administration found a way to punish them by subjecting them to an FBI investigation—it's unclear for what, because contempt of Trump is not a crime under American law.

When criticizing the leader becomes a crime, being a criminal becomes an obligation.

As bad as things look, the country's democratic forces broke through a similar jam in 1958.

The Trump administration's forceful removal of Nicolás Maduro from office has not liberated the Venezuelan opposition so much as confronted it with an existential choice.

President Donald Trump stated at a news conference that María Corina Machado—the charismatic Nobel Peace Prize winner who is far and away the most popular Venezuelan politician—lacks sufficient “support” and “respect” within Venezuela to govern the country. Instead the United States has backed Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, a powerful insider with experience running Venezuela's oil sector and intelligence service. Moreover, Washington expects Rodríguez to work with it at the barrel of a gun: It continues to hold Venezuela's oil exports under military quarantine, and the U.S. president has threatened the interim president with a fate worse than Maduro's if she doesn't comply with American directives.

Michael Scherer: Trump threatens Venezuela's new leader with a fate worse than Maduro's

The country's democratic movement is at a crossroads. It could take the loss and lie low, waiting for the next inflection point—or it could return to protests and organizing, in the hope of changing Trump's mind or getting Rodríguez to call elections.

So far, Machado has tried to cast the moment as the country's “hour of freedom.” Edmundo González, the legitimate winner of the 2024 election that Maduro co-opted, has claimed the post of the presidency and called on Venezuelans to back him. But Machado still has not appeared publicly, González remains in exile in Spain, and the opposition has not yet mounted any substantial public protest.

Institutionally, the old regime remains in place. The ruling party still dominates the country's National Assembly, which is run by Rodríguez's brother. The judiciary is stacked with regime allies, as is the electoral council. Venezuela's military ranks have grown over the past decade and have become ever more entwined with the country's economic system and governance.

Rodríguez will have little incentive to open up the country's political system. More than a dozen powerful officials and military figures have been, like Maduro, indicted in U.S. courts. They face dim prospects if they hand over power without securing guarantees of immunity. Their most logical move is to dig in—and publicly, that's exactly what they have done. Rodríguez has forcefully denounced the U.S. intervention and asserted that Maduro remains Venezuela's rightful leader. Other officials have circled the wagons.

Rodríguez could also deliver on one of the key U.S. demands—access to oil—and use that as a bargaining chip against making any political concessions. Trump has repeatedly claimed that Venezuela stole oil from the United States and has put its recovery at the top of his list of demands. So long as Rodríguez keeps the oil flowing northward, Trump will likely support her against the disruption and unpredictability that could follow a transition of power to the opposition.

Yet even with all of that stacked against it, Venezuela's democratic opposition does have a hopeful historical precedent to draw on. In January 1958, the country's longtime strongman, Marcos Pérez Jiménez, was forced from office only to be succeeded by one of his most powerful officials, the naval commander Wolfgang Larrazábal. But Larrazábal could solidify control of neither the military nor society. He presided over coup attempts, public upheaval, and the erosion of American support.

Finally, Larrazábal agreed to allow major political parties to compete in national elections. He stepped down and ran as a candidate, losing to his popular opponent, Rómulo Betancourt. To the surprise of many, Larrazábal conceded and called for a peaceful transition to democracy.

Now as then, a strongman has been dislodged in Venezuela, and the field of possibilities has expanded. Like Larrazábal did, Rodríguez brings experience and continuity to her role. Also like him, she will be seeking to control substantial centrifugal forces as U.S. threats compel her to make decisions that will rankle insiders and possibly the public. Those tensions could ultimately destabilize the regime and open a new opportunity for democracy.

Gisela Salim-Peyer: The Venezuelan opposition's desperate gamble

That opportunity can best be seized if the opposition remains active and tries to back the regime into a corner. Doing so may involve renewing street protests with the knowledge that the world's eyes are fixed on Venezuela, perhaps making it harder for Rodríguez to repress demonstrations and jail opposition leaders at scale.

Rodríguez's government likely hopes that an atmosphere of fear and prior repression, coupled with surgical raids to disrupt organizing, will keep Venezuelans at home. But the country's opposition has demonstrated its savvy and motivation, most notably with its election-monitoring operation in 2024, which succeeded in proving to the world that Maduro had not won. By regrouping now, the opposition could force Rodríguez into political concessions—perhaps not unlike the ones that allowed Venezuela its democratic breakthrough in 1958.

The president seems intoxicated with military power.

Rudyard Kipling's “Recessional” shocked its readers in 1897, when he wrote it for the complacent celebrations of Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. The poem read differently and more ominously after 1898, when Britain entered a wretchedly difficult and brutal three-year war in South Africa that shook imperial self-confidence as nothing had since the American Revolution.

President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth may have heard of Kipling, although it is doubtful that they have read him or any other versifier. But his words apply to them no less:

If, drunk with sight of power, we loose    Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe, Such boastings as the Gentiles use,    Or lesser breeds without the Law— Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget—lest we forget!

Naked imperialism is an ugly thing, and that contemptuous phrase, “lesser breeds without the Law,” unsettles any contemporary reader of “Recessional.” But for all of its ugliness, the poem also captured Kipling's belief that imperial power was transitory, and that when exercised for nothing but ruthless self-interest, it was not only foolish, but dangerous and impious. George Orwell, whose opinion of Kipling was mixed (he called him a “good bad poet”), believed that by “lesser breeds without the Law” Kipling meant the Germans, and that the poem as a whole was “a denunciation of power politics, British as well as German.”

The American president has admitted that he has an addictive personality, which is why, to his credit, he is a teetotaler. But he and his aides are undoubtedly intoxicated with military power. “This was one of the most stunning, effective, and powerful displays of American-military might and competence in American history,” he said at the press conference following the seizure of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro. “No other country on planet Earth, and it's not even close, could pull this kind of operation off,” Hegseth added. “And no other president has ever shown this kind of leadership, courage, and resolve. The most powerful combination the world has ever seen.” And Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller later told CNN's Jake Tapper that “what we've witnessed under President Trump's leadership this last week is one of the greatest foreign-policy and military victories this country has ever had.”

Read: Trump seizing Greenland could set off a chain reaction

The Maduro snatch was, unquestionably, a remarkable feat of arms, and no tears need be shed about the removal of a man who was an enemy of the United States, a troublemaker in the region, and a tyrant at home. It is entirely conceivable that the outcome will be beneficial, leading to the eviction of Cuban and Iranian agents from Venezuela, much-increased pressure on the Cuban dictatorship, and even, by an unforeseen chain of events, some relief from oppression for the people of Venezuela.

The concerning thing is not Maduro's removal, but rather the view of military power that Trump, Hegseth, and others seem to be forming. Hegseth boasted, understandably, that there were no American fatalities. There were, however, plenty of Venezuelan casualties and, according to Havana, 32 Cuban intelligence and military operatives killed. The administration's expensively trained lawyers, high on credentials if low on scruples, may call this a law-enforcement operation, but blowing up buildings, shutting down Caracas's electrical grid, and killing lots of uniformed people is about as warlike as it gets. And judging by what they later said, Trump and his lieutenants reveled in the combat they observed from the luxurious setting of Mar-a-Lago.

Commando raids of this type, and the units that execute them, fascinate politicians. The people are extraordinary, their actions spectacularly skilled, the hazards immense, and the immediate political payoffs great—if the raids succeed. Small wonder that the Trump White House put out its own Mar-a-Lago version of the famous Obama-administration picture of the president and his top advisers keenly watching the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In that case, as in this one, there was precisely nothing the president and his entourage could do to affect the outcome, but it made them look like they were in charge—which, once the bullets began to fly, they were not.

Something similar holds true in limited air campaigns. Bombing offers gratification without commitment, a thing akin to the dating patterns of dissolute men, of whom the administration also has a few. These are ways of war that seem clean, limited, precise, and brief.

And so they are until they are not. The Trump administration no doubt thinks, as the Obama administration did, that by fighting this way, it can avoid getting bogged down in the kinds of counterinsurgency campaigns that the U.S. waged in Iraq and Afghanistan. The result in Barack Obama's case was the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq—and then a new commitment to fight a deeply destructive third Iraq war against a resurgent Islamic State, and a 2011 intervention in Libya that opened the way to chaos spreading far beyond Tripoli and Benghazi.

The Trump administration also believes—a lesson, again, learned from Democratic presidents, such as Bill Clinton and Obama—that one can avoid consulting Congress before ordering U.S. forces to begin killing people. The Yugoslav wars and the Libya interventions were not preceded by authorizations of military force from Congress, unlike operations in either Afghanistan or Iraq conducted by the George W. Bush administration.

This is all dangerous stuff. Avoiding the deployment of 100,000 troops into Venezuela is no guarantee that American military action will not continue and expand, whether in response to terror counterpunches; attempts to break a de facto, if limited, blockade of Venezuela; or mere refusal to cooperate with the president's desire to cop the profits from Venezuelan oil sales. In war, one thing leads to another.

Read: The fuck-around-and-find-out presidency

Hubris is one of this administration's deepest weaknesses, as is its predilection for bombast and chest-thumping. In a White House that insists on public sycophancy (and no doubt gets a full dose in private, too), the resulting chances of a misjudgment are considerable. Worse is the deliberate disconnection of the use of force from any kind of moral purpose. Miller gave the game away in his CNN interview. Americans, he said, must be “able to assert ourselves and our interests without apology,” before decrying “this whole period that happened after World War II, where the West began apologizing and groveling and begging and engaging these mass reparations schemes.”

Think about that. The United States should acknowledge no restraints, whether of law or morality, on what it does, and the policies that got us through the Cold War, the institutions we created, and the norms we asserted—unevenly, even hypocritically at times—were all for suckers. It is not surprising that Trump and his subordinates immediately began threatening a host of countries, including two of our allies, Colombia and Denmark.

Their statements, and others like them, are nothing less than a paean to force, applied when and as the United States sees fit, unconstrained by anything other than presidential whim. The situation is unlikely to end well.

Or as Kipling concluded:

For heathen heart that puts her trust    In reeking tube and iron shard, All valiant dust that builds on dust,    And guarding, calls not Thee to guard, For frantic boast and foolish word— Thy mercy on Thy People, Lord!

Trans advocates would face a difficult road in the sports cases, even if the Court weren't dominated by Republicans.

Let's be honest. The question of whether transgender athletes have a right to play school-sponsored sports was always the toughest legal issue facing trans advocates.

The Supreme Court's trans rights precedents are particularly ill-suited for plaintiffs challenging state laws prohibiting trans women from playing on women's sports teams. The politics of this issue are absolutely awful for trans people. And the Court is dominated by Republicans who, just last June, voted that states could ban trans youth from receiving gender-affirming medical care.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

So it is likely that most of the justices will rule, in either Little v. Hecox or West Virginia v. B.P.J., that states may prohibit trans women from playing women's sports at the high school or college level. Both cases present this question to the justices — although there is a chance the Court will dismiss the Hecox case because the plaintiff in that case makes a strong argument that the case is now moot.

To understand why trans advocates must climb such a steep hill to prevail in Hecox or B.P.J., it's helpful to be familiar with Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), the one major victory the Court has given transgender Americans. Bostock held that a federal law which bars employment discrimination “on the basis of sex” prevents workplace discrimination targeting LGBTQ employees.

Although Bostock assumed that the word “sex” refers only to “biological distinctions between male and female” (that is, to sex assigned at birth), it concluded that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”

The idea is that if Herman is allowed to date Janet, but Juanita is not, then Juanita is being treated differently because of her sex. Similarly, if a cisgender male worker is allowed to wear stereotypically male clothes, to use a male name, and to otherwise present as a man, then an “employee who was identified as female at birth” must also be allowed to do so, or they are also being discriminated against because of their sex.

But this rationale does not apply to sports, because the law permits sex-segregated sports teams. If a company attempted to divide its workers into male and female “teams,” that would be illegal. But schools may, and typically do, have separate sports teams for men and women.

To prevail in a case like Hecox or B.P.J., in other words, trans plaintiffs must show that they are protected from discrimination because they are transgender — and not just because they are men or women. And, while the Supreme Court held half-a-century ago that ordinary sex discrimination by the government is typically forbidden by the Constitution, it has never ruled that transgender Americans are protected because they are trans.

Meanwhile, several sitting justices appear to have already concluded that trans people do not enjoy constitutional protection. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote an entire concurring opinion in United States v. Skremetti (2025), the trans health care case, arguing that they do not. In an even more ominous sign for trans athletes, Justice Brett Kavanaugh worried during the Skremetti oral argument that, if trans women were given heightened constitutional protection, that could enable them “to play in women's and girls' sports … notwithstanding the competitive fairness and safety issues that have been vocally raised by some female athletes.”

Realistically, in other words, trans athletes should expect a rough ride in the Supreme Court.

The plaintiffs' specific claims in Hecox and B.P.J. are fairly modest. They don't claim that all trans athletes should be allowed to play women's sports, but rather only a certain subset whom, they argue, do not have a competitive advantage.

The plaintiff in B.P.J., who is identified only by her initials because of her young age, is a high school track-and-field athlete. According to her brief, she “transitioned early in life” and “has received puberty-delaying medication and gender-affirming estrogen,” and thus has never gone through male puberty. The plaintiff in Hecox is Lindsay Hecox, a former college athlete who “is treated with both testosterone suppression and estrogen” and who says she “has circulating testosterone levels typical of cisgender women.” (Hecox is also a college senior who does not currently play on any team and who says that she does not intend to play college sports in the future, which is why she argues her case is moot.)

Neither plaintiff argues that all transgender women should be allowed to play high school or college sports. Instead, they seek a court order that applies to trans women with testosterone levels similar to cisgender women. Their lawyers argue that this subset of trans women enjoy “no athletic advantage” over cis women.

Meanwhile, the state of Idaho, the defendant in Hecox, spends a simply enormous amount of its brief doubting this factual claim. They rely largely on statements by Gregory Brown, a professor of exercise science whose professional webpage identifies him as “the faculty advisor for Turning Point USA” on his campus. The plaintiffs, meanwhile, rely largely on testimony by professor Joshua Safer, an endocrinologist who told the trial court that heard Hecox that “there is a medical consensus that the difference in testosterone is generally the primary known driver of differences in athletic performance between elite male athletes and elite female athletes.”

For what it is worth, one of the plaintiffs' primary arguments before the Supreme Court is that the nation's highest Court is the wrong forum to litigate this disagreement among professors. The trial courts in Hecox and B.P.J. deemed Safer's testimony to be more credible than Brown's. And appeals courts like the Supreme Court typically aren't supposed to second-guess a trial court's factual findings unless they are “clearly erroneous.”

This Supreme Court, however, is unlikely to defer to the lower courts just because the rules of civil procedure instruct them to do so. In Kennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022), a case about a public school football coach who incorporated prayer and other Christian activity into his coaching, the Court's Republican majority made up a fake set of facts to justify ruling in favor of that coach — and even adhered to these fake facts after Justice Sonia Sotomayor produced photographic evidence that her Republican justices weren't telling the truth. In cases involving disagreements about medicine, Republican justices often argue that state legislatures have broad leeway to do what they want so long as “medical uncertainty” exists.

And, even if the Supreme Court does credit the lower court's finding that Safer has a more accurate understanding of how testosterone impacts athletic performance than Brown, the outcome of this battle of the professors only matters if the plaintiffs' lawyers can convince a majority of the justices that trans people enjoy heightened protection under the Constitution.

As a general rule, the government is allowed to discriminate. It can discriminate against unqualified applicants and in favor of highly qualified ones when deciding whom to hire. It can discriminate against rich people and in favor of poor people when deciding who receives welfare benefits. And it can discriminate against criminals and in favor of law-abiding people when deciding whom to incarcerate.

Virtually all laws draw some kind of distinction between people they do apply to and people who are unaffected. And the Constitution typically permits this kind of discrimination, even when there is scientific evidence that a particular law discriminates for unsound reasons.

Meanwhile, there are some forms of discrimination that are ordinarily not allowed. Laws that discriminate on the basis of race, sex, or religion, for example, are subject to “heightened” scrutiny under the Constitution. The details of how this scrutiny works often depend on the type of discrimination — the Constitution treats race discrimination with more skepticism than sex discrimination, for example — but most laws that are subject to heightened scrutiny fail.

The Supreme Court held in United States v. Virginia (1996), for example, that “a party seeking to uphold government action based on sex must establish an ‘exceedingly persuasive justification' for the classification.”

So how does the Court determine which forms of discrimination are allowed, and which ones are constitutionally suspect? Under the Court's past decisions, the most important question is whether a particular group has historically been subject to discrimination that “bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society.”

The Court also sometimes looks at other factors, such as whether a group exhibits “obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them as a discrete group” or whether the group is relatively politically powerless. But these factors are less important. Religious discrimination is constitutionally suspect, for example, even though people can change their religion. And women and people of color have not lost their constitutional protection even as they've gained political power relative to women and racial minorities in the past.

The lawyers representing the plaintiffs in Hecox and B.P.J. make a strong argument that discrimination on the basis of gender identity should be subject to heightened scrutiny. In their brief, they list several historical laws that targeted trans people. Over two dozen US cities, including major metropolises like Chicago, used to ban “cross dressing,” for example. Others targeted bars that served “female impersonators.” At one point, the lawyers argue, the United States effectively barred openly trans people from immigrating.

Meanwhile, someone's gender identity bears little relationship to their ability to contribute to society. As the plaintiffs' lawyers write, “being transgender does not make someone less capable of being a lawyer, engineer, farmer, or doctor.” And openly trans people have historically held little political power. In all of American history, there's been exactly one openly trans member of Congress — and she hasn't even completed a single term in office.

Will that be enough for this Supreme Court? Probably not. As Barrett noted in her Skrmetti concurrence, the Court “has not recognized any new constitutionally protected classes in over four decades.” The Court's gay rights cases, for example, seemed to actively avoid the question of whether discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is suspect — even when those decisions found other reasons to rule in favor of gay plaintiffs. So a decision adding trans people to the pantheon of protected groups would be a highly unusual move by the Supreme Court.

And, even if the Court does conclude that trans people enjoy this protection, the plaintiffs in Hecox and B.P.J. must still overcome an additional hurdle.

Let's say that the lawyers representing Hecox and B.P.J. somehow convince a majority of these justices that discrimination against trans people is just as odious as discrimination against women, and thus that laws that discriminate on the basis of gender identity should be subject to heightened scrutiny. Most laws subject to this scrutiny fail, but not all laws do.

As the Court held in Virginia, laws that discriminate on the basis of sex are permitted if they serve “important governmental objectives” and “the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.”

Indeed, one example of a law that discriminates on the basis of sex, but that courts have allowed to remain in place, is a law that segregates men and women onto different high school or college sports teams. Because highly athletic men typically outperform highly athletic women in sports, women-only sports teams are necessary to ensure that women have the opportunity to play. If women-only teams did not exist, nearly all women would be excluded from high school and college sports, because they would be unable to compete with their male classmates.

Or, to use the same language the Supreme Court used in Virginia, gender-segregated sports teams are allowed because they are substantially related to the important objective of allowing both men and women to play competitive sports.

Significantly, this rationale holds even though there are some women who can outperform nearly all men, and there are some men who underperform most women. A cisgender high school boy isn't allowed to try out for the women's field hockey team, even if he can demonstrate that he has unusually low testosterone levels.

The law, in other words, allows states to use the blunt instrument of declaring that all cisgender men must play on one team, and all cisgender women must play on another team, regardless of whether any particular man or woman's athletic performance matches that of the other sex.

Thus, even if Hecox and B.P.J. can convince the Court that trans women with low testosterone levels do not enjoy a competitive advantage over cisgender women, and even if they convince the Court that laws that discriminate against trans people are subject to heightened scrutiny, there is still one more hurdle that they must overcome. The law typically permits schools to segregate sports teams based on students' sex assigned at birth, so why should a trans athlete be treated differently than a cis athlete with similar athletic ability?

Hecox and B.P.J.'s lawyers, for what it is worth, have a pretty good answer to this question. They argue that “courts have recognized that sex separation in sports can pass constitutional muster where men and women still have equal opportunities to compete.” Thus, the hypothetical cisgender boy with low testosterone does not face discrimination because he can still try out for the men's team. But transgender women who experience gender dysphoria, a psychological condition where the inability to express their gender identity causes great distress, cannot try out for the men's team without triggering that distress.

That argument persuaded lower courts. As Hecox's lawyers note in their brief, one court concluded that claiming that trans women can simply play men's sports “is analogous to claiming [gay people] are not prevented from marrying under statutes preventing same-sex marriage because lesbians and gays could marry someone of a different sex” — an argument the Supreme Court rejected in its marriage equality decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).

But even if this argument persuaded lower courts, it's far from clear that it will persuade the Supreme Court. Three current justices dissented in Obergefell. And two other current justices, Kavanaugh and Barrett, have signalled pretty clearly that they are unsympathetic to trans women who wish to play school sports. That's five votes — a majority in the Supreme Court.

All of which is a long way of saying that proponents of trans inclusion in school sports face a very difficult climb in the Supreme Court. Many of the Court's current members have already indicated that they reject the pro-trans arguments in Hecox and B.P.J. And even if these plaintiffs faced a less hostile panel of justices, current legal doctrine is not very favorable to trans people, at least in areas where the Constitution typically permits the government to treat men differently than women.

New York City's congestion pricing experiment, explained in one chart.

Could a $9 toll change notorious traffic? New York became the first American city to find out.

A year ago, it began charging drivers for entering Manhattan's busiest central neighborhoods during peak hours. Critics called it a cash grab, and President Donald Trump even vowed to kill it.

But a year in, congestion pricing has largely proved to be a success, according to new data released by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority — the agency that runs New York's massive network of subways, buses, and commuter rails.

Since tolling began, 21 million fewer vehicles have entered the toll zone, an 11 percent drop from what was projected without it. And average vehicle speeds improved by 23 percent. That's the difference between a one-hour crawl and a 45-minute commute.

But the real gains came at the entry points. At the Holland Tunnel, for example, morning rush hour speeds jumped from 10.8 to 16.2 miles per hour — a 51 percent improvement. A separate analysis that used anonymized Google Maps data found these improvements spilled over to regional roads, meaning even drivers outside the zone got faster commutes.

Public transit riders benefited, too. After years of steady decline, average bus speeds in the zone ticked up 2.3 percent, reversing the trend seen in 2023 and 2024. Subway and bus ridership is up too, carrying more than 400,000 riders every day compared to 2024.

It's easy to dismiss traffic as just a nuisance, but sitting in it is linked to higher stress, lost productivity, and worse air quality for everyone. Getting people out of cars and onto transit helps on all three fronts.

Streets got safer. Crashes involving trucks in the zone dropped by 21 percent compared to the previous year.

The MTA made money. Net revenue exceeded the MTA's initial projections. That cash is earmarked for transit upgrades, including modern subway signals, 56 new elevators for accessibility, and the Second Avenue Subway extension.

The one place the jury is still out is on air quality. It's worth watching because air pollution is a quiet killer. In New York City alone, fine particulate matter contributes to roughly 2,000 deaths and over 5,000 hospitalizations each year — and traffic is a major source of those pollutants.

A recent study from Cornell found a 22 percent decline in one kind of particulate matter after congestion pricing went into effect, while another analysis found little effect. The MTA's own analysis showed no significant change in pollution levels. If London and Stockholm are any guide, it'll take a few years of data before congestion pricing's effects on air quality becomes clear.

There's also the question of drivers who, looking to dodge the toll, might reroute through Queens or other neighborhoods outside the zone. The MTA has anticipated that and earmarked $100 million to offset potential air quality impacts in those neighborhoods: funding school air filters near highways and swapping out diesel equipment for electric.

The vocal opposition that greeted the program's launch has largely died down, similar to what happened elsewhere. When Stockholm launched its congestion pricing in 2006, two-thirds of residents opposed it. After a six-month pilot, they held a referendum. More than half voted to keep it.

New York seems to be on the same arc. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who delayed the program in 2024, now touts it as an “unprecedented success.” And other cities are paying attention. Officials in Los Angeles have already reached out to New York for advice on their own potential pilot project, according to Gothamist.

Turns out, if you charge people to drive, fewer people drive. Who knew.

The Trump-FIFA connection, explained.

This year, North America will host the world's largest sporting event: the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be played in 11 cities in the United States, three in Mexico, and two in Canada.

The World Cup is the most-watched sporting event on the planet, drawing more viewers than the Super Bowl and the World Series combined. This year marks the first time since 1994 that World Cup matches will be played in the United States.

This year's edition has also gotten attention for political reasons. The US role in hosting the tournament has been years in the making, and it's closely tied to President Donald Trump and his unusually warm relationship with FIFA President Gianni Infantino.

Infantino has praised Trump lavishly, presenting him with gifts — including FIFA's Peace Prize, a wholly made-up award that the FIFA president gave to Trump last November — and has reportedly visited the White House more than any other world leader during Trump's second term.

Today, Explained co-host Astead Herndon spoke with Adam Crafton, a senior reporter at The Athletic, who has closely covered FIFA and the growing relationship between the two men.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

How did the US, Canada, and Mexico even get these games in the first place?

The way it works is nations bid, and they bid quite a long way out. The process for this was around 2017. It was actually during Trump's first presidency.

It's interesting to look back on, because President Trump gets the opportunity to take credit for it. But actually, one of the motivating factors for [the US, Canada, and Mexico] joining forces was kind of this concern about whether America, the USA, could win a bid by itself, because this was coming off the back of, if you remember, the FBI's criminal investigations into FIFA and the DOJs involvement. And there was this concern about whether FIFA membership would actually go for it, just an American bid. So [the US] joined forces with Canada and Mexico.

Also, just this feeling at the time of Trump saying some pretty disparaging things about other parts of the world. During the bidding process, I spoke to people part of that bid, and they would be going round saying to people things like, “Oh, you know, Trump doesn't really mean what he's saying,” or “Don't worry, he won't be the president by the time this comes around.” And yet, here we are. And Trump, I think Trump likes it, basically, because he can claim credit. He can say, “I was here when we won this. I brought this, and now I'm here to deliver this.”

We have our two main characters here: President Trump and Gianni Infantino, president of FIFA. Can you tell me about their relationship and how it's shaping the World Cup?

Their relationship was born out of the bid. Infantino kind of got himself into the Oval Office a couple of times; that was how it started. But what actually happened was, whereas a lot of people obviously turned on Trump towards the end of his first presidency and certainly after January 6, Infantino didn't. There was no point where Infantino publicly distanced himself from Trump. He stayed close. He went to Mar-a-Lago. He maintained that relationship. And I think Trump, whatever people think of him, he's clearly someone who remembers those who are loyal to him.

“Infantino has praised Trump lavishly…and has reportedly visited the White House more than any other world leader during Trump's second term.”

When Trump was then out of office, FIFA found it really difficult to penetrate the White House. There was no picture with Joe Biden in the Oval Office. There was no visit to the Oval Office for Infantino during that time. Then, when Trump wins power in November 2024, Infantino is immediately on the front foot — I mean, on Instagram every other day, praising Trump. He went to his pre-inauguration rally. And Trump would keep name-checking him at these events. It was pretty odd for those of us who have followed Infantino as a job, kind of this soccer bureaucrat, to all of a sudden see him basically being on first name terms with the US president.

Infantino's been in the Oval Office more than any foreign state leader, for example. That's extraordinary.

Wait, say that again? He's been in the Oval Office more than any other foreign state leader, any other kind of dignitary?

Yeah, I mean, if you think of, at least, in public appearances, where you see those kind of joint Oval Office affairs, like the one that, for example, Mamdani had with Trump in the Oval Office. There's been several of those with Trump and Infantino.

Can you explain the FIFA Peace Prize?

So, at the FIFA World Cup draw, at the start of December, Donald Trump was presented with the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize.

FIFA has never had a Peace Prize. Nobody has ever asked FIFA to do a peace prize, as far as we know. And the background of this is earlier, in Autumn 2025, there was a kind of unofficial campaign coming out of the White House to suggest that President Trump should be winning the Nobel Peace Prize. And actually, the day before the Nobel Peace Prize was announced, Infantino goes out on Instagram and actually says President Trump deserves it.

I mean, there's no reason for the president of FIFA to be making these declarations about who deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Why is Infantino going out on a limb in this way?

There's a few theories on this. The first is, just: Infantino loves it, right? He loves being around rich, powerful people — sees himself as this kind of head of state for soccer.

The second view is there is a pragmatic need for FIFA to go above and beyondd. And maybe they just think, “This is what we need to do to make sure we get what we need.” And there are things that FIFA needs. So, the host cities, the 11 host cities in the states, have needed $625 million worth of federal security funding for the tournament.

Recently, and amid all the immigration policies that have been going on, FIFA secured what has been called a “FIFA pass,” which means that, if you have bought a ticket for the World Cup, you will get an appointment wherever you are in the world through a visa interview in your country within six to eight weeks.

There are these concessions that FIFA have got, but at the same time, you now have four nations — Haiti, Iran, Senegal, Ivory Coast — whose countries have travel bans, which mean their fans can't travel to the tournament.

So, there's some wins and there's some losses, but I think FIFA are wary [that], at some point, someone in the White House might turn around, look at FIFA and say, “Hang on. They are a kind of a global organization that get tax breaks from America, that get all this revenue from putting on a tournament on our soil, and we are not getting a cut of the ticket revenue, of the parking revenue, of the broadcast, the sponsorship. Why are we helping these guys so much?” Does a Peace Prize go some way to just making sure that's always on [Trump's] desk and reminding him FIFA's great?

Recent changes to federal health policy will affect the lives of millions of Americans, many of them kids.

This story appeared in Today, Explained, a daily newsletter that helps you understand the most compelling news and stories of the day. Subscribe here.

In two weeks, I'll bundle my daughter into her snowsuit and trek over to the pediatrician's office, where a harried nurse in cartoon-print scrubs will stick my wailing child with her second flu shot.

For years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that all kids older than 6 months get a seasonal flu shot. But on Monday, the CDC scrapped that long-standing guidance as part of an unprecedented overhaul of its vaccine recommendations — much to the horror of kids' health experts and the confusion of parents.

The sudden slashing of the pediatric vaccine schedule is just one of several new or expected changes to federal health policy that will affect the lives of millions of Americans, many of them kids. In addition to the hullabaloo over shots, the Trump administration also amplified its baseless war on Tylenol this week and introduced nutrition limits in the food-stamp program.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

To make sense of all these changes, I asked my colleague Dylan Scott — occasional host of this newsletter and health care reporter extraordinaire — to run through the Trump administration's new health policies and how they affect Americans. (Dylan is also on the brink of launching Good Medicine, a new weekly newsletter for anyone trying to make sense of their health.)

There are five major pillars to watch, he said.

On Monday, the CDC slashed its number of recommended, routine childhood vaccines from 17 to 11 — an unprecedented move that won't exactly help America's deep-seated issues with vaccine skepticism.

Shots for measles, polio, chickenpox, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough, among several other diseases, are still in. But the CDC now only recommends the meningitis, hepatitis A and B, and RSV vaccines to kids deemed “high-risk,” and it's leaving the choice to vaccinate for flu, Covid-19, and rotavirus to individual parents and pediatricians.

The agency says its new guidance will not affect vaccine availability or insurance coverage — but it could very well sway many parents not to seek out some shots. That, in turn, affects herd immunity for everyone. In most of the US, vaccination rates among kindergarteners are already too low to prevent the spread of measles.

President Donald Trump this week doubled down on his September denunciation of Tylenol, writing that pregnant women and young kids should not take the drug “for virtually any reason.” He and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have repeatedly suggested that Tylenol could cause autism — a claim that's not supported by scientific evidence. (More than half of Republican voters believe it's true, nonetheless.)

Trump's rhetoric is all part of what Dylan calls a larger “witch hunt to find a cause for autism,” which has already ensnared a range of suspects: chemicals, molds, childhood vaccines, “mysterious toxins.” But scientists already know that the marked increase in autism diagnoses relates to better screening methods and an expanded definition of the disorder. As Dylan wrote last year, the quest to find some alternative, silver-bullet explanation just risks causing more confusion.

Five states introduced new restrictions to their food-stamp programs on January 1, banning participants from using their benefits to buy soda, candy, and other unhealthy foods and beverages. At least a dozen more are expected to introduce similar limitations later this year, including Florida, Virginia, and Texas.

The Trump administration is expected to release new dietary guidelines within a matter of days as part of a routine, scheduled update. (You may remember the “food pyramid” — in 2011, that became “MyPlate.”)

The government's guidance for healthy eating, which directly influences the meals served in schools, day cares and other public settings, has stayed fairly stable over time. But many nutrition experts expect this year's update to veer in a distinctly MAHA direction, perhaps by warning against ultra-processed foods or encouraging more red meat consumption. Avoiding ultra-processed foods could be beneficial, but Americans already have plenty of meat in their diets.

While the Trump administration hasn't taken concrete action on fluoridated water yet, it's an area to watch: Several states and municipalities have already banned fluoridation with Kennedy's encouragement.

For many of us, of course, this all raises some frightening questions, like: How do you navigate your personal health decisions in this environment? And if I can't trust the CDC to tell me what shots to get my kid, who exactly should I trust?

“I always tell people the best source to ask about your personal medical decisions is your doctor,” Dylan said. “Surveys consistently find that is the person most people trust and that makes sense, they know you and your health better than anyone.”

If you don't have a doctor, or if you'd like to do some Googling of your own before talking with them, Dylan recommends looking to authorities like your state government (some of which have banded together to give public health advice), the relevant medical societies (like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) or the Vaccine Integrity Project run by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

Berkshire Hathaway is paying its new CEO, Greg Abel, $25 million each year, a big bump from Warren Buffett's pay.

The company disclosed Abel's annual cash salary in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. He took on the role at the Omaha-based company on January 1.

Buffett, who retired last year, famously took an annual salary of $100,000 with no bonus or stock awards for over 40 years. Bloomberg estimates his net worth at $150 billion, the tenth-richest person in the world.

As Berkshire Hathaway's former CEO and current chairman, Buffett recommended to his board of directors how much he should be paid and set compensation for Abel and other executives.

Abel, who was previously Buffett's deputy, was paid $21 million last year. CEOs of S&P 500 companies were paid an average of $18.9 million in 2024.

At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting last year, Buffett, who is 95, announced that he would be stepping down after 55 years as the conglomerate's CEO. Hours later, the board unanimously voted for Abel to replace him.

""I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive of the company at year end,"" Buffett told the audience at the meeting.

Abel, 62, has been Berkshire Hathaway's vice chair of non-insurance operations since 2018. He's also chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which Buffett hailed as one of the conglomerate's four ""jewels"" in his annual shareholder letter in 2021, the same year Buffett first tapped Abel as his successor.

Investors expect Abel to maintain the company's current investment philosophy. He is known for having a more hands-on leadership style than Buffett.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The companies that make your hard disk drives are having a rally of a lifetime","https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/hard-drive-storage-stocks-sandisk-western-digital-seagate-ai-boom-2026-1","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:03:00 GMT","

The companies behind some of tech's least glamorous products — hard drives and storage — are powering a sharp rally on Wall Street.

The surge comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES 2026 on Monday that the AI boom isn't just about chips, but about where vast amounts of data live.

SanDisk, the flash-memory company spun out of Western Digital last year, has been the standout. Its shares surged about 28% on Tuesday, marking their strongest intraday performance since February. The stock is already up more than 40% just days into January, making SanDisk the top performer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday.

Western Digital and Seagate Technology, two of the world's largest makers of hard-disk drives, are also seeing a boost. Western Digital's shares jumped about 17% on Tuesday, while Seagate rose about 14%.

Huang described the memory storage market as a ""completely unserved market today.""

""This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,"" he said at CES with analysts on Monday.

""The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,"" he added, referring to AI storage needs.

Memory prices have been rising. Korea Economic Daily reported on Monday that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are pushing for server DRAM price increases of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.

Market analysis firm Counterpoint said last week that memory prices could rise by 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as AI-driven demand continues to strain supply.

The AI race has largely been about chips, data centers, and power. But data storage is coming into focus as a key bottleneck.

Driven largely by AI workloads, the volume of stored global data was expected to top 200 zettabytes in 2025 — the equivalent of 200 billion terabytes.

Analysts have predicted that demand for data storage could run ahead of supply.

""The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,"" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.

""For an industry that has long been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, this time is different,"" the analyst said, citing the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure and workloads as a shift that is straining the memory ecosystem.

""For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,"" the analyst added.

Warner Bros. Discovery still isn't interested in David Ellison's takeover offer — or his father's money.

For the eighth time, WBD has turned down a Paramount Skydance acquisition proposal, even as Paramount's latest offer appeared to address some of WBD's concerns with how the bid was financed.

Paramount ""has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions,"" WBD's board of directors wrote in a letter to shareholders posted on Wednesday morning.

Here are the two key reasons why the WBD board said it's rejecting Paramount's latest offer:

Paramount had revised its $108 billion bid for WBD to put in writing that its $40.4 billion in equity is fully backstopped by Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison — the father of CEO David Ellison — instead of his trust, which WBD had told shareholders was ""unknown and opaque"" with assets and liabilities that could be subject to change.

Despite Paramount's assurances that its financing is sound, WBD is sticking with its Netflix deal, saying that Paramount's offer ""is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger."" WBD has told shareholders that regulatory risk is ""not a material differentiating factor"" between the Netflix and Paramount bids.

WBD's board wrote in the letter that it had ""negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest.""

Paramount doesn't have to give up its monthslong quest for WBD, the parent company of HBO, the Warner Bros. Studio, and cable networks like CNN, TNT, and TruTV.

Paramount has said it still believes its all-cash offer of $30 per share for all of WBD is superior to Netflix's cash-and-stock bid of $27.75 per share for WBD's studio and streaming assets. The Netflix-Warner Bros. deal wouldn't include legacy TV networks, which would live on in a separate company.

From here, Paramount can try to convince WBD shareholders to back its bid and force the board to reconsider. Ellison could also increase his bid for WBD and put pressure on Netflix to either fork over more money or fold.

In an SEC filing last month, Paramount disclosed that Ellison had texted WBD CEO David Zaslav that the company ""did not include 'best and final' in our bid,"" suggesting that the company could be prepared to increase its offer.

Some media insiders expect a renewed bidding war. They include former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer, who had a firsthand look into Disney's fight with Comcast for Fox's studio assets in the late 2010s.

""I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer"" from Paramount or Netflix, Mayer said at a UBS media conference in December.

If Paramount can't win over WBD shareholders and doesn't want to pay more, there's the option of suing its would-be acquisition target, alleging a breach of fiduciary duty to its shareholders.

Read the full letter to shareholders here:

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance (""PSKY""), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD which it recently amended on December 22, 2025.

As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer, and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full 14D-9 filing.

PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which may have substantial upside.

Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value creation opportunities.

The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would in effect lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY due to regulatory reasons. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD.

The extraordinary amount of debt financing as well as other terms of the PSKY offer heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of [debt and equity] financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt — more than $50 billion — through arrangements with multiple financing partners.

The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout (""LBO""). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds 2 at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the [conventional structure of the] Netflix merger.

The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction — which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a ""junk"" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition.

Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a ""material adverse effect,"" enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction.

In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer.

If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months.

Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD for regulatory reasons represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses.

In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and 3 management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros.

PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its ""best and final"" proposal.

PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so.

Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you.

Sincerely,

The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Wednesday shared new U.S. nutrition guidelines, advising Americans to eat more ""real food"" and reduce their intake of highly processed foods and added sugars.

The government's new food pyramid replaces the MyPlate diagram released under President Barack Obama, and emphasizes protein, full-fat dairy and vegetables. The most significant changes under the updated guidelines include prioritizing protein over carbohydrates, recommending full-fat dairy instead of low-fat options and calling out processed foods like white bread, chips and candy.

""Healthy fats"" like full-fat dairy and avocados have also been added to the pyramid, and the guidelines recommend cooking with olive oil, butter or beef tallow. 

""We are ending the war on saturated fats,"" Kennedy said at a White House press briefing on Wednesday.

Similarly, the website announcing the new guidelines declares, ""We are ending the war on protein.""

Kennedy called the new guidelines the ""most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in history.""

His ""Make America Healthy Again"" agenda has taken aim at processed foods and sugary beverages, while pushing more controversial dietary changes like cooking with beef tallow and consuming more red meat, which many public health experts say can lead to cardiovascular and other health issues in excess. The backbone of the MAHA platform is that healthier diets will prevent chronic disease, according to Kennedy.

In response to the MAHA push, food and beverage giants like PepsiCo and J.M. Smucker have announced plans to phase out synthetic dyes and other artificial ingredients. Since Kennedy's confirmation, the industry has feared greater regulation, particularly regarding ultra-processed foods, although major policy changes haven't happened yet. 

The USDA and HHS release updated dietary guidelines every five years. While many Americans may brush off the recommendations, the guidelines are intended as a public health tool to inform health care providers, federal agencies, policymakers and nutrition experts. The food industry also takes them into account, given the wide reach of the guidelines. 

Changes in the dietary recommendations will trickle down to school lunches and federal nutrition programs. The consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest estimates that one in four Americans will be directly affected by changes in the guidelines. 

More than a year ago, an advisory committee of health and nutrition experts said that Americans should eat more plant-based food and low-fat dairy and consume less red meat and sugary beverages, based on a review of scientific evidence. However, it is unclear if the USDA and HHS used the report to inform the dietary guidelines announced on Wednesday.

Venezuela will ship sanctioned oil to the U.S. indefinitely, sources close to the White House told CNBC on Wednesday. 

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela will turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil, which will be sold at market prices. 

""That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States,"" Trump said in a social media post. 

The 50 million barrels are only the first tranche and shipments will continue indefinitely, the sources said. U.S. sanctions against Venezuela will be selectively rolled back to enable the transportation and sale of the oil on global markets, the sources said. 

Proceeds from the oil sales will settle in U.S. controlled accounts, the sources said, with the money released back to Venezuela at the discretion of the U.S., they said. 

Energy Secretary Chris Wright later confirmed the plan at a conference hosted by Goldman Sachs in Miami on Wednesday.

""We're going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela,"" Wright said. ""First this backed up, stored oil and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace."" 

Previously, the sanctioned oil would have gone mostly to China but will now be rerouted to the U.S. instead. Trump said Tuesday that storage ships will transport the oil directly to receiving docks in the U.S. 

Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. But it is only producing about 800,000 barrels per day, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. The U.S., by contrast, is currently producing about 13.8 million bpd.

Trump has made clear that U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil sector is a central objective of the military action that ousted President Nicolas Maduro last Saturday. The president has called on major U.S. oil companies to rebuild the South American nation's energy infrastructure system, from wellheads to pipelines, though the companies have so far been largely silent. 

Wright will meet with oil executives about Venezuela at the Goldman conference. 

""Secretary Wright remains in close contact with U.S. oil companies and plans to meet with several of them at the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference in Miami on Wednesday,"" a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNBC.

In this article

Alaska Airlines is ordering more than 100 Boeing jets, a purchase that the carrier's fleet chief said will ensure it has locked in sought-after order slots through the middle of the next decade to expand. 

The order, Alaska's largest ever, which was announced Wednesday, includes 105 yet-to-be-certified Boeing 737 Max 10 jets. Alaska is also buying five 787-10 Dreamliners, using its previous purchase options for those long-haul jets as it charts an international expansion with nonstops to Italy, South Korea and elsewhere. 

Shane Jones, who oversees Alaska Airlines' fleet, revenue products and real estate, told CNBC that the airline expects FAA certification of the Max 10 this year, with deliveries beginning in 2027. 

Alaska, which acquired Hawaiian Airlines in 2024, said it has 413 aircraft in its fleet and plans to grow that to 475 in 2030 and 550 by 2035, with this and previous orders.

The new order includes options for 35 more 737 Max 10s. Fifty-three of the planes in Wednesday's order are new, and 52 are from options the airline is exercising.

Boeing has more than 6,000 aircraft on backorder, but Alaska's purchase plans are a vote of confidence in airplane maker, whose 737 factory 10 miles away from the carrier's headquarters handed Alaska a 737 Max 9 two years ago without key bolts installed in a door plug. That panel blew out of the plane on Jan. 5, 2024, as it climbed out of Portland, Oregon, stunning travelers, though there were no serious physical injuries.

The accident briefly grounded the 737 Max 9 and set Boeing back in production as it waded through another safety crisis during what was supposed to be its turnaround year in the wake of two deadly Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.

Under Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who replaced insider Dave Calhoun months after the accident, the manufacturer has improved its production rate and quality, airline executives have said. It plans to ramp up production this year. The FAA must approve Boeing's Max production increases, a requirement following the door plug accident.

Alaska's Jones told CNBC Wednesday's order is a sign of ""our confidence in the Max 10 certification"" as well as ""our confidence in Boeing and their turnaround and their ability to produce quality aircraft on time.""

The 737 Max 10 has a shorter range than some other models but it can fit more passengers than smaller variants, which can improve unit costs on high-demand flights and allows them to fly more customers in and out of congested airports where adding flights is challenging. 

The Max 10 is years behind schedule and is still awaiting FAA approval. Jones said he expects certification this year with the first deliveries of the variant in the first half of 2027.

Jones said about half of the new aircraft orders are for replacement, with the rest for growth. He declined to disclose how much the airline paid for the aircraft. Manufacturers often share list prices, though big customers generally receive discounts for large orders.

Happy Wednesday. Guests at my home will be pleased to know that I, despite personal fascination, live outside the delivery radius of this shower water beer.

Stock futures are little changed this morning. The market is coming off another winning session.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Yesterday, the White House said President Donald Trump is considering using the U.S. military to acquire Greenland. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC that Trump is weighing ""a range of options,"" including the use of armed forces.

Here's what to know:

The stock market continues to scale walls of worry. The S&P 500 climbed to a new record high yesterday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day above 49,000 for the first time.

Amazon lifted the major averages with a more than 3% advance. The megacap technology giant was joined by semiconductor stocks such as Micron and Intel, which have surged in the new trading year. On the other hand, Chevron pulled back following its big Monday rally.

Follow live markets updates here.

Speaking of semiconductors: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said yesterday that there is ""very high"" demand in China for its H200 artificial intelligence chips. He said the company has restarted production of the chips and is ironing out final details on export licenses with the U.S. government, which has signal it would approve them.

Speaking at the CES conference in Las Vegas, Huang said any H200 sales would be on top of Nvidia's $500 billion two-year forecast that it shared last year. Huang has previously estimated that the Chinese market could be worth $50 billion per year.

Elsewhere at the conference, AMD CEO Lisa Su told CNBC that AI hasn't slowed hiring at her company. Su said that AMD, a Nvidia competitor, is instead placing priority on candidates who ""truly embrace"" the technology.

The Warner Bros. Discovery board isn't changing its mind. WBD board members this morning unanimously shot down Paramount Skydance's hostile takeover plan — again.

The board said it still believed Paramount's offer was ""inferior"" to Netflix's $72 billion deal. Paramount has ""repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal"" despite feedback from the WBD board, it added.

WBD board chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC this morning that the Netflix deal has ""compelling value, a clear path to closing and protections for our shareholders if something stops the close."" Paramount did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

xAI said it raised $20 billion in a new funding round, blowing past its prior target of $15 billion. As CNBC's Lora Kolodny reports, the Elon Musk-led startup received investments from firms including Nvidia, Cisco, Fidelity and Baron Capital Group.

Musk's xAI now operates X, the social platform also owned by the Tesla CEO, following a merger last year. The company has recently faced international regulatory probes after its Grok chatbot generated sexualized images of children and intimate images of adults without their consent. However, xAI also won a contract with the Department of Defense, which uses Grok in its AI agents platform.

What do Coach, Uniqlo and Ralph Lauren have in common? Coffee shops. CNBC's Ryan Baker explains why these clothing retailers are turning to cappuccinos to draw consumers.

CNBC's Kevin Breuninger, Sam Meredith, Dan Mangan, Justin Papp, Chloe Taylor, Yun Li, Sean Conlon, Arjun Kharpal, Spencer Kimball, Kif Leswing, Ashley Capoot, Samantha Subin, Jonathan Vanian, Lora Kolodny, Darla Mercado and Ryan Baker contributed to this report.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright is scheduled to speak publicly for the first time since the U.S. removed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power. 

Wright will be interviewed by Goldman Sachs Wednesday at the bank's annual energy conference in Miami. He will likely answer questions about President Donald Trump's call for U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela. 

Wright will also speak with oil executives at the conference about the situation in Venezuela. Executives from Chevron and ConocoPhillips are attending. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela.

""Secretary Wright remains in close contact with U.S. oil companies and plans to meet with several of them at the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference in Miami on Wednesday,"" a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNBC. 

Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, but it is unclear whether U.S. oil majors are prepared to invest due to instability in the South American nation.

In this article

JPMorgan said its asset management division has fully parted ways with controversial proxy advisors for shareholder votes. 

In an internal memo, the firm said it no longer needs third-party data collection or voting recommendations. Instead, it launched an artificial intelligence tool, Proxy IQ, to aggregate and analyze proxy data from 3,000 annual company meetings. 

Proxy advisors such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis typically provide research and voting recommendations. JPMorgan said it is the first major investment firm to eliminate reliance on such companies. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news earlier Wednesday.

Proxy advisors have been under fire from President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order in December to reassess existing rules. Trump said the proxy advisors ""regularly use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas."" 

Tesla CEO Elon Musk also lashed out at proxy advisors last October, calling them ""corporate terrorists,"" after ISS recommended shareholders reject his nearly $1 trillion pay package.

In this article

The Warner Bros. Discovery board on Wednesday once again unanimously recommended that WBD shareholders reject a hostile takeover offer from Paramount Skydance. 

The board said it continued to believe the Paramount bid is ""inferior"" to a previously announced deal with Netflix to buy WBD's studio and streaming business for $72 billion. 

""We have a signed merger agreement with Netflix, it's a compelling value, a clear path to closing and protections for our shareholders if something stops the close, whatever that might be,"" WBD board Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC's David Faber on ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday morning. 

In the days following the announcement of that deal, Paramount launched its hostile bid, taking directly to shareholders an offer of $30 per share, all cash for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its TV networks. 

WBD's board made an initial recommendation to reject the offer, and Paramount subsequently made another push for the coveted assets. In late December Paramount guaranteed the backing of billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, as a clear response to questions raised by WBD's board. 

Di Piazza previously told CNBC that the board had concerns about the backing of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. 

In an amended offer late last year, Paramount said Larry Ellison had agreed not to revoke the family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. However, Paramount Skydance stopped short of upping the amount of its bid.  

""PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions,"" the WBD board said in a letter to shareholders Wednesday. 

""The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its 'best and final' proposal,"" the board continued. 

In a Wednesday letter to members of the WBD board, Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matthew Halbower said the board has ""made an error"" in not engaging with Paramount's revised bid. 

Pentwater is WBD's seventh largest shareholder.

""Paramount has offered a $30 per share that is economically superior, it is superior in terms of regulatory risk, and I understand the board has some legitimate issues with it, but those legitimate issues don't warrant giving Paramount the stiff arm and refusing to actually have a conversation,"" Halbower told Faber Wednesday morning. ""That's not how I want my board of directors to act.""

Halbower's letter argues that the board's reasons for not engaging with Paramount's bid were insufficient and that the board has ""breached its fiduciary obligations"" to its shareholders.

""We are a small voice, but I think it's important for the board to at least hear our voice as the seventh largest shareholder, because I think what they are doing is wrong,"" Halbower said on CNBC. ""If Paramount goes away, then it is a lost opportunity.""

Paramount first showed interest in acquiring all of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets in September. The company made three takeover offers before Warner Bros. Discovery kicked off a formal sale process, inviting other bidders into the fold. 

Representatives for Paramount didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Netflix issued its own statement welcoming the WBD board's recommendation and noting it has been engaging with the U.S. Department of Justice and European Commission on antitrust concerns surrounding the merger. 

""The WBD Board remains fully supportive of and continues to recommend Netflix's merger agreement, recognizing it as the superior proposal that will deliver the greatest value to its stockholders, as well as consumers, creators and the broader entertainment industry,"" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in the statement.

After a strong holiday shopping season, many consumers are now hitting the stores again — this time to return their purchases. 

Consumers spent $257.8 billion online between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31, jumping 6.8% year over year to a fresh record for e-commerce, according to a new report from Adobe Analytics.

However, returns then spiked 4.7% compared to last year in the days immediately following Christmas Day, from Dec. 26 to Dec. 31. Returns are expected to increase in the first few weeks of January, as well, Adobe found.

""It's a pretty predictable uptick post-Christmas,"" said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. ""That's a part of the overall experience.""

In 2025, returns were expected to amount to 16% of all merchandise sales, totaling $849.9 billion in returned goods, according to an October report by the National Retail Federation. 

With the explosion of online shopping since the pandemic, the online return rate is even higher, amounting to as much as 19%, the NRF found. 

For consumers, returning has become a key component of the shopping experience. In fact, a growing share of shoppers buy products they never intend to keep. 

Nicole Pearl, 47, says she often orders clothing in multiple sizes for her children — ages 14, 12 and 8 — to hedge her bets on the best fit, particularly when apparel is heavily discounted. ""The Black Friday holiday season is definitely where I do more shopping than normal and more returning than normal,"" said Pearl, who lives in Chicago. 

According to a 2024 report by Optoro, 56% of consumers purchase goods in multiple sizes or colors, some of which they then send back, a practice known as ""bracketing."" 

Other shoppers go a step further: 69% admit to ""wardrobing,"" or buying an item for a specific event and returning it afterward, according to Optoro. 

Almost half of shoppers said it's acceptable to ""bend the rules"" when returning items, the NRF also found.

Now, 82% of consumers say free returns are an important consideration when shopping online, according to the NRF, up from 76% a year earlier. 

Roughly 81% of shoppers check the return policies before buying, and 71% said that a bad returns experience will make them less likely to shop at a particular retailer again, the NRF found.

Lindsay Goffman, founder of Refundly, a return-tracking app, said consumers want more transparency when it comes to return windows, return fees and refunds. ""It doesn't need to be this much of a black box,"" she said.

""For the brand, it's very important that they continue to generate ongoing value for the consumer,"" said Adobe's Pandya. ""Once you have captured these new consumers, they have to continue to keep that relationship going.""

But behaviors like bracketing and wardrobing also present major challenges for retailers, not only in terms of inventory management but for lost revenue, experts say. 

""That combination is turning returns from a back-office function into a front-line profitability issue,"" said Gaurav Saran, CEO of ReverseLogix, a returns management company.

To help curb the amount of inventory that is sent back, 72% of all merchants have started charging a return or restocking fee or limiting return options in the last year, according to the NRF.

Historically, Americans moved in order to find better economic opportunities. But the driver has now shifted from the ""Go West, young man"" mentality, where free and open land presented that opportunity, to much more personal incentives of family and affordability, according to an annual migration report from United Van Lines. 

It found Americans are not only choosing to live closer to family, but that they want smaller markets rather than urban cores as they seek cheaper housing and better quality of life. This shift will have a significant impact on commercial real estate investors and the choices they make going forward.  

Oregon was the most popular moving destination for the first time ever in 2025, while Florida and Texas, which had seen huge influxes in the Covid and early post-Covid years, are now seeing more balanced migration. 

Six of the top 10 inbound states were in the South and South Atlantic: West Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama and Delaware.

""The data reveals Americans are seeking a different pace of life, and destinations like Oregon, the Carolinas and the south are delivering it,"" Eily Cummings, vice president of corporate communications at United Van Lines, said in a release. ""While our total number of residential moves is similar to 2024, we're seeing much greater complexity in why people move and increasingly divergent migration patterns across age groups.""

Younger millennials and Gen Z are favoring New Jersey, meanwhile, since it's more affordable than New York City. But retirees are moving out of the state, making it the top state for outbound migration, according to the report.

As the migration rationale shifts to basic affordability and easier lifestyle, the commercial real estate needed to support that is probably somewhat different than if the main driver of those migration patterns was more robust economic opportunity, according to Ryan Severino, chief economist at BGO, a global real estate investment, lending and services firm.

He said the need for more affordable housing, more modest office parks and more middle- to lower-income retail spaces are better bets for investors. Even the industrial real estate that supports that factors in. For example, if people are living in smaller workforce housing, they need to have self-storage nearby. 

Demographic shifts also play into that thesis. Population growth is slowing down, the household formation rate is slowing down and the migration rate is slowing down over time, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 

""I think what it suggests to me, especially working for a private equity investor, is that we do need to be smarter and pick our spots more carefully from a commercial real estate perspective going forward, than I think a lot of the last however many decades where people have operated under this blanket assumption that, oh, you know, these migration patterns are durable and they're accelerating over time, when the reverse is probably true,"" Severino said.

While Americans are still heading to southern regions for lifestyle and affordability, migration patterns now appear to be more volatile and less durable than they have been in the past and will not necessarily accelerate. 

There was a huge migration to Southern states in the first years of the pandemic, and multifamily developers expected that to be a gold mine for many years to come. 

""They would buy things thinking we're going to get 6% and 8% rent growth for as far as the eye can see, and we're going to be minting money and, in five years, we're going to double what we paid for this thing,"" said Manus Clancy, head of data strategy at Lightbox, a commercial real estate data and analytics platform.

Rents, however, are now coming down, as oversupply makes its way through the system, and some who fled to the South are now moving out.

""The truth is that people were coming down to save money, that while the migration was real, it wasn't absent other factors, like new development, new inventory coming on. The new inventory in 2024 was the highest in 50 years. And I think that there was an enormous amount of buyers' remorse,"" he said.

Arizona, Nevada and Florida are prime examples of where companies relocated and people moved for a so-called ""better quality of life"" but are now leaving.

""It was not anything approximating what I know to be real life. And I think a lot of investors and developers took that as more of a longer-term structural change, an acceleration in these longer-term patterns,"" Severino said. ""And so they went out and they built a bunch of housing in Florida and Nevada and Arizona and places like that, and then a lot of those people didn't stick around.""

While snowbirds will still migrate to the South, commercial real estate investors need to be more strategic in where they're putting their money, according to Clancy, especially in retail. 

""Guys like Simon [Simon Property Group] will do the high end, and they are ... but they're being very, very selective. Nobody's going out there saying, 'We're going to build a strip mall on spec, because we expect a million people from Illinois, Michigan and Indiana to come down here in the next five years.' It's just not happening,"" he said.

Clancy said he expects to see more retail geared toward discount grocers and stores such as Walmart. 

Moving data does show that while there is a new push by young Americans to smaller, more affordable Midwestern markets, older generations will generally choose to retire in the South, but not nearly as much as they have in the past. 

""Even if the population is getting bigger, the rates of all of these things are slowing down, which means it's probably not the layup that a lot of people who even passively pay attention to commercial real estate perceive it to be,"" Severino said.

In this article

American Airlines said Wednesday that it will keep the spending requirements to earn elite frequent flyer status in 2027 steady for a third consecutive year as the carrier courts higher-spending travelers and tries to catch up to industry profit leaders Delta Air Lines and United Airlines.

Delta and United each said they would also keep elite status thresholds the same for the 2026 earning year. 

Airlines offer elite loyalty program members perks — ranging from earlier boarding and a free checked bag to free upgrades to roomier cabins and airport lounge memberships — in exchange for lots of flights on the carrier and its partners, as well as co-branding credit card spending.

Airlines in recent years have switched their loyalty program models to reward travelers' spending instead of simply how far they fly.

American said it is also adding more perks for milestones in between earned status tiers, like two food and beverage coupons at the 15,000-point level or a subscription to The New York Times games or cooking platforms or the Times' sports publication, The Athletic. The first level of elite status, Gold, is awarded at 40,000 loyalty points.

The carrier has been investing in new cabins and larger lounges and on Tuesday said it is starting to offer free in-flight Wi-Fi, a plan it announced last April. 

American didn't outline adjustments to its Citibank credit cards after it said it would drop Barclays as one of its credit card partners, though it expects to announce changes later this year.

The U.S. said Wednesday that in its attempt to blockade sanctioned oil exports from Venezuela, it seized two tanker ships, one of which was newly registered under the Russian flag.

In a post on X, the U.S. European Command said the tanker — which it called Bella 1, the ship's former name — had been seized in the North Atlantic for violations of U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil. 

The ship, now named Marinera, is just one that Russia has reflagged to join its ""dark"" fleet.

""This has moved beyond a sanctions case into a real-time jurisdictional challenge, where the key question is what legal basis exists for enforcement on the high seas,"" Dimitris Ampatzidis, senior risk and compliance analyst at energy consulting firm Kpler, told CNBC. ""The vessel's identity and history remain constant, but its flag status can significantly raise the diplomatic stakes.""

Automatic Identification System tracking data by Kpler shows the path of the vessel and the diversion the vessel made.

Kpler's AIS data — real-time location information transmitted by ships — shows that the tanker recently made a sharp turn in the Atlantic Ocean near Scotland. 

More than two weeks before the ship was seized, the U.S. stopped and attempted to board the tanker, which was registered as the Bella 1 under a fraudulent Guyana flag, during the ship's transit to Venezuela to be filled with the sanctioned crude.

On Dec. 31, Russia notified the U.S. that the ship had changed its name to Marinera and switched its registration to Russia, according to Lloyd's List. The vessel left the Caribbean.

Another newly Russian-flagged tanker linked to moving Venezuelan oil, the Premier, which was reflagged from Gambia to Russia on Dec. 22, remains empty outside the Jose terminal in Venezuela, according to Lloyd's List vessel tracking.

In a separate X post Wednesday, U.S. Southcom announced that the Panama-flagged tanker Sophia had been seized and was being escorted to the U.S. by the U.S. Coast Guard. 

The Sophia is laden with around 2 million barrels of crude oil that was loaded at Jose Oil Terminal in Venezuela around Dec. 26-29, as confirmed by satellite imagery and port reports seen by Kpler, Emmanuel Belostrino, senior manager of crude oil market data at Kpler, told CNBC.

The tanker's previous voyage was also from Venezuela, when it similarly loaded around 2 million barrels of crude in early August 2025 before heading to offshore Malaysia, Belostrino said. 

""The sanctioned cargo was likely transferred to another vessel via dark ship-to-ship transfer, but Kpler has not determined the partner vessel,"" he said.

The seizure of the Sophia comes after the Dec. 27 seizure of the Panama-flagged ship Centuries. Maritime experts have told CNBC these seizures may have been conducted under the 2002 Salas-Becker agreement, which allows U.S. authorities to board Panamanian-flagged vessels with just two hours' notice.

President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill,"" enacted in July, requires adults ages 19 to 64 who rely on Medicaid for health coverage to meet certain work requirements. 

One notable group exempt from those changes is qualifying family caregivers.

About 7.3 million family caregivers ages 18 to 64 were Medicaid beneficiaries in 2025, out of 63 million total caregivers in the U.S. that year, according to data from the AARP, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that advocates for Americans ages 50 and over.

Both affected beneficiaries and the states responsible for implementing the changes have some time before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions go into effect.

States have until Jan. 1, 2027, to adopt the new work requirements. 

How states implement those changes is crucial to ensuring uninterrupted Medicaid access for family caregivers, according to new research from AARP.

Family caregivers enrolled in Medicaid provide an average of 35 hours of unpaid care per week, AARP data shows. Family caregivers provide an estimated $600 billion annually in unpaid care, according to the nonprofit's research.

""The health of a family caregiver is critical to their ability to provide care to their loved ones,"" said Megan O'Reilly, vice president of government affairs for health and family at AARP. 

The OBBBA includes ""community engagement"" requirements, also called work requirements, for Medicaid beneficiaries ages 19 to 64. 

The work requirements apply to enrollees in Medicaid expansion programs. Certain states expanded their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act to make all individuals below certain income levels eligible for coverage.

Proponents of the new work requirements have said the change could incentivize people to find work and also help curb federal spending. Critics have said some workers may lose health insurance coverage under the restrictions due to complicated reporting requirements.

The new federal law includes $911 billion in Medicaid cuts, with work requirements accounting for the largest share at approximately $326 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 

Per the law, individuals will need to have at least 80 hours per month of employment, training or other qualifying activities to qualify for Medicaid coverage.

Notably, family caregivers who are responsible for children ages 13 and under or disabled individuals of any age are exempt from that requirement. 

It will be up to those caregivers to successfully prove they qualify for the exemption. States can help to make that process easier, according to AARP's new research.

While states have until Jan. 1, 2027, to adopt the Medicaid community engagement requirements, they should take the full period leading up to that date to make sure they are fully prepared, according to the AARP.

That initial implementation deadline does come with some flexibility, AARP notes, as states that demonstrate they are working toward compliance with the changes may seek a one-time extension of up to two years, or until 2029.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act also provides $200 million to states to support those implementation efforts. 

As states work toward compliance, there are ways they can implement the law to help ensure family caregivers are exempt from the Medicaid work requirements, according to the AARP. 

That includes efforts to help ensure family caregiver enrollees in Medicaid know about the new changes and what they need to do to comply. States may partner with health plans, providers and community-based organizations to help ensure caregivers get the information they need, the AARP research notes.

""One thing we know about family caregivers is that they're exhausted,"" O'Reilly said, and may be caring for both children and aging parents.

""That outreach component is going to be critically important to ensure that people don't get lost,"" she said.

States may limit the documentation and verification process that family caregivers must undergo to prove they qualify, according to AARP, such as through self-attestation or checkboxes on online or paper registration forms.

States may also consider making it so that compliance verification for both new and existing Medicaid enrollees requires one month of qualifying activity, the shortest possible time period under the new law, according to AARP. 

The new law requires states to complete compliance verifications both when an individual first enrolls in Medicaid and when they renew their coverage. While states have discretion to complete those verifications more frequently, in its research, the AARP points to less frequent rechecks as a way to ""potentially limit coverage churn and provide some stability for caregiver enrollees.""

To help ensure all Medicaid enrollees who qualify for the caregiver exemption receive it, states may also draw from multiple sources of data, according to the AARP, such as state units and area agencies focused on aging; applications for Medicare, Social Security, Veterans Affairs and other benefits that disclose caregiver status; and health records that document family caregiving situations.

More clarification on the new Medicaid community engagement requirements is expected when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issues an interim final rule, due by June.

When a Bitcoin owner wants to generate yield from their holdings, they typically go to a third party. That middleman is usually a stablecoin issuer or exchange like Tether or Coinbase that allows the holder to swap their Bitcoin for collateral—in the form of stablecoin or wrapped BTC—to be used in lending protocols like Aave. Now a Stanford professor named David Tse is promoting a new alternative to those systems. 

Tse is the co-founder of a startup called Babylon that has created a decentralized protocol, called BTCVaults, which offers users a more direct way to collateralize their Bitcoin. 

On Wednesday, the company announced that it raised $15 million dollars from a16z crypto, the crypto arm of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Tse did not disclose Babylon's valuation in an interview with Fortune. 

“We're building protocols using cutting edge technology to enable people to cut out the middle person and go straight to the goal, which is to be productive,” Tse said.

There are certain downsides when Bitcoin owners send their holdings to a third party, Tse says. The intermediaries take possession of the cryptocurrency, and the user loses control of the key. Babylon's protocol, in contrast, enables collateralization without the user relinquishing control of the Bitcoin. 

Tse views his company's competition as the centralized services like Coinbase, Kraken, and Tether. 

The company plans to integrate its technology with the lending protocol Aave in the second quarter of 2026. For now, Babylon does not generate revenue but hopes to after the launch with Aave. The company currently has more than 40 employees. 

David Tse co-founded Babylon in 2021 with Fisher Yu. The company does not have a CEO; Tse is the research scientist and Yu is the CTO. Tse has been a professor at Stanford for more than a decade, where he runs a research lab about blockchains. He has a PhD from MIT and taught at UC-Berkeley for 18 years.

Tse says that he started a company to give his research a broader purpose. Deliverables in academia, he says, are research papers, which he equates to pieces of artwork that can only be admired by a few people. 

“A startup is the natural way of converting research, innovation, and ideas into a product that people can use,” he said.

When Bitcoin first launched in 2009, many investors dismissed the currency as a fringe concept and even as a scam. (Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's former right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, memorably called it “stupid and evil.”) But the asset has skyrocketed in value in recent years and President Donald Trump labeled the currency “digital gold” after signing an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last January. Now, reports allege that Venezuela has bought into that “digital gold,” holding a “shadow reserve” nearly double that of the U.S.

Digital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold an estimated $60 billion worth of Bitcoin. Additional intelligence reports allege that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his associates accrued Bitcoin via three channels: a gold swap overseen by Venezuelan Interior Minister Alex Saab in 2018, oil revenue priced in Bitcoin, and by seizing crypto mining equipment from miners in the country.  

Sanctions have walled off the country's access to financial markets for years, and experts allege that they may have motivated Venezuelan leaders to invest in cryptocurrencies to sidestep the barrier.

Bitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela's holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth nearly $22 million. The website sourced the data from a 2022 Forbes article that cited research from a blockchain analytics firm. The total is a far cry from the estimated U.S. holdings of 328,372, currently worth $30 billion, though the claim positions Venezuela's holdings at nearly double the U.S. and one of the biggest holders of bitcoin globally.

The claims of Venezuela's shadow Bitcoin holdings have predictably garnered skeptics, including digital asset financial services company Ledn Co-founder Mauricio di Bartolemo, who grew up in Venezuela and whose family has mined crypto there since 2014.

Di Bartolemo finds no credibility in any of the three alleged sources of bitcoin income: the gold swap, oil exchange or mining equipment seizures. “This to me does not align with anything in the public record,” di Bartolemo told Fortune. “There's so much corruption, embezzlement and missing money that I don't believe that any meaningful amount would have accrued.”

He outlined his full argument in a Coindesk op-ed piece titled “Don't hold your breath for Venezuela's bitcoin.” Though he notes that his family's crypto mining materials were seized by the government in 2018 and returned five years later in a worn down condition, signaling heavy use of the equipment.

Di Bartolemo says that stablecoins have grown in popularity in Venezuela amid rampant inflation. Many Venezuelans send remittances to their families using stablecoins as the currency has a better exchange rate differential than liquid cash.

It is near impossible to track how much crypto the Venezuelan government holds, given the decentralized and clandestine properties of the asset. However, if true, the claims could potentially reshape global Bitcoin markets. 

While most of the U.S. government's crypto holdings were accrued through law enforcement seizures, the rise of crypto as a state-controlled asset entered the mainstream last year after President Trump signed the executive order to create a national Bitcoin reserve to bolster the U.S's position in digital assets, at no cost to taxpayers. 

Now that the U.S. is in effective control of Venezuela, with ambiguous statements from Trump that the U.S. “is going to run” the country, it is unclear what will happen to any Bitcoin reserves that do exist. Real or fake, the claim demonstrates the currency's growing geopolitical significance and the Trump administration's willingness to advance its interest in the digital assets industry.

About us

Copy link

Authorities in Cambodia just caught up with Asia's biggest alleged crypto criminal. 

Chen Zhi, chair of a conglomerate accused of running dozens of forced labour scam compounds and stealing billions of dollars worth of crypto, has been arrested in Cambodia and deported to China for investigation by relevant authorities, the Cambodia-China Times reported on Wednesday. 

The report comes after Zhi and Prince Group, the multinational where he acts as chair, have faced a heightened crackdown from authorities in recent months. 

In October, US authorities, including the Department of Justice's National Security Division, filed a civil forfeiture complaint for 127,271 Bitcoin tied to Zhi, worth approximately $15 billion at the time. 

The same day, the US and the UK designated Prince Group as a Transnational Criminal Organisation.

Later that month, the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control updated its sanctions list with 25 new crypto wallet addresses belonging to Zhi that contain some $780 million worth of Bitcoin. 

In November, Prince Group said in a statement that the firm categorically rejects the notion that it or Zhi engaged in any unlawful activity. 

Zhi is a 38-year-old Chinese émigré who has since renounced his Chinese citizenship.

Since approximately 2015, he has acted as the chair of Prince Group, which operates dozens of businesses in more than 30 countries.

On the surface, Prince Group is focused on real estate development and financial services. However, in secret, the firm, guided by Zhi and other executives, grew the company into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organisations, prosecutors in the US allege. 

International authorities and human rights groups say the multinational runs and oversees dozens of forced labour scam compounds across Southeast Asia.

Victims are lured to the compounds, often with offers of well-paid jobs in IT and administration. But when they arrive they are imprisoned and forced to work on pig butchering scams, often with the excuse that they must pay off phoney debts.

Pig butchering scams involve criminals building deep trust with victims through fake online relationships before convincing them to invest heavily in fake crypto or investment platforms and then stealing all their money.

The funds stolen through these scams are then laundered through a complex network of over 100 shell and holding companies worldwide, according to a press release from the US Treasury Department.

In 2024, criminals stole over $4 billion through pig butchering scams, a 40% increase from 2023, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain security firm. 

In June, an Amnesty International report identified at least 53 compounds used for pig butchering scams in Cambodia.

Victims interviewed by the human rights organisation reported slavery, human trafficking, child labour, and torture being carried out by criminal gangs running the compounds on a vast scale.

Zhi's arrest will likely deal a significant blow to these operations.

Morgan Stanley has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch an Ethereum Trust, on the heels of its registrations for spot Bitcoin and Solana exchange-traded products, expanding its crypto footprint in early 2026.

The Wall Street giant filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday for the Morgan Stanley Ethereum Trust, an exchange-traded fund designed to track the price of ETH and distribute staking rewards to investors.

The filings come as regulators under U.S. President Donald Trump have adopted a more accommodating approach to crypto markets, opening the door for traditional financial firms to expand ETF offerings tied to digital assets.

The Ethereum Trust would be a passive investment vehicle sponsored by Morgan Stanley Investment Management, holding ether directly and valuing shares daily based on a pricing benchmark derived from major trading venues, according to the Form S-1.

The filing states that the trust intends to stake a portion of its ETH holdings and distribute rewards to shareholders at least quarterly, subject to IRS guidance.

ETH was trading at about $3,211 at the time of writing, down roughly 0.7% on the day, according to CoinGecko data.

The latest move builds on a steady expansion of the bank's crypto strategy.

Morgan Stanley broadened access to crypto funds to all clients in October, including those with retirement accounts, after previously limiting exposure to high-net-worth individuals.

Last September, the firm also confirmed it had partnered with Zerohash to enable Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana trading through its E*Trade platform.

Early last year, the bank's CEO and Chairman, Ted Pick, said that the bank's approach hinges on regulatory comfort.

“For us, the equation is really around whether we, as a highly regulated financial institution, can act as transactors,” he said in a January interview.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Buy Now: Grok Highlights ICP, While DeepSnitch AI Rises 116%","https://www.tribuneindia.com/partner-exclusives/best-altcoins-to-buy-now-grok-highlights-icp-while-deepsnitch-ai-rises-116/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:03:00 GMT","

Internet Computer has been expanding its utilities, with chainkey fusion technology attracting new liquidity to DeFi, and Caffeine dApp helping to burn millions of tokens in recent weeks. With the price recovering on the chart, ICP has great long-term potential, and even Grok AI recommended buying.



DeepSnitch AI is creating a new platform concept that blends AI with on-chain analytics, turning into one of the most promising projects for 2026. This presale already surpassed $1.1 million in funding, and being a relatively new crypto, it offers significant long-term upside with 100x potential. For many investors, it's the best altcoin to buy now. Here's why.







Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, announced that the ETH blockchain has finally overcome the ""scalability trilemma"" and is now ready to achieve decentralization, security, and high speed at the same time. This feat was only possible thanks to the activation of PeerDAS with the Fusaka upgrade and advancements in ZK-EVMs.

For a long time, many blockchains sacrificed one aspect to prioritize others, like Bitcoin prioritizes security and decentralization, but is slow. The advantage of Ethereum overcoming this scalability trilemma is that it becomes the only blockchain that can scale to billions of users, without sacrificing decentralization, speed, or security, growing to a trillion-dollar valuation.



With the biggest challenge resolved, Vitalik believes Ethereum is ready to go to the next level, creating a new roadmap for ETH to advance towards global adoption by 2030, involving businesses, banks, and even governments. With a potential valuation of trillions of dollars ahead, this makes ETH definitely one of the best altcoins to buy now.

Goldman Sachs is predicting in its latest report that the S&P500 index will surpass 7,600 points in 2026, driven by macroeconomic acceleration and AI adoption. Considering that the AI ​​sector currently represents 40% of the index, artificial intelligence should play a significant role in global economic growth this year.

With this perspective, investing in a project like DeepSnitch AI could be the opportunity of the year. This is because it is still in presale, meaning you have the opportunity to invest in a project still in its early stages, offering more upside than most altcoins in the crypto market.

DeepSnitch AI is building an advanced platform that uses artificial intelligence to track several on-chain activities, creating real-time reports to help traders with information about tokens, projects, or even to anticipate market movements. This is the type of tool that everyone, from small investors to big whales, needs to make better investment decisions.

This is the type of platform that can be a game-changer in the market, and that's why the presale is growing rapidly and has already raised over $1.1 million, while the token price surged 116%. But it's still possible to pay a low price to invest in this AI project that offers great upside in the long term (only $0.03269).

So, if the entire AI sector really explodes in 2026, and even the S&P 500 hits record highs because of it, new projects like DeepSnitch AI could reasonably rise 100x. That's why this is undoubtedly one of the best altcoins to buy now.

Grok stated that ICP is his pick for the 2026 bull run. The message was a reply in a thread, and Grok explained that his choice was based on the fact that Internet Computer offers decentralized cloud storage (competing against AWS and Google Drive), smart contracts, while also building AI on blockchain (running AI directly in canisters).

Being the only blockchain capable of running everything from websites to dApps, 100% on-chain, Internet Computer (ICP) is currently seen as one of the most undervalued altcoins. Analyzing the chart, ICP's potential is promising. After several days of decline, it reclaimed key horizontal support at $3.00, and the price is now holding above this level at $3.25.

Its next major resistance is at $3.49, and surpassing this level will likely initiate a new upward rally to $4.50 and then upwards to $10.



SEI started 2026 with a 14% increase, driven by expectations of the Giga Upgrade, which is expected in the next weeks. The upgrade aims to expand the network to reach 200,000+ TPS, preparing SEI to become a perfect blockchain for DeFi, gaming, and RWA market (due to fast transactions and low fees).

Also, the recent partnership with Xiaomi makes SEI a promising altcoin for 2026, as its wallet will be installed on millions of new Xiaomi smartphones sold starting this month. This gives SEI very interesting long-term potential, making it one of the best altcoins to buy now.

Looking at the chart, SEI is still within a downtrend channel, priced at $0.128. If it manages to break through its resistance at $0.14, it will form a bullish pattern, with the next target at $0.255 (a potential 100% increase).

Conclusion: What's the best altcoin to buy now?

Internet Computer is becoming a full-fledged blockchain with numerous features. SEI is expanding to attract DeFi and RWA. Both are promising Layer 1 blockchains, but their high market cap limits explosive gains for investors.

For those seeking opportunities with 100x potential, DeepSnitch AI is the best altcoin to buy now. Because it's still in presale, it offers investors the chance to pay a low price for a project with much more upside potential in 2026.

DeepSnitch AI blends artificial intelligence with on-chain analytics and is still in presale. Its early stage, fast growth, and AI focus make it one of the most promising high-upside crypto projects for 2026.

Among the best altcoins to buy, DeepSnitch AI looks more promising because it is a project that mixes artificial intelligence with crypto. Also, being still in presale, it offers much higher growth potential than established large-cap altcoins.

Both ICP and DeepSnitch AI involve artificial intelligence, but ICP is more established with a higher market cap. DeepSnitch AI is newer, offers greater upside, and has a realistic 100x potential due to its early presale stage.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market succumbed to a wave of selling pressure during the Asia session, prompting a drop to about $91,530 at 10:00 a.m. UTC from around a local high of $93,750 at midnight.

The sell-off follows a failed attempt at breaking above $94,500 on Tuesday, the third in the past five weeks.

The altcoin market fared worse than bitcoin, with PENGU and XRP taking the brunt of the hit with declines of 6.5% and 3.5% since midnight.

Bitcoin is now trading firmly back in December's range, which saw various spikes between $85,000 and $94,500, even as it extended the decline that started in October.

Wednesday's drop reflects a rise in risk-off sentiment from traders. U.S. equities also fell in pre-market trading, with the Nadsaq 100 futures trading 0.32% lower since midnight.

Exchanges have liquidated crypto futures bets worth $465 million over the past 24 hours, with longs accounting for over 50% of the tally. This is in stark contrast to the pasta two days, when shorts faced the brunt of liquidations.

Still, cumulative open interest (OI) in crypto futures listed worldwide remains steady above $143 billion, the highest in nearly two months, with moderately positive funding rates indicating a bullish positioning.

OI in XRP, DOGE, SUI and ZEC fell 5%-6%. This is likely linked to profit-taking following recent price surges in these tokens.

CME's BTC futures show signs of green shoots, with OI rising from 100K BTC to 111K BTC since Dec. 30. Still, overall positioning remains light compared with a year ago, when OI stood at above 191K BTC.

On Deribit, put skews for BTC and ETH continue to weaken, although bullishness is yet to emerge.

BTC block flows show a mixed profile, with strangles suggesting a bullish volatility bias and call spreads indicating upside price expectations. In ETH's case, straddle, also a volatility strategy, was the most preferred play.

Memecoins and privacy coins were Wednesday's two worst performing sectors, with zcash (ZEC) leading the privacy plight, dropping by 4.5% since midnight UTC.

CoinDesk's Memecoin Index (CDMEME) fell 1.5%, about twice as much as the CoinDesk 5 index, which measures the price of BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL and ADA.

One glimmer of hope for the altcoin market is the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, with total value locked (TVL) across the entire ecosystem rising by 0.17% over the past 24 hours despite assets moving to the downside, suggesting positive inflows, according to DefiLlama.

CoinMarketCap's ""altcoin season"" indicator is at 25/100, down slightly from last week's high of 27 but considerably above December's low of 14, suggesting signs of optimism in the altcoin market.

One outlier from the move to the downside was tron (TRX), which remains in the black since midnight to add to a 1.2% gain over the past 24 hours.

SUI and XRP price have surged over the past seven days, with double-digit gains since the beginning of January, as fresh capital continues to flow into altcoins while Bitcoin remains above $92,500. The total crypto market cap added just over $250Bn in less than a week, since 2026 began.

According to CoinGecko, over the week, SUI is up about +31%, and

	 is up about +21%, surpassing Bitcoin's +5% gain in the same period. This move comes as traders shift from a Bitcoin-only mindset toward higher-risk altcoins, trying to front-run what many analysts believe is an upcoming ‘altcoin season'.

XRP, in particular, is gearing up for an explosive 2026, after CNBC called it the “hottest crypto trade of the year” and the “breakout investment of 2026” yesterday (January 6).

	  has shown strong resilience and a modest bounce after falling to $85,000 at the end of 2025, and is now up around 10% from there, currently trading above $92,500, prompting some traders to take profits and seek further upside in altcoins.

That rotation has lifted coins like

	 and XRP faster, as investors seek out promising major-cap tokens with smaller market caps than Bitcoin in search of bigger gains. So far, that play is working out, as both SUI and XRP price are up around 3-4x more than BTC USD since the beginning of 2026.

Sui is a newer Layer-1 blockchain that launched in 2023 and can be thought of as another protocol similar to Solana or Avalanche. It focuses on speed, user experience, and privacy.

Developers recently pushed a significant upgrade: the Beluga Consensus Improvement, which is designed to process more transactions more efficiently, according to OKX. That mix of tech progress and hype around high-throughput chains heading into 2026 gives traders a clear story to buy into.
XRP's story looks different but just as powerful. XRP targets cross-border payments, aiming to be a faster, cheaper alternative to SWIFT for banks and payment providers. Daily XRP Ledger transactions often exceed 900,000, indicating that people actually use the network, not just trade the token, according to Ainvest.
Additionally, XRP spot ETFs remain a popular investment choice among retail investors, attracting over $1.15Bn in inflows since their launch in November 2025, according to CoinGlass data.
If you want more detail on the XRP story, we covered its ETF-driven momentum in XRP ETFs Pull in $1.2B as Bitcoin, Ethereum Funds Cool, and its recent chart signals in XRP Price Nears First “Golden Cross” in 2026. For Sui's institutional angle, check our coverage of ETF interest in Bitwise Files For 11 New Crypto ETFs, Including Uniswap, Sui, Near.

Does This Mean Altcoin Season Has Started for Real after a False Start in 2025?

(SOURCE:BlockchainCenter.net)
Short answer: not yet, but the pieces are lining up. The Altcoin Season Index now tilts toward a more pro-altcoin environment, according to BlockchainCenter.net, and meme coins and AI tokens already reacted first, with some AI names like Render posting +80% weekly gains. That behavior indicates traders feel more comfortable with risk again.
We also see a classic rotation pattern. Bitcoin runs first. Then, large-cap altcoins like XRP price rise, driven by factors such as ETF inflows and CME derivatives. After that, newer Layer-1 chains, such as SUI, and rivals like Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano begin to attract flows as traders bet on the “next big base chain.”
So what does this mean for your wallet today? It shows that money is no longer parked solely in BTC USD. Traders are willing to move into coins with clear stories: payments for XRP, fast smart contracts for Sui, and emerging viral memes such as WHITEWHALE, rather than random small caps with no momentum. That shift can create sharp rallies but also sharp reversals if the narrative cools.
What's the Smart Way to Play This Without Getting Rekt?
This is the risky part of any potential bullish market cycle. Investors remain nervous after a lackluster 2025 for altcoins, during which a reported $4-5Bn was drained from retail traders via Pump.fun alone.
Now, double-digit daily moves feel great when the candles are green, but those same gains when going down can come just as fast. Prediction markets on Myriad still price only a 17% chance of a full-blown alt season in Q1 2026, so the crowd does not yet agree that this is an easy, straight-line uptrend.

(SOURCE: Myriad)
Beginners should treat the likes of SUI and XRP as beta plays around a core holding of Bitcoin or Ethereum, not as a full-stack investment. Never chase a vertical green candle, and definitely not with money you can't afford to lose.
Keep position sizing small, use limit orders instead of emotional market buys, and accept that altcoin rotations often end with painful pullbacks, remembering to take profits all the way up to avoid the dreaded 'round trip'.
If you would like more context on how this fits into the broader moves underway, please see our market update in Crypto Market News Today, January 6. If this rotation strengthens and ETF flows remain strong, SUI, XRP, and other significant altcoins may see more action, as the market always tends to favor the patient, not the FOMO-driven.

Developers recently pushed a significant upgrade: the Beluga Consensus Improvement, which is designed to process more transactions more efficiently, according to OKX. That mix of tech progress and hype around high-throughput chains heading into 2026 gives traders a clear story to buy into.

XRP's story looks different but just as powerful. XRP targets cross-border payments, aiming to be a faster, cheaper alternative to SWIFT for banks and payment providers. Daily XRP Ledger transactions often exceed 900,000, indicating that people actually use the network, not just trade the token, according to Ainvest.

Additionally, XRP spot ETFs remain a popular investment choice among retail investors, attracting over $1.15Bn in inflows since their launch in November 2025, according to CoinGlass data.

If you want more detail on the XRP story, we covered its ETF-driven momentum in XRP ETFs Pull in $1.2B as Bitcoin, Ethereum Funds Cool, and its recent chart signals in XRP Price Nears First “Golden Cross” in 2026.

Short answer: not yet, but the pieces are lining up. The Altcoin Season Index now tilts toward a more pro-altcoin environment, according to BlockchainCenter.net, and meme coins and AI tokens already reacted first, with some AI names like Render posting +80% weekly gains. That behavior indicates traders feel more comfortable with risk again.

We also see a classic rotation pattern. Bitcoin runs first. Then, large-cap altcoins like XRP price rise, driven by factors such as ETF inflows and CME derivatives. After that, newer Layer-1 chains, such as SUI, and rivals like Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano begin to attract flows as traders bet on the “next big base chain.”

So what does this mean for your wallet today? It shows that money is no longer parked solely in BTC USD. Traders are willing to move into coins with clear stories: payments for XRP, fast smart contracts for Sui, and emerging viral memes such as WHITEWHALE, rather than random small caps with no momentum. That shift can create sharp rallies but also sharp reversals if the narrative cools.

This is the risky part of any potential bullish market cycle. Investors remain nervous after a lackluster 2025 for altcoins, during which a reported $4-5Bn was drained from retail traders via Pump.fun alone.

Now, double-digit daily moves feel great when the candles are green, but those same gains when going down can come just as fast. Prediction markets on Myriad still price only a 17% chance of a full-blown alt season in Q1 2026, so the crowd does not yet agree that this is an easy, straight-line uptrend.

Beginners should treat the likes of SUI and XRP as beta plays around a core holding of Bitcoin or Ethereum, not as a full-stack investment. Never chase a vertical green candle, and definitely not with money you can't afford to lose.

Keep position sizing small, use limit orders instead of emotional market buys, and accept that altcoin rotations often end with painful pullbacks, remembering to take profits all the way up to avoid the dreaded 'round trip'.

If you would like more context on how this fits into the broader moves underway, please see our market update in Crypto Market News Today, January 6. If this rotation strengthens and ETF flows remain strong, SUI, XRP, and other significant altcoins may see more action, as the market always tends to favor the patient, not the FOMO-driven.

                        Crypto treasuries break traditional finance models, but their volatility, decentralized governance and built-in transparency help redefine the CFO's role from gatekeeper to resilience architect.

Cash flows are forecasted, liabilities are denominated in stable currencies, and transparency is something produced quarterly, often through intermediaries.

But what about for the treasury teams and finance functions of cryptocurrency-native organizations? In the world of public blockchains, assumptions from traditional finance break down quickly. Volatility is structural, governance is collective, and transparency is not an output of the system but the system itself.

That reality has reshaped the role of the chief financial officer inside crypto-native organizations, none more so than at the Cardano Foundation. CFO Stephen Wood said the mandate is less about guarding the balance sheet in the conventional sense and more about engineering financial resilience into a public digital infrastructure that has no single owner.

“What is unique about Cardano is the nature of its decentralized, community-driven governance, where we have on-chain governance and even a constitution,” Wood told PYMNTS in an interview.

In practice, that means the treasury is not simply a pool of capital controlled by an executive team. It is a shared resource whose stewardship must balance long-term sustainability, short-term liquidity needs, and the economic incentives that keep a decentralized network functioning.

Real-time on-chain treasury management enables faster settlement, lower fees and automated reconciliations. It also provides “instant global visibility into how assets are managed and proof of holdings,” Wood said, which directly builds investor confidence.

The CFO's role, then, becomes one of architect and facilitator rather than gatekeeper. Outside of the blockchain finance space, this is an emerging reality that many finance teams across industries are being faced with and embracing.

Liquidity management is one of the most persistent challenges for blockchain-based organizations. Treasury assets are often denominated in native tokens that can fluctuate in value, while liabilities from payroll to vendor contracts are typically denominated in fiat currencies. Traditional hedging strategies only partially apply.

Wood said his own response has been to layer conventional financial discipline onto blockchain-native tools.

“To achieve this, we utilize both multi-year and short-term treasury allocation plans,” he said, describing a structure that mirrors institutional asset-liability management while acknowledging crypto's volatility. “Recognizing the inherent volatility of our crypto holdings, we also build our execution capability by adopting a hybrid risk management methodology.”

Instead of relying solely on periodic reports or third-party assurances, the Cardano Foundation can monitor treasury positions, exposures and liquidity conditions directly on the blockchain ledger. For institutional partners and ecosystem participants, that visibility helps change the nature of trust.

“For our partners and the wider ecosystem, on-chain analytics provides compliance teams and institutional investors with the transparent, real-time data they need to manage liquidity as risk fluctuates,” Wood said, adding that on-chain systems can surface stress signals as they develop, allowing organizations to act before vulnerabilities cascade.

“By moving financial data onto a transparent ledger, we eliminate the ‘information asymmetry' that typically hides systemic vulnerabilities,” he added.

Through platforms like Reeve, the Cardano Foundation publishes financial data directly onto the blockchain, creating a verifiable, real-time record of assets and allocations.

Despite these innovations, some financial challenges remain analog. Working capital management, in particular, is complicated by the mismatch between crypto-denominated assets and fiat-denominated obligations.

The solution, at least for now, is prudence rather than financial engineering, Wood said.

It is a reminder that even the most advanced blockchain infrastructure must still contend with real-world financial constraints, and that discipline, not innovation alone, underpins sustainability.

While much of the crypto industry continues to search for durable real-world applications, Wood said he sees artificial intelligence as one of the most mature and promising intersections with public blockchain infrastructure.

At Cardano, AI is not treated as a speculative add-on but as an operational layer with direct implications for finance, compliance and governance.

Wood pointed to Cardano's work with the Masumi network, developed by Serviceplan Group and NMKR, which supports more than 500 companies through a decentralized AI agent network. These agents are designed to interact autonomously while preserving data privacy and regulatory compliance.

“AI agents can identify each other, verify underlying data without exposing it, and maintain audit logs that meet European supervisory requirements,” Wood said. “These aren't speculative applications. This is real-world infrastructure being used by major institutions.”

For finance leaders, the implication is that AI and blockchain together can create systems that are not only faster and more efficient, but also more governable.

Lloyds has completed its first digital assets transaction
using Tokenised Deposits. The bank said this was the first time in the UK that
tokenised deposits had been issued on a public blockchain. It also said this
was the first global use of sterling deposits in this format.

The transaction was carried out on the Canton Network. This
is a public blockchain designed for regulated financial markets. Lloyds Bank
PLC issued the Tokenised Deposits on the network. Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets
then used the deposits to purchase a Tokenised Gilt issued by Archax.

Following the purchase, Archax transferred the underlying
funds back into its standard account at Lloyds. The movement of funds showed
how transactions can flow between blockchain-based systems and existing banking
infrastructure. Lloyds said the process demonstrated interoperability between
the two environments.

Surath Sengupta, Head of Transaction Banking Products at
Lloyds, said the transaction offered “a glimpse into the future of finance.” He
said tokenisation brings “real-world assets onto blockchain

Digital Asset and Kinexys by JPMorgan are preparing to bring JPM Coin, the bank's dollar-denominated deposit token, natively onto the Canton Network. The move extends JPMorgan's digital cash beyond its existing internal infrastructure and onto a public blockchain designed for institutional use.

The initiative follows JPMorgan's recent pilot deploying JPM Coin on Coinbase's Base network for institutional clients. Bank executives have said the token will roll out across multiple public blockchains over time, with Canton becoming another pillar in that multi-chain approach.

JPM Coin, branded as JPMD within Kinexys Digital Payments, represents a digital claim on U.S. dollar deposits held at JPMorgan. The bank describes it as “the first bank-issued, USD-denominated deposit token” built specifically for institutional clients and issued on distributed ledger infrastructure rather than through stablecoin issuers or offshore vehicles.

The Canton Network is a public, permissionless layer-one blockchain built for institutional finance. It combines privacy controls, compliance tooling, and scalability under a shared framework governed by the Canton Foundation and supported by major financial firms. Unlike bank-specific ledgers, Canton is designed as a neutral settlement layer where multiple institutions can transact across asset classes.

By bringing JPM Coin onto Canton, JPMorgan and Digital Asset are attempting to solve a long-standing limitation of bank-issued tokens: isolation. Tokens that live only on internal ledgers restrict interoperability with tokenized securities, onchain collateral, and other blockchain-based workflows. Canton offers a way to keep regulated money inside a shared environment without forcing participants onto a single bank's infrastructure.

“This collaboration brings to life the vision of regulated digital cash that can move at the speed of markets,” said Yuval Rooz, co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset.

Under the plan, JPM Coin will be issued, transferred, and redeemed directly on Canton rather than bridged in from private systems. The partners are taking a phased approach through 2026, beginning with technical integration and business frameworks that allow near-instant settlement onchain.

Naveen Mallela, global co-head of Kinexys by JPMorgan, said the effort pushes the industry forward by combining “the security of bank-issued deposits and settlement” with the “speed and innovation of 24/7, near real-time blockchain transactions.”

Unlike permissionless stablecoins, JPM Coin remains a regulated deposit liability of JPMorgan. Transfers will operate within institutional compliance standards, but execution and settlement occur on a public blockchain rather than through legacy clearing systems. The goal is to let regulated cash interact directly with tokenized assets, margin workflows, and atomic settlement models.

Demand for onchain money is rising from both crypto-native firms and traditional companies experimenting with tokenized assets. Institutions want cash that settles instantly, remains available outside banking hours, and fits within existing regulatory expectations. Public blockchains offer speed and interoperability, but institutions have been reluctant to rely solely on third-party stablecoins.

JPMorgan's approach offers an alternative: deposit-backed digital cash that stays within the banking system while operating on public rails. The Canton integration also opens the door to additional Kinexys products, including blockchain-based deposit accounts that could support cash management for firms trading tokenized securities or using onchain collateral.

Canton itself has drawn attention recently after pilots involving tokenized U.S. Treasurys. Interest in its native Canton Coin has risen alongside speculation about its role as a settlement asset within institutional decentralized finance-style workflows, though the network's focus remains on infrastructure rather than retail activity.

Digital Asset and Kinexys plan to progress integration work throughout 2026, starting with issuance and transfer mechanics before expanding into broader use cases. Further details on transaction volumes, regulatory scope, and client adoption have not yet been disclosed.

If successful, the Canton deployment would place JPM Coin alongside other public blockchain pilots and reinforce a wider shift in market structure. Large banks are no longer limiting blockchain activity to internal ledgers; they are testing how regulated money can operate directly within shared, public networks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Nike quietly says goodbye to NFT arm","https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/markets/nike-quietly-says-goodbye-to-nft-subsidiary","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:41:40 GMT","

Nike just did it.

Yes, the athletic footwear and apparel company finally sold off its non-fungible token (NFT) arm, RTFKT.

This is a quiet end to an acquisition that once symbolized the company's ambitious metaverse plans.

NFTs are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain, representing ownership or proof of authenticity for items such as art, music, collectibles, videos, or virtual goods. 

Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH), which are interchangeable, each NFT has distinct metadata that makes it one of a kind, hence “nonfungible.”

NFTs became mainstream in 2021 as artists, brands, and game developers began selling digital items verified on networks like Ethereum. 

However, their popularity has declined due to market saturation, falling resale values, and waning speculative interest.

Scams, environmental concerns, and shifting investor focus toward AI and real-world assets (RWAs) have further dampened demand. Many projects failed to deliver lasting utility, leading to reduced confidence and lower trading volumes.

RTFKT was a digital fashion and collectibles studio specializing in NFTs, 3D art and virtual wearables.

Founded in 2020 by Benoit Pagotto, Chris Le, and Steven Vasilev, the company gained prominence for blending gaming culture, blockchain technology, and high-end sneaker design. 

Nike acquired the startup in 2021 under former CEO John Donahoe, as part of its push into the metaverse and digital collectibles market. 

RTFKT became a key player in developing Nike's Web3 strategy, launching virtual sneakers and avatars before Nike eventually shuttered and sold the subsidiary.

The OregonLive reported on Jan. 6 that Nike has sold its digital art and collectibles studio.

The sale followed the company's decision in 2023 to shut down the subsidiary. 

Current CEO Elliott Hill is shifting the company's focus back to core sports performance and rebuilding relationships with major wholesale partners such as Dick's Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. 

The sportswear giant confirmed with OregonLive that the sale of RTFKT, pronounced “Artifact,"" became effective on Dec. 16, launching what it called “a new chapter for the company and its community.” 

Terms of the deal, including the buyer, were not disclosed.

In its statement, Nike said it “continues to invest in delivering innovative products and experiences across physical, digital, and virtual environments.”

Before winding down RTFKT's operations, Nike said in a post on Medium in 2024 that it would temporarily halt the production of NFTs but continue partnerships with gaming companies to develop virtual wearables and in-game products.

Oops, something went wrong

Nike has quietly sold its digital products subsidiary RTFKT, the NFT unit it acquired during the 2021 crypto boom, as the sportswear giant's Converse brand reported a 30% drop in quarterly sales last December.

The sale, effective December 16, marks Nike's definitive exit from blockchain-based collectibles and signals a strategic retreat to its core athletic performance business under the new leadership of CEO Elliott Hill.

The sportswear giant had previously announced plans last year to end its non-fungible token (NFT) operations and other blockchain-based initiatives.

RTFKT was acquired by Nike in 2021 under then-CEO John Donahoe, who prioritized direct and digital sales channels during his tenure, betting heavily on emerging technologies and virtual consumer experiences.

The acquisition was designed to expand Nike's presence in collectibles and metaverse markets during the 2020-2021 NFT and digital worlds bubble, when virtual sneakers and avatars commanded premium prices from collectors and crypto enthusiasts.

In a brief statement, Nike said the RTFKT sale was “launching a new chapter for the company and its community,” adding that it “continues to invest in delivering innovative products and experiences across physical, digital and virtual environments.” 

The carefully worded announcement left room for continued digital initiatives while distancing the company from its blockchain experiments.

Terms of the RTFKT sale, including the buyer's identity and financial details, were not disclosed.

When asked who purchased the unit, Jarlan Perez, Yuga Labs Design Director and former Nike and Google executive, responded cryptically:

“That's up to them to reveal themselves whenever they are ready,” suggesting the buyer may be a prominent player in the digital assets space.

Despite the uncertain future, RTFKT tokens surged by over 270% following reports of the sale, sparking speculation that new ownership could revive the “lost glory” of NFTs.

Nike faces mounting legal pressure over its abrupt departure from digital collectibles, complicating what was already a challenging strategic pivot.

Some purchasers of Nike-themed NFTs and other crypto assets filed a proposed class action lawsuit in Brooklyn federal court last April, seeking damages of at least $5 million for what they characterize as an abandonment of promised digital ecosystems.

Lead plaintiff Jagdeep Cheema, an Australian investor, claims that Nike's abrupt decision to shut down RTFKT wiped out the NFTs' value without adequate notice or compensation.

The lawsuit alleges violations of consumer protection laws in New York, California, Florida, and Oregon, with buyers complaining the company pulled the plug without warning or transition plans.

Some NFTs stopped displaying images correctly after the shutdown announcement, compounding concerns that the assets would no longer be supported or maintained.

The technical failures intensified backlash from collectors who had invested substantial sums based on Nike's reputation and implied commitment to the digital space.

The broader NFT market has collapsed since its April 2022 peak, with over $12 billion wiped from its market cap according to Coingecko data.

The market now struggles to generate $4 million in daily sales volume, a dramatic fall from the substantial sums RTFKT sneakers, hoodies, and Clone X

avatars commanded during the last crypto summer when digital collectibles were seen as the future of brand engagement.

Although the new Nike CEO, Elliott Hill, has not publicly detailed his 2026 strategic plans, the RTFKT sale comes as Nike navigates broader challenges, including Converse's significant revenue decline and increased competition from emerging athletic footwear brands capturing market share.

While Nike maintains it will continue selective virtual partnerships with gaming companies, the sale of RTFKT is a clear pivot away from blockchain-based consumer products toward its core competencies in physical, performance-driven athletic wear, which built the brand's global dominance.

When Bitcoin first launched in 2009, many investors dismissed the currency as a fringe concept and even as a scam. (Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's former right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, memorably called it “stupid and evil.”) But the asset has skyrocketed in value in recent years and President Donald Trump labeled the currency “digital gold” after signing an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last January. Now, reports allege that Venezuela has bought into that “digital gold,” holding a “shadow reserve” nearly double that of the U.S.

Digital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold an estimated $60 billion worth of Bitcoin. Additional intelligence reports allege that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his associates accrued Bitcoin via three channels: a gold swap overseen by Venezuelan Interior Minister Alex Saab in 2018, oil revenue priced in Bitcoin, and by seizing crypto mining equipment from miners in the country.  

Sanctions have walled off the country's access to financial markets for years, and experts allege that they may have motivated Venezuelan leaders to invest in cryptocurrencies to sidestep the barrier.

Bitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela's holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth nearly $22 million. The website sourced the data from a 2022 Forbes article that cited research from a blockchain analytics firm. The total is a far cry from the estimated U.S. holdings of 328,372, currently worth $30 billion, though the claim positions Venezuela's holdings at nearly double the U.S. and one of the biggest holders of bitcoin globally.

The claims of Venezuela's shadow Bitcoin holdings have predictably garnered skeptics, including digital asset financial services company Ledn Co-founder Mauricio di Bartolemo, who grew up in Venezuela and whose family has mined crypto there since 2014.

Di Bartolemo finds no credibility in any of the three alleged sources of bitcoin income: the gold swap, oil exchange or mining equipment seizures. “This to me does not align with anything in the public record,” di Bartolemo told Fortune. “There's so much corruption, embezzlement and missing money that I don't believe that any meaningful amount would have accrued.”

He outlined his full argument in a Coindesk op-ed piece titled “Don't hold your breath for Venezuela's bitcoin.” Though he notes that his family's crypto mining materials were seized by the government in 2018 and returned five years later in a worn down condition, signaling heavy use of the equipment.

Di Bartolemo says that stablecoins have grown in popularity in Venezuela amid rampant inflation. Many Venezuelans send remittances to their families using stablecoins as the currency has a better exchange rate differential than liquid cash.

It is near impossible to track how much crypto the Venezuelan government holds, given the decentralized and clandestine properties of the asset. However, if true, the claims could potentially reshape global Bitcoin markets. 

While most of the U.S. government's crypto holdings were accrued through law enforcement seizures, the rise of crypto as a state-controlled asset entered the mainstream last year after President Trump signed the executive order to create a national Bitcoin reserve to bolster the U.S's position in digital assets, at no cost to taxpayers. 

Now that the U.S. is in effective control of Venezuela, with ambiguous statements from Trump that the U.S. “is going to run” the country, it is unclear what will happen to any Bitcoin reserves that do exist. Real or fake, the claim demonstrates the currency's growing geopolitical significance and the Trump administration's willingness to advance its interest in the digital assets industry.

HIVE (NASDAQ: HIVE) reported strong December 2025 production and full‑year results, driven by higher hashrate and fleet efficiency across a geographically diversified platform.

December 2025: 306 BTC produced (+197% YoY from 103 BTC), average daily production 9.9 BTC/day, hashrate averaged 23.3 EH/s (peak 24 EH/s), fleet efficiency 17.5 J/TH, and BTC per EH/s 13.2. Bitcoin mining difficulty rose 40% YoY for December.

Full‑Year 2025: 2,311 BTC produced (+31% YoY) despite the Bitcoin halving and an annual average network difficulty +46% YoY. HIVE continues to operate at >2% of the global Bitcoin network.

Outlook: Plans to add 100 MW hydroelectric capacity at Yguazú with commissioning targeted for Q3 2026, which would bring renewable footprint to ~540 MW (400 MW Paraguay; 140 MW Canada & Sweden).

Peers showed mixed moves: crypto-related names like BTBT -0.9%, BITF -1.71%, and FUFU +2.01% traded in different directions, while AMRK +2.17% and OPY +0.47% also diverged, suggesting stock-specific factors for HIVE rather than a broad sector move.

Positive crypto/AI growth updates have often coincided with upward moves, while production beats can still see occasional short-term pullbacks.

Over recent months, HIVE has highlighted rapid expansion in Bitcoin production, hashrate, and renewable-powered infrastructure. Key milestones include record Q2 FY2026 revenue of $87.3 million with 717 BTC mined, multiple updates showing network share above 2%, and commissioning of 300 MW in Paraguay with plans for 400 MW. The company also launched a US$300 million ATM. This December 2025 production update extends the same theme of scaling BTC output and efficiency against rising network difficulty.


    This announcement details robust December 2025 performance, with 306 BTC produced, 197% year-over-year growth, and average hashrate of 23.3 EH/s at 17.5 J/TH efficiency. Full-year output reached 2,311 BTC despite higher network difficulty. HIVE also outlined plans for an additional 100 MW of hydro-powered capacity in Paraguay, targeting a 540 MW renewable footprint. Investors may track execution timelines, network share above 2%, and how new capacity influences margins and cash flow.
  

AI-generated analysis. Not financial advice.

This news release constitutes a ""designated news release"" for the purposes of the Company's prospectus supplement dated November 25, 2025 to its short form base shelf prospectus dated October 31, 2025.

San Antonio, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - January 7, 2026) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (BVC: HIVECO) (the ""Company"" or ""HIVE""), a diversified global digital infrastructure company, today reported strong December 2025 Bitcoin production results, highlighting exceptional year-over-year growth, continued quarter-over-quarter momentum, and sustained month-over-month operational strength, despite seasonal weather volatility impacting parts of the Northern Hemisphere.

HIVE continues to operate at more than 2% of the global Bitcoin network, underscoring the Company's scale, reliability, and disciplined execution across its globally diversified fleet.

December 2025 Production Highlights

Bitcoin Produced: 306 BTC

+197% increase year-over-year (103 BTC in December 2024), while Bitcoin mining difficulty increased 40% year-over-year for the month of December.

Strong month-over-month (6%) and quarter-over-quarter (23%) growth, reflecting rising hashrate and improved fleet efficiency

Average Daily Production: 9.9 BTC/day

Hashrate: Averaged 23.3 Exahash per Second (""EH/s""), peaking at 24 EH/s

Fleet Efficiency: 17.5 Joules per Terahash

BTC per EH/s: 13.2 BTC

While extreme cold weather across parts of the Northern Hemisphere temporarily impacted peak hashrate availability, HIVE's geographically decentralized operating model-spanning three continents, nine time zones, and five languages-enabled the Company to maintain high uptime, operational resilience, and production consistency.

Full-Year 2025 Performance

For the full calendar year 2025, HIVE produced 2,311 Bitcoin, representing a 31% increase year-over-year from 1,770 Bitcoin in 2024. This growth was achieved despite the Bitcoin halving and sustained all-time highs in global network difficulty (notably the Bitcoin mining annual average difficulty was 46% higher in 2025 compared to 2024), highlighting HIVE's operational leverage and technology leadership.

Expansion and Growth Outlook

HIVE intends to develop an additional 100 megawatts (""MW"") of hydroelectric-powered data center capacity at its Yguazú campus in Paraguay, with full commissioning targeted for calendar Q3 2026. Long-lead time substation components have been ordered.  The Company will deploy this capacity using a disciplined return-on-invested-capital (""ROIC"") framework, optimizing free cash-flow from green-energy powered data centre infrastructure.

Upon completion, HIVE's renewable energy footprint is expected to reach approximately 540 MW, including:

Management Commentary

Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman, stated: ""At HIVE, we view Bitcoin as bundled, portable energy. Our green data centers convert surplus hydroelectric power into a globally liquid digital asset that can move instantly, without transmission constraints. Maintaining over 2% of the global Bitcoin network reflects years of disciplined execution. As Bitcoin enters its next cycle and AI compute demand accelerates, our dual-engine model allows us to fund growth organically while maximizing the value of renewable energy.""

Aydin Kilic, President & CEO, added: ""December's results demonstrate the strength of HIVE's global operating platform. Seasonal weather events reinforce why we believe in decentralization across multiple geographies. Operating daily across nine time zones allows us to optimize uptime, protect margins, and scale efficiently. We are very pleased with the consistent performance and uptime in our Paraguay operations. Our assets generate cash flow today while remaining flexible for tomorrow, positioning HIVE to compound value through 2026 and beyond.""

Grvt (pronounced Gravity), a hyper-scalable crypto exchange, has announced the launch of Grvt Institute, an education-focused initiative aimed at improving global crypto and blockchain literacy.

As its first program, Grvt Institute is rolling out a crypto literacy pilot in South Korea in partnership with the Korea Insurance Institute, one of the country's leading financial education bodies.

The Grvt Institute is positioned as a non-commercial, public-interest initiative, distinct from exchange-led education platforms that function primarily as marketing channels. 

Designed around a professional certification model, the pilot program in South Korea will offer offline, cohort-based education open to retail participants regardless of prior experience. 

The curriculum will cover crypto fundamentals, risk awareness, and decentralized finance (DeFi), and will conclude with a certificate of completion.

Grvt, which recently raised $19 million in Series A funding to scale privacy-focused on-chain finance, plans to expand the initiative into a global online curriculum following the initial offline cohorts. 

The broader objective is to lower barriers to crypto and blockchain adoption by emphasizing foundational knowledge, disciplined risk awareness, and practical security education.

Addressing the crypto literacy gap 

Global adoption of crypto and blockchain technology has moved faster than education, leaving many users without a clear grasp of core concepts such as blockchain mechanics, self-custody, and risk management. 

This gap has contributed to avoidable losses, poor decision-making, and weakened public trust in the sector.

Grvt Institute was created to address this imbalance through neutral, foundational education that prioritizes understanding over speculation. 

Developed in partnership with trusted institutions such as the Korea Insurance Institute, the curriculum combines blockchain fundamentals with established financial risk-management principles. 

The aim is to raise the standard for credible, professional-grade education in the Web3 ecosystem.

Korea pilot: a first step toward global education

South Korea was chosen as the launch market due to its high level of digital adoption and strong engagement with emerging financial technologies. 

Through its partnership with the Korea Insurance Institute, Grvt Institute combines blockchain-focused expertise with long-standing experience in financial education and consumer protection. 

The first cohort of the program is scheduled to begin in February 2026.

The program is built around several core elements. It follows a neutral, public-interest approach with no promotional content and balanced coverage of both opportunities and risks. 

The curriculum focuses on blockchain fundamentals, key digital asset categories, market structure, and risk awareness.

The Korea pilot will be used to refine the model before expanding it into a global digital education program.

Grvt Institute aims to function as foundational educational infrastructure for a safer and more sustainable digital asset ecosystem. 

Grvt's view is that responsible, long-term adoption of crypto and blockchain technology requires as much investment in public understanding as in technological development. 

At the core of this approach is the belief that education is essential to building trust.

“Crypto and DeFi represent a meaningful shift in how financial systems can work, but technology alone is not enough,” said Hong Yea, co-founder and CEO of Grvt. 

“If we want responsible, long-term adoption, we must invest in education. Grvt Institute is our commitment to helping people understand what crypto and blockchain actually are, how to use them safely, and how they can create real value beyond speculation.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Lloyds leads UK banking shift to blockchain technology","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lloyds-uk-banking-blockchain-technology/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:42:00 GMT","

One of Britain's largest banks, Lloyd, is working with multiple technology companies to eliminate physical paperwork from its processes in favor of blockchain systems and artificial intelligence across its business, from global trade deals to secured consumer lending.

The initiative aims to speed up transactions and cut costs in various areas of the business. Changes are underway in how the institution handles trade documentation.

The move towards digital record-keeping picked up steam in 2023 through a partnership with Enigio. The collaboration allows the bank to handle shipping papers, bills of exchange, and promissory notes through blockchain without printing or posting physical documents. 

This builds on work from 2022, when Lloyds processed Britain's first digital promissory note, with a digital bill of exchange twelve months later.

The bank broadened its digital footprint in 2024 by linking up with WaveBL, a blockchain system operating in 136 countries. Customers can now move electronic bills of lading worldwide, eliminating courier fees and the waiting times that come with paper systems. 

The bank recently finished a digital Letter of Credit transaction connecting India and the United Kingdom. Where traditional paper approaches typically require several weeks, this digital method wrapped up in just four days. The faster processing supports a trade agreement between both countries targeting $120 billion in commerce by 2030.

Plans for 2027 include introducing tokenized deposits. Through “smart contracts,” the bank wants to automate legal steps like conveyancing and document handling.

This work forms part of a broader trial run by UK Finance involving other big names, including Barclays, HSBC, and Santander. The consortium is examining how tokenized money works for online purchases, remortgaging homes, and completing wholesale bond settlements. Designers believe these arrangements will reduce the risk of fraud and enable “programmable money,” where payments happen automatically when specific conditions are satisfied.

Quant Network manages the infrastructure for this framework, which should be operational by 2026. Lloyds expects this setup will eventually connect with central bank digital currencies and private assets, positioning the UK as a leader in international digital finance.

The institution is also making substantial investments in artificial intelligence. The bank now runs a cloud-based system handling 18 generative AI applications and more than 80 machine learning programs. Officials predict these AI tools will deliver £50 million in value this year, climbing to £150 million the following year.

AI is already producing financial results. Since 2021, the bank reports cutting £1.5 billion in costs through automation. The bank plans to launch a new AI financial assistant by 2026.

A recent survey revealed that 54% of UK financial companies believe AI will offer a competitive edge. Lloyds has already put over 800 AI models to work across 200 different internal operations. These initiatives helped the bank secure an “Outstanding” rating in the 2025 Euromoney Global Digital Banking report. 

Currently, the bank counts 23 million customers using digital platforms, with 21 million on its mobile app.

Competing banks are also spending on technology. Barclays, for instance, has concentrated on an AI assistant for employees, and Santander is applying data to forecast when customers might have trouble with loan repayments. Meanwhile, Lloyds is pursuing comparable AI projects while simultaneously advancing blockchain into trade and deposits.

Through digitizing these operations, the bank is tackling persistent problems with high costs, sluggish processing times, and the environmental burden of paper-intensive banking. As the UK shifts its financial approach towards digital assets, Lloyds is wagering on this combination of AI and blockchain.

Why Does Venezuela Have So Much Oil? Geology

Trump has cited Venezuela's oil resources as motivation for capturing the nation's leader—here's the geology behind the news

President Donald Trump's push to take control of Venezuela's oil has focused global attention on the South American nation's vast reserves.

Trump has repeatedly touted Venezuela's rich oil supply as among the motivations for the January 2 military assault on the country and the capture of its leader, Nicolás Maduro, who has since been charged with drug trafficking and weapons possession.

But just how much oil does Venezuela have, and why?

In 2024 the country claimed more than 300 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, the highest of any nation. The runners up were Saudi Arabia, with more than 260 billion barrels, and Iran, with more than 200 billion barrels. The global total was 1,566 billion barrels.

And the vast reserves are not a coincidence. Geology is very much in Venezuela's favor, says Luis Zerpa, a petroleum engineer at the Colorado School of Mines. “From the geology side, it just has the perfect location,” he says. And like all fossil fuels, the country's oil owes its existence to deep time—and the planet's dynamic surface.

The story of oil begins when land is pushed up in one region, creating a low-lying basin nearby, Zerpa says. Rock is eroded from the higher-elevation land into the basin, which also fills with the organic remains of plants and animals. Over millions of years, enough material piles up above to raise the temperature and pressure to the point that sediments turn into rock and organic material becomes oil and gas.

The balance of oil and gas depends on two factors. The first is how much rock builds up above the material. The so-called oil window occurs at a depth of anywhere between 4,000 and 12,000 feet; below it, organic matter is more likely to turn into gas. The other factor is the origin of the organic material itself—marine plants are more likely to become oil, whereas terrestrial plants are more likely to become gas.

As oil and gas form—and as tectonic plates move—the rock surrounding these deposits begins to fracture. This sets the hydrocarbons free from the source rock in which they formed and enables them to migrate up into more porous rock that then traps them in place.

Venezuela is nestled between the Caribbean and South American plates. And the Nazca plate, which underlies the eastern Pacific Ocean, also shapes the area's tectonic scene. The jostling of all those plates lifted up the northern Andes and other highlands in the region—while it simultaneously created three sedimentary basins that have produced oil and gas: the Eastern Venezuela Basin in the north, the Maracaibo basin in the northwest and the Barinas-Apure basin in the west.

Hence, Venezuela's more than 300 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves were formed. Here, “proven” means that engineers have drilled enough wells to accurately estimate the extent of oil and gas deposits in the country's territory.

Getting that oil is a different matter. Venezuela's production of the fossil fuel peaked around 1970 at around 3.7 million barrels per day, before it fell steeply starting in the late 1970s and continued to drop during the 1980s. It recovered here and there in the mid-1990s and early 2010s. But in 2025 the nation produced only around 1.1 million barrels per day. Analysts expect that any political transition in the wake of Maduro's capture and arrest will barely raise that output for at least the next two years: aging infrastructure has severely constrained production, and fixing that will take billions of dollars in investment and several years, Reuters has reported.

‘Microbubbles' Help Spread Dangerous Microplastics Through Our Water, Study Finds

Water plays a crucial role in how tiny pieces of plastic enter our environment—and us

If you read the research on microplastics, these pollutants appear to be as frightening as they are ubiquitous. Found throughout our bodies, food and environment, both microplastics and their ingredients have been linked to heart attacks, stroke, respiratory conditions, fertility issues and death—to name just a few issues.

Yet despite these traits, scientists don't fully understand how all the minuscule filaments of plastic get into our environment. A study published last month in Science Advances offers some new clues as to how water may be contributing to their spread.

Scientists already knew that plastics degrade through exposure to sunlight and repeated weathering by waves, sand or other debris. But the new study suggests contact with water itself is also a factor: in both marine and river environments, researchers found that microbubbles can form on the surface of a piece of plastic, breaking it down—and releasing tiny, practically invisible plastic bits into the surrounding water.

From there, nanoplastics and microplastics often enter the food chain—and, in turn, us. An estimated 130 million metric tons of plastic waste enters our bodies and the environment every year, with that number on track to more than double by 2040.

The results, the researchers write, could inspire future research on how to control the release of microplastic into, well, everything. “Plastic degradation is an invisible threat to the environment and human health,” said John Boland, a professor in the School of Chemistry at Trinity College Dublin and senior author of the study, in a statement. “Society urgently needs to come to grips with the enormity of the challenge posed by our ubiquitous use of plastics.”

The more welcoming side of Medusa turns typical mythology upside down, with the smile likely designed to represent peace and prosperity.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Depictions of Medusa are typically at least a bit frightening, with her snakes for hair and menacing facial expressions. However, a carved Medusa image recently discovered by archaeologists at an ancient Roman forum offers a fresh take on the iconic character from Greek mythology—the team unearthed ceiling panels above marbled columns showing Medusa smiling like a child.

“Our Medusa was made just like an Eros, like the face of a very small child and in a smiling pose,” Fatma Bagdatli Cam, Bartin University professor, said according to Turkey Today.

Archaeologists discovered the distinct smiling Medusa during excavations in the ancient city of Amastris (now known as Amasra, and located in modern-day Turkey) while working through a monumental Roman forum with a columned gallery and ceiling tiles. As part of Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism's Heritage for the Future project, in conjunction with the university's Archaeology Application and Research Center, a 30,000-square-foot area has so far yielded marble columns up to 30 feet tall.

The research team is attempting to recreate the forum (also known as a Roman stoa), and has uncovered at least seven columns, additional architectural blocks, ceiling coffers, and evidence that a second stoa sits nearby. The discoveries have prompted experts to dub Amasra a city of splendor during Roman rule. The forum would have been at the heart of community interactions—everything from commerce to social interactions. Cam said that every artifact helps develop a clearer picture of common life and culture in Amasra during the Roman era.

The presence of a smiling Medusa, then, represents a stark contrast to expectations in more ways than one. With the character from Greek mythology known for her snakes for hair, sharp teeth, and a terrifying expression designed to turn onlookers into stone, images of Medusa were commonly used to scare would-be visitors. Serving as a deterrent, depictions would often be placed on architectural elements, decorative pieces within buildings, or even on shields.

The more welcoming side of Medusa seen at Amasra turns typical mythology upside down, with the smile instead designed to represent peace and prosperity, Cam said. The unique discovery also has the team excited for what other artifacts they may uncover at Amasra—past finds at the site include an Alexander the Great statue head, statues of a nymph, and multiple Lares statues from a regional Roman religion.

While looking to uncover more artifacts, work continues to recreate the Roman stoa—three of the columns have already been re-erected—and eventually open the site to visitors. “We are very excited,” Cam said. “We want the area to be brought to tourism as soon as possible, and we want domestic and foreign tourists to see and watch the ancient city gradually rise to its feet.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The remains of a distinct Bronze Age community found in the Grotta della Monaca caves within the Pollino massif in Calabria, Italy, offered up some intriguing insights into how the group formed and lived. What they uncovered included the first archaeologically-recorded incestuous relationship, as well as a difficult bond with lactose. 

By studying human remains from 1780 to 1380 B.C.E. which were found in the caves, a team of researchers from the Max Planck Harvard Research Center for the Ancient Mediterranean and the University of Bologna in Italy reconstructed the genetic and social profile of the Protapennine community from northwestern Calabria some 3,500 years ago. It's the first genetic and social profile of such a community and shows how the mountain group had a distinct ancestry and way of life. 

The team published its findings in a study in Communications Biology, highlighting the population history, kinship patterns, and cultural practices of this distinct Bronze Age group prior to Greek colonization of the region.

DNA analysis shows strong ties to Early Bronze Age Sicily, with little influence from the eastern Mediterranean. There's also links to northeastern Italy, as well as a local mix of hunter-gatherers, early farmers, and Steppe ancestries. 

“Our analysis shows that the Grotta della Monaca populations shared strong genetic affinities with Early Bronze Age groups from Sicily, yet lacked the eastern Mediterranean influences found among their Sicilian contemporaries,” Francesco Fontani, first author of the study and affiliated researcher at the Max Planck Harvard Research Center for the Ancient Mediterranean, said in a statement. “This suggests that, while in contact across the Strait of Messina, Tyrrhenian Calabria followed its own demographic and cultural trajectories during prehistory.” 

The site—known for copper and iron ore exploitation and funerary use—has an apparent geographic isolation, but it wasn't fully genetically autonomous. Two individuals show ancestral links to populations from northeastern Italy, showing long-distance mobility and interactions across the peninsula. The genomes revealed contributions from European hunter-gatherers, Anatolian Neolithic farmers, and Steppe pastoralists, and while these components are all common in Bronze Age Europe, they form a local signature for the people of the Calabria mountains. 

The team may have also found the first case reported in archaeological literature of a parent-offspring incestuous union, “an extreme case that we attempt to frame into the demographic landscape of prehistoric communities of Bronze Age southern Italy,” wrote the study's authors.  

“The finding emphasizes the distinction between unambiguous biological evidence and its social meaning,” Alissa Mittnik, group leader at the Department of Archeeogenetics of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and co-senior author of the research, said in a statement. “This exceptional case may indicate culturally specific behaviors in this small community, but its significance ultimately remains uncertain.” 

The researchers also determined that, based on isotopic and genetic data, the community within the Grotta della Monaca practiced pastoralism and consumed milk and dairy products. This occurred despite their carrying genetic variants associated with adult lactose intolerance. Donata Luiselli, co-senior author of the study and head of the Ancient DNA Laboratory at the University of Bologna, said this “illustrates how cultural adaption can precede genetic evolution. These people had developed dietary strategies that allowed them to thrive in a challenging mountain environment, despite lacking genetic tolerance to lactose.” 

The remains found in the caves show that instead of an isolated site, Grotta della Monaca likely functioned as a collective burial site for a community, all while reinforcing the familial bonds of the group. The burial practices were structured according to the sex and kinship relations of the deceased. 

“Situated over 600 meters [nearly 2,000 feet] above sea level in the Pollino massif, Grotta della Monaca continues to reveal key evidence about the first complex societies of southern Italy,” Felice Larocca, speleoarchaeologist and director of the research at the site, said in a statement, “and, more broadly, about the biological and cultural roots of human diversity.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Ancient skeletons reveal viruses embedded in human DNA","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106224628.htm","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:09:31 GMT","

Scientists have, for the first time, rebuilt ancient genomes of Human betaherpesvirus 6A and 6B (HHV-6A/B) using DNA from archaeological human remains that are more than 2,000 years old. The research, led by teams at the University of Vienna and the University of Tartu (Estonia) and published in Science Advances, shows that these viruses have been closely linked with humans since at least the Iron Age. The findings confirm a long evolutionary relationship and reveal that one strain, HHV-6A, appears to have lost its ability to integrate into human DNA early in its history.

HHV-6B infects roughly 90 percent of children by age two and is best known for causing roseola infantum -- or ""sixth disease"" -- the most common cause of febrile seizures in young children. Along with its close relative HHV-6A, it belongs to a widespread group of herpesviruses that typically cause a mild early infection before remaining dormant in the body for life.

What sets these viruses apart is their unusual ability to insert their genetic material into human chromosomes. This allows the virus to stay inactive for long periods and, in rare cases, be passed down from parent to child as part of the human genome. Today, about one percent of people carry these inherited viral copies. While scientists had long suspected that these integrations occurred far in the past, direct genetic evidence had been missing until now.

Searching for Viral DNA in Ancient Human Remains

To uncover that evidence, an international team led by the University of Vienna and the University of Tartu (Estonia), working with researchers from the University of Cambridge and University College London, analyzed nearly 4,000 human skeletal samples from archaeological sites across Europe. From this large dataset, the team successfully identified and reconstructed eleven ancient herpesvirus genomes.

The oldest genome came from a young girl who lived in Iron Age Italy (1100-600 BCE). Other samples spanned a wide range of locations and time periods. Both HHV-6A and HHV-6B were detected in medieval remains from England, Belgium, and Estonia, while HHV-6B was also found in ancient samples from Italy and early historic Russia. Several individuals from England carried inherited forms of HHV-6B, making them the earliest known cases of chromosomally integrated human herpesviruses. The Belgian site of Sint-Truiden stood out, yielding the highest number of cases and evidence that both viral species circulated within the same community.

""While HHV-6 infects almost 90% of the human population at some point in their life, only around 1% carry the virus, which was inherited from your parents, in all cells of their body. These 1% of cases are what we are most likely to identify using ancient DNA, making the search for viral sequences quite difficult,"" said the lead researcher of the study, Meriam Guellil, University of Vienna, Department of Evolutionary Anthropology. ""Based on our data, the viruses' evolution can now be traced over more than 2,500 years across Europe, using genomes from the 8th-6th century BCE until today.""

Viral Integrations That Lasted for Millennia

By reconstructing these ancient genomes, researchers were able to pinpoint where the viruses had integrated into human chromosomes. When compared with modern genetic data, the results showed that some viral integrations occurred thousands of years ago and were passed down through many generations.

The analysis also revealed that HHV-6A and HHV-6B followed different evolutionary paths. One of the two viruses, HHV-6A, appears to have lost its ability to integrate into human DNA over time, suggesting that its interaction with human hosts changed as both evolved together.

Modern Health Links and Ancient Origins

""Carrying a copy of HHV6B in your genome has been linked to angina-heart-disease,"" says Charlotte Houldcroft (Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge). ""We know that these inherited forms of HHV6A and B are more common in the UK today compared to the rest of Europe, and this is the first evidence of ancient carriers from Britain.""

A New Window Into Virus and Human Coevolution

The discovery of ancient HHV-6 genomes provides the first time-stamped genetic proof of long-term virus-human coevolution at the DNA level. It also highlights how ancient DNA can illuminate the deep history of infectious diseases, showing how short-lived childhood infections can eventually become part of the human genome.

Although HHV-6A and HHV-6B were only identified in the 1980s, this research traces their presence back to the Iron Age. ""Modern genetic data suggested that HHV-6 may have been evolving with humans since our migration out of Africa,"" says Guellil. ""These ancient genomes now provide first concrete proof of their presence in the deep human past.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Breakthrough lets scientists watch plants breathe in real time","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106224625.htm","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:19:31 GMT","

Scientists have long understood that plants take in air through tiny openings on their leaves known as stomata. These microscopic pores act like adjustable valves, letting carbon dioxide enter the leaf for photosynthesis while allowing water vapor to escape into the air. Until now, closely tracking this balancing act as it happens has been extremely difficult.

Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have now created a powerful new system that makes this possible. Their study, published in the journal Plant Physiology, introduces a tool called ""Stomata In-Sight."" It overcomes a major obstacle in plant science by allowing scientists to observe the minute movements of stomata while also measuring, at the same time, how much gas the leaf is exchanging with the atmosphere under carefully controlled conditions.

Why Stomata Matter for Crops and Water Use

Stomata (Greek for ""mouths"") play a central role in agriculture worldwide. When these pores open, plants absorb the carbon they need to grow. But this process also leads to water loss. Because of this tradeoff, the number of stomata on a leaf and how they open and close directly affect how efficiently a plant uses water.

Understanding this process is essential for developing crops that can grow with less water and still reliably produce food, biofuel and bioproducts, especially in regions facing drought. As the research team explained, ""Traditionally, we've had to choose between seeing the stomata or measuring their function.""

Earlier approaches often relied on taking leaf impressions (like taking a dental mold), which only show a frozen moment in time. Other methods used standard microscopes that could view the leaf but offered no control over the surrounding environment. This limitation matters because stomata respond quickly to changes in light, temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide levels.

A Window Into the Living Leaf

The new ""Stomata In-Sight"" system brings together three advanced technologies in a single setup:

Live Confocal Microscopy     This laser-based imaging method produces sharp, three-dimensional images of living plant cells without cutting into the tissue.

Leaf Gas Exchange Measurement     Highly sensitive instruments track exactly how much CO2 the leaf absorbs and how much water vapor it releases.

Environmental Control     A specialized chamber allows researchers to precisely adjust light, temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide to simulate real-world growing conditions.

By combining these tools, scientists can directly observe how stomata behave as environmental conditions change, providing a real-time view of plant responses that was not possible before.

Why This Breakthrough Matters

This detailed look at plant function could reshape how crops are bred. By pinpointing the physical and chemical signals that tell stomata when to open or close, and by understanding how stomatal density affects this behavior, researchers can identify genetic traits linked to ""smarter"" plants -- crops that use water most efficiently.

This is especially important because water availability is the single greatest environmental limit on agricultural production. Improving water-use efficiency could help crops withstand increasing heat and drought stress.

The system was developed by Joseph D. Crawford, Dustin Mayfield-Jones, Glenn A. Fried, Nicolas Hernandez and Andrew D.B. Leakey at the Department of Plant Biology and the Institute for Genomic Biology at the University of Illinois.

About the Study

The research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation, the National Science Foundation and a philanthropic gift. The findings appear in an open-access paper titled, ""Stomata In-Sight: Integrating Live Confocal Microscopy with Leaf Gas Exchange and Environmental Control,"" published in Plant Physiology.

There is a new reason to take daily tooth brushing seriously. Researchers in South Korea have found strong evidence that bacteria from the mouth can move into the gut and influence brain cells, potentially playing a role in the development of Parkinson's disease.

The study was carried out by a collaborative team led by Professor Ara Koh and doctoral candidate Hyunji Park from POSTECH's Department of Life Sciences, working alongside Professor Yunjong Lee and doctoral candidate Jiwon Cheon of Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine. The group also partnered with Professor Han-Joon Kim from Seoul National University College of Medicine. Together, they identified a biological process showing how substances produced by oral bacteria in the gut may help set Parkinson's disease in motion. Their findings were published in Nature Communications.

Parkinson's disease is a widespread neurological condition marked by tremors, muscle stiffness, and slower movement. It affects about 1-2% of people worldwide over the age of 65, making it one of the most common brain disorders linked to aging. Earlier research suggested that people with Parkinson's have different gut bacteria than healthy individuals, but which microbes were involved and how they affected the disease remained uncertain.

A cavity-causing bacterium emerges as a suspect

The researchers discovered higher levels of Streptococcus mutans -- a common oral bacterium known for causing dental caries -- in the gut microbiomes of people with Parkinson's. This bacterium produces an enzyme called urocanate reductase (UrdA) along with a metabolic byproduct known as imidazole propionate (ImP). Both substances were found at increased levels in the gut and bloodstream of patients. Evidence suggested that ImP can travel through the body, reach the brain, and contribute to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons.

Mouse studies reveal Parkinson's-like damage

To better understand this process, the team conducted experiments in mice. They either introduced S. mutans directly into the animals' guts or genetically modified E. coli to produce UrdA. In both cases, ImP levels rose in the blood and brain tissue. The mice developed key features associated with Parkinson's disease, including damage to dopaminergic neurons, increased brain inflammation, movement problems, and greater buildup of alpha-synuclein, a protein closely tied to disease progression.

Blocking a key signaling pathway

Additional experiments showed that these harmful effects depended on activation of a signaling protein complex called mTORC1. When mice were treated with a drug that inhibits mTORC1, researchers saw a clear reduction in brain inflammation, neuron loss, alpha-synuclein accumulation, and motor problems. These results suggest that targeting the oral-gut microbiome and the compounds it produces could open new paths for treating Parkinson's disease.

""Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how oral microbes in the gut can influence the brain and contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease,"" said Professor Ara Koh. ""It highlights the potential of targeting the gut microbiota as a therapeutic strategy, offering a new direction for Parkinson's treatment.""

The research received support from the Samsung Research Funding & Incubation Center of Samsung Electronics, the Mid-Career Researcher Program of the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Microbiome Core Research Support Center, and the Biomedical Technology Development Program.

Cancer cases are exploding worldwide -- and nearly half of the deaths could be prevented with better prevention, early detection, and access to care.

A Rapid Global Rise in Cancer

The global burden of cancer has grown dramatically over the past three decades. Since 1990, the number of newly diagnosed cancer cases worldwide has more than doubled, reaching 18.5 million in 2023. Over the same period, annual cancer deaths rose by 74 percent to 10.4 million (both excluding non-melanoma skin cancers). Most of those affected now live in low- and middle-income countries.

A significant share of this burden is linked to preventable causes. More than 40 percent of cancer deaths worldwide are associated with 44 modifiable risk factors, including tobacco use, poor diet, and high blood sugar. This connection highlights major opportunities to reduce cancer deaths through prevention.

Looking ahead, researchers project that new cancer cases will climb another 61 percent over the next 25 years, reaching 30.5 million annually by 2050. Cancer deaths are forecast to rise by nearly 75 percent over the same period, reaching 18.6 million per year. These increases are largely driven by population growth and the continued aging of populations worldwide.

While age-adjusted global cancer death rates have declined overall, this progress has not been evenly shared. In several low- and middle-income countries, both the number of cancer deaths and the rates themselves are still increasing. The authors stress that meeting this growing challenge will require stronger efforts from governments and policymakers to prevent cancer, expand early diagnosis, and improve treatment access at national, regional, and global levels.

Projections Warn of a Growing Crisis

Between 1990 and 2023, global cancer cases and deaths rose sharply despite advances in treatment and expanded efforts to address cancer risk factors. Without urgent action and increased funding, researchers estimate that by 2050, 30.5 million people will receive a new cancer diagnosis each year and 18.6 million will die from the disease. More than half of new cases and nearly two-thirds of deaths are expected to occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), according to a major analysis by the Global Burden of Disease Study Cancer Collaborators published in The Lancet.

Although the total number of cancer cases and deaths is projected to increase significantly between 2024 and 2050, age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates are not expected to rise globally. This suggests that most of the growth in cancer burden will be driven by demographic changes rather than worsening individual risk.

Even so, the projected improvements fall well short of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to cut premature deaths from non-communicable diseases, including cancer, by one-third by 2030.

Experts Call for Greater Global Action

""Cancer remains an important contributor to disease burden globally and our study highlights how it is anticipated to grow substantially over the coming decades, with disproportionate growth in countries with limited resources,"" said lead author Dr. Lisa Force from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington, USA. ""Despite the clear need for action, cancer control policies and implementation remain underprioritized in global health, and there is insufficient funding to address this challenge in many settings.""

She added, ""Ensuring equitable cancer outcomes globally will require greater efforts to reduce disparities in health service delivery such as access to accurate and timely diagnosis, and quality treatment and supportive care.""

The analysis draws on data from population-based cancer registries, vital registration systems, and interviews with family members or caregivers of people who died from cancer. It provides updated global, regional, and national estimates covering 1990 to 2023 across 204 countries and territories, examining 47 cancer types or groupings and 44 attributable risk factors.[1] The study also projects the global cancer burden through 2050 and evaluates progress toward the UN SDG target for reducing non-communicable disease deaths between 2015 and 2030.

Uneven Cancer Burden Across Countries

In 2023, global cancer deaths reached 10.4 million, while new cases climbed to 18.5 million (both excluding non-melanoma skin cancers). Compared with 1990, this represents increases of 74 percent in deaths and 105 percent in new cases.

Despite an overall 24 percent decline in age-standardized cancer death rates worldwide between 1990 and 2023, this improvement has largely occurred in high- and upper-middle-income countries. In contrast, age-standardized cancer incidence increased by 24 percent in low-income countries and by 29 percent in lower-middle-income countries, highlighting growing disparities in regions with fewer resources (see table 1 in paper).

From 1990 to 2023, Lebanon recorded the largest percentage increase in age-standardized cancer incidence and mortality rates for both sexes combined. Over the same period, the United Arab Emirates experienced the greatest decline in age-standardized incidence, while Kazakhstan saw the largest decrease in age-standardized death rates.

Breast cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide in 2023 for both sexes combined. Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer remained the leading cause of cancer deaths globally (see table 2 in paper).

Preventable Risks Drive Millions of Deaths

The study estimates that 42 percent (4.3 million) of the 10.4 million cancer deaths in 2023 were linked to 44 modifiable risk factors, pointing to significant opportunities for prevention.

Behavioral risk factors accounted for the largest share of cancer deaths across all income levels in 2023. Tobacco use alone contributed to 21 percent of cancer deaths worldwide. Tobacco was the leading risk factor in every income group except low-income countries, where unsafe sex was the primary risk factor, linked to 12.5 percent of cancer deaths.

Men were more likely than women to die from cancers associated with modifiable risks. In 2023, 46 percent of cancer deaths in men were linked to factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet, high alcohol consumption, occupational risks, and air pollution. Among women, 36 percent of cancer deaths were associated with modifiable risks, with tobacco, unsafe sex, unhealthy diet, obesity, and high blood sugar playing the largest roles (see appendix 2 table 6).

""With four in 10 cancer deaths linked to established risk factors, including tobacco, poor diet, and high blood sugar, there are tremendous opportunities for countries to target these risk factors, potentially preventing cases of cancer and saving lives, alongside improving accurate and early diagnosis and treatment to support individuals who develop cancer,"" said co-author Dr. Theo Vos from IHME. ""Reducing the burden of cancer across countries and worldwide demands both individual action and effective population-level approaches to reduce exposure to known risks.""

Equity and Prevention as Global Priorities

The researchers emphasize that cancer prevention must be integrated into health policies in LMICs and that equitable cancer control efforts are essential to ensure timely and effective care for all patients.

""The rise of cancer in LMICs is an impending disaster,"" said co-author Dr. Meghnath Dhimal from the Nepal Health Research Council. ""There are cost-effective interventions for cancer in countries at all stages of development. These cancer burden estimates can help broaden the discussion around the importance of cancer and other non-communicable diseases in the global health agenda. To control the growth of non-communicable diseases including cancer in LMICs, an interdisciplinary approach for evidence generation and multi-sectoral collaboration and coordination for implementation are urgently needed.""

Dr. Force noted that the findings can help guide future policy. ""These new estimates and forecasts can support governments and the global health community in developing data informed policies and actions to improve cancer control and outcomes around the world. They can also support tracking of progress towards global and regional cancer targets.""

She added, ""Our analysis also highlights the need for more data from sources such as cancer and vital registries, particularly in lower resource settings. Supporting cancer surveillance systems is crucial to informing both a local and global understanding of cancer burden.""

Study Limitations and Data Gaps

The authors acknowledge several limitations. The estimates rely on the best available data but are constrained by gaps in high-quality cancer data, especially in resource-limited countries. Current Global Burden of Disease estimates do not account for several infectious diseases known to increase cancer risk in some lower-income regions, including Helicobacter Pylori and Schistosoma haematobium, which may lead to underestimation of cancer deaths linked to modifiable risks.

The projections also do not incorporate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, recent conflicts, or future medical breakthroughs that could significantly alter cancer trends.

In a linked Comment, Dr. Qingwei Luo and Dr. David P Smith from The University of Sydney and Cancer Council NSW, who were not involved in the study, wrote: ""To ensure meaningful progress in reducing the global cancer burden, it is imperative that governments prioritize funding, strengthen health systems, reduce inequalities, and invest in robust cancer control initiatives and research on prevention, intervention, and implementation -- because the future of cancer control depends on decisive, collective action today.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This weight loss option beats Ozempic by 5 times","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106224639.htm","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:37:34 GMT","

A new real-world comparison finds that bariatric surgery leads to dramatically more weight loss than popular injectable medications. After two years, people who underwent sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass lost about five times more weight than those using weekly GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide or tirzepatide,* according to research presented at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

The study, conducted by researchers at NYU Langone Health and NYC Health + Hospitals, showed that surgery patients lost an average of 58 pounds over two years. In contrast, patients who were prescribed a GLP-1 drug for at least six months lost about 12 pounds. That translates to 24% total weight loss for surgery patients compared with 4.7% for those using medication. Even among patients who stayed on GLP-1 therapy continuously for a full year, average weight loss reached only 7%, still far below the results seen with surgery.

Real-World Results Fall Short of Clinical Trials

""Clinical trials show weight loss between 15% to 21% for GLP-1s, but this study suggests that weight loss in the real world is considerably lower even for patients who have active prescriptions for an entire year. We know as many as 70% of patients may discontinue treatment within one year,"" said lead author Avery Brown, MD, a surgical resident at NYU Langone Health. ""GLP-1 patients may need to adjust their expectations, adhere more closely to treatment or opt for metabolic and bariatric surgery to achieve desired results.""

The findings highlight a key gap between controlled clinical trials and everyday use, where side effects, costs, and long-term adherence can limit the effectiveness of medication-based weight loss.

How the Study Compared Surgery and GLP-1 Medications

Researchers analyzed electronic medical record data from patients treated between 2018 and 2024 within the NYU Langone Health and NYC Health + Hospitals systems. All participants had a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35 and either underwent bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy or Roux en-Y gastric bypass) or received a prescription for injectable semaglutide or tirzepatide.

After adjusting for factors such as age, BMI, and co-morbidities using average treatment effect weighting, the team compared outcomes for 51,085 patients across both groups. The study was supported by NYU CTSA grant KL2 TR001446 from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Future Research and Treatment Decisions

""In future studies we will aim to identify what healthcare providers can do to optimize GLP-1 outcomes, identify which patients are better treated with bariatric surgery versus GLP-1s, and determine the role out-of-pocket costs play in treatment success,"" said senior author Karan R. Chhabra, MD, MSc, a bariatric surgeon and Assistant Professor of Surgery and Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.

GLP-1 drugs have gained widespread attention, with about 12% of Americans reporting they have taken one at some point and 6% saying they currently use them. However, persistence remains a major challenge. Recent research shows that 53.6% of patients with overweight or obesity stop GLP-1 therapy within one year (53.6%), and that figure rises to 72.2% by two years.

At the same time, bariatric surgery remains underused. According to the ASMBS, more than 270,000 metabolic and bariatric procedures were performed in 2023, representing only about 1% of people who meet BMI eligibility criteria.

""While both patient groups lose weight, metabolic and bariatric surgery is much more effective and durable,"" said ASMBS President Ann M. Rogers, MD, FACS, FASMBS, who was not involved in the study. ""Those who get insufficient weight loss with GLP-1s or have challenges complying with treatment due to side effects or costs, should consider bariatric surgery as an option or even in combination.""

Obesity Remains a Major Health Challenge

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), obesity affects 40.3% of adults in the United States, while severe obesity impacts 9.4%. Research shows obesity can impair immune function, drive chronic inflammation, and raise the risk of many serious conditions, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.

*Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy and tirzepatide is the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Magnetic nanoparticles fight bone cancer and help healing","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260106224627.htm","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 09:37:31 GMT","

Researchers from Brazil and Portugal have created a new magnetic nanocomposite designed to attack bone cancer while also supporting bone repair. The work, published in Magnetic Medicine, describes a core -- shell structure made from iron oxide nanoparticles wrapped in a thin coating of bioactive glass. This design allows the material to generate heat when exposed to a magnetic field while remaining firmly attached to bone tissue.

According to the research team, combining these two functions in one material has been a major challenge. The new approach brings together magnetic heating for cancer treatment with properties that encourage bone regeneration.

""Magnetic bioactive nanocomposites are very promising for bone cancer therapy because they can simultaneously ablate tumors through magnetic hyperthermia and support new bone growth,"" said Dr. Ângela Andrade, lead author of the study. ""We found that it is possible to achieve both high magnetization of the nanocomposite and a strong bioactivity in the same material, which has been a long-standing challenge in this field.""

Encouraging Results in Bone-Like Conditions

To test how the material behaves in the body, the scientists placed the nanocomposites in simulated body fluid. Under these conditions, the particles quickly formed apatite, a mineral that closely resembles the inorganic portion of natural bone. This rapid mineral formation suggests the material could bond well with bone after implantation.

The researchers also compared different formulations of the nanocomposite. One version, enriched with a higher level of calcium, stood out for its performance.

""Among the tested formulations, the one with a higher calcium content demonstrated the fastest mineralization rate and the strongest magnetic response, making it an ideal candidate for biomedical applications,"" shared Andrade.

Heating Tumors While Supporting Regrowth

The iron oxide core gives the material its magnetic behavior. When placed in an alternating magnetic field, it can produce localized heat that is strong enough to damage or destroy cancer cells. This process targets tumor tissue while minimizing harm to nearby healthy cells.

At the same time, the bioactive glass coating plays a key role in healing. It encourages surrounding bone tissue to regenerate, creating a treatment strategy that addresses both tumor removal and structural repair in one step.

""This study provides new insights into how surface chemistry and structure influence the performance of magnetic biomaterials,"" Andrade added. ""The findings open new perspectives on the development of increasingly advanced multifunctional materials that are both safe and effective for clinical use.""

A Step Forward for Cancer and Regenerative Medicine

Overall, the research marks progress in the development of smart nanomaterials for oncology and regenerative medicine. By combining strong magnetic performance with bone-friendly bioactivity, these nanocomposites point toward future therapies that could treat bone tumors and restore damaged tissue through a single, minimally invasive procedure.

Targeted protein degradation modulates protein function beyond the inhibition of enzyme activity or protein–protein interactions. Most degrader drugs function by directly mediating the proximity between a neosubstrate and a hijacked E3 ligase. Here we identify pseudo-natural products derived from (−)-myrtanol, termed iDegs, that inhibit and induce degradation of the immunomodulatory enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) by a distinct mechanism. iDegs boost IDO1 ubiquitination and degradation by the cullin-RING E3 ligase CRL2KLHDC3, which we identified to natively mediate ubiquitin-mediated degradation of IDO1. Therefore, iDegs increase IDO1 turnover using the native proteolytic pathway. In contrast to clinically explored IDO1 inhibitors, iDegs reduce the formation of kynurenine by both inhibition and induced degradation of the enzyme and thus also modulate the non-enzymatic functions of IDO1. This unique mechanism of action may open up alternative therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of cancer beyond classical inhibition of IDO1.

Current strategies for small-molecule-mediated targeted protein degradation (TPD)1 rely on compound-mediated induction of proximity between a neosubstrate and an E3 ubiquitin ligase2. Such ‘degraders' can either be heterobifunctional, harbouring distinct entities for the target and E3 (‘PROTACs'), or monovalent, binding to either the target or the ligase to adapt its surface and induce a cooperative tripartite assembly (molecular glue degraders, MGDs). Both degrader types have entered clinics3, and the discovery of alternative chemotypes that may unlock previously unexplored TPD strategies is highly desirable.

Natural products (NPs) and their analogues have yielded diverse inducers of protein degradation4, raising the possibility that new degrader chemotypes could be derived from NPs. Pseudo-natural products combine natural-product fragments in arrangements and combinations not observed in NPs. They retain the biological relevance of NPs but open new chemical space and therefore may have unexpected and novel targets5,6, so exploration of their bioactivity5,7 may identify novel small-molecule degrader chemotypes and E3 ligases.

The haem-binding enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) converts tryptophan (Trp) to kynurenine (Kyn), and Trp shortage and Kyn elevation are linked to reduced anti-tumour immunity, though by different mechanisms8,9,10,11,12. Moreover, IDO1 expression and Kyn levels are related to Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoma13 and to neurodegeneration14,15. In general, clinical exploration of different IDO1 inhibitors for cancer treatment has16,17,18,19,20,21,22, despite encouraging preclinical data23,24, met with limited success25,26. Plausible reasons include that IDO1 may have non-enzymatic functions27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. Nevertheless, IDO1 inhibitors are in active clinical trials35. The limitations of enzymatic inhibitors36 may be overcome by IDO1 degradation, as initially supported by IDO1-directed proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs)37,38,39, but monovalent IDO1 degraders have yet to be identified.

We have identified a class of pseudo-natural products derived from (−)-myrtanol, termed iDegs, that both inhibit IDO1 and induce IDO1 degradation. iDegs induce structural changes in IDO1 that cause enhanced ubiquitination and augmented degradation by CRL2KLHDC3, a ligase we identified to also mediate the ubiquitination and native degradation of IDO1. Our work defines a unique mechanism of action, a previously not identified type of degrader, and reveals an E3-ligase previously not used for small-molecule-mediated protein degradation.

A library of 157,332 small molecules were screened in a cell-based assay (Kyn assay; Extended Data Fig. 1a) that quantified Kyn, the product of the IDO1 reaction. So as to screen under conditions that would be sensitive to IDO1 levels, we considered that IDO1 expression can be induced by interferon gamma (IFN-γ)40. We thus performed the screen in IFN-γ-stimulated BxPC3 cells21. The (−)-myrtanol-derived pseudo-natural product, hereafter termed iDeg-1 (see Supplementary Scheme 1 for the synthesis), inhibited Kyn formation with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.83 ± 0.31 µM in the screening assay (Fig. 1a), which we confirmed using orthogonal Kyn assays in IFN-γ-stimulated BxPC3, SKOV-3 and HeLa cells (IC50 values of 1.1 ± 0.1 µM, 1.6 ± 0.3 µM and 1.7 ± 1.2 µM, respectively; Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Further indication that iDeg-1 targets IDO1 came from a cell viability assay in two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cultures41,42: iDeg-1 reduced IDO1-dependent SKOV-3 cell death induced by IFN-γ (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). iDeg-1 only slightly affected IDO1 enzymatic activity (Extended Data Fig. 1f), did not impair IDO1 transcription (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h), but dose-dependently reduced IDO1 protein levels up to 45 ± 15% at 10 µM after 24 h (Fig. 1c,d) without inhibiting in vitro translation of IDO1 or global protein translation (Extended Data Fig. 1i–n).

IFN-γ-stimulated BxPC3 cells were treated with 20 µM iDeg-1 or DMSO for 6 h before the IP. Data are presented as mean values ± s.d.; n = 3 biological replicates.

Source data

To determine whether iDeg-1 induces degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), IFN-γ-stimulated BxPC3 cells were treated with iDeg-1 for 6 h (Fig. 1e), or for 2 and 4 h after pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (CFZ; Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Increased polyubiquitination was detected with a tandem ubiquitin binding entity (TUBE) pulldown from cell lysates43. Ubiquitination was induced shortly after compound addition, but protein reduction was only detectable after 24 h in IFN-γ-stimulated BxPC3 cells (Fig. 1c,d). Because the capacity to induce degradation may be masked by the ongoing IFN-γ-stimulated production of IDO1, we directly introduced enzymatically active recombinant human IDO1 protein (rhIDO1) into HEK293T cells by electroporation (HEKrhIDO1 cells). iDeg-1 dose-dependently reduced Kyn amounts with an IC50 value of 0.45 ± 0.1 µM (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c) and lowered IDO1 protein after 6 h by 46% at a concentration of 10 µM (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). CFZ inhibited degradation (Fig. 1g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2f), indicating involvement of the UPS. iDeg-1 also inhibited Kyn production in HEK293T cells, which transiently express IDO1, with an IC50 of 0.42 ± 0.2 µM (Extended Data Fig. 2g). Therefore, iDeg-1 depletes IDO1 independently of the effects of IFN-γ.

Global proteome profiling of HEKrhIDO1 cells after 6 h of treatment with iDeg-1 showed that, besides IDO1, reduced levels were detected only for DOCK-8 and RHOBTB3. However, these effects could not be validated (Fig. 1i, Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Table 1). Analysis of ubiquitinated proteins for a diglycine (diGly) attached to lysine residues (K-ε-diglycine) that were modified with ubiquitin44, after iDeg-1 treatment and IDO1 immunoprecipitation uncovered K389 of IDO1 as a site of ubiquitination (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 3c). In addition, we observed a 3.5-fold increase in ubiquitin levels in the IDO1 immunoprecipitate after treatment with iDeg-1, confirming iDeg-1-induced IDO1 ubiquitination (Extended Data Fig. 3d). DiGly analysis further revealed K48 linkages in the ubiquitin chains (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 3e), which are associated with protein degradation via the UPS45.

Direct engagement of IDO1 in cells was proven by a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA)46, which showed that iDeg-1 stabilizes IDO1 with a shift in the melting temperature (ΔTm) of 3.5 ± 0.4 °C (Fig. 2a,b). An isothermal CETSA experiment at 50 °C (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b) proved that stabilization was dose-dependent.

Initial structure–activity exploration identified iDeg-2 (IC50 = 138 ± 23 nM) and iDeg-3 (IC50 = 46 ± 21 nM), which embody an iodine or an alkyne substituent, respectively, in the para position of the phenyl carbamate (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). In BxPC3 cells exposed continuously to IFN-γ, iDeg-2 and iDeg-3 reduced IDO1 protein levels by 55 ± 3% and 62 ± 11%, respectively, as compared to 42 ± 2% by iDeg-1 at 3.33 µM (Fig. 2d,e). iDeg-2 and iDeg-3 also partially inhibited the enzyme in vitro (Fig. 2f) and stabilized rhIDO1, as determined by nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF; Fig. 2g).

IDO1 binds haem as a cofactor in the active site, and exists in haem-free (apo) and haem-bound (holo) forms in cells19. UV–vis spectroscopic analysis revealed that in the presence of iDeg-1, iDeg-2 or iDeg-3, the specific Soret absorbance peak of haem-bound IDO1 (holo-IDO1; Fig. 2h) is reduced, showing that iDegs displace haem and, with different potencies, bind to apo-IDO1. Accordingly, addition of hemin reduced the potency of iDeg-1, iDeg-2 and iDeg-3 in the Kyn assay (Extended Data Fig. 4e–g) and dose-dependently elevated Kyn levels in the presence of iDeg-2 (Extended Data Fig. 4h). As we detected both enzymatic inhibition and degradation of IDO1 by iDeg-3, the compound class was termed iDeg.

The co-crystal structure of IDO1 in complex with iDeg-1 (PDB 9RIS) and iDeg-2 (PDB 9FOH) at 2.1 Å and 1.6 Å resolution, respectively (Supplementary Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 5a), revealed that iDegs reside in the haem binding site in IDO1. The phenyl carbamate occupies lipophilic pocket A47 in the distal haem site, and the pyrrolidine and the sulfonyl group occupy the haem binding pocket. The monoterpene scaffold only slightly protrudes into the D-pocket, and the tert-butyl phenyl group is located in the solvent-exposed B-pocket (Fig. 3a,b). Interestingly, binding to this latter pocket has previously been observed mainly for holo-IDO1 inhibitors47 (Extended Data Fig. 5b). iDegs binding occurs through numerous hydrophobic interactions, a water-bridged hydrogen bond between the carbamate nitrogen and the hydroxyl group of S167 and a hydrogen bond between the sulfonyl oxygen of iDeg-2 and H346 (Fig. 3c). As many of the same IDO1 residues are responsible for haem coordination, this binding mode is mutually exclusive with haem and ensures that iDegs can only bind apo-IDO1. The iodine moiety of iDeg-2 establishes additional hydrophobic contacts within the distal region of the A-pocket, specifically with the main chain of L124 and V125 (Extended Data Fig. 5c). These interactions probably contribute to the enhanced activity of iDeg-2 compared to iDeg-1 (Fig. 2). Comparisons to all IDO1 structures revealed that iDeg-1 and iDeg-2 induce a striking conformational rearrangement (Fig. 3d,e). In the presence of iDeg-1, the electron density map allowed the building of a shorter C-terminal K-helix although with comparatively high B-factors. In contrast, in the iDeg-2-bound structure, no electron density for the K-helix was detected (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5d). This absence is not attributed to crystal packing forces, as the K-helix is present in the crystal structure of IDO1 with the inhibitor apoxidole with identical space group, unit cell and similar crystallization conditions (PDB 8ABX; Extended Data Fig. 5e)48. An overlay of the structures of IDO1 bound to iDeg-2 or with the apo-IDO1 inhibitor linrodostat revealed that helices B, C, F, H and J are all reoriented and the J-helix is also remodelled in the iDeg complex (Fig. 3e). In all previously reported IDO1 structures, the K-helix is embraced through F, J and H helices and the E–F loop (Extended Data Fig. 5f). In contrast, in the iDeg-1- and iDeg-2-bound complexes, tethers to the K-helix are weakened due to cumulative movements of several amino acids within the J-helix. Specifically, a substantial rotation and translation of H346, which coordinates the central iron of the haem group in holo-IDO1, shifts the J-helix C terminus towards the iDeg-2 binding pocket. Residues R343, F270 and T395 also adopt an alternative conformation compared to all other published IDO1 structures (Fig. 3f,g and Extended Data Fig. 5f). Weakened interactions between the K-helix and surrounding helices F, J and H and the E–F loop due to their reorientation presumably increase the flexibility of the K-helix, accounting for its invisibility in the electron density map. As previously reported IDO1 inhibitors do not substantially alter the overall structure of IDO1 compared to holo-IDO147 (Extended Data Fig. 5f), the observed conformational rearrangements represent a novel and unique binding mode of the iDegs.

Surface regions interacting with the K-helix are highlighted. e, Overlay of IDO1-iDeg-2 (violet) and IDO1–linrodostat (grey; PDB 6DPR-B) structures. iDeg binding triggers local and long-distance structural perturbations (red dashed arrows). f, iDeg-2 binding induces a conformational shift in H346, moving the J-helix towards the iDeg-2 binding pocket, including R343. F270 also adopts a shifted conformation. g, Residues T395, Q281 and R343, which are involved in stabilizing the K-helix through hydrogen bonding, similarly adopt shifted positions in the iDeg-bound state.

Mechanistically, because iDegs bind deep in the active site, it is unlikely that they directly contact an E3 ligase. Instead, iDeg-induced degradation possibly involves increased accessibility of the C-terminal K-helix bearing the ubiquitinated K389, as compared to the conformations observed for all published IDO1 inhibitors.

To explore the contribution to IDO1-induced degradation of several amino acids that adopt substantially shifted positions in the iDeg-bound structures, we generated an IDO1 stability reporter in KBM7 cells harbouring an inducible Cas9 cassette49 (Fig. 4a). Supporting a role of the C-terminal region of IDO1 in degradation, only N-terminally fused BFP enabled iDeg-induced reporter degradation (Fig. 4b). Alanine substitutions were introduced at H346, R343 and F270, which interact with haem in the holo-IDO1 structure50 and adopt different conformations in the iDeg-bound state compared to all other published IDO1 structures. In addition, we tested the T395M mutation, as T395 located in the K-helix contributes to its stabilization through hydrogen bonding with R343 (J-helix) and Q281 (E–F loop). All four mutants displayed lower protein stability in cells, indicating their role in maintaining a stable IDO1 conformation (Fig. 4d). Degradation induced by iDeg-1, iDeg-2 or iDeg-3 in cells expressing these IDO1 mutants was rescued only by the H346A mutation, highlighting their interaction with H346 as being crucial for degradation (Fig. 4e).

To identify the E3 responsible for iDeg-mediated IDO1 degradation, we conducted a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based CRISPR–Cas9 screen using an sgRNA library targeting 1,301 ubiquitin-associated genes (six sgRNAs per gene)51. Cas9 expression was induced for 72 h before 14 h of compound treatment, then the cells were enriched for increased or decreased BFP levels using FACS and the corresponding sgRNAs quantified by deep sequencing (Fig. 4f,g, Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 1), revealing the genes functionally required for iDeg-induced degradation.

As expected, knockout of proteasome subunits or of genes involved in neddylation counteracted iDeg activity (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c), thus phenocopying the IDO1 stability reporter behaviour upon chemical perturbation of the UPS (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 6d). Importantly, we further identified the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complex, including cullin2 (CUL2), RBX1, elongin B/C (EloB and EloC) and the Kelch domain containing protein 3 (KLHDC3), as required for IDO1 degradation.

Unexpectedly, genetic disruption of the CRL2KLHDC3 complex also affected baseline IDO1 turnover under vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) treatment. In the presence of iDegs, however, knockout of these genes led to an even higher enrichment of the corresponding sgRNAs (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). This indicated that the compounds could function by enhancing the efficiency of IDO1 degradation. To validate these findings, we employed the TurboID approach and expressed IDO1 fused to the TurboID biotin ligase in HEK293T cells followed by enrichment of biotinylated proteins. Indeed, KLHDC3 was slightly biotinylated in the control condition, which increased upon treatment of cells with iDeg-3 (Fig. 4i), thus confirming that IDO1 and KLHDC3 interact in cells, and that this interaction is enhanced in the presence of the degrader. Contrary to classical degrader modalities such as PROTACs or molecular glue degraders, which typically function by inducing proximity between an E3 and a target that is functionally inconsequential in the absence of the small molecule, iDegs thus appear to promote a native route for IDO1 turnover.

The CRL substrate receptor KLHDC3 has not yet been employed for small-molecule-induced protein degradation. KLHDC3 recognizes C-degrons52,53, which explains why the C-terminally fused IDO1-BFP reporter was not degraded, but the BPF-IDO1 reporter was (Fig. 4b). The C-terminal EG sequence of human IDO1 is consistent with the distinguishing feature of a KLHDC3 C-degron, which is a C-terminal glycine52,53,54. In agreement, a peptide IDO1C-deg corresponding to the C-terminal region (residues 381–403) bound KLHDC3 with a KD of 103 nM (Fig. 4j and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Substituting the C-terminal glycine with lysine (peptide IDO1C-deg-G403K) abolished binding to KLHDC3. Replacing the ubiquitination site (peptide IDO1C-deg-K389R) did not impact E3-degron complex formation (Fig. 4j and Supplementary Fig. 2b).

To test whether IDO1 is a direct substrate of CRL2KLHDC3, we biochemically reconstituted ubiquitination. Because KLHDC3-EloB/C can form an autoinhibited self-assembly55, we used a monomeric version of KLHDC3 (C-terminal Gly-to-Lys mutant). Assays were performed in the ‘pulse-chase' format. The pulse reaction generates a thioester-linked E2 conjugate with fluorescently labelled ubiquitin. Next, E3 and substrate are added, and fluorescent ubiquitin transfer from E2 (UBE2R2) to the substrate and subsequently to a substrate-linked ubiquitin is observed over time. The IDO1C-deg peptide was ubiquitinated in vitro in a CRL2KLHDC3-dependent manner, whereas the mutant versions were not (Fig. 4k and Supplementary Fig. 2b). In cells, mutation of the IDO1 C-terminal glycine increased abundance, whereas mutation of the non-optimal –EG degron to an optimal –RG C terminus reduced IDO1 abundance (Fig. 4l). These findings demonstrate that IDO1 is a substrate of KLHDC3 and that the C-terminal glycine-based degron is essential for interaction with the E3 ligase.

To benchmark the degradation potency of iDeg-1, iDeg-2 and iDeg-3 and subsequently the identified inhibitor and degrader iDeg-6 (IC50 of 16 ± 5 nM in the Kyn assay; Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 7a), IDO1 levels were detected after stimulation of cells for 24 h with IFN-γ followed by a washout (to avoid IDO1 expression) and compound addition. iDeg-6 most potently depleted IDO1 in the cells, with a maximal achievable degradation (Dmax) of 70% at 100 nM and a half-maximal degradation concentration (DC50) for IDO1 degradation of 6.5 ± 3 nM (Fig. 5a–c and Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Also, in the BFP-IDO1 reporter cell lines iDeg-1 was the least and iDeg-6 the most potent compound (Extended Data Fig. 7d). In vitro iDeg-6 inhibited IDO1 activity nearly completely and more potently than iDeg-1 to 3 with an IC50 of 1.6 ± 0.3 µM (Extended Data Fig. 7e). Direct binding of iDeg-6 to IDO1 was detected using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; Supplementary Fig. 3). The compound induced thermal stabilization of the protein and haem displacement to a higher extent as compared to iDeg-1, iDeg-2 and iDeg-3 (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). We therefore used iDeg-6 for further validation.

We estimated the contribution of IDO1 inhibition and IDO1 degradation by iDeg-6 to the total reduction of Kyn levels in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor CFZ (Extended Data Fig. 7h–j and Supplementary Table 3). IDO1 degradation accounted for 81% or 59% of the achieved Kyn level decrease at 100 nM or 1 µM, respectively. However, the cellular response to proteasomal inhibition is rather complex and can induce compensatory degradation mechanisms that can impact total IDO1 levels.

iDeg-6 also depleted IDO1 protein in SKOV-3 and BT549 cells in the absence of or upon stimulation with IFN-γ in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 5d–f and Extended Data Fig. 8a–e). The neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 rescued iDeg-6-induced IDO1 depletion (Extended Data Fig. 8f) and increased IDO1 in the absence of iDegs, demonstrating that neddylation is required for both native and iDeg-induced IDO1 degradation. KLHDC3 knockout in U2OS or KBM7-BFP-IDO1 cells increased IDO1 amounts and rescued iDeg-6-dependent degradation (Fig. 5g–j and Extended Data Fig. 8g,h; also Extended Data Fig. 6e for iDeg-1, iDeg-2 and iDeg-3). IDO1 ubiquitination in the presence of iDeg-6 was abolished for KLHDC3 variants carrying mutations in the degron recognition motif (R240A, S241E, R292A)54 (Extended Data Fig. 9a).

Surprisingly, in vitro, apo-IDO1 was rapidly ubiquitinated by CRL2KLHDC3. IDO1 was also ubiquitinated upon treatment of apo-IDO1 with iDeg-6 (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). In contrast, both haem and the apo-IDO1 inhibitor linrodostat suppressed IDO1 ubiquitination under these conditions (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). Hence, biochemically, apo-IDO1 is a better KLHDC3 substrate than holo-IDO1, consistent with structural data showing haem and lindrodostat determining the arrangement of the K-helix, as well as quantitative insights from competitive ubiquitination assays. Briefly, ubiquitination of IDO1 C-terminal peptide (IDO1C-deg) was examined while titrating apo-IDO1 or compound-bound IDO1. If a full-length IDO1 binds KLHDC3, then substrate preference shifts from peptide to protein along the titration, allowing calculation of IC50 values for inhibiting C-terminal peptide ubiquitination. Apo-IDO1 and iDeg-6-bound IDO1 show IC50 values of 119 and 118 nM, respectively, matching the affinity towards the isolated C-terminal peptide measured by ITC (Figs. 4j and 5k,l and Extended Data Fig. 9d). In contrast, the IDO1 bound to linrodostat showed a >20-fold greater IC50 value (2.6 µM). Thus, apo-IDO1 and iDeg-6-bound IDO1 are high-affinity KLHDC3 substrates, whereas linrodostat binding renders IDO1 less suitable for ubiquitination.

Next, ubiquitination assays were designed to elucidate the biochemical function of the iDegs. Apo-IDO1 was incubated first with an iDeg, or first with hemin or linrodostat (which secure the IDO1 C-terminal helix). Afterwards, hemin or linrodostat were added to the iDeg-treated IDO1, or vice versa (Fig. 5m and Supplementary Fig. 4). Although apo-IDO1 and iDeg-bound IDO1 were readily ubiquitinated in the absence of haem, when the iDeg treatment was first, ubiquitination proceeded after haem addition. Due to its superior occupation of the haem-binding pocket, linrodostat prevented ubiquitination in all assays if added first. Although iDeg-1 showed little effect in these assays, iDeg-2 through iDeg-6 increasingly competed with haem and allowed ubiquitination, trending with their IC50 towards IDO1 activity in vitro and efficacy at eliciting IDO1 degradation in cells.

These findings suggest a possible model for the regulation of IDO1. De novo translated apo-IDO1 is rapidly cleared in cells by degradation mediated by KLHDC3. In the presence of haem, apo-IDO1 is charged with haem to form holo-IDO1, and the holo-pool may thus escape degradation. Support for such a mechanism in cells (Fig. 6a) was obtained by treatment with haem synthesis inhibitor succinyl acetone to deplete the haem and shift the equilibrium to the apo-IDO1 form. In IFN-γ-stimulated BxPC3 cells, succinyl acetone reduced IDO1 protein levels, and the addition of hemin dose-dependently increased IDO1 (Fig. 6b,c and Extended Data Fig. 9e,f).

Similar observations were made in SKOV-3 cells and KBM7-BFP-IDO1 stability reporter cells (Fig. 6d,e and Extended Data Fig. 9g). Addition of only hemin dose-dependently increased IDO1 protein levels in SKOV-3 cells, which is in agreement with the majority of IDO1 being in the apo-form19. Changes in the IDO1 protein level did not result from altered IDO1 mRNA levels (Extended Data Fig. 9h). Knockout of KLHDC3 counteracted succinyl acetone-mediated IDO1 depletion, indicating that apo-IDO1 degradation is dependent on KLHDC3 (Fig. 6f). These results support involvement of KLHDC3 in the regulation of apo-IDO1 turnover, both under native conditions and in the presence of iDegs. The mechanism of action relies on further pushing IDO1 towards the degradation-sensitive state.

We then asked whether other IDO1 inhibitors might control IDO1 abundance. All investigated inhibitors increased IDO1 protein levels in the cells, which was partially reverted in KLHDC3 knockout cells (Fig. 6g,h and Extended Data Fig. 9i). These findings are in agreement with the biochemical data showing lower ubiquitination of IDO1 in the presence of linrodostat (Fig. 5m), and our structural data showing iDegs bind a distinct conformation of IDO1. Hence, the IDO1-KLHDC3 degradation circuit can be modified in both directions by liganding common residues, albeit with distinct overall structural consequences. We analysed the influence of these IDO1 inhibitors on the melting temperature of IDO1 and on haem displacement to assess whether these assays could be used for predicting IDO1 degrader activity. Apo-IDO1 inhibitors shifted the melting curve to higher temperatures, whereas most holo-IDO1 inhibitors shifted the peak corresponding to the haem-bound state (Extended Data Fig. 10). Both types of inhibitors affected the UV–vis absorption: holo-IDO1 inhibitors shifted the absorbance peak to a higher wavelength, whereas apo-IDO1 inhibitors decreased the absorbance at the Soret band. These biophysical assays, however, cannot be used to predict IDO1 degraders as iDegs change the Tm and the Soret band intensity in a similar manner as other apo-IDO1 inhibitors.

Finally, we assessed the ability of iDeg-6 to suppress the non-enzymatic activity of IDO1, which has recently been shown to promote tumour proliferation and migration33,34. Specifically, in SKOV-3 cells, IDO1 enzymatic inhibition by epacadostat stabilizes a non-enzymatic IDO1 protein, which results in faster cell migration. In contrast, IDO1 knockdown decreases the migratory capacity of SKOV-3 cells34. We thus compared cell migration, using a wound healing assay, with SKOV-3 cells exposed to iDeg-6 and epacadostat. iDeg-6 significantly slowed down wound closure compared to the control and cells that were treated with epacadostat, demonstrating that iDegs can also affect the non-enzymatic protumorigenic function of IDO1 (Fig. 6i and Extended Data Fig. 9j).

Clinical investigation of IDO1 inhibition has had limited success so far47,56, possibly due to its non-enzymatic signalling function29,32. This limitation could be addressed by the targeted degradation of IDO1. We identified a pseudo-natural product class termed iDegs that potently induce IDO1 ubiquitination and degradation through the native degradation pathway mediated by the E3 ligase CRL2KLHDC3. iDegs bind to apo-IDO1, which is either present in cells or generated by intrinsic haem loss, leading to loss of enzymatic activity. More importantly, iDegs induce a conformational shift of the C-terminal helix and lock IDO1 in a state favouring ubiquitination by KLHDC3. As degraders, iDegs are unique, as other apo-IDO1 modulators increase IDO1 protein abundance. Our data demonstrate that apo-IDO1, but not haem-bound IDO1, is preferentially ubiquitinated and degraded, suggesting also that apo-IDO1 can readily adopt a ubiquitination-sensitive conformation. In contrast, haem binding prevents IDO1 turnover. Therefore, targeting the same binding pocket with the haem cofactor or small-molecule ligands has a completely opposite impact on the IDO1-KLHDC3 degradation circuit and IDO1 fate.

So far, degraders employing native degradation mechanisms have largely been overlooked, and only a few examples (targeting BCL6 or EZH257,58) support the notion that monovalent degraders in a more general sense may regulate the native mechanisms of protein homeostasis for the respective targets2. Scholes and colleagues have identified supercharging of endogenous degradation pathways as a frequently observed mechanism of inhibitor-induced kinase degradation59. Functionally differentiated, iDegs represent a group of small molecules that act as a switch to induce an IDO1 conformational state that shifts the equilibrium to the degradation-sensitive state, thereby channelling the IDO1-iDeg complex to the native degradation mechanism. This route to protein degradation complements current degradation strategies that are based on PROTACs or MGDs, as observed for oestrogen and androgen receptors, and may also apply to other proteins60,61.

Compared to IDO1-directed PROTACs37,38,39, iDegs are smaller and more drug-like and hijack the native ligase, making them broadly applicable to all cells and tissues expressing IDO1.

Due to their dual mode of action, iDegs impair all IDO1 functions, and, unlike other apo-IDO1 inhibitors, they induce a decrease in protein levels. Because the non-enzymatic functions of the protein and an inhibitor-mediated increase in IDO1 concentration32,38 may be linked to failure of IDO1 inhibitors in the clinic, small-molecule-induced inhibition and degradation may open up alternative therapeutic opportunities13,14,15.

BxPC3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (PAN Biotech) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. BT549, HeLa and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% FBS, sodium pyruvate and non-essential amino acids. SKOV-3 and U2OS WT and KO cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (PAN Biotech) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS.

IDO1-deficient SKOV-3 cells were produced using the CRISPR–Cas9 system. For this, 100,000 cell well−1 in six-well plates were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 with PX458 plasmid containing three separated sgRNA located in IDO1. sgRNA sequences were 5′-CACACGCTATGGAAAACTCC-3′; 5′-AGCCCACTTCTTCATCAATA-3′; 5′-TACCATATTGATGAAGAAGT-3′. After 48 h, the cells were sorted for single cells based on green fluorescent protein (GFP) positivity. Single clones were expanded and successful KO of IDO1 was verified using immunoblotting. KBM7 iCas9 cells were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 100 U ml−1 penicillin/streptomycin, 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1 mM L-tryptophan. Cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Regular mycoplasma testing confirmed cell lines as mycoplasma-negative.

The Kyn screening assay was performed as previously described21. BxPC3 cells were seeded in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium in 1,536-well or 384-well plates (Greiner 782086, Corning 3770) 24 h before the addition of the compounds, IFN-γ (50 ng ml−1, PeproTech) and L-Trp (380 µM, Sigma-Aldrich). After 48 h of incubation, initial cell viability was accessed by the addition of Hoechst 33342. Afterwards, trichloroacetic acid (TCA, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 7% and incubated for 10 min before a centrifugation step of 10 min at 1,620g. Kyn levels were determined by means of the Kyn sensor21 at a final concentration of 17.5 µM in sensor buffer (50 mM H3PO4 and 120 mM NaCl pH 1). Fluorescence intensity (excitation, 535 nm; emission, 595 nm) was measured using a Spectramax Paradigm reader (Molecular Devices). Data were normalized to the values for cells treated with DMSO. All HTS data were analysed with the Quattro Software Suite (Quattro Research).

For the manual assay, BxPC3 or SKOV-3 cells were seeded in clear 96-well or 384-well plates, respectively, 24 h before compound treatment and IFN-γ (50 or 5 ng ml−1, respectively) and L-Trp (380 µM) addition, as described in ref. 21. At 48 h after treatment, TCA was added and Kyn levels were detected using 2% wt/vol of para-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (p-DMAB; Ehrlich reagent) in acetic acid. The absorbance of the Ehrlich reagent was detected at 492 nm and at 650 nm as background control on a Spark multimode microplate plate reader (Tecan). Kyn levels were determined by subtracting the absorbance value at 650 nm and presented relative to the DMSO control. Dose–response curves and IC50 values were generated and fitted with GraphPad Prism 9.2 using a four-parameter variable-slope nonlinear regression curve fit.

For label-free Kyn detection, the cell supernatant was analysed by LC–MS/MS following the addition of 30% TCA. Kyn levels were measured by HPLC–MS/MS using an LTQ Velos Pro and Dionex HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data were analysed using Thermo Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and presented with GraphPad Prism 9.2. Values are shown relative to the DMSO control.

SKOV-3 WT and IDO1-deficient cells were seeded in 48-well plates (8,000 cells well−1; Corning, 3548) for 2D experiments or in 96 ultralow-attachment plates (5,000 cells well−1, S-bio, MS-9096UZ) for 3D experiments. After seeding, cells were treated with 10 ng ml−1 (2D) or 1 ng ml−1 (3D) of IFN-γ and CellTox Green (Promega, G8731) and added to the culture medium (1:6,000). The following day, the cells were treated with either DMSO or 5 μM iDeg-1. iDeg-1 was freshly added every three days. The cells were monitored by live phase-contrast microscopy using an IncuCyte S3 system (Sartorius) with a 10x objective, capturing images every day up to four days (2D) and six days (3D). Cell death was quantified by counting the numbers of green fluorescence-positive cells (CellTox Green positive) normalized to the confluence of each respective image (2D) or by measuring the green signal mean intensity of each spheroid (3D).

To analyse IDO1 levels, IFN-γ-stimulated BxPC3 cells (50 ng ml−1 IFN-γ), U2OS cells (5 ng ml−1 IFN-γ), HEKrhIDO1 cells (HEK293T cells electroporated with rhIDO1), SKOV-3 cells (stimulated with IFN-γ or not) and BT549 cells were treated with compounds for the indicated times followed by cell lysis (150 mM sodium chloride in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1% NP-40 alternative, protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Protein concentrations were determined by a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), followed by the addition of 1× sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer and protein separation by 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Separated protein samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. IDO1 in IFN-γ-stimulated cells as well as vinculin, β-actin or α-tubulin as loading controls were detected by blocking the membranes with Intercept blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, 927-70001) and using the primary antibodies anti-IDO1 (1:2,500, 14-9750-82, Thermo Fisher), anti-vinculin (1:10,000, V9131, Thermo Fisher), anti-β-actin (1:2,500, ab8227, Abcam) or anti-α-tubulin (1:2,500, ab18251, Abcam), and IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies (IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin-G (IgG) secondary antibody (1:5,000, 926-32210), IRDye 680CW goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:5,000, 926-68071) and IRDye 680RD donkey anti-mouse (1:5,000, 926-68072)). For the detection of IDO1 protein levels in BT549 and SKOV-3 cells, the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS + 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T), followed by incubation with anti-IDO1 (1:5,000, ab211017, Abcam) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000, 31460, Pierce Biotechnology). For the detection of DOCK-8 and RHOBTB3 protein levels in HEK293T cells, the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T, followed by incubation with anti-DOCK-8 (1:500, 11622-1-AP, Proteintech) or RHOBTB3 (1:800, 13945-1-AP) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000, 31460, Pierce Biotechnology). KLHDC3 protein levels in U2OS, U2OS KO or HEK293T cells were detected by blocking the membranes with 5% milk in PBS-T and using anti-KLHDC3 antibody (1:1,000, HPA030131, Atlas) and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3,000, 7074, Cell Signaling Technology). Primary antibodies were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Washing steps were performed with PBS-T. Chemiluminescence was detected using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein bands were visualized using a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad). Band intensities were quantified using Image Lab software 6.0 (Bio-Rad).

BxPC3 cells (100,000 cells well−1) or SKOV-3 cells (150,000 cells well−1) were seeded in a 24-well plate or 12-well plate, respectively. BxPC3 cells were incubated for 24 h before treatment with the indicated compound concentrations and 50 ng ml−1 IFN-γ. SKOV-3 cells were directly treated with or without 10 µM succinyl acetone for 24 h before the addition of hemin for a further 24 h. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The obtained RNA was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using a QuantiTect reverse transcription kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) before the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using a QuantiFast SYBR green PCR kit (Bio-Rad). Gene-specific primers for IDO1 (forward: 5′-GCCTGATCTCATAGAGTCTGGC-3′ and reverse: 5′-TGCATCCCAGAACTAGACGTGC-3′)30 and GAPDH (forward: 5′- GTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACAGCG-3′ and reverse: 5′-ACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCAA-3′) as a reference gene were used. qPCR was performed using a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Data were analysed using CFX Manager (Bio-Rad). IDO1 expression levels in each sample were normalized to the levels of the reference gene GAPDH. Relative quantification was performed using the 2−ΔΔCt method63.

For the assay, the pXPG-IDO1 plasmid containing a firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene under the control of the full-length IDO1 promoter (kindly provided by G. M. Doody) was used as a reporter. The Renilla (Rluc) luciferase expression plasmid pRL-TK vector (Promega Corporation) was used as a control. HEK293T cells were transiently reverse-transfected with the plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following a modified protocol of the manufacturer's guidelines. The Fluc plasmid (4 μg) and 300 ng of the Rluc plasmid were mixed in serum-free Opti-MEM in a 1:3 ratio with Lipofectamine 2000. The mixture was added to 9 ml of cell suspension at a cell density of 2.78 × 105 cells ml−1, then 25,000 cells were seeded per well in a clear 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. The next day, IDO1 promoter-mediated Fluc expression was induced by the addition of 50 ng ml−1 IFN-γ with simultaneous compound treatment. The cells were incubated for 48 h before determining the activity of Fluc and Rluc using the Dual-Glo Luciferase assay system with a Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan). Fluc/Rluc ratios were normalized to the values of the DMSO control (set to 100%).

BxPC3 cells (200,000 cells well−1) were seeded in a 12-well plate, and 50 ng ml−1 IFN-γ was added. After 24 h, 5 µM cycloheximide (CHX) was added 30 min before the addition of 5 µM iDeg-1, followed by cell lysis preparation and immunoblotting.

Tandem ubiquitin binding entity (TUBE) protein was expressed from pGex-6P-1-GST-4xUBA-His (UBA, ubiquitin-associated domains) in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity purification using a Ni-NTA column. TUBE protein expression was induced by isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 30 °C. Afterwards, the cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride; 39107.01, Serva) and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and the TUBE protein was separated using a Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The TUBE protein was eluted using 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer containing 500 mM imidazole and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and subsequently applied to a size exclusion column (HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg) in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, supplemented with 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithioerythritol (DTE) and 2% glycerol) to yield pure TUBE protein.

For the TUBE pulldown, BxPC3 cells were seeded in either 10- or 15-cm2 cell culture dishes and after cell attachment were treated with 40 ng ml−1 IFN-γ to induce IDO1 expression overnight. Next, the medium was aspired and medium containing the respective concentration of iDeg-1 was added and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For proteasome inhibition, 450 nM CFZ (ab216469, abcam) was added 1 h before the addition of iDeg-1. After compound incubation, cell lysates were prepared in TUBE lysis buffer (20 mM Na2HPO4, 20 mM NaH2PO4, 1% NP-40 Alternative, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), freshly prepared) supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 TUBE protein. The samples were kept on ice for 30 min, followed by a centrifugation step for 30 min at 16,000g and 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined to adjust the protein concentration before the addition of 40 µl of GST magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher). The samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by four washing steps using ice-cold PBS-T for 5 min. To elute ubiquitinated protein species, 20 µl of 1× SDS sample buffer was added to the beads and incubated for 15 min at 55 °C. Afterwards, all samples were boiled for 5 min at 98 °C before separation by SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting for IDO1 and vinculin as a control.

HEK239T cells (3,000,000 cells per electroporation) were electroporated with 80 µg of rhIDO1 utilizing a NeonTM transfection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher). For electroporation, 1,000 V (two pulses for 35 ms) were applied using a Neon transfection system pipette station. Afterwards, the cells were washed in pre-warmed PBS followed by resuspension in 3 ml of trypsin/EDTA solution, and were then incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. The electroporated cells were washed again and resuspended in phenol red-free DMEM growth medium (900,000 cells ml−1). For the Kyn assay in HEKrhIDO1 cells, the cells were plated in 96-well plates and supplemented with 150 µM L-Trp and the respective compound concentrations for 24 h before readout as described above for the manual Kyn assay. For immunoblotting, electroporated cells were seeded in a 12-well plate and treated with the indicated compounds for 6, 14 or 24 h before immunoblotting as described above. For co-treatment, the cells were pre-treated with the proteasome inhibitor CFZ or the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 for 30 min before iDeg-1 addition.

HEK293T cells (270,000 cells ml−1) were transfected with 0.5 µg of pCMV3-IDO1 (Sino Biological US) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher) while seeding in a 96-well plate, followed by incubation overnight. L-Trp (500 µM) and compounds at the indicated concentrations were then added, and the cells were incubated for 24 h before the detection of Kyn levels using p-DMAB as described above for the manual Kyn assay.

The HEK239T cells were electroporated with rhIDO1 as described above and treated with 10 µM iDeg-1 or DMSO for 6 h before lysate preparation by means of four freeze–thaw cycles in PBS containing 0.4% NP-40 Alternative. The protein concentration was determined, and 200 μg of protein lysates were subjected to sample preparation and MS analysis. Protein lysates were dissolved in an equal volume of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer supplemented with 7.5 µl of 200 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, 7.5 µl of 375 mM iodoacetamide were added and the samples incubated for another 30 min at room temperature in the dark before acetone-based protein precipitation (incubation at −20 °C overnight). The next day, the samples were centrifuged at 8,000g and 4 °C, the supernatant was aspired, and protein pellets were dried at room temperature. The pellets were dissolved in 50 mM TEAB containing trypsin/LysC (25:1 protein:protease ratio (wt/wt), pre-dissolved in 1 mM HCl (trypsin/LysC mix, MS grade, 5× from Promega Corporation)) and incubated at 37 °C overnight while shaking. The next day, the samples were dried in a vacuum concentrator at 30 °C and subjected to MS.

All solvents used during MS measurements were LC–MS grade. Digested samples were first dissolved in 120 μl of 20 mM ammonium formate (NH4COOH) at pH 11 in an ultrasonicator for 15 min, followed a 15-min incubation step while rotating, and a subsequent centrifugation step (8,000g for 3 min at room temperature). Each sample (50 μl) was separated into ten fractions using an XBridge C18 column (130 Å, 3.5 μm, 1 mm × 150 mm) and a U3000 capHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under high pH conditions to reduce the sample complexity and increase the number of quantified proteins. Separation was performed at a flow rate of 50 μl min−1 starting with 95% solvent A (20 mM NH4COO pH 11 in H2O)/5% solvent B (40% 20 mM NH4COO pH 11, 60% acetonitrile in H2O), isocratic for the first 10 min, followed by a linear gradient increasing solvent B up to 25% over 5 min. Afterwards, a second linear gradient was applied, increasing solvent B up to 65% in 60 min, followed by a third gradient increasing solvent B up to 100% over 10 min. Fractions were detected at a wavelength of 214 nm.

The ten fractions were collected at 15 and 100 min (30 s per fraction, circular fractionation using ten vials) and dried in a SpeedVac unit at 30 °C until complete dryness for final analysis by nanoHPLC–MS/MS. The dried samples were then dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water before injection of 9 μl onto an UltiMateTM 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), coupled online to a Q Exactive HF Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray source (Nanospray Flex Ion Source, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

To detect the peptides within the samples, a mass range of m/z 300–1,650 was achieved with a resolution of 60,000 for a full scan, before 15 high energy collision dissociation (HCD) MS/MS scans of the most intense at least doubly charged ions using a resolution of 15,000 and a nominal collision energy (NCE) of 27%. The obtained data were analysed using MaxQuant software (v.1.6.17.0)64 including the Andromeda search algorithm and using the human reference proteome of the UniProt database. A full enzymatic trypsin cleavage search was conducted allowing for two miscleavages. Carbamidomethylation was chosen as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine and acetylation of the N terminus as variable modifications.

For the first analysis, the mass accuracy for the full mass spectra was set to 20 ppm, and in the second search it was set to 4.5 ppm and for the MS/MS spectra to 20 ppm. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was selected for peptide and protein identification, and only proteins for which at least two peptides were quantified were chosen for further validation. Relative protein quantification was achieved by means of the label-free quantification algorithm implemented in MaxQuant.

To consider the differences in IDO1 concentration after electroporation of IDO1 into the HEK293T cells, all label-free quantification (LFQ) intensities were normalized to those of the DMSO control of the same biological replicate by dividing the LFQ intensity of the sample by that of the corresponding DMSO control (resulting in a value of 1 for the DMSO controls themselves).

Statistical data analysis was carried out using Perseus65 v.1.6.14.0. The normalized LFQ intensities were log-transformed (log2) and grouped. Proteins were only retained for further analysis when quantified at least twice in at least one of the groups. Missing values were ascribed as ‘0' and a both-sided t-test with error-corrected P values (FDR = 0.01, S0 = 0.5) was conducted. Results were exported into an Excel file (xlsx) and visualized using Perseus. The detailed analysis procedure is described in refs. 64,65.

BxPC3 cells were seeded in 10-cm2 dishes and stimulated with 40 ng ml−1 IFN-γ overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The next day, fresh medium was added containing 20 µM of iDeg-1 or DMSO as a control, and incubated for 8 h before cell detachment and cell lysis using immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.5% NP-40 Alternative) supplemented with fresh N-ethylmaleimide as well as phosphatase (PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitors, Sigma-Aldrich) and protease inhibitors (cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail, Sigma-Aldrich). Three freeze–thaw cycles were performed for cell lysis, followed by centrifugation at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 °C and determination of the protein concentration (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad). The lysate (800 µg) was subjected to immunoprecipitation.

For the following steps, a magnetic rack was used to separate magnetic beads from the supernatant. First, the cell lysates were pre-cleared using 25 µl of Pierce Protein A/G magnetic beads per sample for 1 h at 4 °C while rotating. The lysates were then added to pre-coated Pierce Protein A/G magnetic beads with IDO1 antibody (ab211017, Abcam), followed by continuous rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation wash buffer (50 mM PIPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ethyleneglycol-bis-(2 aminoethylether)-N,N.N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 0.1% NP-40 Alternative, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20 and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) for 5 min while rotating. Subsequently, the beads were transferred to a fresh sample tube after being washed three times with 500 µl of PBS, before further washing steps with 500 µl of PBS (thrice) to remove detergents. The beads were resuspended in 50 µl of denaturation buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 8 M urea and 1 mM DTT) and incubated for 30 min while shaking before the addition of 5.55 μl of 50 mM chloroacetamide solution for another 30 min while shaking. For on-bead digestion, 1 μl of LysC (stock solution of 0.5 μg μl−1 in water) was added for 1 h at 37 °C while shaking. The LysC digestion supernatant was transferred into a fresh sample tube, and to the remaining beads, 165 μl of a 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) solution containing 0.25 μg trypsin was added and incubated for another 1 h at 37 °C while shaking. The two digestion solutions were combined and supplemented with an additional 0.5 μg of trypsin, and the digestion was continued overnight at 37 °C while shaking. The remaining beads were discarded. The next day, the addition of 20 μl of 10% TFA stopped the digestion, and the samples were desalted by stage tip purification. A double layer of C18 chromatography matrix was placed into a 200-µl pipette tip and the matrix was activated by adding 100 μl of 100% methanol. The matrix was washed once with buffer A (0.1% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile in H2O) and twice with buffer B (0.1% formic acid in H2O). For each washing step, centrifugation in a tip centrifuge was performed. Afterwards, the samples were subjected to tip washing once with buffer B, before sample elution, twice, with 20 μl of buffer A. The samples were dried in a vacuum concentrator at 30 °C, and analysed by MS.

All solvents used during MS measurements were LC–MS grade. The samples were dissolved in 20 μl of 0.1% TFA in water and 3 μl were subjected to nanoHPLC–MS/MS analysis. The samples were injected into an UltiMateTM 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), coupled online to a Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray source (Nanospray Flex Ion Source, Thermo Scientific). Samples were desalted by means of a pre-column cartridge (5 μm, 100 Å, 300-μm ID × 5 mm; Dionex) using 0.1% TFA in water and a flow rate of 30 μl min−1 for 5 min, with eluent flow to waste followed by back-flushing of the sample during the whole analysis from the pre-column to the PepMap100 RSLC C18 nanoHPLC column (2 μm, 100 Å, 75 μm ID × 50 cm, nanoViper, Dionex). A linear gradient starting with 95% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in H2O) and 5% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) was used, which was increased to 30% solvent B over 90 min (flow rate 300 nl min−1). Afterwards, the column was washed (95% solvent B as the highest acetonitrile concentration) and re-equilibrated to the starting conditions. Finally, to detect the peptides within the samples, the nanoHPLC was coupled online to the Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer using a standard uncoated SilicaTip (ID 20 μm, Tip-ID 10 μM, New Objective). A mass range of m/z 300–1,650 was achieved with a resolution of 70,000 for the full scan, before ten HCD MS/MS scans of the most intense at least doubly charged ions using a resolution of 17,500 and an NCE energy of 25%.

The obtained data were analysed using MaxQuant software (v.1.6.17.0)64 including the Andromeda search algorithm and using a database containing the IDO1 (UniProt accession no. P14902) or the ubiquitin (UniProt accession no. P0CG48) sequence, together with typical contaminants included in the MaxQuant software. The search was performed for full enzymatic trypsin cleavages allowing two miscleavages. For the protein modifications, carbamidomethylation was chosen as fixed, and oxidation of methionine, acetylation of the N terminus, and GlyGly of lysine as variable modifications. The mass accuracy for the full mass spectra was set to 20 ppm (first search) and 4.5 ppm (second search), respectively, and for the MS/MS spectra to 20 ppm. The FDRs for peptide and protein identification were set to 1%. Results were exported into a txt file and visualized using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad). Details of the analysis procedure are described in ref. 64.

SKOV-3 cells were seeded into a T-75 flask (or a six-well plate for the isothermal dose–response experiment) 48 h before compound addition. On day 3, the indicated iDeg-1 concentrations or DMSO as a control were added for 1 h and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before cell detachment using trypsin. The cells were washed twice with PBS (4 °C, 300g), then the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and equally divided into ten different PCR sample tubes that were subjected to gradient heat treatment (3 min) using a Mastercycler EP gradient system (37, 40.8, 44.1, 47.4, 50.0, 53.4, 55.7, 56.3, 61.0 and 63.7 °C).

For the isothermal dose–response analysis of iDeg-1, the cells were heat-treated at a constant temperature of 50 °C. Afterwards, the SKOV-3 cells were placed on ice and cell lysis was performed by adding 0.4% NP-40 before freeze–thaw lysis. The samples were then centrifuged at 100,000g at 4 °C for 20 min to separate denaturated protein. The supernatants were collected and subjected to SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting, followed by immunostaining for IDO1. The obtained band intensities were quantified using Image Lab software and normalized to the intensities of the bands at 37 °C. Melting temperatures in the presence or absence of the test compound were determined via nonlinear regression using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad).

BxPC3 cells (100,000 cells well−1) were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight before the addition of 25 ng ml−1 IFN-γ and the respective compounds for 24 h. Afterwards, the cells were washed three times with pre-warmed PBS followed by protein translation analysis using a Click-iT HPG Alexa Fluor 488 protein synthesis assay kit (Thermo Fisher). Fresh medium containing the respective compounds as well as 50 µM L-homopropargylglycine (L-HPG) to tag newly synthesized proteins were added to the cells, followed by incubation for 45 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were then fixed using 4% para-formaldehyde, and the L-HPG was fluorescently labelled with Alexa 488 reagent provided by the assay kit using a click reaction as described by the manufacturer (Click-iT HPG Alexa Fluor 488 protein synthesis assay, Thermo Fisher). Cell nuclei were stained using the nuclei stain provided in the assay kit. Images were acquired at ×10 magnification using an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss). The images were analysed using MetaXpress software. The L-HPG-mediated fluorescence intensity as well as a cell count analysis were performed, and the obtained data were normalized to the cell count and visualized by Fiji ImageJ. Data were plotted using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad).

Full-length IDO1 cDNA was cloned into the pT7CFE vector (pT7CFE1-IDO1) and used in the in vitro translation assay with a 1-Step Human Coupled DNA IVT kit (Thermo Fisher). To obtain the proteins required for protein translation, HeLa cell lysate was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. The obtained lysates were combined with pT7CFE1-IDO1 plasmid and supplemented with the reagents provided with the 1-Step Human Coupled DNA IVT kit (Thermo Fisher). The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 30 °C followed by immunoblotting for IDO1.

Full-length human IDO1 cDNA was cloned into the pGEX6p-2rbs vector using EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. For protein translation assays, full-length IDO1 cDNA was cloned into the pT7CFE vector (pT7CFE1-IDO1). Human recombinant IDO1 protein was expressed in E. coli according to ref. 66, yielding pure and active IDO1 protein. IDO1 protein expression in E. coli was induced by the addition of 300 µM IPTG, and the cells were incubated at 20 °C overnight. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM PMSF, DNase), disrupted by sonication and the lysate was centrifuged at 13,000g for 35 min at 10 °C. The supernatant was applied to a GST Trap HP column to enrich GST-tagged IDO1 equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTE, pH 7.0. To obtain untagged full-length IDO1, GST was cleaved from IDO1 overnight using PreScission protease. Eluted IDO1 protein was further purified using a size exclusion column (26/60 G75 HiLoad) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl to yield pure rhIDO1.

For hIDO1crystallization, a truncated version (5–400) of IDO1 was cloned into the pGEX6p-2rbs vector using the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. Haem was removed by overnight incubation with 166 mM 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA) to obtain apo-IDO1. Haem occupancy was determined by UV–vis spectrophotometry.

Expression constructs for KLHDC3-EloB/C (both monomeric and tetrameric versions) are described in ref. 55. Briefly, KLHDC3, EloB and His-TEV-EloC were first cloned into pLib via Gibson assembly. Cassettes were then generated via PCR as described in ref. 67 and Gibson-assembled into pBig1a to generate a single vector for co-expression of all components. Proper assembly into pBig1a was confirmed by PmeI and SwaI restriction digestion.

For the ubiquitination assays, IDO1 (residues 5-C) was cloned into a pRSF Duet based vector with an N-terminal His-TEV tag and purified as described above.

KLHDC3-EloB/C was expressed in Hi5 insect cells with an N-terminal 6XHis tag on EloC as described in ref. 55. Tagged proteins were purified from cell lysates by Ni affinity chromatography. Nickel elutions were directly loaded onto a HiTrap Q-HP column and eluted with a gradient of 2–50% NaCl. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated and further purified by size exclusion chromatography in 25 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT pH 7.5.

To introduce a cysteine for fluorescent labelling of UB and K0UB, we mutated the protein kinase A site in the pGEX2TK backbone converting the PKA site from RRASV to RRACV68. UB or UBK0 purified from this expression construct was labelled with AlexaFluor-647-maleimide or fluorescein-5-maleimide, respectively, as described in ref. 68. Briefly, DTT was added to UB or UBK0 at a final concentration of 10 mM and incubated on ice for 20 min to completely reduce the cysteines for labelling. DTT was removed by buffer exchange over an NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) in labelling buffer (25 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl). Labelling reactions consisted of UB or UBK0 at 150 µM final concentration and were initiated by the addition of 600 µM AlexaFluor-647-maleimide or fluorescein-5-maleimide (4× excess over labelling target and <5% final DMSO concentration). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and quenched by the addition of DTT to 10 mM. Quenched reactions were desalted over a PD-10 column in labelling buffer containing 1 mM DTT to remove unreacted probe. Desalted protein was concentrated and further purified over a Sephadex SD75 column.

Full-length rhIDO protein (1 µM) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM KH2PO4 and 50 mM K2HPO4, pH 6.5) was incubated with the respective compounds for 90 min at 37 °C before the addition of 10 mM ascorbic acid, 10 µM methylene blue, 2 mM Trp and 100 µg ml−1 catalase (Sigma-Aldrich, C100). The samples were incubated for 60 min, followed by the addition of TCA to a final concentration of 7% and further incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Kyn levels were detected by the addition of an equal volume of 2% (wt/vol) p-DMAB in acetic acid, and absorbance was measured at 492 nm and 650 nm as a background control. Values are presented relative to the DMSO control. Dose–response curves and IC50 values were generated and fitted with GraphPad Prism 9.2.0 (GraphPad software) using a four-parameter, variable-slope nonlinear regression curve fit.

Full-length rhIDO1 (10 µM) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) was incubated with the respective compound or DMSO as a control at 37 °C for 3 h, followed by a centrifugation step for 10 min at 1,000g. Afterwards, the protein solution was loaded onto a capillary, followed by the measurement of fluorescence intensities at 350 nm and 330 nm from 20 °C up to 90 °C using a Prometheus Panta device (NanoTemper Technologies). Melting curves were visualized by GraphPad Prism 9.2.0 (GraphPad software).

Full-length rhIDO1 (10 μM) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) was incubated with the respective compounds or DMSO as a control for 3 h at 37 °C followed by a centrifugation step for 10 min at 1,000g. Subsequently, UV–vis spectra of the samples were monitored between 250 and 650 nm in 1-nm increments using UV-transparent microplates (UV-STAR, Greiner) and a Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan).

All experiments were performed on a MicroCal AutoITC200 set-up. KLHDC3-EloB/C was buffer-exchanged by desalting over an NAP-5 column in ITC buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in ITC buffer to a final concentration of 1 mM. The titrations used KLHDC3-EloB/C in the sample cell at 24 µM, and 240 µM test peptide in the syringe. Titrations were performed at 25 °C with one injection of 0.4 µl, followed by 12 injections of 3 µl. Experiments were performed n = 2 times, and data were evaluated with MicroCal PEAQ software.

To evaluate the binding affinity of iDegs to IDO1, IDO1 protein was dissolved in ITC buffer (50 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM K2HPO4 and 1 mM TCEP, pH 6.57) to a final concentration of 125 µM in the syringe, while the sample cell contained iDeg-6 at 50 µM. Titrations were performed at 25 °C with one injection of 0.4 µl, followed by 18 injections of 2 µl. Experiments were performed n = 3 times in a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC system (Malvern), and the data were evaluated with MicroCal PEAQ software.

Truncated apo-IDO1 protein (residues 5–400; 10 mg ml−1, 225 µM) was incubated with 660 µM iDeg-1 (1.3% vol/vol DMSO) or 450 µM iDeg-2 (1.8% vol/vol DMSO) in binding buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 µM TCEP) at 37 °C for 2 h. The soluble protein fraction was separated from the precipitate by centrifugation at 20,000g for 15 min at 20 °C. Crystallization drops were prepared by mixing 0.4 µl of the rhIDO1:iDeg solution with 0.2 µl of precipitant solution in a sitting drop set-up (iQ plates, SPT Labtech) at 20 °C. Crystals were obtained in wells with precipitant solution containing 41% vol/vol PEG200 in 50 mM MES pH 6.66 (iDeg-1) and 39% (vol/vol) PEG200 in 100 mM MES pH 6.95 (iDeg-2). The crystals appeared in one day as thin bars. After five days, the crystals were collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using the precipitant solution as cryoprotectant. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Swiss Light Source (SLS, Villigen, Switzerland) on beamline X10SA (iDeg-1) and at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) on beamline ID30B (iDeg-2). Data were processed with XDS and scaled using XSCALE. The iDeg-2 structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser69 from the Phenix suite70 using as initial model the coordinates of the IDO1-apoxidole structure (PDB 8ABX). The iDeg-1 structure was solved in the same manner using the determined IDO1-iDeg-2 structure (PDB 9FOH) as the initial model. Iterative refinement cycles were carried out using phenix.refine and COOT71. Figures were generated using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics system (version 2.5.4, Schrödinger). PDB ID codes, data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Supplementary Table 2.

The use of pulse-chase assays allowed comparison of the paths of UB transfer starting from UBE2R2 or UBE2D2. First, UBE2R2 or UBE2D2 was pulse-labelled by incubating a mixture of UBA1 (0.3 µM), E2 (10 µM) and fluorescently labelled UB or KOUB (15 µM) in 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, pH 7.5 at room temperature for 13 min. Pulse-loading reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA to 50 mM and incubated on ice for 5 min. Ubiquitination chase reactions consisted of mixing the E2~*UB thioester conjugate (0.4 µM final concentration) with the indicated pre-equilibrated NEDD8~CUL2-RBX1-KLHDC3-EloB/C (0.3 µM final concentration) with a threefold excess of IDO1 variants in 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5 at room temperature. Experiments following loading of apo-IDO1 with small molecules consisted of incubating IDO1 (15 µM final concentration) with a twofold excess of the indicated test molecules for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Mixtures were pelleted for 10 min at 14,000 r.p.m. to remove insoluble material. A UV–vis spectrum of the resulting supernatant confirmed haem incorporation, and the samples were directly diluted into ubiquitination reactions. Reactions were quenched at the indicated times with 2× SDS–PAGE sample buffer and separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels and scanned for fluorescence on a Typhoon imager. All experiments, except where indicated, utilized a monomeric version of KLHDC3-EloB/C.

To assess the relative binding strength of apo-IDO1, or small-molecule-bound variants of IDO1, we employed a competition pulse-chase ubiquitination assay. First, KLHDC3-EloB/C (50 nM) was equilibrated at room temperature for 15 min with 200 nM IDO1C-deg peptide and varied concentrations of full-length apo-IDO1, iDeg-6-bound IDO1 or linrodostat-bound IDO1. Chase reactions were then initiated by the addition of the pre-formed fluorescent UBE2R2~UB thiolester conjugate (100 nM final concentration). Reaction aliquots were removed at 30 s and quenched with 2× SDS–PAGE sample buffer, separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels, and scanned for fluorescence on a Typhoon imager. Data were quantified and visualized as the loss of UB~IDO1C-deg ubiquitination upon increasing concentrations of full-length IDO1 variants, yielding apparent IC50 values for KLHDC3 binding by the differing IDO1 full-length variants.

Biochemical assays testing the order of addition of small molecules as shown in Fig. 5m, were performed by first incubating apo-IDO1 (14 mM) with the indicated small molecules (42 µM) for 20 min at room temperature. A second test molecule was then added (42 µM) and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The mixtures were then diluted to a final concentration of 500 nM of IDO1 containing NEDD8~CUL2KLHDC3 (200 nM final concentration). Ubiquitination chase reactions were initiated by the addition of UBE2R2~UBR7 thioester conjugate (300 nM). Reactions were quenched at the indicated times with 2× SDS–PAGE sample buffer and separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels and scanned for fluorescence on a Typhoon imager.

The N-terminal stability reporter was generated starting from the previously reported C-terminal stability vector49,72. The backbone was digested using SalI and MluI (NEB), and the mCherry and TagBFP inserts were amplified using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase following the manufacturer's instructions and using the primers indicated in Supplementary Table 3. Fragments were subsequently assembled using an NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly cloning kit. The MluI restriction site was maintained and utilized for insertion of the various IDO1 constructs amplified with the primers indicated in Supplementary Table 3 and again assembled using the NEBuilder HiFi kit. As starting material for the genetic versions of IDO1, Addgene plasmid 187026 (pcDNA3.1-IDO1-p2a-eGFP gifted by G. van den Bogaart73) was used. The custom-made sgRNA library targeting elements of the ubiquitin proteasome system51 was generated as previously described in ref. 49. Single sgRNAs were designed using the VBC score74 and ordered as custom oligos (Sigma). After phosphorylation (T4 PNK, NEB) and annealing of the oligos, an NEBridge Golden Gate assembly kit (BsmBI-v2) was used for insertion of the respective sgRNAs (sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 4). sgRNAs were cloned into pLenti-U6-sgRNA-IT-EF1αs-THY1.1-P2A-NeoR49. Insertion of the correct DNA sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing (Microsynth).

For IDO1 F270, R343A, H346A and T395M, pENTR223 IDO1 was mutagenized using Q5 site-directed mutagenesis (NEB), followed by Gibson assembly to yield the respective N-terminal stability reporters. The used oligunucleotides were as follows:

Lenti-X cells were transfected at 70% confluence with the reporter or sgRNA plasmids as well as the two packaging plasmids (pCMVR8.74 helper and pMD2.G envelope) using polyethylenimine (PEI MAX Mw 40,000, Polysciences). pCMVR8.74 was a gift from D. Trono (Addgene plasmid 22036). pMD2.G was a gift from D. Trono (Addgene 12259). The virus was collected and filtered using a 0.45-μm poly-ethersulfone filter. One million KBM7 iCas9 cells or KBM7 iCas9 IDO1 N-terminal stability reporter cells per 2 ml were transduced with varying volumes of virus solution and incubated with 8 µg ml−1 polybrene for 24 h before cell expansion. Cells were selected either via FACS using a CytoFLEX SRT Benchtop Cell Sorter (for reporter cell lines, BFP and mCherry positive cells, Extended Data Fig. 7c) or using G418 (1 mg ml−1, Gibco) for sgRNA-harbouring cell lines, which was added 72 h after transduction. KO cell lines were generated by selection of the respective sgRNA (sgAAVS1 = CTRL or sgRNA1/2 KLHDC3 for KO1/KO2) for at least 14 days with G418 followed by subsequent induction with doxycycline (0.4 μg ml−1, PanReac AppliChem) and cell recovery.

IDO1 KBM7 reporter cells were treated for the times, compounds and concentrations indicated in the respective figure legends or as specified in the text. All compounds were diluted starting from DMSO stock solutions. Blue fluorescent protein (BFP) and mCherry levels were measured using an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) with BD FACSDiva software (v9.0). To quantify the changes across conditions, the mean BFP and mCherry values were exported after gating for singlets and reporter positive cells (for the gating strategy see Supplementary Fig. 1a,c) utilizing FlowJo 10.6.2. Normalization was performed either against the respective wt IDO1 reporter cells treated with DMSO (Fig. 5h), their respective co-treatment (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 6d) or for each respective genotype (Figs. 4b,i, 5i and 6f,i and Extended Data Fig. 6e).

The screen, library preparation and sequencing analysis were performed as described in ref. 49. In brief, 120 million KBM7 iCas9 IDO1 N-terminal stability reporter cells were transduced at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ~0.12 sgRNA-positive cells (>1,000-fold library representation, Extended Data Fig. 7e) with the customized ubiquitin focused library. Transduced cells were selected with G418 (1 mg ml−1, Gibco) for 14 days, expanded, and Cas9 expression was induced with doxycycline (0.4 μg ml−1, PanReac AppliChem). Three days after Cas9 induction, 50 million cells per condition and replicate were treated with DMSO, iDeg-1 or iDeg-2. The experiment was performed in two biological replicates. Cells were washed with PBS, stained with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-mouse Thy1.1 antibody (1:400, 202526, BioLegend) and human TruStain FcX Fc receptor blocking solution (1:1,000, 422302, BioLegend) for 5 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with BD fixation buffer 4% (Thermo Scientific Pierce) for 45 min at 4 °C. All steps were performed protected from light. Cells were washed twice with PBS and stored in FACS buffer (PBS, 5% FBS and 1 mM EDTA).

For sorting, cells were strained using a 35-μm nylon mesh and sorted on a BD FACSAria Fusion instrument (70-µm nozzle, BD Biosciences) with BD FACSDiva software (v8.0.2). Singlets, Cas9 and sgRNA-positive cells were selected following the scheme shown in Extended Data Fig. 7a–d. Next, fractions with different levels of BFP were enriched: the 5% highest or lowest BFP expressing cells were used for the respective HIGH and LOW fractions, and 30% of the population's centre was selected for the MID fractions. For each replicate, cells corresponding to at least a 1,000-fold library representation were sorted.

To quantify the sgRNA levels per each fraction and sample, next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries were prepared. Genomic DNA was isolated by cell lysis (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) and proteinase K treatment (New England Biolabs) overnight at 55 °C, with shaking at 1,200 r.p.m., followed by 2 h of DNAse-free RNAse (Thermo Fisher Scientific) incubation at 37 °C. Next, DNA was extracted by two rounds of phenol extraction and subsequent isopropanol precipitation. Barcoded NGS libraries for each sorted population were generated using a two-step PCR protocol using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Invitrogen). The resulting PCR products were purified after each step using Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads (Omega Biotek). The final NGS libraries were pooled and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina).

Sequencing reads were trimmed using fastx-toolkit (v0.0.14), aligned using Bowtie2 (v2.4.5), and quantified using featureCounts (v2.0.1). The utilized workflows are available at https://github.com/ZuberLab/crispr-process-nf/tree/566f6d46bbcc2a3f49f51bbc96b9820f408ec4a3 and https://github.com/ZuberLab/crispr-mageck-nf/tree/c75a90f670698bfa78bfd8be-786d6e5d6d4fc455. To calculate gene-level enrichment, the sorted populations (HIGH or LOW) were compared to the MID populations using the median-normalized read counts.

To generate the TurboID-IDO1 construct, TurboID was N-terminally fused to IDO1 via a flexible 5xGGGS linker. The IDO1 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from pCMV3-IDO1 (Sino Biological US) using the following primer pair:

The pCD-betaG-Flag-TurboID vector (Addgene 124646) was amplified using the following primer pair:

5′-CTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACGTAGATCCAGACATGATAAGATAC-3′ and 5′-ccgccaccgctcccgcctccCTTTTCGGCAGACCGCAGACTGATTTC-3′

The amplified PCR fragments were assembled together with the primer 5′-GGAGGCGGGAGCGGTGGCGGctctggtgggggaagCGGCGGAGGGAGTGGAGGAGGCAGC-3′ to incorporate the 5xGGGS linker using an NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly cloning kit.

Ten million HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 4.2 µg of Flag-TurboID-IDO1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with CFZ for 1 h, followed by treatment with either DMSO or 5 µM iDeg-3 for 2.5 h. During the final 15 min of the incubation, 500 μM biotin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cells to induce biotinylation of proximal proteins. The cells were subsequently washed four times with cold PBS, pelleted at 300g for 5 min and lysed in urea lysis buffer (4 M urea, 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 Alternative, 2 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide, protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.5) for 1 h on ice, followed by sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 17,000g for 15 min at 4 °C), then 500 µg of protein from each condition in 500 µl of lysis buffer was incubated with 60 µl of pre-washed streptavidin magnetic beads (Pierce) (washing buffer 1: 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The next day, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of 4 M urea washing buffer 2 (4 M urea, 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) followed by a final wash with PBS. Bound proteins were eluted by resuspending the beads in 20 µl of elution buffer (25 mM biotin, 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. This elution procedure was repeated using 10 µl of 2× LDS buffer at 95 °C, and both eluates were combined. The eluates were then dried in a SpeedVac for 2 h, redissolved in 10 µl of Milli-Q water, and the complete eluate was applied to SDS gel. Input and eluted proteins were analysed by immunoblotting against IDO1 and KLHDC3.

The scratch wound healing assay was performed as described in ref. 34. SKOV-3 cells were seeded at 0.2 × 106 cells ml−1 in 2 ml in six-well plates and cultured overnight to reach a confluence of over 80%. After 24 h of pre-conditioning with epacadostat, iDeg-6 or vehicle, a 10-µl sterile pipette tip was used to make a scratch line on the monolayer of confluent cells at the bottom of the well. The cells were washed twice to remove cellular debris, re-exposed to stimuli or vehicle, and then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. Over this incubation time, the wound healing was continuously observed using an EVOS M5000 imaging system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with ×10 magnification. Pictures were acquired at different time points. The area of the wound healing was determined using the MRI wound healing tool (ImageJ software, NIH) and the data are reported as percentage of wound closure in relation to time 0.

Experimental studies suggested potential adverse effects of preservative food additives, but epidemiological data are lacking. We aim to investigate associations between exposure to these compounds and type 2 diabetes incidence in the NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort (n = 108,723; 79.2%women; mean age=42.5 (SD = 14.6); France, 2009-2023). Dietary intakes are assessed using repeated 24h-dietary records. Exposure is evaluated through multiple composition databases and ad-hoc laboratory assays in food matrices. Associations between cumulative exposures to preservatives and diabetes incidence are characterised using multi-adjusted Cox models. The sum of total preservatives encompasses 58 substances. Among those, 17 are consumed by at least 10% of the study population and thus individually investigated. Thirteen (12 after multiple test correction) widely used individual preservatives are associated with higher diabetes incidence (n=1131cases): potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic, citric and phosphoric acids, sodium acetates, calcium propionate, sodium ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol, sodium erythorbate, and rosemary extracts. These findings call for their safety re-evaluation and support recommendations to favour fresh and minimally processed foods without superfluous additives. Trial registration: The NutriNet-Santé cohort is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03335644).

Food additives encompass a wide range of substances which can be divided into different categories based on their functional properties, e.g., colours, preservatives, sweeteners, emulsifiers, etc. Our group already investigated artificial sweeteners1, emulsifiers2, nitrites and nitrates3, and most recently, food additive mixtures4 in association with type 2 diabetes incidence in the NutriNet-Santé cohort. The present study focuses on preservative food additives, which are massively used by the food industry globally. Among the three and a half million foods and beverages listed in the Open Food Facts World database in 20245, more than 700,000 contain at least one of these additives. Preservatives (European codes usually within the E200s and E300s ranges) are added to prolong the shelf-life of foods. They protect them against deterioration caused by micro-organisms and/or growth of pathogenic micro-organisms, and by oxidation, such as fat rancidity and colour changes6.

From 2004 to 2024, about a sixth (n = 25) of food additive re-evaluations conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concerned preservatives. Sixteen of them led to the derivation of Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) reference values for these additives or their respective groups7. ADIs were based on a range of toxicological endpoints, including behavioural, carcinogenic, developmental, haematological, reproductive, and thyroid toxicity, as well as growth retardation, increased blood methaemoglobin level, and increased mortality, all relying on experimental data. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies highlighted potential metabolic-related generally adverse effects of preservatives on pancreatic tissue8,9, insulin disruption8,9,10,11, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle11,12, inflammation13,14, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) activation15, questioning their potential impacts on metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, with direct metabolic aetiology. EFSA suggested that metabolisation of these additives implies conversion into substances, such as acetate into acetyl-CoA, that play a role in the body's metabolism7. For some of these additives, corresponding substances are naturally present in foods and beverages (e.g., certain antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C – ascorbic acid). In this case, epidemiological studies investigated the link between their dietary intake, supplementation or nutritional status and the risk of type 2 diabetes (suggesting non-to-low protective evidence16), but to our knowledge, none of these have considered food additives sources, while the impact of the substance may depend on the matrix in which it is integrated. Plus, no consumption data is available for other preservative food additives due to the important variability in additive composition between commercial products and the lack of brand-specific data in previous cohorts. Thus, this study aimed to comprehensively quantify the time-dependent exposure to preservative food additives available on the French/European market and examine any potential associations with the incidence of type 2 diabetes in a large prospective cohort.

The population study included 108,723 participants (Fig. 1), 79.2% women. On average, they completed 21 24HDRs (SD 18); median = 17; 25th–75th percentiles = 6–32; maximum = 84. Participants had a mean age at baseline of 42.5 years (SD 14.6) (range = 15.2–99.0). Compared to lower consumers (tertile 1), higher consumers of food additive preservatives (tertile 3) tended to be younger, slightly less exposed to a family history of diabetes, with a lower prevalence of metabolic diseases (cardiovascular disease, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension), a lower physical activity level, they were more likely to be current smokers, consumed less alcohol and had higher energy intakes (Table 1—descriptive unadjusted analysis).

Flowchart of participants included from the NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2009–2023 (n = 108,723).

Intakes of preservative food additives are displayed in Tables 2 and 3. A total of 99.7% of participants exhibited a non-null intake of food additive preservatives in the first 2 years of follow-up. Out of the 58 preservative food additives detected and quantified in our databases, 17 were consumed by at least 10% of the participants and thus were individually investigated in relation with type 2 diabetes incidence (Tables 2 and 3), to allow sufficient statistical power in Cox models (but all 58 additives were accounted for in sums of preservative categories). In terms of proportion of consumers, the main preservative food additives were: citric acid (E330) (91.8% consumers), lecithins (E322) (87.1%), total sulfites (83.6%), ascorbic acid (E300) (83.5%), sodium nitrite (E250) (73.7%), potassium sorbate (E202) (65.5%), sodium erythorbate (E316) (52.7%), sodium ascorbate (E301) (50.2%), potassium metabisulfite (E224) (44.4%), and potassium nitrate (E252) (32.6%). No strong correlation between preservative food additives was identified (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Manufacturers use preservatives ubiquitously across a wide range of food groups (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Some are nonetheless more specific to given food groups: 22.2% of sorbates were found in fruit- and vegetable-based foods; 85.5% of sulfites in alcoholic drinks; 53.7% of nitrites, 80.4% of nitrates, and 42.2% of erythorbates in processed meat; 43.6% and 30.5% of propionates in refined and whole grains and cereals, respectively; 50.6% of ascorbates and 25.7% of citrates in fruit- and vegetable-based foods; and 30.3% of tocopherols in breakfast cereals. In all, 34.6% of food additive preservatives were consumed through ultra-processed foods in this population study.

The magnitude of the food group contribution to the preservative food additive intake is reflected by the colour (gradient from yellow to red, the higher the contribution, the redder the circle) and size point (the higher the contribution, the bigger the circle). aGroups of preservative food additives were defined as follows (European codes): total sorbates (E200, E202, E203), total benzoates (E210, E211, E212), total sulfites (E220, E221, E222, E223, E224, E225, E228), total nitrites (E249, E250), total nitrates (E251, E252), total acetates (E260, E261, E262, E263), total propionates (E280, E281, E282), total ascorbates (E300, E301, E302, E304), total tocopherols (E306, E307, E307b, E307c), total erythorbates (E315, E316), total butylates (E319, E320, E321), and total EDTA (E385, E386). bDetailed % are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

For food additive substances that also naturally occurred in the diet, the relative contribution of the food additive source varied depending on the compound: from 1% for tocopherols or 5% for acetates on average, to 17% for citric acid, 29% for ascorbates, and 63% for sulfites.

No participant exceeded the ADIs set by EFSA7 for sorbates, erythorbates or nitrates. However, 90 participants exceeded the ADI set for sulfites with a mean intake of 0.88 mg of sulfur dioxide/kg body weight per day (SD 0.33, median = 0.80, 25th–75th percentiles [0.75–0.92]) and 55 exceeded the ADI for nitrites with a mean consumption of 0.10 mg nitrite ion/kg body weight per day (0.03, 0.08, [0.08–0.10]).

Participants' median follow-up time was 8.05 years (841,296 person-years). Between 2009 and 2023, 1131 incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified. Schoenfeld residuals did not refute the proportional hazard assumption (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Restricted cubic spline plots (Supplementary Fig. 3) did not indicate departure from linearity for sodium acetates (E262), total tocopherols, tocopherol-rich extract (E306), alpha-tocopherol (E307), phosphoric acid (E338), and extracts of rosemary (E392) (p values for non-linearity ≥0.05), in this case p values for trend are provided in the following paragraph. For others, restricted cubic splines suggested a plateau effect (p values for non-linearity <0.05); therefore, the likelihood ratio overall p values (requiring no underlying hypothesis of linearity) are displayed thereafter. The retained p values are provided for all tested additives in Supplementary Table 2 for the main model and in Supplementary Table 3 for sensitivity analyses.

The results of Cox models are presented in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2. Higher intakes of the following additives were associated with a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes: total preservatives (HRcategory 3 vs. 1 = 1.47, 95% CI [1.26–1.73], p < 0.001), total preservatives (non-antioxidant) (1.49[1.27–1.74], <0.001), total sorbates (1.85[1.57–2.18], <0.001), potassium sorbate (E202) (2.15[1.76–2.63], <0.001), potassium metabisulfite (E224) (1.29[1.10–1.51], <0.001), total nitrites (1.50[1.26–1.78], <0.001), sodium nitrite (E250) (1.50[1.26–1.78], <0.001), total acetates (1.36[1.16–1.59], <0.001), acetic acid (E260) (1.31[1.08–1.60], <0.001), sodium acetates (E262) (1.23[1.01–1.50], 0.003), total propionates (1.43[1.21–1.68], <0.001), calcium propionate (E282) (1.44[1.22–1.70], <0.001), total preservatives (antioxidant) (1.40[1.19–1.65], <0.001), total ascorbates (1.17[1.00–1.38], 0.01), sodium ascorbate (E301) (1.41[1.19–1.66], <0.001), total tocopherols (1.27[1.07–1.50], <0.001), alpha-tocopherol (E307) (1.30[1.05–1.60], 0.001), total erythorbates (1.42[1.20–1.69], <0.001), sodium erythorbate (E316) (1.43[1.20–1.69], <0.001), citric acid (E330) (1.29[1.11–1.51], 0.003), phosphoric acid (E338) (1.39[1.10–1.75], <0.001), and extracts of rosemary (E392) (1.20[1.02–1.41], 0.01). Overall, these results were stable across all sensitivity analyses testing mutual adjustment for other preservative food additives, additional adjustment for the proportion of ultra-processed foods in the diet, diagnosis and/or treatment for at least one prevalent non-diabetes metabolic disorder, time-dependent intakes of total emulsifier and total artificial sweetener food additives, vitamins C and E supplements, trans fatty acids, dietary patterns rather than individual food groups, polyunsaturated fatty acids and heme iron; models with start of follow-up after the first 2-year period; models not excluding energy under-reporters; marginal structural model; and model using splines for covariates (Supplementary Table 3). An exception was for total ascorbates, which became non-significant with p = 0.4 in the marginal structural model, maybe due to loss of statistical power (however, the specific ascorbate E301 remained stable with this model, p < 0.001). As expected, no association was detected with the hip fracture negative control model (613 incident cases, all p values > 0.05).

HR hazard ratio, CI confidence interval. The dot represents the estimates of HR, and the error bars represent the 95%CI of the estimates. The dashed line indicates the reference value (HR = 1). Associations between total preservatives and non-antioxidant preservatives and type 2 diabetes are presented on the left-hand side (A) of the figure, and between antioxidant preservatives and type 2 diabetes on the right-hand side (B). aThe three food additive categories were defined as follows: sex-specific tertiles (tertile 1 = reference) for total preservatives, total preservatives (non-antioxidant), total sorbates, total sulfites, total nitrites, sodium nitrite (E250), total preservatives (antioxidant), total ascorbates, ascorbic acid (E300), lecithins (E322), and citric acid (E330); and otherwise: 1/ non-consumers (=reference), 2/ lower, and 3/ higher consumers, the latter two being separated by the sex-specific median. Cut-offs were re-calculated for each period and are available in Supplementary Table 6. bThe detail of all investigated associations between preservative food additive intakes and type 2 diabetes risk with corresponding HRs, 95% CIs and number of cases/participants per category is provided in Supplementary Table 2. When the log-linearity assumption was not rejected (p for non-linearity ≥0.05 in the Restricted Cubic Splines models), the p for linear trend (marked with *) was retained (obtained by coding the exposure as an ordinal categorical variable 1, 2, 3). When the assumption of log-linearity was not met (p for non-linearity <0.05), it was not adapted to calculate a p for linear trend, thus, the likelihood ratio overall p value (marked with §) was retained (obtained by coding the exposure as a non-ordinal categorical variable and calculating likelihood ratio test between models with and without the studied food additive exposure variable). cMultivariable Cox proportional hazard models (two-sided, statistically significant p value < 0.05) (see Methods for adjustment strategy). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. FDR-corrected p values for multiple test correction are available in footnote e of Supplementary Table 2.

We also tested associations between intakes of acetic acid, citric acid, nitrates, nitrites, sulfites, vitamin C, and vitamin E from naturally occurring sources and type 2 diabetes incidence. Naturally occurring acetic acid and nitrates from drinking water were associated with increased type 2 diabetes incidence, while natural sulfites were associated with lower incidence (Supplementary Table 4).

In this population study, ultra-processed food exposure (% weight in the diet) was associated with higher type 2 diabetes incidence (HR = 1.20, 95% CI [1.11–1.29], p value < 0.001). We computed a mediation analysis to assess the proportion of this association mediated by preservative food additives that were related to type 2 diabetes in this study (i.e., potassium sorbate (E202), potassium metabisulfite (E224), sodium nitrite (E250), acetic acid (E260), sodium acetates (E262), calcium propionate (E282), sodium ascorbate (E301), tocopherol-rich extract (E306), alpha-tocopherol (E307), sodium erythorbate (E316), citric acid (E330), phosphoric acid (E338), and extracts of rosemary (E392)). In all, 17% of the association between ultra-processed food and type 2 diabetes was mediated by exposure to these preservatives (p value of the mediated proportion = 0.01).

This large prospective cohort study revealed associations of higher type 2 diabetes incidence with higher intakes of several widely used preservative non-antioxidant food additives (potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic acid, sodium acetates, and calcium propionate) and preservative antioxidant food additives (sodium ascorbate, tocopherol-rich extract, alpha-tocopherol, sodium erythorbate, citric acid, phosphoric acid, and extracts of rosemary).

For some preservative food additives, EFSA data were available to compare intake levels with those observed in our population study (Supplementary Table 5). The order of magnitude was consistent overall. Relatively similar intakes were observed for sorbates (E200-E203), ascorbates (E300-E302), extracts of rosemary (E392), nitrates (E251-E252), propionates (E280-E283), and lecithins (E322). Compared to EFSA, intake tended to be lower in NutriNet-Santé for sulfites (E220-E228), nitrites (E249-E250), and alpha-tocopherol (E307) and higher for erythorbates (E315-E316). These differences may be due to: (1) the differences between exposure assessment methods (with more precise data in the NutriNet-Santé cohort, based on brand-specific repeated 24HDRs versus generic food items and a generally lower number of records or recalls in studies on which EFSA estimates are based); (2) the differences in dates of assessment and study populations, with for instance more women, older, and more-health conscious participants in NutriNet-Santé compared to the French general population.

No other cohort study investigated the associations between intakes of preservative food additives and type 2 diabetes incidence, probably due to a lack of data regarding specific industrial foods consumed and thus their additive content, which varies greatly from one brand to another. Thus, comparison with epidemiological literature is not straightforward. Consistent with our findings, a recent meta-analysis observed a higher risk of type 1 or 2 diabetes associated with higher exposure of dietary nitrites and no association with nitrates. This meta-analysis included five studies based on food frequency questionnaires (not enabling differentiation between naturally occurring and food additive sources) as well as previous NutriNet-Santé results (based on brand-specific data, enabling differentiation between sources)17. Indeed, our group previously published a specific study on nitrites and nitrates and type 2 diabetes incidence in NutriNet-Santé3. Despite an updated methodology (now using time-dependent cumulative exposure) and longer follow-up (+2 years), the results remain consistent. As several public health authorities consider a possible ban of nitrites and nitrates as food additives, altogether, these data consolidate the conclusions that higher exposure to additive-originated nitrites was associated with higher type 2 diabetes incidence, while no association with nitrate additives was detected3. To our knowledge, no other study investigated nitrite/nitrate additives and type 2 diabetes incidence. Regarding antioxidants, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed no benefit of vitamins E, C or beta-carotene supplementation on type 2 diabetes risk16. None of the included studies provided data specifically on preservative antioxidant food additives. An RCT conducted in Iran focused on patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and detected no effect of rosemary leaf extract on glycaemic status18. Some prospective studies investigated the associations between blood or urinary biomarkers of some compounds that may partly result from exposure to exogenous preservative food additives, but also largely from endogenous metabolism, greatly limiting the comparison with our results. For instance, a nested case-control from the Women's Interagency HIV Study in the United States observed that plasma sorbic acid was associated with greater odds of incident type 2 diabetes19. Another US prospective study showed that elevated serum calcium phosphate, a derived compound of phosphoric acid, was associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes20.

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, many mechanisms may underpin the associations detected in this study, including metabolic and inflammatory disruption and/or altered insulin signalling pathway. An in vitro study (hepatic cells) on food additives revealed that lecithins showed no cytotoxicity or genotoxicity, while potassium sorbate, sodium nitrite, sodium ascorbate, and sodium erythorbate were cytotoxic21. Potassium sorbate specifically acts as an AGE activator with and without glucose15, while high AGE intake is linked to type 2 diabetes22. Mouse model studies showed that coadministration of sorbate and fructose (a monosaccharide naturally found in many foods and drinks) leads to altered liver function (steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis) associated with altered expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism23. These observations are associated with disturbances in intestinal myco- and microbiota, while other studies have confirmed sorbate's potential proinflammatory effects at hepatic and microbiota levels24. Investigating the impact of potassium sorbate on pancreatic inflammation, related to type 2 diabetes onset25, would be interesting.

Regarding the insulin (INS) pathway, experiments on rat models showed the particular role of N-nitroso compounds in the development of INS resistance via disruption of both INS and IGF pathways and dysfunction of pancreatic β-cells8,9 and that co-exposure to N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) and fat (found in nitrited-processed meat) causes INS and IGF-1 resistance associated with type 2 diabetes26. Studies on mice and humans also reported that propionate impaired insulin action27. In a rodent study, chronic supplementations of pharmacological doses of vitamins C and E increased fasting blood glucose, insulin, and homoeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance (HOMA—a method used to quantify insulin resistance and beta-cell function)10. Vitamin C impaired glucose tolerance by disrupting upstream hepatic insulin action, while vitamin E acted downstream insulin receptors, reducing, for example, glucose transporter-2 expression. Sodium ascorbate, which converts to vitamin C, and vitamin C isomers like erythorbates may share similar roles in metabolism. In contrast, an in vitro study found that alpha-tocopherol decreases superoxide anion release in human monocytes under hyperglycaemic conditions via inhibition of protein kinase C-alpha28. The effects of one substance may vary based on factors such as food matrix (of which composition, structure, pH and other characteristics may affect the way bioactive compounds are assimilated and digested by gut microbiota and host organisms), dosage, and interaction with other elements, impacting the bioavailability of oil-soluble vitamins like vitamin E, for instance29,30.

The TCA cycle is connected to several metabolisms (including fat, amino acid, glucose metabolisms)—changes in the levels of its metabolites may impact the overall metabolism. For example, inhibiting citrate cotransporter Slc13a5/mINDY improved hepatic insulin sensitivity11. Interestingly, several food additives like citrate, propionate (after conversion into succinyl-CoA), and acetate (after conversion into acetyl-CoA) connect with the TCA cycle12, and it would be interesting to test the links between such exposure and the activity of this specific metabolism. No direct comparison was possible concerning phosphoric acid; however, a US cross-sectional study found that the phosphate-regulating hormone fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) may be considered a biomarker for declining metabolic function linked to inflammation14.

In our study, both linear and non-linear relationships were observed. Overall, for substances showing a non-linear relationship, restricted cubic splines suggested a plateau effect (i.e., the higher the intake, the higher the incidence until a certain threshold, a point from which, even if the intake increases, the incidence globally does not vary much). Other epidemiological and experimental studies are needed to confirm and understand these dose-response relationships and underlying mechanisms.

In terms of public health implications, these results suggest that a reduction in food additive preservative exposure might be beneficial to type 2 diabetes prevention. As per the NOVA definition, food preservatives are not necessarily markers of ultra-processing (unlike other food additives such as artificial sweeteners or colours). The proportion of additive preservatives from ultra-processed foods in this population study was 34.6%. This probably contributed to the fact that results were still statistically significant after adjustment for the proportion of ultra-processed foods in the diet. However, this is not incompatible with the fact that some of these additives could contribute to explaining part of the association between ultra-processed foods and elevated risk of type 2 diabetes31,32. In practice, to reduce exposure to certain food additive preservatives such as sulfites or nitrites, for which the primary sources are specific food groups that, in addition, have no particular nutritional value (i.e., alcoholic beverages and processed meats, respectively), it is advisable to limit consumption of these food/beverage groups. However, several preservative food additives (e.g., potassium sorbate, calcium propionate, erythorbates) are ubiquitously used across many food groups, with a huge variability in ingredient lists depending on the brands for the same generic food item. This has two public health implications. First, in terms of recommendations to the public, this leads to the formulation of a general guideline aimed at limiting unnecessary preservative additives (choosing preservative-free alternatives whenever possible). This applies to all food groups, including processed and ultra-processed fruit and vegetables. For example, cooking at home and consuming only unprocessed or minimally processed fruit and vegetables would avoid around 25% of total food preservatives. Second, this reinforces the idea that measures targeting individuals (such as disseminating recommendations) will not be sufficient and that policy actions must be implemented in parallel to deeply transform the food supply and reduce exposure. This includes, for example, re-evaluating these additives and, if necessary, amending regulations on authorised substances and doses in order to better protect the population.

This study was based on a large and prospective cohort with highly detailed brand-specific 24HDRs along 14 years of follow-up (allowing time-dependent cumulative exposure assessment), thereby providing access to unique information on exposure to preservative food additives. However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the observational design does not allow causal interpretation for the studied associations based on this study alone. Residual confounding cannot be fully ruled out. Yet, multivariable models have been adjusted for a broad spectrum of potential confounding factors, thereby limiting the potential for bias. In particular, the food vectors of preservative additives were very diverse, encompassing contrasted nutritional profiles in terms of sugar, salt, fat and fibre content. For instance, for potassium sorbate, 26.3% of the intake came from fruit- and vegetable-based products while 21.6% came from fats and sauces. To limit as much as possible confounding bias linked to nutritional profiles of vector foods, all models were carefully adjusted for energy, saturated fats, sodium, dietary fibre, and sugar intakes. Second, as in other studies investigating health and diet in which people enroll voluntarily, this study included more women, with a higher educational level and healthier lifestyles than the general French population33,34. Therefore, caution is needed in generalising the findings. However, daily energy intake as well as proportion of energy by ultra-processed foods were similar in our population study compared to estimates from French nationally representative surveys, supporting the generalisability of our findings35,36. Ethnic representation race/ethnicity and religion were not available in the cohort due to a very restrictive ethical/legal regulation policy regarding the collection of these data in French epidemiological studies (specific authorisations needed). But overall, the geographical distribution of the cohort also matches that one of the general population in mainland France37. Nearly 95% of the French population has access to the Internet38, and we have shown that the study population was not limited to digitally fluent individuals (with about a quarter of participants reporting being inexperienced in terms of computer use)39. In aetiological studies, the diversity of the population is more important than the representativeness itself. In NutriNet-Santé, we aimed to have enough contrast between different categories of dietary exposures to conduct aetiological analyses, while accounting for a wide diversity of lifestyle profiles. Third, besides the characteristics of this population (more women, more highly educated, healthier lifestyles), combined with a young minimum age of enrollment (15+), potentially explains the observed low rate of ascertained type 2 diabetes (1.04% in this study against 5.6% people being medicated for diabetes in France40). Multisource case ascertainment combining participant declaration of a medical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by a physician with yearly registration of all medication use linked to the Vidal® database and the link with medico-administrative databases limited the risk of not detecting diagnosed cases. Moreover, nationally-representative French data estimated that only 1.7% adults had undiagnosed diabetes in France41, limiting the potential bias due to undiagnosed diabetes cases. Fourth, classification bias can never be totally excluded. However, the estimation of dietary intakes (nutrients and food additives) in NutriNet-Santé is among the most accurate globally in a cohort study. This is due to the high level of the 24HDRs used (3500 generic foods including the distinction between raw vs. cooked, organic vs. conventional etc. + commercial brands), and their update during follow-up. Dietary records were validated against interviews by a trained dietitian and against blood and urinary biomarkers for energy and key nutrients42,43,44. Nevertheless, specific exposure to preservative food additives was not part of these validation studies. Indeed, validation of additive exposure versus plasmatic or urinary biomarkers would be ideal; however, it can be challenging, and even impossible for most food additives, including most preservatives, due to the lack of measurable biomarkers, since most additives are metabolised into substances that are non-specific and/or ubiquitous in human biofluids. However, the accuracy of the qualitative and quantitative food additive exposure assessment of the NutriNet-Santé cohort represents an important strength of the study, thanks to detailed and repeated 24HDRs, linked to multiple food composition databases (OQALI, Open Food Facts, GNPD, EFSA, and GSFA), ad-hoc laboratory assays in food matrices, and dynamic matching to account for reformulations of industrial food items over time. Besides, intakes of food additive preservatives in this study mostly aligned with EFSA estimates. Using the Australian Food Composition Database to estimate naturally occurring acetic and citric acids was not optimal since country variations may occur, but French/European composition tables were not available or less complete for these natural sources. Similarly, quantifying the natural intake of some substances was impossible due to limited data (e.g., natural lecithins). Fifth, participants were invited to complete three 24HDRs every 6 months. Since the dietary record update was not mandatory, not all participants completed all records (in this case, their intakes of the previous period were kept). Therefore, we used updated intake values for each participant whenever available, making the most of all follow-up data, and systematically adjusting for the number of answered 24HDRs in all models. Next, it was not feasible to examine the association of several less frequently consumed preservative food additives with type 2 diabetes. However, these limited proportions of consumers reflected a low occurrence in the French market, indicating a reduced potential public health impact for these substances. Last, results were presented with and without adjustment for multiple testing by the False Discovery Rate method, with mostly stable results. If adjusting for multiple testing decreases type I error, it also increases type II error (risk of false negative) and may lead miss out on existing associations, which is why this adjustment is debated45. Besides, our results were supported by mechanistic plausibility, and all detected associations in our study showed HRs >1, strongly suggesting they were not going in random directions (which would have been the case if they were due to chance).

This large prospective cohort showed associations between exposure to several preservative food additives and higher type 2 diabetes incidence. These findings may have important public health implications given the ubiquitous use of preservatives in a wide range of foods and drinks. Although these results need to be confirmed by other epidemiological studies (since no causal conclusion can be drawn from a single observational study), they are consistent with experimental data suggesting adverse metabolic-related effects of several of these compounds. This calls for a re-evaluation of the safety of these additives and supports recommendations for consumers to favour fresh and minimally processed foods and limit superfluous additives whenever possible.

The study is registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03335644 and is conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB-Inserm) and the “Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés” (CNIL n°908450/n°909216). Each participant provides an electronic informed consent form before enrollment. This research does not result in discrimination in any kind to our participants.

This study relied on the data from the French NutriNet-Santé prospective e-cohort, launched in 2009, to investigate the association between nutrition and health46. Participants aged 15 and above are invited to participate in the study via a dedicated web-based platform (https://etude-nutrinet-sante.fr/) and regularly answer questionnaires on their dietary intakes, health, anthropometric47,48, physical activity49, lifestyle, and socio-demographic data50. Sex was self-reported by participants. No compensation was offered to the participants. The term “sex” is used throughout the study as we aimed to reflect the biological attribute rather than the gender shaped by social and cultural circumstances. There was no specific hypothesis of an interaction between studied preservatives and sex, thus results are presented overall. However, all cut-offs for exposure categories were sex-specific (and presented by sex in Supplementary Table 6).

Upon registration and every 6 months, participants were asked to complete in sequences of three validated42,43,44 web-based 24-h dietary records (24HDRs). At each period, 24HDRs were randomly assigned to three non-consecutive days over 2 weeks (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day, to account for variability in the diet across the week and the seasons). At all times throughout their assigned dietary record period, participants had access to a dedicated interface on the study website to declare all foods and beverages consumed during 24 h: three main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and any other eating occasion. Participants were asked to estimate portion sizes either by directly entering the weight consumed in the platform or by using validated photographs or usual containers51. The NutriNet-Santé food composition database (>3500 items) was used to estimate mean daily energy, alcohol, macro- and micro-nutrient intakes (including vitamins C and E)52. This database integrated all available data from the French national composition database (CIQUAL53), and further added information on additional components (e.g., food additive, trans fatty acids, etc.). These estimates included contributions from composite dishes using French recipes validated by food and nutrition professionals. The web-based questionnaires used in the study have been tested and validated against both in-person interviews by trained dietitians and urinary and blood markers42,43. In this analysis, we included participants having at least two 24-h dietary records during the first 2 years of follow-up. Participants who underreported their energy intake were excluded from the analyses and were identified using the method from Black, based on the original method developed by Goldberg et al.54,55. This method relies on the hypothesis that the maintenance of a stable body weight requires a balance between energy intake and expenditure. The equations developed by Black account for the reported dietary energy intake, basal metabolic rate (calculated using Schofield's equations), sex, age, height, weight, number of dietary records, physical activity level (PAL), and intra/inter-individual variability56. As recommended by Black, the intra-individual coefficients of variation for BMR and PAL were fixed at 8.5% and 15%, respectively. In addition, a PAL of 1.55 was used to reflect a “light” physical activity, which is assumed to be attained by healthy, normally active individuals living a sedentary lifestyle. Finally, some individuals identified as under-reporters of energy intakes using Black's method were not excluded if they also reported recent weight variations, adherence to weight-loss restrictive diets, or declared the consumptions entered in their dietary records as unusually low compared to their habitual diets. This ensured that flagged under-reporters have true incoherent reporting, and must be excluded. Although their exclusion may limit the generalisability of the findings, it was necessary to avoid important exposure classification bias.

In this study, 23,098 participants (corresponding to 17.2% of the subjects) were considered under-energy reporters and were excluded from the study. This proportion of under-reporters is common, for instance, in the nationally representative INCA 3 study conducted in 2016 by the French Food Safety Agency, 18% of adult participants were identified as under-reporters using the Black method35.

Several quality control operations were performed to account for over-reporting. Limitations in the online tool were set when participants reported the quantities of food consumed, aiming to alert them that the number they were about to enter was potentially an outlier, thereby encouraging double-checking and correction. Later on, during the data cleaning process, limitations were set per food category within one eating episode and per record for quantities; for instance, limitations for fruits were set for 3000 grams/day, 1500 grams/day for fish, 2000 grams/day for yoghurts, etc. These limitations are based on the 99th percentile of energy intake and are updated every 10,000 new dietary records added to the cohort if more than 10% of reported food items had outliers, then the full record was excluded. Otherwise, values were corrected to the maximum authorised values or standardised. In this study, 54 participants (corresponding to 0.04% of the subjects) were considered over-energy reporters and were excluded from the analyses.

Participants' intakes of naturally occurring acetic and citric acids, nitrites, nitrates, and sulfites were quantified using multiple sources (see the Methods on Preservative Food Additive Intakes).

Assessment of food additive intake in the NutriNet-santé cohort through brand-specific data of the 24HDRs has been previously described57. Each industrial food item consumed and reported in a specific dietary record was matched against three databases to assess the presence of any food additive: OQALI, a national database whose management has been entrusted to the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE) and the French food safety authority (ANSES) to characterise the quality of the food supply (https://www.oqali.fr/); Open Food Facts, an open collaborative database containing millions of food products marketed worldwide (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/); and the Mintel Global New Products Database (GNPD), an online database of innovative food products in the world (https://www.mintel.com). In a second step, the dose of food additive contained in each food item was estimated based on (1) ad hoc laboratory assays quantifying additives in specific food items (n = 2677 food-additive pairs analysed), (2) doses in generic food categories provided by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), or (3) generic doses from the Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA)58. Dynamic matching was applied, meaning that products were matched date-to-date: the date of consumption of each food or beverage declared by each participant was used to match the product to the closest composition data available, thus accounting for potential reformulations.

The 80 preservative food additives listed in the Codex General Standard for Food Additives database59 or UK Food Standard Agency60 were eligible for the present study. However, the occurrence of some of them was very low in the French/European markets, thus the proportion of consumers was null; their list is provided in the footnote to Tables 2 and 3. We decided to include as food additive preservatives both preservatives per se as defined by Regulation (EC) No 1333/20086 and antioxidant food additives, as both prevent the spoilage of food (food additive antioxidants preserving food via an antioxidant mode of action). In this paper, the term “preservative food additives” includes both “preservative non-antioxidant food additives” and “preservative antioxidant food additives”. Some preservative food additives possess additional key properties (e.g., some emulsifiers). All food additives with preservative properties are included in the present paper. We summed individual preservative food additives with similar chemical structures into the following groups: total sorbates (European codes E200, E202, E203), total benzoates (E210, E211, E212), total sulfites (E220, E221, E222, E223, E224, E225, E228), total nitrites (E249, E250), total nitrates (E251, E252), total acetates (E260, E261, E262, E263), total propionates (E280, E281, E282), total ascorbates (E300, E301, E302, E304), total tocopherols (E306, E307, E307b, E307c), total erythorbates (E315, E316), total butylates (E319, E320, E321), total citrates (E330, E332, E333), and total EDTA (E385, E386).

The strength of our methodology relies on the precise qualitative assessment of additive exposure, i.e., the presence/absence of a specific preservative food additive in the food consumed. This unique level of detail is permitted by the fact that commercial names/brands of industrial products consumed were collected and matched with Open Food Facts, OQALI, and GNPD databases, providing the ingredient list and thus, the presence of the specific food additive, at the time when the product was consumed. Thus, we only attribute a non-null dose of a specific additive to a given product declared by a participant if this specific product contains this specific additive. Then, the quantitative assessment of the doses of additives in the products that contain a specific additive is challenging since manufacturers are not compelled to declare this information on the packaging. Hence, the 3-step method was used to assess doses in our cohort. In all, in the framework of the ADDITIVES project, we performed 2677 quantified analyses, corresponding to a total of 61 food additives in 196 different (generic) food items. “Pairs” (i.e., a specific additive in a specific food vector) selected for laboratory assays corresponded to the most frequently consumed and most emblematic commercial food/beverage items for a given additive. Specifically, for preservative food additives, we had access to 1138 laboratory quantified analyses corresponding to 58 preservative food additives (E200, E202, E203, E210, E211, E212, E220, E221, E222, E223, E224, E225, E228, E234, E235, E239, E242, E249, E250, E251, E252, E260, E261, E262, E263, E280, E281, E282, E285, E290, E300, E301, E302, E304, E306, E307, E307b, E307c, E310, E315, E316, E319, E320, E321, E322, E325, E326, E330, E332, E333, E334, E338, E385, E386, E392, E472c, E942, E1105) in 128 (generic) food items (several commercial brands were tested per food item, e.g., in the case of milk chocolate, milk chocolate with nuts, creamy desserts, omega-3 enriched margarines, sausages, jams, chocolate mousse…). In addition to the assays carried out by certified laboratories, which were sent to us by the consumer association UFC Que Choisir, we contacted two companies (Mérieux & Eurofins) and the Direction Générale de la Consommation, de la Concurrence et de la Répression des Fraudes (DGCCRF) to carry out these assays. Only the additives listed in their catalogue could be measured.

If data were unavailable from this source, EFSA and GSFA doses were only applied if the specific food item contained the specific food additive in its ingredient list. We used 3122 preservative food additive data from EFSA (data available online in each EFSA Opinion + transmission of specific information by EFSA following an official Public Access to Document request PAD 2020/077), related to 46 preservative food additives present in 977 food categories. EFSA collects much information from manufacturers related to their specific commercial products, but for confidentiality reasons, only transfers information for generic food items or food groups (no brand-specific data). As regards GSFA, we used 5149 preservative food additive data concerning 42 preservative food additives coming from 226 food categories. As for EFSA, data from GSFA are not brand-specific but relate to generic food items or food categories (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Overall, quantitative dose data from ad hoc assays and from databases were similar in magnitude (e.g., for food additive potassium sorbate (E202) in the brand-specific pre-packed carrot salad that we selected: laboratory assay = 0.987 mg/100 g vs. 1 mg/100 g in the EFSA database for the corresponding generic food item), which was not surprising since EFSA doses for instance correspond to an average of laboratory assay data received by the Agency from EU member states, manufacturers and various contributors.

Food additive sulfites are present in many foods and drinks exempted from mandatory nutritional/ingredient declaration (e.g., wines or vinegar), making it sometimes impossible to determine which specific sulfite additive was used. Therefore, in this study, specific food additive codes (E220-E228) were used when the information was available on the packaging, i.e., for food items with mandatory ingredient declaration. The total sulfite variable accounts for all sulfite additives, i.e., both from foods and drinks with a mandatory ingredient list and from other food items with added sulfite (unspecified code). This strategy was established to avoid counting twice the same dose of sulfite (e.g., wine with declared ingredients).

In order to adjust for intake from non-additive sources of a given substance, whenever composition data were available:

Participants' intake of naturally occurring acetic and citric acids was quantified using the Australian Food Composition Database61, which has been matched to the NutriNet-Santé food composition database for this specific study.

The methodology used to quantify intakes from non-food additive sources of nitrites and nitrates in foods and beverages has been previously described3,62,63. Briefly, food-originated nitrites and nitrates were determined by food category using EFSA's concentration levels for natural sources and contamination from agricultural practices7. The publicly available data from the French official regional sanitary control of tap water was used to estimate intakes via water consumption by region of residence64, via a municipality-specific merging according to the NutriNet-Santé participants' postal code, as well as a dynamic temporal merge according to the year of dietary records.

Participants' intakes of naturally occurring and food additive sulfites were quantified using the corresponding EFSA Opinion7 and matching to the NutriNet-Santé database for this study.

Intakes of non-food additive dietary vitamins C and E were computed from the NutriNet-Santé food composition database52.

A multi-source approach was used to detect incident type 2 diabetes cases. Throughout follow-up, participants could report any health-related events, medical treatments, and examinations via the health questionnaires every 6 months or, at any time, directly via the health interface of their profile. Besides, the NutriNet-Santé cohort was linked to the national health insurance system database to collect additional information regarding medical treatments and consultations, and to the French national mortality registry to identify the occurrence and cause of death. We did not perform ad hoc biochemical assessment. Participants were asked to declare major health events through the yearly health questionnaire, through a specific health check-up questionnaire every 6 months, or at any time through a specific interface on the study website. They were also asked to declare all currently taken medications and treatments via the check-up and yearly questionnaires. A search engine with an embedded exhaustive Vidal® drug database is used to facilitate medication data entry for the participants. Besides, our research team was the first in France to obtain authorisation by Decree in the Council of State (n°2013-175) to link data from our general population-based cohorts to medico-administrative databases of the National Health Insurance. Thus, data from the NutriNet-Santé cohort were linked yearly to these medico-administrative databases, providing detailed information about the reimbursement of medication and medical consultations. An incident type 2 diabetes case is detected when a participant has either reported the pathology at least twice or reported it once along with the use of a related medication.

All 1131 type 2 diabetes incident cases were primarily detected through the declaration by the participants of a type 2 diabetes diagnosed by a physician and/or diabetes medication use, in follow-up questionnaires. The questions were: “Have you been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (if yes, indicate the date of diagnosis)” and “Are you treated for type 2 diabetes?”. ATC codes considered for type 2 diabetes medication were A10AB01, A10AB03, A10AB04, A10AB05, A10AB06, A10AC01, A10AC03, A10AC04, A10AD01, A10AD03, A10AD04, A10AD05, A10AE01, A10AE02, A10AE03, A10AE04, A10AE05, A10AE30, A10BA02, A10BB01, A10BB03, A10BB04, A10BB06, A10BB07, A10BB09, A10BB12, A10BD02, A10BD03, A10BD05, A10BD07, A10BD08, A10BD10, A10BD15, A10BD16, A10BF01, A10BF02, A10BG02, A10BG03, A10BH01, A10BH02, A10BH03, A10BX02, A10BX04, A10BX07, A10BX09, A10BX10, A10BX11, A10BX12.

In addition to the abovementioned questions about the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or a medication report, two additional sources of confirmation were considered. First, linkage with the medico-administrative databases confirmed more than 80% of the cases surveyed (ICD-10 codes E11). Second, among participants who provided a blood sample at the clinical/biological examination, 85.3% of those with elevated fasting blood glucose (i.e., ≥1.26 g/L) had consistently reported a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or medication. However, elevated blood glucose without any declaration of type 2 diabetes diagnosis or treatment was not considered specific enough to classify the participant as a type 2 diabetes case.

Participants from the NutriNet-Santé cohort who completed at least two 24HDRs during their first 2 years of follow-up, those who were not under- or over-energy reporters, and who did not have any prevalent type 1 or 2 diabetes at enrollment were included in the analysis (flowchart of participants presented in Fig. 1). Baseline participants' characteristics were described as mean (SD) for quantitative variables and n (%) for qualitative variables for the overall population and per baseline sex-specific tertiles of total preservative food additives. A correlation matrix was generated to visualise the Spearman correlations between intakes of individual food additives (Supplementary Fig. 1). For each studied additive or group of additives, participants were categorised into lower, medium, and higher consumers defined as sex-specific tertiles if the additive was consumed by at least 66% of participants, or non-consumers, and consumers separated by the sex-specific median otherwise (cut-offs provided in Supplementary Table 6). The relationship between preservative food additive intake coded as categorical a cumulative time-dependent exposure and the incidence of type 2 diabetes were investigated using multivariable proportional hazard cause-specific Cox models with age as the time scale to account for the competing mortality risk during the follow-up period. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Participants contributed person-time to the models from their age at enrollment in the cohort (which corresponds to the completion of the first set of 24HDRs) until their age at the date of type 2 diabetes ascertainment, type 1 diabetes diagnosis, death, last contact, or 31 December 2023, whichever occurred first. A counting process structure was used with cumulative time-dependent dietary variables updated every 2 years. Exposure during a specific period was calculated using a weighted average of the most recent 2-year period and prior periods, thereby using all available dietary record data. The time-to-event data structure was used with time-dependent dietary variables updated every 2 years. Exposure during one period was computed using a weighted average of the most recent 2-year period and prior periods. Each period contained averaged food additive intakes from the available dietary records within each 2-year period. The maximum number of 2-year periods was seven, to cover the maximum follow-up period of 14 years. A cumulative exponential decay weighting scheme was used to attribute lower weights to recent periods and higher weights to more ancient ones, given the fact that physio-pathological mechanisms underlying potential causal associations between additive intake and diabetes onset are expected to take several years (food additive intake consumed the month before diagnosis is less likely to have caused diabetes onset than more ancient usual exposure). Thus, for instance, intake during period 3 (years 5–6 of follow-up) = [intake during period 1 (years 1–2) + intake during period 2 (years 3–4) / 2 + intake during period 3 (years 5–6) / 4] / (1 + 1/2 + 1/4). The same methodology was applied to all dietary data. Cut-offs for food additives were updated for each follow-up period and are provided in Supplementary Table 1. For incident cases, dietary data collected during periods after type 2 diabetes diagnosis were not accounted for.

For incident cases, dietary data collected during periods after type 2 diabetes diagnosis were not accounted for. The principal model was adjusted for age (time-scale), sex, baseline BMI, height, physical activity, smoking status, number of smoked cigarettes in pack-years, educational level, family history of diabetes, number of dietary records completed, time-dependent daily intakes of energy without alcohol, alcohol, saturated fats, sodium, fibre, sugars, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, red and processed meats or heme iron (for nitrites and nitrates models only). Missing values for covariates were handled by a multiple imputation approach using additive regression, followed by bootstrapping, and predictive mean matching (n = 20 imputed dataset) as implemented in the Hmisc R package (version 5.1-0)65. Specifically, the imputation model included a comprehensive set of predictors deemed relevant to the missing covariates. Variables were incorporated to capture the underlying relationships and patterns. The choice of predictors (i.e., age, sex, family history of diabetes, physical activity, incident type 2 diabetes, education level, smoking status, BMI, energy intake, and alcohol intake) was guided by their known or hypothesised associations with the variables containing missing values. Missing values were imputed for the following variables: physical activity level (13.59% of missing values), BMI (2.76%), height (2.76%), smoking status (0.29%), number of smoked cigarettes in pack years (0.30%), education level (0.96%), and family history of diabetes (0.31%).

Moreover, whenever relevant, models were adjusted for the intake of the corresponding substance coming from naturally occurring sources. Associations between intakes from these natural sources and type 2 diabetes incidence were also tested. The proportional hazard assumption was tested using the Schoenfeld residual method (Supplementary Fig. 2) implemented in the survival R package (version 3.5-8)66. Restricted cubic splines with three knots covering each food additive distribution: 27.5th, 72.5th and 95th percentiles (Supplementary Fig. 3)67 were employed to investigate potential non-linear dose-response associations. When the log-linearity assumption was not rejected (p for non-linearity ≥0.05 in the Restricted Cubic Splines models), the p for linear trend was retained (obtained by coding the exposure as an ordinal categorical variable 1, 2, 3). When the assumption of log-linearity was not met (p for non-linearity <0.05), it was not adapted to calculate a p for linear trend; thus, the likelihood ratio overall p value was retained (obtained by coding the exposure as a non-ordinal categorical variable and calculating the likelihood ratio test between models with and without the studied food additive exposure variable). We have tested the associations between food preservative additive exposures and hip fracture (i.e., outcome with no expected causal relationship) as a “negative outcome control model”. We tested the proportion of the association between ultra-processed food68 intake and type 2 diabetes incidence that was mediated by food additive preservatives found associated with diabetes in this study, using the CMAverse R package (version 0.1.0)69 and the same adjustment variables as the main model. Sensitivity analyses were tested based on the main model: additional mutual adjustment for other preservative food additives intakes except the studied one (continuous, mg/d) (model 1); additional adjustment for the baseline weight proportion of ultra-processed food intake (model 2); additional adjustment for the diagnosis and/or treatment for at least one prevalent metabolic disorder (i.e. cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia or hypertension) (model 3); additional adjustment for time-dependent intakes of total emulsifier and total artificial sweetener food additives (continuous, mg/d) (model 4) (these two categories of food additives have been associated with type 2 diabetes risk in NutriNet-Santé); additional adjustment for baseline intake of vitamin C (continuous, mg) and vitamin E (continuous, mg) from dietary supplements (model 5); additional adjustment for trans fatty acids intake (continuous, mg) (model 6); adjustment for PCA-derived dietary patterns rather than individual food groups (continuous, see Method for deriving dietary patterns by principal component analysis and corresponding factor loadings for determination of dietary patterns) (model 7); additional adjustment for time-dependent intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (continuous, g/d) and heme iron (continuous, mg/d) (model 8) (for preservative antioxidant food additives only, since antioxidant may counteract polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation by heme iron); follow-up starting at the end of the first 2-year period (model 9); without exclusion of under-reporters (model 10); use of marginal structural models with stabilised and truncated at 99th percentile inverse probability of treatment weighting as recommended by Young et al.70 (model 11); relaxing log-linearity assumption on covariates adding splines with the R package splines (version 4.3.3) (model 12). All statistical tests were two-sided, and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted with R version 4.3.3, except for the restricted cubic spline method, which was implemented with SAS version 9.467.

Dietary patterns were identified based on 20 food categories, using a principal component analysis conducted with the R package FactoMineR (version 2.8)71. The principal component analysis creates linear combinations (called principal components) of the initial set of variables, with the aim to group those that are correlated while explaining as much variation from the dataset as possible. We used the scree plot generated by the principal component analysis to select the retained principal components (with eigenvalues ≥ 2). For easier interpretation, we used the R “varimax” option to rotate the principal components orthogonally and maximise the independence of the retained principal components. The variable coefficients derived from the selected principal components are called factor loadings. A positive factor loading indicates a positive contribution of the variable to the principal component, whereas a negative factor loading indicates a negative contribution. For the interpretation of the two principal components selected, we considered the variables contributing the most to the component, i.e., with loading coefficients under −0.25 or over 0.25. We then label the principal components descriptively, based on the most contributing variables. Finally, we calculated an adherence score for each principal component and for each participant, using the food categories factor loadings to weigh the sum of all observed intakes. Thus, the adherence score measures a participant's diet conformity to the identified dietary pattern intake pattern. In the analyses of dietary patterns, we identified a healthy pattern (explaining 10.88% of the variance), which was characterised by higher intakes of fish and seafood, fruits, unsweetened soft drinks, vegetables, and wholegrains, along with lower intakes of sweetened soft drinks. In contrast, we identified a Western pattern (explaining 7.9% of the variance), which was characterised by higher intakes of fat and sauces, potatoes and tubers, and soups and broths.

Our understanding of the long-term behaviour of global climate and the Antarctic ice sheet relies heavily on the oxygen isotopic composition of marine calcite (δ18Ocalcite), which reflects a combination of ocean temperature and the amount of water stored in ice sheets. On the basis of δ18Ocalcite, the Antarctic ice sheet has been interpreted as extremely dynamic in the Oligocene, 34–23 million years ago. Yet, the proposed continental-scale ice volume changes are challenging to reproduce with models and may be overestimated owing to a larger influence of temperature on the deep-sea δ18Ocalcite than previously assumed. Here we present the first Oligocene record of orbital variability in deep ocean temperature based on benthic foraminiferal clumped isotope thermometry, a method affected only by temperature and independent of seawater chemistry. We find large, eccentricity-paced temperature variations of up to 4 °C, sufficient to explain the δ18Ocalcite cycles without requiring continental-scale ice volume changes. This finding is consistent with the simulated stability of the Antarctic ice sheet, highlighting the importance of robust independent temperature reconstructions. Our results show that the temperature in the deep Southern Ocean, and possibly globally, is highly sensitive to the seasonal distribution of insolation in an Oligocene-like climate state warmer than today.

The geological past provides the opportunity to assess the behaviour of the climate system and the long-term stability of the Antarctic ice sheet under atmospheric carbon dioxide levels close to, and exceeding, those projected for the end of this century1. Both the global mean climate state and the behaviour of ice sheets are commonly inferred from deep ocean oxygen isotope records obtained from the microscopic calcite shells of benthic organisms called foraminifera (hereafter δ18Ocalcite)2,3,4. However, owing to a multitude of overlying influences on deep ocean δ18Ocalcite, isolating specific aspects of the climate system, such as continental ice volume or deep ocean temperature, requires additional assumptions or constraints (ref. 5 and references therein).

In the Oligocene (34–23 million years ago, Ma) when atmospheric CO2 ranged between 350 and 800 ppm1, the Arctic was ice-free6, whereas Antarctic-proximal sedimentological records indicate the presence of a continental-sized Antarctic ice sheet7,8. On the basis of the occurrence of large (~0.5–1.0‰) fluctuations in deep ocean δ18Ocalcite records from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans9,10, Antarctic ice volume in the Oligocene has been interpreted to have fluctuated by 34–90% of the modern ice sheet volume at orbital periodicities of 40 and 110 thousand years (kyr)11,12,13,14. Crucially, the upper range of these estimates would imply that, at elevated atmospheric CO2 relative to pre-industrial levels1, the Antarctic ice sheet could enter a dynamical state similar to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets during the glacial–interglacial cycles of the Quaternary (the past 2.6 million years)15. Cyclical seaward advances and retreats of at least portions of the Antarctic ice sheet in the Oligocene are supported by ice-proximal sedimentological evidence7,16. However, ice sheet models are unable to reproduce the largest variations in ice volume interpreted from δ18Ocalcite with a range of CO2 even larger than the current best estimates of Oligocene atmospheric CO2 (refs. 1,17,18,19). This is because strong stabilizing feedbacks limit ice sheet retreat from ice surface melting, and a topography without deep subglacial basins reduces the retreat of marine-based ice17. These conflicting lines of evidence currently obscure our understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet behaviour on orbital time scales.

A more stable Antarctic ice volume, as indicated by models, could be explained if the documented Oligocene variations in δ18Ocalcite were driven primarily by factors other than continental ice volume. Benthic foraminiferal δ18Ocalcite reflects both the temperature and the isotopic composition of seawater (δ18Osw), with the latter influenced globally by the volume and isotopic composition of continental ice, and to a lesser extent, regionally, by variations in surface ocean salinity at sites of deep-water formation5,20. Owing to the dominant influence of temperature, ice volume estimates from δ18Ocalcite require either assumptions of relatively constant deep ocean temperatures21,22 or independent temperature reconstructions.

Here, we derive independent estimates of temperature using clumped isotope thermometry (Δ47)23 to test for orbital-scale deep ocean temperature variability during the interval spanning 28.2–27.2 Ma, which encompasses the largest δ18Ocalcite cycles of the Oligocene9,10 (Fig. 1). Our aim is to test whether deep ocean temperatures vary on eccentricity timescales and, if so, to determine the proportion of the δ18Ocalcite signal driven by temperature variability. Δ47 is independent of δ18Osw and seawater elemental ratios, which affect the traditional trace element-based paleothermometers such as foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios23,24, and it does not appear to be measurably affected by organism biology23,25,26. Because of their microscopic size, the application of Δ47 to foraminifera has until recently been limited by the requirement of large sample amounts (more than 10 mg)27. Advances in analytical techniques28,29, however, have increased the scope of possible applications of this proxy (for example, refs. 30,31,32). Here, we present the first deep ocean temperature record derived by clumped isotopes that resolves the high-amplitude 110-kyr δ18Ocalcite cycles observed in the Oligocene. The 110-kyr cycles (that is, the combined 95-kyr and 125-kyr eccentricity components) reflect the shortest periodicity of changes in the shape of Earth's orbit, which, in association with other orbital parameters, controls the amount and seasonal distribution of incoming solar radiation (Fig. 1). Our independent deep ocean temperature record comes from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 699 in the subpolar Southern Ocean at a present-day water depth of 3,705 m (ref. 33) (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). An orbital chronology was developed using sediment colour reflectance and δ18Ocalcite records (Extended Data Figs. 2–4 and Supplementary Table 1). A total of 1,082 individual benthic foraminiferal Δ47 measurements from 99 discrete samples (Extended Data Figs. 5–8 and Supplementary Table 2) were binned into 32 temperature data points (Methods) that trace the large δ18Ocalcite cycles characterizing the mid-Oligocene9,10 (Fig. 1), with an average temporal resolution of 28 kyr (Fig. 1). This binning is necessary because, with the small-aliquot approach applied here, the precision of individual Δ47 measurements is insufficient for paleoclimatic interpretation (Methods). The fidelity of our Δ47 binning is confirmed by good agreement with a moving window Gaussian filter, averaging temperature with a resolution of 25 kyr (Methods; Extended Data Fig. 8).

In b, δ18Ocalcite is shown both for all samples (continuous purple line) and averaged in the same way as the Δ47 record (purple dots) to obtain the Site 699 record of δ18Osw (‰VSMOW) (d). In a and d, the data are presented as mean values with light and dark envelopes in a and stippled and continuous error bars in d representing the 95% and 68% confidence intervals, respectively, derived from 20–46 measurements sourced from two to five individual sediment samples (Methods; Supplementary Table 2). e, The cycles in Earth's orbital eccentricity57 with higher values indicating the times of greater southern hemisphere summer insolation during precession maxima. Black and white bars indicate the magnetic polarity stratigraphy at Site 699 (ref. 58). The yellow bands mark the 110-kyr eccentricity cycles captured at Site 699. The horizontal bars in a, b and d reflect the age ranges of the adjoining two to five samples combined for calculating the mean temperature and δ18Osw values (Main and Methods). The inset map shows the modern location of ODP Sites 699, 1264 and 1218. Map generated with Ocean Data View59.

The δ18Ocalcite data obtained for each sample as a co-product of the Δ47 measurements (Methods) provide a higher-resolution record that reproduces the large eccentricity-paced δ18Ocalcite cycles observed at other sites9,10 (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 2). The δ18Ocalcite data were additionally binned in the same way as the Δ47 data and combined with their corresponding temperature data points, to extract the residual variability in δ18Osw (Methods; Fig. 1).

Mid-Oligocene bottom water temperatures at Site 699 varied between 4.3 °C (±1.8 °C) and 10.8 °C (±1.5 °C) (uncertainty reported at 68% confidence intervals; Methods) within the study interval and averaged 7.2 °C ± 1.4 °C (Fig. 1), substantially warmer than the present-day bottom water temperature of 0 °C at this site34 (Extended Data Fig. 1). When compared with reconstructions based on δ18Ocalcite for the study interval, our Δ47-derived mean deep ocean temperature is significantly warmer than the 1.4 °C estimate of Rohling et al.13 but within error of the 5.6 °C estimate of Cramer et al.35. Our reconstructed temperature is close to the mean deep ocean temperature of 6.5–7 °C obtained from Mg/Ca thermometry for the interval 28–26 Ma (ref. 35), although the absolute temperatures derived from Mg/Ca are highly dependent on calibration choices (for example, refs. 14,36), and also match with clumped isotope-based estimates for the mean Oligocene temperature in the deep North Atlantic (7.7 °C ± 1.1 °C between 33.5 and 24.4 Ma)37. The overall deep ocean warmth reconstructed for the mid-Oligocene furthermore corresponds well with the reconstructed contemporaneous sea surface temperatures seasonally exceeding 10 °C at sites in the Southern Ocean38 and on the Antarctic margin39,40,41, the likely source region for the bottom water bathing Site 699 (refs. 42,43).

The calculated δ18Osw values average 0.57‰ ± 0.34‰ within the study interval. If reflecting only continental ice volume, this value would indicate a substantially larger ice volume than at present. The direct translation of δ18Osw into continental ice volume (for example, ref. 12), however, is complicated by the additional influences on δ18Osw, including δ18Oice of the ice sheet and regional, salinity-related changes in δ18Osw. Large interbasin salinity gradients have been reconstructed for the deep ocean in the mid-Pliocene44, highlighting that this factor must be considered when interpreting δ18Osw, especially in climate states warmer than today. We note that both the absolute temperature and δ18Osw would be lower by around 1.5 °C and 0.35‰ respectively, with alternative clumped isotope calibrations45,46 (Methods). This difference in absolute temperatures, however, does not exceed uncertainty (Methods), and, crucially, the relative changes in temperature and their relationship with observed variations in δ18Ocalcite remain independent of our calibration choice.

At Site 699, sediment properties (Methods), δ18Ocalcite and bottom water temperature show a cyclicity with a dominant 110-kyr (short eccentricity) pacing throughout the studied interval (28.2 to 27.2 Ma; Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 4). The studied interval captures a total of six 110-kyr cycles (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 9), with the youngest three being the largest 110-kyr cycles of the Oligocene and corresponding to up to 1‰ changes in δ18Ocalcite, globally9,10 (Fig. 1). In the South Atlantic, these δ18Ocalcite cycles have been interpreted to reflect changes in Antarctic ice volume equivalent to 100% of the modern East Antarctic ice sheet11. By contrast, our record shows distinct temperature changes of ±2.8–4.4 °C (±1.4 °C) associated with each of the largest δ18Ocalcite cycles (Δδ18Ocalcite ± 0.6–1‰) (Fig. 1). This amplitude of eccentricity (110-kyr)-paced temperature variations in the mid-Oligocene is slightly larger than 2–3 °C obliquity (40-kyr)-paced temperature variations reconstructed with Mg/Ca thermometry for the late Oligocene deep North Atlantic Ocean12. With an empirical relationship between δ18Ocalcite and temperature of approximately −0.22‰ per degree Celsius20,47, our reconstructed changes in deep ocean temperature alone are in principle sufficient to explain the δ18Ocalcite cycles observed at our site, without requiring continental-scale changes in Antarctic ice volume (Fig. 1). Our data clearly demonstrate that deep ocean temperatures can exhibit a high degree of variability on orbital timescales (Fig. 2), and therefore, δ18Ocalcite cannot be interpreted to reflect δ18Osw (and ice volume) changes in the absence of independent constraints on temperature. This suggests that the previous assumptions that led to the interpretation of continental-scale ice volume fluctuations based on Oligocene δ18Ocalcite alone need revising11.

a,b, The largest 110-kyr cycles in the younger part of our record from Site 699, for which the age model is best constrained, showing eccentricity maxima matching maxima in bottom water temperatures (a) and the absence of consistent cyclical changes in δ18Osw (‰VSMOW) (b), suggesting no orbital variability in Antarctic ice volume. c–e, The results in a and b are consistent with Oligocene ice sheet model simulations17 showing minimal ice volume variability between 500 ppm (c) and 840 ppm (d) atmospheric CO2 due to melting in coastal regions being compensated by increased ice thickness inland at higher CO2 (e). The yellow and purple dots in a and b indicate values included in the eccentricity maxima groups for the purpose of testing statistical significance of peak versus background values (Methods; Extended Data Fig. 10). In a and b, the data are presented as mean values with horizontal stippled lines representing the 68% confidence intervals of the proxy data derived from 20–46 measurements sourced from two to five individual sediment samples (Methods; Supplementary Table 2). The vertical lines reflect the age ranges of the adjoining two to five samples combined for calculating the mean temperature and δ18Osw values (Main and Methods). The eccentricity values are from ref. 57. Panels c–e adapted from ref. 17 under a Creative Commons license CC BY 4.0.

The large analytical uncertainty of our residual δ18Osw data prevents detailed interpretations of this signal, leaving open the possibility of some ice volume-related changes in δ18Osw. Nonetheless, we do not see any evidence for systematic, large-scale changes in δ18Osw on orbital timescales, as it would be expected if cyclical, continental-scale, waxing and waning of the Antarctic ice sheet was the primary driver behind the δ18Ocalcite record (Methods; Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 10). Given the large deep ocean temperature changes we observe, the δ18Ocalcite cycles could only accommodate for continental-scale fluctuations in ice volume—equivalent to melting the modern East Antarctic ice sheet, resulting in ~59 m of sea-level change14—if large changes in salinity and/or in δ18Oice were counteracting the ice volume component in the δ18Osw signal (Fig. 1). The δ18Oice varies with ice sheet size owing to the effects of changing altitude and transport distance, but these effects are of the opposing sign, and they would probably be insufficient to offset large-scale ice volume changes48. The scale of salinity-related change in δ18Osw in the study area required to offset continental-scale ice volume changes would have to approach the difference observed between deep Atlantic and Pacific water masses in the Pliocene44. Further, any regional salinity-related change in δ18Osw would need to be compensated for by opposing signals elsewhere in the ocean to maintain mass balance, which may be hard to achieve given the volume of deep water that was probably formed in the Southern Ocean. For these reasons, it seems unlikely that bottom water salinity at Site 699 changed to the extent required to fully mask the large ice volume-related changes proposed in earlier studies. Hence, the most parsimonious explanation to account for the mid-Oligocene eccentricity cycles captured in the deep ocean oxygen isotope records is that they were primarily driven by temperature, with possible small variations in ice volume not exceeding the lower end estimates from Oligocene sea-level change reconstructions13,14.

The warmest deep ocean temperatures at our site coincide with eccentricity maxima, within age model uncertainty (Methods; Figs. 1 and 2 and Extended Data Fig. 10). The magnitude of the temperature and δ18Ocalcite changes appears to be proportional to the degree of change in eccentricity, with intervals of less pronounced eccentricity, such as between 28.1 and 27.9 Ma, corresponding to more muted temperature and δ18Ocalcite variability (Fig. 1). Hence, our new temperature reconstructions suggest a strong response of deep ocean temperature in the Oligocene to orbital variations in insolation (Fig. 2).

The deep ocean temperature reflects the surface temperature in areas of deep-water formation27, which, for Site 699, and much of the global ocean during the Oligocene, were most probably located in the Southern Ocean42,43. Our record could thus reflect regional eccentricity-paced temperature variations in the surface ocean surrounding Antarctica, with implications for ocean overturning and associated heat and carbon sequestration in the deep ocean. Alternatively, the eccentricity-paced deep ocean temperature variations could reflect switches between two different water masses bathing Site 699, characterized by different temperatures, akin to the Circumpolar Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water today (Extended Data Fig. 1). Similar temperature reconstructions from other sites are needed to distinguish between these scenarios. Regardless, given its location in the deep Southern Ocean, Site 699 is probably representative for a substantial portion of the global deep ocean, indicating a strong eccentricity imprint on ocean circulation and heat distribution during the middle Oligocene.

If the 110-kyr eccentricity-paced δ18Ocalcite cycles observed in the deep ocean are dominated globally by temperature changes on the order of ~3–4 °C (Fig. 1), this may offer a way to reconcile ice sheet modelling, suggesting a relatively stable Oligocene Antarctic ice volume, with the deep ocean δ18Ocalcite records. In the Oligocene, the Antarctic ice sheet was probably not marine-based as it is today due to elevated bedrock topography17,49 (Fig. 2). The warm surface ocean temperatures proximal to Antarctica39,40,41 would have furthermore prevented an extensive marine-based ice sheet from forming. Models suggest that a land-based ice sheet is much less susceptible to large-scale melting compared with marine-based ice sheets, even under high CO2 concentrations (>1,000 ppm), resulting from self-stabilizing feedbacks caused by surface-elevation mass balance and albedo17,19,49,50,51,52,53,54,55. In model simulations that incorporate data-constrained Oligocene bedrock topographies for Antarctica, the ice volume loss obtained for a CO2 change from 500 to 840 ppm, in line with Oligocene estimates1, is negligible17 (<0.1%) (Fig. 2). For simulations with a low concentration of atmospheric CO2 of 280 ppm, which is lower than proxy reconstructions1, the ice volume change is equivalent to 25% of the modern-day ice volume17,19. In these simulations, melting in Antarctic coastal areas is counteracted by the increased ice thickness in the interior due to more abundant snowfalls in a warmer climate (Fig. 2). Therefore, changes in the spatial extent of the Antarctic ice sheet7,16 may not necessarily correspond to large ice volume changes (Fig. 2) and can explain changes in deep ocean temperatures decoupled from Antarctic ice volume41,56. Our work thus supports a very different response of the middle Oligocene Antarctic ice sheet to orbital variations compared with the ice sheets of the Quaternary at substantially lower levels of atmospheric CO2.

Our new data show temperature fluctuations in the deep ocean of up to 4 °C consistent with a mostly terrestrial Oligocene Antarctic ice sheet between 28 and 27 Ma that may have responded to orbital forcing by changes in its spatial extent but with relatively small variations in ice volume. This finding contradicts previous interpretations of δ18Ocalcite fluctuations being the expression of continental-scale glacial–interglacial cycles in Antarctic ice volume. The large, eccentricity-paced (110 kyr) deep water temperature swings we reconstruct for the Southern Ocean (Figs. 1 and 2) suggest a climate state that is highly sensitive to external forcing during the middle Oligocene. At this time, the ocean, rather than ice sheet volume, was the primary component of the climate system mediating and responding to orbital variability in insolation. This may be an inherent feature of a warmer-than-present-day climate state such as the Oligocene. Our findings stress the importance of robust deep ocean temperature reconstructions and the need for more such records to reconcile our understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet from both the geological record and model simulations, and to understand the behaviour of the climate system in an Oligocene-like state characterized by the unipolar glaciation on Antarctica.

ODP Site 699 (51°32.537′ S, 30°40.619′ W) was drilled as a single hole (Hole 699A) in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean at a water depth of 3,705 m, underneath the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and Circumpolar Deep Water, and is today bathed by Antarctic Bottom Water33,60 (Extended Data Fig. 1). The paleolatitude of Site 699 in the Oligocene was very close to the modern61. The high abundance of siliceous microfossils in studied cores 699A-20H and 21H indicate a high productivity regime typical of the ACC region already in the Oligocene. This is corroborated by micropaleontological evidence62 indicating that, since the early Oligocene, the Atlantic Ocean south of 50 °S was under the influence of the ACC and had a polar oceanographic regime.

Sediments recovered at Site 699 possess a clear characteristic remanent magnetization, determined by means of shipboard continuous measurements on the archive halves and integrated by onshore analysis of discrete samples58. The newly generated diatom biostratigraphy supports the magnetic polarity correlation of cores 699A-20H and 699A-21H within subchrons C9n–C10n. This assignment is based on the occurrence of the following marker taxa: Rocella vigilans, Kozloviella minor and Cestodiscus trochus. Especially K. minor is reported from other Southern Ocean deep-sea holes for which diatom biostratigraphy is available, including ODP Holes 748B and 749A63. The best constrained Southern Ocean record of this species is from Hole 748B, where K. minor occurs within a narrow interval spanning Chron C10n. To refine this initial biomagnetostratigraphic framework, red–green–blue (RGB) data was extracted from the core images (Extended Data Fig. 2). We corrected the RGB data for overexposure in the centre of the images and underexposure at the edges of the images. The correction does not considerably change the main patterns in cyclicity. Please note that the main cyclicity in the core images is not an artefact of uneven lighting conditions but a true feature of the sediment cores. The resulting individual red, green, and blue records, were combined into a combined RGB record. High values in the combined RGB signal visually correspond to the lighter coloured strata, which at Site 699 are calcium carbonate dominated. At other South Atlantic and Pacific Ocean sites3,10,64, elevated levels of calcium carbonate (light-coloured sediments, RGB highs) correspond to eccentricity-paced productivity maxima that occur during an eccentricity minimum. The RGB and δ18Ocalcite records both exhibit the dominant 110-kyr cyclicity but are not always perfectly aligned. To better visually align the high-amplitude mid-Oligocene ~110-kyr cycles identified at Sites 699, 1218, and 1264, we made a small correction to the Site 1264 eccentricity-tuned age model by changing the tie point ‘293.52 adjusted revised metres composite depth (armcd) − 27.511 Ma' into ‘293.30 armcd − 27.511 Ma'. Both RGB and δ18Ocalcite were considered when selecting our final tuning tie points (Supplementary Table 1). This tuning approach was independently validated by (1) the convincing alignment (within error) between the magnetostratigraphic reversals from Site 699A with those of the Westerhold et al.3 astronomically calibrated time scales (Extended Data Fig. 3), (2) the identification of between five and six precession forced cycles in the RGB record for some of the best-expressed ~110-kyr cycle (that is, the combined 95- and 125-kyr components of eccentricity) and (3) the coherency in the benthic foraminiferal δ18O stratigraphy from Site 699A and independently astronomically age-calibrated δ18Ocalcite records from Walvis Ridge Site 1264, and equatorial Pacific Ocean Site 1218 (on the revised age model of Westerhold et al.3; Fig. 1).

Our fine-tuned astronomically calibrated age model for cores 699A-20H and 21H spans the 26.8- to 28.2-Ma interval and is based on 11 eccentricity based (La2011_ecc3L solution57) tie points and three magnetostratigraphic tie point (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1).

We note that the results of this study are independent from the adopted tuning approach as we used δ18Ocalcite from Site 699 and Westerhold et al.3 to guide our sampling strategy and obtain temperature data for the targeted δ18Ocalcite cycles.

The samples from cores 699A-20H and 21H are clay-rich and unlithified with generally well-preserved benthic foraminifera (Extended Data Figs. 5–7). Benthic foraminiferal abundance fluctuates substantially through the studied interval, with several intervals characterized by very low abundances. Levels of low foraminiferal abundance are at 182.6–182.8 and 192.1–192.6 meters below sea floor (mbsf). Benthic foraminiferal abundance can be lower owing to an increase in sedimentation rates, a drop in paleoenvironmental oxygen conditions or carbonate dissolution65,66. Based only on benthic foraminifera abundance variability in the samples, some degree of dissolution at discrete levels in the record cannot be ruled out. However, the generally good foraminiferal preservation through the record does not suggest major dissolution, as supported by scanning electron microscope images of specimens (Extended Data Figs. 5–7) taken from light (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6) and dark (Extended Data Fig. 7) sediment intervals (Extended Data Fig. 2).

The samples were washed over a 63-μm mesh-size sieve with tap water and oven-dried at 40 °C. A total of 99 samples were picked for clumped isotope analysis from 179.9 to 195.45 mbsf. Benthic foraminifera were picked from the size fraction >150 μm after dry sieving. Benthic foraminifera were grouped according to taxonomy and ecology depending on species and genus abundance as follows: (1) Cibicidoides spp. (composed of C. mundulus, C. eocaenus, C. havanensis, C. grimsdalei, C. micrus, C. brady, C. lamontdoherty and C. dickersoni); (2) Oridorsalis umbonatus; (3) Epifaunals (composed of Laticarinina pauperata, Gyroidinoides gyrardanus, G. planulatus, G. depressus, Nuttallides umbonifera, Alabamina weddellensis, Epistominella exigua, Anomalinoides rubiginosus and A. spissiformis); (4) Nodosarids (Nodosaria spp., Lenticulina spp., Lagenidae and Polymorphinids), Pleurostomellids (Pleurostomella spp.) and Stilostomellids (Stilostomella spp.); and (5) Infaunals (Pullenia bulloides, P. quinqueloba, Melonis barleanuum, Nonion havanense, Nonionella spp. and Globocassidulina subglobosa). For several samples, this distinction into different species groups was not possible owing to extremely low foraminifera abundance, requiring all found specimens to be combined for measurements (samples 699A-20H-2, 20–22 cm to 699A-20H-2, 42–44 cm; samples 699A-20H-3, 5–7 cm to 699A-20H-3, 27–29 cm; samples 699A-21H-3, 10.5–13 cm to 699A-21-3. 50–53 cm). Foraminifera were cracked between glass plates and sonicated in deionized water (3 × 10–20 s) and methanol (1 × 5 s). At the end of the cleaning procedure, the test fragments were rinsed until the solute was no longer cloudy and oven-dried at 50 °C. Individual measurements from multiple adjacent samples were combined to calculate average Δ47 values, covering the minimum and maximum depth ranges of 10 and 30 cm, respectively, except between 182.21–182.67 mbsf (46 cm) and 186.45–187.05 mbsf (60 cm) where several samples were barren of foraminifera.

The clumped isotope paleothermometer relies on the thermodynamic bounding of 13C and 18O isotopes in calcite molecules as a function of ambient temperature and is unaffected by the δ18Osw (ref. 23). The influence of non-thermal controls on Δ47, such as pH and the biological partitioning of isotopes in calcite, does not appear resolvable67,68,69. The low natural abundance of 13C–18O bonds within carbonate ions demands large sample sizes to produce data with the precision required for palaeoclimate applications. Here, we used small (~85 μg) carbonate samples and obtained the necessary precision by averaging a mean of 33 Δ47 measurement values (minimum 20 to maximum 46) from neighbouring samples29,70. The Δ47 measurements were performed at the Farlab, University of Bergen, on two Thermo Scientific MAT 253 Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer connected to Thermo Scientific Kiel IV carbonate preparation devices. The analytical method used here is extensively described in Modestou et al.30 and Leutert et al.71. We used three carbonate standards (ETH 1, 2, 3), which differ in bulk isotopic composition and ordering state to correct for Δ47 scale compression and to transfer results to the Intercarb-Carbon Dioxide Equilibrium Scale (I-CDES)72. An additional standard (International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)-C272) was not used for corrections but instead used to check the fidelity of the correction procedure (0.639 ± 0.027‰ (1 s.d.); n = 850). All analytical sessions (~23 h each) included approximately equal numbers of carbonate standards and samples. External reproducibilities (1 s.d.) in Δ47 of the four carbonate standards after correction were between 0.027 and 0.028‰.

Oxygen and carbon stable isotopes were obtained from the same groups/specimens as a co-product of Δ47 measurements. Carbonate δ18O and δ13C values are reported relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite scale (VPDB) and were corrected with the same carbonate standards (ETH 1–3), using the values reported by Bernasconi et al.73, including a scale correction. The δ18O and δ13C values of all the standards have external reproducibilities (1 s.d.) better than or equal to 0.07‰ (δ18O) and 0.03‰ (δ13C).

To complement the stable isotope record obtained as a co-product of Δ47 measurements, stable isotopes were additionally measured on several monospecific samples of Cibicidoides (C. munduls/C. eocaenus) for the depth interval 193.6–194.1 mbsf and 194.7–195.0 mbsf at 10-cm resolution on a Thermo Scientific MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer connected to a Thermo Scientific Kiel IV carbonate preparation device at Farlab, University of Bergen. Carrara Marble (in-house CM12) was used as a working standard, and the values are reported relative to VPDB, calibrated using National Bureau of Standards (NBS) standards 18 and 19. External reproducibility in CM12 was better than or equal to 0.02‰ (δ13C) and 0.05‰ (δ18O) (1 s.d.) over the analysis interval.

Owing to the large number of ‘replicate' measurements required, Δ47 values from multiple 10-cm spaced samples were averaged for each data point, using the δ18Ocalcite record as a guide to avoid aliasing and to obtain temperature data for the targeted δ18Ocalcite cycles. On average, each temperature group combines measurements from three samples (from minimum two to maximum five), and a total of 32 temperature groups were obtained with this approach, equivalent to one temperature data point every 28 kyr.

Sample standard errors were determined by selecting the higher value between the sample standard deviation and the external reproducibility from IAEA-C2 (0.027‰) and calculating standard errors of the means depending on the number of measurements from each sample. Average Δ47 values for each group were determined as the average of all sample averages in the temperature group weighted by the number of measurements from the respective samples, with errors being estimated through the propagation of the standard errors of the samples. For each temperature group, a mean age was assigned by also averaging the age of each sample in the temperature group by the number of measurements.

Temperatures were then estimated with the calibration of Meinicke et al.25 updated to the I-CDES scale74:

Errors in temperature estimates (for example, propagated analytical and calibration errors) were determined through Monte Carlo simulations after Meckler et al.37. The final temperature errors are reported as 68% and 95% confidence intervals (Fig. 1).

To test the impact of the choice of calibration equation, we also calculated temperatures with the calibrations of Anderson et al.45 and Daëron and Vermeesch46,75 (Supplementary Table 2), which include both biogenic and inorganic (for example, natural and laboratory precipitate) samples. Temperatures calculated with these equations are on average 1.5 °C (ref. 45) and 1.2 °C (ref. 46) colder, respectively, than those obtained with equation (1), and the δ18Osw on average 0.35‰ and 0.28‰ more negative. For this study, we chose to report temperatures with equation (1) because the other two calibrations include very high temperature (>100 °C) samples that can bias the relationship within the ocean temperature range. Although the choice of calibration affects our absolute reconstructed temperature and δ18Osw (albeit within error of our estimates), the relative changes, which are the main focus of this study, are unaffected. We refrain from using the calibration of Daëron and Gray76 as it yields unrealistically cold temperatures when applied to the Plio-Pleistocene section of the Cenozoic record of Meckler et al.37.

In addition to the grouping (binning) approach to reconstruct temperature, we used a Gaussian moving window filter to independently confirm the validity of our temperature grouping. This verification process was carried out through a Monte Carlo simulation following the methodology outlined in Rodríguez-Sanz et al.70. In short, for each replicate analysis, we generated 10,000 random values on the basis of the observed external reproducibility of 0.027‰ from IAEA-C2 (Extended Data Fig. 8a), and assuming a normal distribution. To account for both analytical and calibration uncertainties, we computed 10,000 temperature estimates for each replicate using a random slope–intercept pair from the clumped isotope calibration equation (outlined below). Subsequently, we applied a Gaussian filter with a 110,000-year window to each simulation and calculated average temperatures every 25,000 years. The final temperature values are presented as the median (50th percentile), along with the associated uncertainties represented by the 95% and 68% confidence limits (Extended Data Fig. 8b). The filter generated a pattern remarkably similar to the temperature groups, indicating that our chosen binning approach did not introduce bias into the temperature reconstruction (Extended Data Fig. 8). Despite the similarity between the temperature patterns obtained with the binning and Gaussian filter approaches, we prefer the binning approach, as it enables variable resolution and minimal smoothing in places where data density is higher (such as between 27.55 and 27.4 Ma).

To calculate δ18Osw, we used δ18Ocalcite from the Δ47 analysis of Cibicidoides spp. for most of the samples that compose our temperature groups (86 of 106 samples). However, we also had to rely on other taxa when Cibicidoides spp. were absent or not sufficiently abundant for Δ47 analysis. Whereas Δ47 is not measurably impacted by using different benthic foraminifera taxa77, there are species-specific offsets in δ18Ocalcite (for example, refs. 78,79) that need to be corrected for. Our Site 699 dataset shows distinct offsets between the δ18Ocalcite of Cibicidoides spp. and the other taxonomic groupings used as Δ47 aliquots from the same samples (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Averaged across all samples with dual measurements, aliquots of mixed epifaunal benthic foraminifera species were offset in δ18Ocalcite by −0.13‰ (±0.05, 95% confidence intervals), O. umbonatus by −0.22‰ (±0.04, 95% confidence intervals) and mixed samples of all benthic foraminiferal species by −0.15‰ (±0.09, 95% confidence intervals) with respect to Cibicidoides spp. (Extended Data Fig. 9b). We used these mean offsets to correct δ18Ocalcite with respect to Cibicidoides spp. when Cibicidoides spp. was not available and used the corrected δ18Ocalcite value from the other species/groups with the following order of priority where multiple options were available: (1) mixed epifaunal benthic foraminifera (8/106 samples), (2) O. umbonatus (1/106) and (3) mixed benthic foraminifera, in case of very low abundance of specimens (11/106) (Extended Data Fig. 9c). We preferred the mixed epifaunal group over O. umbonatus, as the former consistently display the smallest offset from Cibicidoides spp. It is also worth noting that the offset correction ultimately has limited impact on the Site 699 δ18Ocalcite record and, hence, δ18Osw, owing to the relatively small number of samples lacking Cibicidoides spp. and the small magnitude of the δ18Ocalcite offsets that we corrected for, relative to the changes observed in the δ18Ocalcite record (Extended Data Fig. 9d). This notion is corroborated by the similar magnitude of δ18Ocalcite fluctuations at Site 699 and at Sites 1264 (South Atlantic) and 1218 (Equatorial Pacific) where Cibicidoides mundulus and Cibicidoides spp. were used, respectively, with a mean difference of only 0.18‰.

To obtain δ18Osw, we calculated the average δ18Ocalcite for each group using the average δ18Ocalcite value for each sample in a temperature group and weighing these in the identical way to the Δ47 data (that is, giving more weight to samples that yielded more measurements for Δ47). This way, any skewing of the group averages towards a given sample owing to an unequal number of Δ47 measurements is also reflected in the δ18Ocalcite and, as a result, δ18Osw.

The temperature and the average δ18Ocalcite for each group were combined to obtain δ18Osw following the equation of Marchitto et al.20

where BWT is bottom water temperature.

We tested the statistical significance of the temperature and δ18Osw changes associated with the six 110-kyr eccentricity cycles between 28.2 and 27.2 Ma using mean values of temperature and δ18Osw groups (Extended Data Fig. 10). The temperatures and δ18Osw coinciding with the cycle core ~40 kyr of peak eccentricity values were grouped in the ‘eccentricity maxima' group of values and tested against background values (Extended Data Fig. 10). In doing so, we took into account a slight (±5 kyr) misalignment between the data and the eccentricity cycles. The test was performed with a t-test using the R stats package R Core Team80 (Extended Data Fig. 10b,d). For temperature, the t-test returned a P of 0.011, meaning the mean of the groups are statistically different. For δ18Osw, the t-test returned a P value of 0.256, meaning the mean of the groups are not statistically different (Extended Data Fig. 10b,d).

North-South cross-sections at 30°W showing the modern location of Site 699 with present-day temperature and salinity. Contours for temperature and salinity highlight the two main deep-water masses characterizing the area: CDW (Circumpolar Deep water) and AABW (Antarctic Bottom Water). Figure generated using https://odv.awi.de ref. 59.

(a) Hole 699 A Cores 19H to 21H were visually inspected for the presence of sedimentary cycles. Core color images show distinct cyclicity in the depth domain. (b) Magnetostratigraphy from Hole 699A58, where black (white) indicates a normal (reversed) magnetic polarity. Grey corresponds to coring gaps. Red error bars indicate uncertainty intervals of the exact magnetic reversal positions in the depth domain. Specifically, to each chron-reversal is assigned a mean-depth value indicated with a horizontal red bar. Mean-depth values are calculated based on the uppermost and lowermost magnetic chron positions, as reported by ref. 58, also used to calculate the error bars in the figure. The spread from the mean of the upper and lower depth uncertainties (error bars) ranges from ±0.1 to 1.5 meters. Note that the reversal from Chron C10r to C10n falls in the core gap in between Core 22H and Core 21H, and this reversal comes with a greater uncertainty. The study interval spans Cores 699A-20H and 21H, and Subchrons C9n to C10n. (c) Uncorrected red (R), green (G), blue (B), (RGB), data extracted from the core images (a). (d) RGB data corrected for uneven lighting conditions of core photographs. (e) Benthic foraminiferal δ18O data from Site 699. Arrows indicate the stratigraphic depths of foraminiferal samples used for SEM images shown in Extended Data Figs. 5–7.

(a) Depth-age relationship. Our initial age model consisted of assigning the Westerhold et al.3 reversal ages to Site 699 magnetostratigraphic chron boundaries (ref. 58). Black error bars on the y-axis indicate the upper, mean, and lower depth position for each reversal boundary (see Extended Data Fig. 2 caption for an explanation). Black error bars on the x-axis indicate how the uncertainty in the depth-domain (uppermost, mean, and lowermost positions) translates into an age uncertainty. Note that upper and lower depth uncertainties with respect to the mean are equal (see y-axis), but that younger and older age uncertainties with respect to the mean vary from one another (see x-axis). This is resulting from changing depth-age relationships, that is, varying sedimentation rates, throughout our study interval. In the age domain the spread from the mean of the younger and older age uncertainties ranges from -0.009 and +0.005 Myr to -0.072 and +0.141 Myr. Subsequent alignment of the RGB record to the La2011_ecc3L57 eccentricity solution resulted in a more accurately constrained age control for Site 699. Our tuned reversal ages are within error in agreement with those of Westerhold et al.3, and apart from the C8r/C9n reversal, also with the GTS2020 ages81. (b) Site 699 sedimentation rates based on our eccentricity tuning. Sedimentation rates vary between ~1.1 and 2.7 cm kyr−1, values that are typical for a (hemi)pelagic deep marine site.

Astronomical age calibration was guided by Site 699 (a) benthic foraminiferal δ18O record, but mainly based upon (b) the RGB record from Hole 699A Cores 20H and 21H. Tuning target was (c) the La2011_ecc3L57 eccentricity solution. Tuning tie points based on an alignment of RGB (and δ18O) to eccentricity are indicated with red vertical lines. Black vertical lines are tie points based on the (d) Site 699 magnetic polarity reversals58, which were assigned the (e) Westerhold et al.3 ages. Within error, (d) and (e) agree with one another. Chron boundary names are indicated.

Sample 699A-20H-2, 100-105 cm (182.10–182.13 mbsf). Panels a, b, and c show whole fragments and the images on the right are zoomed in (see panels a, b, c for locations).

Sample 699A-20H-3, 45-50 cm (183.05–183.08 mbsf). Panels a, b, and c show whole fragments and the images on the right are zoomed in (see panels a, b, c for locations).

Sample 699A-21H-4, 50-53 cm (194.10–194.13 mbsf). Panels a, b, and c show whole fragments and the images on the right are zoomed in (see panels a, b, c for locations).

(a) Replicate analyses (grey circles) and filter median values (blue line). (b) Filter median values (blue line) and 68% and 95% confidence intervals shown as dark blue and light blue envelopes. These were calculated with the simulation 16th – 84th and 2.5th – 97.5th percentiles, respectively. Red circles are the temperature estimates for the temperature groups expressed as mean values. Errors on temperature groups are the 68% and 95% confidence intervals derived from 20-46 measurements sourced from 2-5 individual sediment samples.

(a) Cross-plot of δ18Ocalcite from Cibicidoides spp. versus other key taxonomic groupings used here (red: O. umbonatus; grey: aliquots of mixed epifaunal benthic foraminifera species; yellow: mix of all benthic foraminifera present) from individual samples where measurements of both Cibicidoides spp. and other were possible. (b) The averaged δ18Ocalcite offset from Cibicidoides spp. of the groupings in (a) for all samples containing dual measurements, with 95% confidence intervals (vertical bars) and number of samples containing measurements of a specific grouping as well as Cibicidoides spp. displayed at the bottom. (c) The composite Site 699 benthic foraminifera δ18Ocalcite record (black line) plotted versus age, with taxonomic groups contributing to the record shown as coloured circles (blue: Cibicidoides spp.; red: O. umbonatus; grey: all epifaunal benthic foraminifera; yellow: all benthic foraminifera), constructed by correcting for the averaged δ18Ocalcite offsets (see (b)) of the other groupings to that of Cibicidoides spp. (d) Comparison of the composite benthic foraminifera δ18Ocalcite record with the offset-correction applied (blue line, grey circles) and without an offset-correction (black line, yellow circles).

(a) Δ47 temperatures plotted against the La2011_ecc3L Eccentricity Index from57 for the six 110-kyr eccentricity cycles captured here. Yellow dots indicate temperatures included in the eccentricity maxima group for the purpose of testing statistical significance of peak vs background values. Temperature data are presented as mean values with horizontal stippled lines representing the 68% confidence intervals of the proxy data derived from 20-46 measurements sourced from 2-5 individual sediment samples. Vertical lines reflect the age ranges of the adjoining 2-5 samples combined for calculating average Δ47 values. (b) Result of the Welch's t-test82, a variation of the standard t-test that is more suitable for distributions with unequal variance, comparing the background temperature values with the ones at the eccentricity maxima. Each box-plot shows the mean (white star), median (green line), 25-75% range (boxes) and full range of values (whiskers) of the two groups. The numerical result of the Welch's t-test is shown in upper-left-hand part of the figure, whereby DF= degree of freedom; LC and HC = 95% lower and higher (respectively) confidence boundaries of the estimated likely true difference between the two groups. (c) Same as (a) but for δ18Osw data. Purple dots indicate values included in the eccentricity maxima group for the purpose of testing statistical significance of peak vs background values. (d) Same as (b) but for δ18Osw data.

Metrics details

Aviation's climate impact continues to grow, with little progress toward emission reductions aligned with global targets. While technological advances attract attention, operational efficiency across aircraft, airlines, airports, city pairs, and regions remains underexplored. Here we assess carbon dioxide efficiency for 27.5 million flights between 26,156 city pairs in 2023, using data from Airline Data, International Civil Aviation Organization, International Air Transport Association. Results show wide variation: 32–890 gram carbon dioxide per revenue passenger kilometres across routes and 60–360 gram carbon dioxide per revenue passenger kilometre across aircraft models. Efficiency differs by region and is lowest in Africa, Australia, and Norway, and highest in Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia. Operating all routes at their demonstrated optimum could cut emissions by 10.7%. A theoretical 50% reduction is possible with the most efficient aircraft, all-economy layouts, and 95% load factors. Efficiency-focused policy could swiftly reduce fuel use without limiting air transport capacity.

Global commercial aviation released between 892 and 936 Mt of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in 20191,2,3, contributing roughly 4% of the world's net human-driven effective radiative forcing4,5. Industry projections indicate that the sector is likely to see robust growth over the next twenty years6,7. As demand growth has outpaced efficiency gains in the past, emissions from the sector will continue to rise unless new technologies, including sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), become available at scale8,9,10. However, with recent Airbus' decision to delay work on hydrogen-electric aircraft; technical and economic barriers to e-fuel production11,12; and the cost and production limits to SAF13,14, it is unlikely that the sector will decarbonize in line with global climate stabilization objectives15,16.

Factors driving the growth of emissions in air transport include the expansion of airlines, airports, and the role of subsidies17, as well as patterns of flight distribution and the influence of frequent fliers on demand generation18. Less attention has been given to the potential for reducing emissions, including through improved fuel efficiency in the air transport system. Fuel consumption can be optimized in four general ways: aircraft technology & design; alternative fuels & fuel properties; aviation operations & infrastructure; and socio-economic & policy measures19. Aircraft technology & design refers to airframe (weight, aerodynamics) and engine fuel efficiency. New fuels with properties similar to Jet A1 will reduce net CO2 emissions. Operations & infrastructure refers to optimized flight routes, including altitude, air traffic control systems, dynamic scheduling, efficient ground handling, airport designs and airport congestion20. Higher passenger load factors reduce fuel consumption per passenger, as do economy-class only seating configurations3,21,22. Regarding policies, subsidies make air transport less efficient23, while any form of charge directly or indirectly targeting emissions (SAF fuel quotas, landing fees, air passenger duties, emission trading) is an incentive for airlines to operate more efficiently. Efficiency gains will be an important pillar of any decarbonisation strategy for the sector24, although growth rates have consistently outpaced efficiency gains in the past25.

Historically, average passenger load factors have seen an upward trend, from 63.2% in 1980 to 82.4% in 2019, while emissions per RPK fell from 280 g CO₂ per RPK to 90 g CO₂ per RPK25. Yet, recent restrictions in airspace use due to military conflicts (specifically Russia-Ukraine) have increased flight distances and global fuel consumption26. Several large airlines have also started to introduce more premium travel options27, decreasing fuel efficiency. In the future, avoidance of super-saturated flight zones to reduce contrail formation and subsequent non-CO2 warming is projected to increase fuel use28, while the introduction of supersonic aircraft will decrease fuel efficiency and accelerate radiative forcing29.

While factors influencing fuel consumption have been discussed, differences in global operational efficiency appear to have never been investigated. We analyze passenger air transport efficiency between aircraft, airlines, airports, city pairs, and geographical regions. The potential of three strategies—operating only the most efficient aircraft, adopting an all-economy class configuration, increasing load factors—is assessed to determine the hypothetical maximum efficiency for the current air transport system.

Data is analysed for 27,451,887 flights (take-offs), operated between 26,156 bi-directional city pairs in 2023. Flights transported a total of 3,554,769,475 passengers over a total flown distance of 43,314,099,618 km (equivalent to 145 return journeys to the sun), or equalling 6,813,991,167,300 RPK (about 0.7 light years), causing emissions of 577,968,750 t CO2.

Fig. 1 illustrates the relevance of the 20 highest emitting countries. The United States is responsible for 25% of global emissions (144.6 Mt), with an average weighted efficiency per RPK that is 14.3% higher than the weighted global average. The second largest emitting country, China, follows with 49.7 Mt CO2, and an average weighted efficiency of 88.6 g CO2 per RPK. Together, the 20 countries account for 74.9% (433 Mt CO2) of global emissions from air passenger transport. Emissions on individual city pairs vary between a low of 31.6 g CO2 per RPK (Milan, Italy to Incheon/Seoul, South Korea) and a high of 888.3 g CO2 per RPK (Kavieng to Tokua Lakunai, within Papua New Guinea). The global average is 84.4 g CO2 per RPK.

The United States leads with the highest total emissions (144.6 Mt CO₂) and the highest per-passenger emissions (96.5 g CO2 per RPK), followed by China and the United Kingdom. Countries are color-coded by continent, highlighting regional contributions to global aviation-related carbon emissions.

The global variation in efficiencies can also be illustrated by airports, and for the busiest routes (Fig. 2). Results show that inefficient flights dominate in Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, and Central Asia. They are also common in North America (particularly smaller airports, less busy flights), East Asia, and Western South America. In Europe, Norway is particularly inefficient. Efficient flights dominate in Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia, as well as on routes with high traveller volumes. Other regions, including Europe, have both more and less efficient routes.

Thin white lines denote the ideal flight path between two airports along the respective great circle, shown globally (a), and for North America (b), Europe (c), and East Asia (d). Airports are marked by location and colour-coded to show the CO2 intensity (RPK-weighted average across arrivals and departures) and the marker size scales with the airport's CO2 emissions (half of all arrivals and departures). Percentages in the legend correspond to emission percentiles, ranking airports from lowest to highest emissions.

Larger airports have a higher efficiency averaged across arriving and departing flights (Fig. 3a). The standard deviation of flight CO2 intensities increases for larger airports too (Fig. 3b) as they serve more flights. This is statistically supported by rank correlations of (a) −0.57, (b) 0.54, and total CO₂ emissions are largely determined by RPK (Pearson: 0.98). Large variation in CO₂ intensity reflects on regional differences (Fig. 2).

a Mean and (b) standard deviation of CO2 intensities across all arriving and departing flights. Mean and standard deviations are RPK-weighted. Airports are sorted by their respective CO2 emissions (half of all departures and arrivals), low to high. Linear least-square fits are applied with 1–99% confidence intervals obtained from bootstrapping 1000 random subsamples of 50% of the airports. Rank-correlation coefficients are (a) −0.57, (b) 0.54.

Figure 4 further illustrates differences between the least and most efficient airports and airlines in the world. Average emissions between the least/most efficient airports and airlines (emissions of 0.1 Mt CO2 or more in 2023) can be more than a factor two. For example, airline LATAM (Chile) caused average emissions of 69.1 g CO2 per RPK, while Air Algerie (Algeria) emitted 115.0 g CO2 per RPK; airport Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) caused 67.5 g CO2 per RPK and Atlanta 103.0 g CO2 per RPK. There is also evidence that larger airlines are more efficient (Fig. 5a), and that passenger load factors influence efficiency (Fig. 5b).

The 30 largest airlines by total emissions (>4 Mt CO2) are marked in purple and account for 60.7% of all emissions. a Logarithmic and (b) linear least-squares fits are applied with 5–95% confidence intervals via bootstrapping 1000 subsamples of a random 50% of the airlines. Frequent passenger load factors around 0.79 in (b) are due to data limitations (see Methods).

These findings point to the importance of aircraft models, layouts, and load factors. These are analyzed to determine the theoretical maximum efficiency in the air transport system. Observed aircraft model efficiency varies considerably (Fig. 6). The most efficient models include Boeing 787–900 (55.4 g CO2 per RPK), 787–800 (59.8 CO2 per RPK), and Boeing 787–1000 (60.1 CO2 per RPK), followed by Airbus A320 neo (61.4 g CO2 per RPK), Airbus A321neo (64.1 CO2 per RPK), and Airbus A350 (76.2 g CO2 per RPK). If all aircraft were replaced with the Boeing 787-9 (long-haul) and the Airbus A321neo (short and medium-haul), this would result in fuel savings of −25% to −28% depending on respective market share (Fig. 7).

Aircraft are sorted by revenue RPK share (denoted in light-years, 1 light-year \(\approx\)9.5 \(\cdot\) 1012 km) and horizontally stacked on the x-axis (accumulating RPK). The height of each bar denotes the aircraft's CO2 intensity, the area is proportional to the CO₂ emissions from that aircraft type and colored accordingly. The 15 most prominent aircraft types (in RPK) are labelled, (w) stands for (winglets). Average intensity is given as a horizontal dashed line and the total emissions across all aircraft is proportional to the area below.

The current air transport system in our study causes emissions of 578 Mt CO2 (see Methods for system boundaries). Replacing less efficient aircraft with only the two most efficient models (Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A350) would reduce emissions by 26.5% to 33.7% to 383 to 425 Mt CO2. Changing these aircraft from their current layout (premium and economy class seating) to an all-economy class layout would further reduce emissions in the range of 26.1 to 56.7%, or 166 to 313 Mt CO2. Last, increasing the load factor to 95% would further reduce emissions to a range of 139 to 263 Mt CO2. The fuel penalty incurred in additional weight is not considered, but small (see Methods, Fig. 9).

In regard to layouts, IATA21 suggests that business and first class seats are up to 5 times more CO₂-intense than economy class seats. Premium class seating is more common in wide-bodied aircraft and on long-haul flights, as well as among specific airlines including American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Swiss International Air Lines30. An all-economy class configuration would consequently reduce emissions. Here, results suggest that increasing passenger numbers to the maximum seating configuration for the most efficient aircraft (Airbus 350 and Boeing 787) would further reduce emissions by 21.5% to 56.7%, assuming no changes in the load factor.

In 2023, average passenger load factors were 78.9% for flown kilometers, with a range from 20.1% to 100% between individual flights. Increasing this load factor to 95% would further reduce emissions by 16.1%. Overall, emissions in 2023 could have been 54.5% to 76.0% lower, though a modest fuel penalty would have to be considered (see Methods). This suggests that transporting the same number of passengers over the same distances would be possible with less than half the current fuel consumption, if airlines only operated the most efficient aircraft models, switched to an all-economy layout, and increased the load factor to 95% (Fig. 7).

While this is the hypothetical maximum, analysis for 13,666 city pairs (52.2% of all city pairs) that are served by more than one airline or aircraft configuration suggests that operating these city pairs by the most efficient configuration currently in use would reduce emissions by 10.7%. This represents the already demonstrated efficiency gain in the air transport system, with airlines operating under their economic constraints.

Further analysis confirms that CO2 intensity strongly depends on passenger load factors and flight distance (Fig. 8). A least-squares linear regression with load factor and distance as predictors shows that a full flight (load factor 100%) covering 10,000 km emits, on average, 57 g CO2 per RPK. This almost doubles to 109 g CO2 per RPK for a half full flight (load factor 0.5) or increases to 83 g CO2 per RPK for a reduced flight distance of 1000 km at full capacity. However, there is considerable variation around this average (Fig. 8) likely highlighting the importance of aircraft models. Neglecting possible changes in passenger load, if every flight's intensity was capped at this average (the medium cap model), increasing efficiency for approximately the lower half of flights would save 8.6% in emissions (or 50 Mt CO₂). A low cap model, allowing average intensities (from the medium cap model) and up to 33% higher, would only affect the most inefficient flights, consequently saving only 1.1% of emissions. A high cap model, however, which requires every flight to be at least 33% more efficient than the average (of the medium cap model), effectively requiring the highest industry standards, would save 34.6% of emissions or 200 Mt CO₂. These scenarios are more realistic compared to those discussed around Fig. 7 as they acknowledge constraints many airlines face when operating.

CO2 intensity of flight connections as a function of (a) average passenger load and (c) flight distance (including detours and holding). Each marker denotes one flight connection between two airports. Markers are color-coded with flight distance in (a) and passenger load in (c), with colors visualized as a histogram in (b, d) respectively for (a, c). Note that (b, c) show flight distance on a logarithmic axis. A CO2 intensity cap model (blue, purple, orange lines) is added as a simple model to represent an approximate industry standard of operational low, medium and high CO2 intensities for civil aviation. The medium cap model is fitted via least-squares, the low (high) cap model is 33% higher (lower) intensity. The data gap in (c) is an artefact resulting from the ICAO correction factor (see Methods).

Further growth in aviation will make the sector increasingly relevant for climate change mitigation. Efficiency gains have importance, because the replacement of Jet A1 with SAF does not eliminate non-CO₂ components, even though lower soot particle emissions can reduce effective radiative forcing31. Strategies minimizing fuel use are thus preferable, as they contribute to a reduction in CO₂ as well as non-CO₂ effects. This article highlights the considerable potential for efficiency gains in the sector: higher load-factors, the scaling back of premium-class seating, or the replacement of inefficient aircraft models with efficient ones provide opportunities for considerable fuel savings.

While airlines often claim that fuel savings are in their own economic interest, the reality is that many airlines continue to fly with old aircraft, low load factors, or growing shares of premium-class seating. For example, aircraft remain in service for 25 years32. Global passenger load factors have generally increased over time, but have yet to surpass the 85% threshold25. New policies and policy corrections are needed to accelerate efficiency gains in aviation. For example, low load factors may be a result of public service obligations and other subsidies provided by governments23, encouraging - and even forcing - airlines to fly even though demand is marginal. Another example is the hub-and-spoke model, under which airlines fly passengers from smaller airports to central hubs where they can transfer to other flights. Spoke routes may be served with smaller, less efficient aircraft, have lower load factors, and not be profitable on their own33.

Climate policies, where they exist, currently focus on decarbonizing air transport through the adoption of SAF. For example, the European Union's ReFuel programme forces airlines to adopt greater shares of SAF34, defined as a percentage share of total fuel use. Paradoxically, this legislation could lead to an increase in overall warming, even if quotas are successfully met, if total fuel use increases faster than the share replaced with SAF. Inefficiency considerations in air transport are an alternative climate governance inroad: as the CO2 intensity cap model illustrates, efficiency-based policies have a great potential to curb emissions. These may include soft policies (a public airline efficiency rating), market-based measures (phasing out subsidies, higher landing fees for inefficient airlines or aircraft), or regulatory approaches (CO2 intensity caps). Notably, there is precedent for such policies in other sectors: the EU energy label and minimum performance standards for white appliances35, bonus-malus systems in vehicle insurance36 or fuel economy standards37, as recently approved by the Marine Environment Protection Committee for international shipping38. Resistance to any such policies must be expected, as airlines operate within economic constraints, a business environment shaped by subsidies, expectations of continued growth, and limited ambition for climate change mitigation.

The comparison of commercial passenger air transport efficiencies requires a comparable indicator. CO2 intensity, i.e. Emissions per revenue passenger kilometer (g CO2 per RPK) can be calculated for aircraft, airports, and city pairs. This indicator is directly proportional to fuel use per revenue passenger kilometer (kg fuel per RPK). It is influenced by many factors, including the aircraft design (airframe, engine type, winglets), operational aspects (distance, speed, flight route, flight altitude, weather, detours, holding patterns, green flying techniques), as well as on-the-ground conditions (taxiing, ground power supply). Energy use per passenger also depends on aircraft layout (seat numbers), load factors, and co-loaded cargo. Data is limited to aircraft with 30 seats and more, i.e., private aircraft and business jets are not part of the analysis. Data allows us to calculate average load factors for each city pair, from which global load factors and fuel use can be derived.

To factor these aspects into the calculation of emissions per RPK, an efficiency model is used that considers distance, aircraft type, and payload (passenger and cargo weight). 2023 data for the efficiency model is derived from:

T100I (AirlineData): flight-specific load factors for flights to and from the USA and Canada, annual means.

ICAO TFS (Traffic by Flight Stage): similar to T100I with global coverage, though not for all airlines.

IATA WATS (World Air Transport Statistics): annually averaged, airline-specific load factors (i.e., not disaggregated by city pair or aircraft type), further split into international and domestic services, for about 219 airlines.

FlightGlobal: similar to IATA WATS, with airline-level data (annual mean load factors) for 178 airlines.

Data consequently has three levels of granularity for load factors:

Level 1: Airline average over one year (52% of all flights).

Level 2: Airline–city pair average over one year (12.4%).

Level 3: Airline–aircraft–city pair average over one year (15.2%).

T100I and ICAO TFS provide level 3 data. From these, level 2 and level 1 averages can be derived by averaging revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) and available seat kilometers (ASK) across aircraft serving a given city pair (level 2) and additionally across all city pairs (level 1, ICAO TFS only). By contrast, IATA WATS and FlightGlobal only provide level 1 data.

For each individual flight, the highest level of load factor is sought, following a fallback cascade across the data sources. When IATA WATS is established as the best data source, the corresponding value for either domestic or international flights is used. As a last fallback, a global load factor over all airlines is calculated for three distance categories: short-haul (≤1500 km), medium-haul (1501−3500 km) and long haul (>3500 km). This load factor is used when no other load factor (level 1–3) can be found.

The induced error can be calculated for using global means instead of level 3 values. When bootstrapping 100,000 samples, the per-flight absolute error mean is 0.0406, and the median is 0.0145. The bootstrapped 95% CI for the absolute error mean is [0.0389, 0.0423]. This corresponds to a relative error of 5.38% with a 95% CI of [5.15%, 5.62%]. Notably, this error affects 20.4% of the load factor, as a higher-level granularity for load factors is available for 79.6% of flights.

Total fuel use is a function of total load and aircraft-specific performance data. Seat-classes are weighted by multiplying average per-passenger emissions with a seat-class factor based on IATA's cabin class method21. This method considers the number of seats per class in a given aircraft configuration. The formula for this calculation is provided in (Eq. (1)); the passenger share of fuel use in (Eq. (2)), also involving data from Flight Global, which provides passenger data. Fuel use is transformed into CO₂ in (Eq. (3)).

More specifically, fuel consumption is calculated for each individual flight, accounting for the specific aircraft model, cabin layout, and passenger/cargo load factors. Fuel consumption is derived from a physical aircraft performance model, which calculates fuel consumption for a given aircraft model, considering flight distance and takeoff weight. The total fuel consumption of the flight is then broken down into fuel use per passenger and converted to CO2 emissions per passenger. All subsequent analyses are based on these individual-flight emission characteristics, allowing for more nuanced results than calculations based on airline-average or city pair-average load factors or performance data.

Allocation of total fuel burn of a given flight to individual passengers and subsequent conversion to CO2 emissions follows these steps:

(a) Calculation of fuel use for payload in ton kilometres (tkm)

(b) Calculation of fuel per passenger (pax)

Here, passenger emissions and 50% of the emissions from freight transport are allocated to passengers, assuming a passenger (including baggage) weighs 100 kg39.

(c) Calculation of CO₂ per Passenger (pax)

The resulting per-passenger emission intensity enables comparisons of flight efficiency. Figure 8 illustrates the inherent dependence of emission intensity on flight distance, with longer flights generally exhibiting lower emission intensities. This is because takeoff and ascent to cruising altitude - the most fuel-intensive phase of a flight - account for a larger proportion of total fuel burn on short-haul routes.

These data are used to assess all flights; where no data for a specific flight is available, global mean values are used for three distance classes (short-/medium-/long-haul). Flight distances are based on great circle distances, which are converted to flown distances by using ICAO's correction factor: +50 km for flights up to 550 km, + 100 km for flights between 550 and 5500 km, and +125 km for flights >5500 km40. Data is available for 26,155 city pairs and 61,607 ‘flights', with one flight being defined as a unique combination of departure airport, arrival airport, airline, and aircraft type. Non-operational code-sharing flights have been removed from the dataset; only the airline carrying out the flight is considered. A weakness of the dataset is that it includes mostly scheduled flights.

The dataset comprises 27,451,887 flights in 2023, carrying a total of 3,554,769,475 passengers over a distance of 6,813,991,167,301 RPK, and causing emissions of 577,968,750 t CO2. This is less than the 35.3 million flights, 4.319 billion passengers, 8232 billion RPK, and the 530 Mt CO₂ reported through the CORSIA Central Registry (said to cover 99% of total 2023 emissions on scheduled services reported for 2023 by ICAO41)42,43. Our data consequently covers 83% of RPK and 82% of passengers in comparison to ICAO data. A potential explanation is that there are data gaps related to the reporting of charter operators.

Consistency analysis of our database shows that the number of seats in aircraft is always higher than the number of passengers. Airline load factor comparison with three airlines, Ryanair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines, for which data is publicly available, also suggests that variation is within 10%. For example, in 2023, Ryanair reported a 93% load factor, whilst the model suggests 93.6%; Lufthansa reported 82%, whilst the dataset is 78.9%; and American Airlines reported 83.5%, whilst the model suggests 81%. It is difficult to validate emission intensities for airlines due to variable operating conditions and inconsistent reporting standards. Annual reports may not include RPK numbers, refer to financial years rather than calendar years, combine data on operational fuel use for cargo and passengers, combine different accounting scopes, deduct sustainable aviation fuel emission “savings”, or calculate CO₂e rather than CO₂. Airlines also have subsidiaries that may have been included/excluded in the accounting. However, the communication teams of all airlines mentioned in this article (LATAM, Ryanair, EasyJet, Qatar Airways, Emirates, China Southern, British Airways, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air Algérie) were provided with the data sources used in our analysis, as well as the airline-specific emission efficiencies (g CO2 per RPK) calculated, and were asked to comment. LATAM responded by saying that it does not wish to comment. EasyJet provided a link to their own calculations, suggesting slightly lower emission efficiencies (66.64 g CO2 per RPK) than calculated using our model (74.2 CO2 per RPK).

Emissions are assessed at different scales of analysis, for airports, airlines, or countries. For airports, emissions are calculated by aggregating half the emissions from all incoming and outgoing flights. This ensures that half of the emissions for each city pair are attributed to the respective departure and arrival airports. The approach addresses that fuel use can vary between incoming and outgoing flights due to differences in flight paths or weather. Airline emissions consider all emissions from flights operated by an airline, with intensities calculated by dividing the total amount of CO2 by the number of RPK. Country emissions are calculated by aggregating emissions from all airports within national borders.

The efficiency of air transport is calculated for aircraft, airlines, airports, city pairs, and countries, using the same indicator (g CO2 per RPK). Airport emissions are calculated for 3218 airports by summing up the CO2 for all departures and arrivals from/at each airport, and dividing the value by two to assign half the emissions from every flight to this airport. In an identical approach, half of all RPKs for every departure and arrival are calculated. The mean CO2 intensity (g CO2 per RPK) is then derived by dividing an airport's CO2 emissions by its RPK. Aircraft comparisons are based on city pairs, for which data is available for all aspects of the flight. For these, fuel consumption per RPK can be calculated for each aircraft based on fuel use, emissions, and RPK. On this basis, aircraft can be ranked by observed efficiency.

Optimum efficiencies on city pairs can be calculated for all routes served by more than one flight configuration (13,666 out of 26,156 city pairs, or 52.2%). Avoided CO₂ can be determined by dividing the most efficient average (g CO2 per RPK) by the average efficiency on the city pair, multiplied with CO₂ emissions on this city pair. Values can then be aggregated for all city pairs, and total emission be compared to current emissions in the system. This can be expressed as (Eq. (4)):

Ebest = Best (minimum) efficiency for a given route (e.g., fuel per tkm)

Ei = Efficiency of airline i on the same route

CO2i = Current CO₂ emissions of airline i

CO2best,i = CO₂ emissions at best efficiency for airline i

Then, the formula for CO₂ emissions at the best efficiency is:

If there are multiple airlines on a city‑pair, the total emissions improvement can be calculated as (Eq. (5)):

Assuming that only the most efficient aircraft were operated on all city pairs served by more than one carrier, emissions would be 10.66% lower than current emissions (517 Mt CO₂, rather than 578 Mt CO₂). This is the lower theoretical threshold for emission reductions based on observed operational efficiency.

Theoretical maximum efficiency. There are three ways to increase the efficiency of air transport: using only the most efficient aircraft, switching to one flight class (economy); and increasing load factors. The maximum efficiency for the year 2023 can be calculated in three steps.

Step 1: Global fleet of most efficient aircraft models. The effect of replacing the entire 2023 fleet with the two most efficient models - the Boeing 787-9 (55.4 g CO₂ per RPK) and the Airbus A321neo (61.4 g CO₂ per RPK) would lead to emission reductions in the range of 26.6% (all Airbus) to 33.7% (all Boeing), compared to the current fleet average of 83.6 g CO₂ per RPK, with (Eq. (6)):

Iavg = average CO₂ intensity (gCO₂ per RPK)

Iopt = CO₂ intensity of the Boeing 787‑9 (gCO₂ per RPK)

S = relative savings

Step 2: Economy class only configuration. To determine the difference between an air transport system consisting only very efficient aircraft models, we calculate frequency weighted averages for average seat numbers in economy, business, and first class for the five configurations of the most efficient aircraft models (A350-1000; A350-900; Boeing 787-1000; Boeing 787-800; and Boeing 787-900). As Table 1 illustrates, first class seating is uncommon in these aircraft, partially explaining their efficiency.

The difference in space use between all-economy vs. business and first class aircraft layout can be calculated using current economy to business to first ratios, with each first class seat equalling 5 economy seats, and every business class seat 4 economy class seats21. The percentage increase in seat numbers can be calculated based on data from Official Airline Guide (OAG) and FleetsAnalyzer (FA) for models A350 and B787, which represent the range of most efficient aircraft. In contrast to FA, OAG does not distinguish economy and economy-premium class; this might explain some of the difference in observed maximum seat numbers. OAG data refers to the 2023 flight schedule that lists the actual cabin layout for every flight; FA data considers actual aircraft configurations in fleets of various airlines (2023 data).

Table 1 shows the observed maximum seat number for the different models for both databases, and the average seat numbers for each model. The theoretical maximum number of seats can be calculated based on the following formula (Eq. (7)):

where S is the number of seats per class, and the factors are the IATA seat class factors, and economy (eco), premium-economy (prem.eco), business (bus) and first (first).

The increase in seat numbers in an all-economy layout is then determined based on an “assumed maximum”, representing either the calculated theoretical maximum seat number or the certified maximum seat number (whichever is lower). Certified maximums refer to type certification that are based on emergency evacuation demands13. This means that the number of seats in the Airbus A350-1000 is capped at 440, and at 420 seats for Boeing 787-1000 and 787-900.

Results suggest that an all-economy layout would allow airlines to carry 26% to 57% more passengers, which is equivalent to the theoretical reduction in fuel use of an all-economy layout.

Step 3: 95% load factor. Limiting capacity growth in global air transport will lead to higher load factors. In particular low-cost carriers have reported load factors of up to 94%44. Here we assume a hypothetical maximum load factor of 95% that would reflect on an air transport system with considerably reduced capacity25. Given the current load factor of 78.9%, aircraft could carry 16.1% more passengers if available capacity was utilized at 95%.

Fuel penalty. Calculations in Step 2 and 3 do not consider that optimization for efficiency will incur a fuel penalty due to the additional weight carried. Analysis for the two aircraft models characterizing the range of layout gains, i.e., A350-1000 and Boeing 787-800 (26.1–56.7% more seats), suggests that this fuel penalty is small. This is illustrated in Fig. 9 for the A350-1000: depending on distance, fuel consumption increases by 5.8% to 13.9%, implying a small fuel-penalty even in comparison of a near-empty (20% load factor) to a close to full (80% load factor) aircraft. We conclude that increasing seat numbers or load factor will marginally increase fuel use. The potential reduction in fuel consumption in an optimized air transport system is thus in the range of −55% to −75%, not considering the fuel penalty.

Fuel use increases as a function of load, here illustrated for the A350-1000. The difference in fuel consumption between a near-empty (20% load factor, lower green curve) and near-full (80% load factor, upper blue curve) ranges between 5.8% and 13.9%, suggestion that the fuel penalty for additional weight carried is small.

A CO2 intensity cap model illustrates how much emissions from global aviation would fall if flights were required to operate at a mandated maximum CO2 intensity. However, considering such a cap as constant is largely unrealistic as it is strongly dependent on flight distance and load factors. Ignoring changes to load factors or flight distance, we isolate the variation independent of those. Other scenarios investigate increasing load factors (in exchange for fewer aircraft, see above).

The CO2 intensity c is therefore modelled as a function of load factor l and flight distance d, linear in both predictors (Eq. (8)):

Inverse proportionality is assumed as increasing load decreases the intensity, so does a longer flight (larger aircraft, less resistance at higher altitude, smaller contribution of fuel-intensive takeoff). This model is fit via least-squares, estimating the constants to (rounded) a = 54 g CO2 per RPK, b = 35,000 g CO2 per pax, d0 = 180 km. The offset in load factor l0 is manually set to 0.01 to prevent intensities going to infinity for very low load factors which is not well constrained with the data given how few flights operate that empty. This model is considered to be the medium cap model representing an average intensity. The low clow and high cap model chigh are defined as clow = 4c/3, chigh = 2c/3, representing 33.3% lower/higher efficiency, respectively. Theoretically, for very long flight distances fuel consumption increases due to the additional weight of large amounts of fuel. This motivates to add a term proportional to distance d, which however, does not yield a positive proportionality constant, contradicting this theory with data. In that sense, higher intensities for very long flight distances are not supported with the data here.

Findings are characterized by the following limitations: Our data comprises only a share of global commercial passenger air transport (83% of RPK and 82% of passengers in comparison to ICAO42,43). It is unclear how the difference affects the representativeness of our findings for commercial passenger air transport. We also acknowledge that ICAO's distance correction is crude, as the ratio of actual flight distance to great-circle distance depends on multiple factors such as weather, airspace restrictions, or airport congestion. Load factors are calculated based on three levels of granularity, and a fallback option that is the global average. Analysis suggests that the error affects in particular small, remote, or politically isolated territories (Nauru, St. Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna, Bhutan, or Greenland), countries where reporting is more limited (China, Russian Federation, India), or specific airlines and airline subsidiaries (e.g., Sichuan Airlines, TUI Airways Ltd., Interglobe Aviation Ltd.). Last, our proposed strategies to increase efficiencies in global aviation will in practice be met with various economic and political challenges. Airlines operate within economic constraints and a business environment shaped by subsidies, limited ambition for climate change mitigation, and expectations of continued growth. Efforts to enhance air transport efficiency will have to be addressed within this multifaceted context.

Tadeo Ramirez-Parada studied the timing of plant flowering for his PhD — but he didn't touch a single petal. Instead, he developed a machine-learning algorithm to analyse the digitized captions of one million herbarium specimens, which showed him how flowering times are changing with rising temperatures.

Ramirez-Parada's work has helped to solve an important mystery in ecology — showing that as temperatures change, plants shift their flowering times to cope with the heat, rather than adapting through natural selection1. Yet his work so far has been almost entirely computer-based. “I have had to do very little experimental or field work,” says Ramirez-Parada, who did his PhD at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Ecologists: don't lose touch with the joy of fieldwork

Ecologists: don't lose touch with the joy of fieldwork

Ramirez-Parada's work is typical of a change that is reaching into every part of ecology. Whatever scientists are analysing — digitized specimens, images of the natural world, DNA samples, or data streaming in from sensors — many are doing it indoors.

The technologies are creating a world that can be monitored at times, places and scales that were previously unimaginable. We are moving towards the “fully automated monitoring of ecological communities”, wrote Marc Besson, a marine scientist at the Sorbonne University Ocean Observatory in Banyuls-sur-Mer, France, in a 2022 paper2.

Many ecologists say this revolution offers huge potential for understanding the biodiversity crisis and discerning patterns of global change.

But some ecologists are dismayed. They feel that the discipline is losing intimacy with its subject matter. They argue that field experience is in decline, and that this loss could lead to error, bias and oversimplification of results.

“If it becomes a world where you don't actually have to go out in order to become an ecologist, we kind of lose sight of what the actual world is like,” says Bill Sutherland, who studies conservation biology at the University of Cambridge, UK.

Like scientists everywhere, ecologists are grappling with how to make the most of a torrent of data.

Natural-history museums and herbariums around the world have digitized more than one billion specimens over the past few decades, some with accompanying DNA records.

Meanwhile, citizen scientists and researchers alike have been feeding databases such as iNaturalist with hundreds of millions of observations, which are absorbed into the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a central database for natural history.

There is also a stream of data from sensors such as camera traps — which take pictures when activated by movement — microphones, animal-tracking devices, drones, satellites and DNA samplers.

Such sensors can run for years without intervention. Once, a remotely planted camera trap would eventually run out of power: now, the energy consumption of such a device is minimal and it can rely on solar or wind energy. Bandwidth is no longer an obstacle to data being transmitted 24 hours a day.

And computer science is more than keeping up3. Artificial-intelligence systems are already identifying species from these data; they are also being used for more complicated tasks such as building species-distribution models and ancestry trees. Some ecologists predict that generative AI, which creates new content based on learning from huge data sets, will soon be able to make more complex models, leading the way to understanding ecological processes and forecasting how species will respond to environmental changes.

There are already at least 100 laboratories that would label their work as ‘AI for nature', according to Tanya Berger-Wolf, a computational ecologist at the Ohio State University in Columbus.

The approach is starting to bear fruit. One European project, called CamAlien, is tracking invasive species using high-resolution cameras with machine-learning processing power, affixed to cars, boats and trains. As they speed along, they rapidly photograph the sides of roads and tracks, analyse the images in situ and upload alerts about alien invasive plants to a Europe-wide online map.

The system shows how, just in the past few years, new technologies combined with AI have “gone from mostly demonstrating potential to actually beginning to deliver real implementations”, says Toke Thomas Høye, an ecologist at Aarhus University in Denmark, who co-developed CamAlien. Some 16 European countries are trying out the technology to assess the distribution of invasive alien species.

Similarly, amid the steep declines in some insects, a consortium of researchers has finessed camera-trap technology, originally designed to spot mammals, so that it can identify and monitor insect species, which are much more numerous. Automated insect monitoring didn't exist five years ago, says Høye. Thanks to developments in AI, scientists can distinguish between thousands of species.

“It's opening up a door to part of our natural world that is so much more diverse compared to what camera traps have been used for previously,” says Høye. He and his group think that making insect monitoring easier and less labour-intensive will shed light on the state of insect populations around the globe.

Another group has deployed a system of microphones in search of a more detailed understanding of migration as birds fly across Europe from Norway to the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Known as the TABMON project, it is now streaming real-time soundscape data, day and night. An AI tool analyses the data and converts them into commonly used biodiversity indicators.

“Having standardized ecological data on continental scales is extremely rare,” says Sarab Sethi, who studies ecosystem sensing at Imperial College London, and led the design of the microphones, “especially when it's on the fine-scale temporal resolution that acoustics gives, across a wide range of species, and across multiple years”. The project has yet to report its first results.

Few would dispute the benefits of more data and detail, but there is an ominous side effect, says Kevin Gaston at the University of Exeter, UK, who studies people's relationship with nature: field experience is on the wane.

Gaston and his co-author Masashi Soga, who studies the loss of human–nature interactions at the University of Tokyo, argued in a March 2025 paper4 that there has been an ‘extinction of experience': a widespread decline in fieldwork-based research and education, with knock-on effects on the depth of ecological understanding. They also flagged other dangers, such as reduced engagement with local communities — a practice known to be crucial for successful conservation.

Others have expressed concern about ‘AI colonialism', a practice in which data, collected remotely in poorer countries, are siphoned off for analysis in well-equipped labs elsewhere.

In India's forests, ecologists harness the power of fieldwork

There are few quantitative data available to support or challenge Gaston and Soga's argument. One analysis5 of ecological studies published between 1980 and 2014 found that fieldwork-based studies decreased by 20% (as a proportion of the total), whereas modelling and data analyses increased by 600% and 800%, respectively. But these are relative changes, rather than absolute numbers, and the data set ends more than a decade ago.

Anecdotally, however, Gaston and Soga's paper struck a nerve. Since publication, a number of groups have cited it while warning that a lack of outdoor research is hindering studies on subjects ranging from solitary bees to dinosaur fossils.

There's also anecdotal evidence that more computer scientists have entered ecology, excited about what they can offer, but lacking field experience. That was the case for Berger-Wolf, considered a founder of computational ecology. She completed her PhD in theoretical computer science, but, being married to an ecologist, says she would chat to others in the ecology community and walk away “with a feeling like, oh, there's got to be a different way of answering this question”.

Berger-Wolf changed tack in 2003, and by 2005 was developing algorithms for dynamic network analysis to depict the social interactions of zebras in the Kenyan Serengeti. Field colleagues urged her to go and see her data but she always refused: “I'm a city girl. And I don't like dust and bugs. And my answer was: ‘no, my data looks beautiful on my screen.'”

Sethi is another convert to ecology, having arrived in the field with an engineering background. In 2016, he decided to apply acoustic monitoring to ecology for his PhD — but the self-confessed metrophile quickly found himself out of his depth in a rainforest in Malaysian Borneo.

“I did what I now realize was the extremely dumb thing of trying to develop a new technology and for its first deployment to be in a tropical forest on the other side of the world,” Sethi grins. On the first night, he lay under a mosquito net in a pitch-dark hut on stilts, wide awake, while his ecologist colleagues dozed comfortably amid the sounds of the rainforest. He remembers thinking: “My God, is this just like a joke that's gone a bit too far?” Now he values his field experiences but works mostly from the lab.

Some ecologists have gone the other way, coming in from outdoors to embrace big data. Laura Pollock at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, began her career as a field ecologist, first in the swamps of New Orleans, Louisiana, and then in isolated mountain regions in Australia. She saw a need for ecologists to do better data analysis, and now she uses machine learning to do predictive modelling of biodiversity across landscapes.

“I rarely get outside,” she says. “I'm trying, but it's really hard because there's so much technology creating so much data that we need people who have these data-science skills to analyse this.”

But Besson has embraced technology without diminishing his hours in the field. He says that he is spending as much time outside as he did before automation arrived. “Cameras and hydrophones can capture things in addition to my own eyes and ears, and they can stay in the field when I need to go back to the lab ... and when I need to sleep.”

There are also many systemic forces driving ecologists indoors, argues Gaston.

There's a widespread perception that funding for field studies is in decline — although the data are not often differentiated into grants for fieldwork versus those for lab-based projects. Scientists who run long-term ecological studies, in particular, report that they struggle to find funding.

Biodiversity research requires more boots on the ground

Biodiversity research requires more boots on the ground

Other contributing forces include the fact that research institutes are increasingly in urban areas; that more scientists have childcare responsibilities that deter them from doing long or far-flung trips; that many feel the need to reduce their carbon footprint and that others want to avoid ‘helicoptering' in and out of a country to do fieldwork that local scientists could do.

Another major issue, says Sutherland, is that the fast track to career-boosting publications is to analyse, rather than physically collect, data.

“Supposing you do your PhD and you spend all your time doing fieldwork,” he says. “And the person sitting next to you has been extracting data [from day one]”. After three years, he says, they might have published in increasingly highly ranked journals, while “you're still in the Amazon catching fish”.

In this study, we proposed a weighted loss hard constraint physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) called WHC-PINN. WHC-PINN solves hyperbolic equations with the aid of a gradient weighting approach and by applying hard constraints. Euler equations are chosen for analysis and validation of WHC-PINN, as they represent a common and useful model for compressible fluid flow that includes shock waves and contact discontinuities. This is an important test case from a practical point of view, as resolving discontinuities with PINNs remains challenging. Accordingly, we explore two well-known fundamental problems of Euler equations, i.e., Riemann, and the converging-diverging nozzle. While solvers in other studies have successfully addressed one of the converging-diverging nozzle or Riemann problems with different formulations, our proposed solver can tackle both problems with the unified conservative formulations by incorporating specific features. Furthermore, given the distinct nature of the two selection problems, WHC-PINN solver is capable of addressing both initial value and boundary value problems, and we think that WHC-PINN is a step forward in using PINNs as a general-purpose compressible flow solver. Through comparing WHC-PINN results and analytical solutions, WHC-PINN could accurately capture the shock locations.

This story contains graphic imagery.

On August 4, 2024, when now-US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was still a presidential candidate, he posted a video on X in which he admitted to dumping a dead bear cub near an old bicycle in Central Park 10 years prior, in a mystifying attempt to make the young bear's premature death look like a cyclist's hit and run.

At the time, Kennedy said he was trying to get ahead of a story The New Yorker was about to publish that mentioned the incident. But in coming clean, Kennedy solved a decade-old New York City mystery: How and why had a young black bear—a wild animal native to the state, but not to modern-era Manhattan—been found dead under a bush near West 69th Street in Central Park?

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from public records requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

WIRED has obtained documents that shed new light on the incident from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation via a public records request. The documents—which include previously unseen photos of the bear cub—resurface questions about the bizarre choices Kennedy says he made, which left city employees dealing with the aftermath and lamenting the cub's short life and grim fate.

A representative for Kennedy did not respond for comment. The New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Parks Department referred WIRED to the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. NYDEC spokesperson Jeff Wernick tells WIRED that its investigation into the death of the bear cub was closed in late 2014 “due to a lack of sufficient evidence” to determine whether state law had been violated. They added that New York's environmental conservation law forbids “illegal possession of a bear without a tag or permit and illegal disposal of a bear” and that “the statute of limitations for these offenses is one year.”

The first of a number of emails between local officials coordinating the handling of the baby bear's remains was sent at 10:16 am on October 6, 2014. Bonnie McGuire, then-deputy director at Urban Park Rangers, told two colleagues that UPR sergeant Eric Handy had recently called her about a “dead black bear” found in Central Park.

“NYPD told him they will treat it like a crime scene, so he can't get too close,” McGuire wrote. “I've asked him to take pictures and send them over and to keep us posted.”

“Poor little guy!” McGuire wrote in a separate email later that morning.

According to emails obtained by WIRED, Handy updated several colleagues throughout the day, noting that the Department of Environmental Conservation had arrived on scene and that the agency was planning to coordinate with the NYPD to transfer the body to the Bronx Zoo, where it would be inspected by the NYPD's animal cruelty unit and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. (This didn't end up happening, as NYDEC took the bear to a state lab near Albany.)

Imagery of the bear has been public before—local news footage from October 2014 appears to show it from a distance. However, the documents WIRED obtained show previously unpublished images that investigators took of the bear on the scene, which Handy sent as attachments in emails to McGuire. The bear is seen laying on its side in an unnatural position. Its head protrudes from under a bush and rests next to a small patch of grass. Bits of flesh are visible through the bear's black fur, which was covered in a few brown leaves.

A report attributed to Handy and his partner, identified as “A. Ioannidis,” notes that the bear “had multiple injuries to its body, rear legs, and jaw.”

“Further inspection of [the] hour seems to indicate bear was hit by a car,” read notes obtained by WIRED, which appear to have been handwritten at 4 pm on October 6, though it's unclear by whom.

Handy also communicated with Caroline Greenleaf—the director of community relations for the Central Park Conservancy, which had tipped UPR off about the bear—on October 6. “Thanks for letting us know about the bear!” Handy wrote in a 5:52 pm email. “Definitely a first for Central Park.”

“All around strange day,” Greenleaf replied. “I will be very interested in hearing the necropsy results.” Handy agreed in his reply the next morning, saying the previous day was “definitely strange.”

A NYDEC law enforcement complaint summary obtained by WIRED describes the analysis of the bear's body conducted the next day by agency wildlife health biologist Kevin Hynes.

“Mr. Hynes stated the cause of death to the less than one-year-old female bear cub was massive blunt force trauma consistent with a motor vehicle strike,” the report reads. “Injuries included spinal fractures, all legs broken, and skull fractures severe enough for the majority of its brain to be lost through its mouth.”

This is consistent with the preliminary forensic necropsy report Hynes eventually produced for the NYDEC, which WIRED obtained via a public records request. The report—which Business Insider covered in 2024—recontextualizes a photo included in the 2024 New Yorker story in which Kennedy is shown sticking his hand inside the mouth of the deceased bear cub. As reported by Business Insider, the necropsy notes that in addition to brain tissue being found in the bear's mouth, it was also in her “trachea and upper bronchus.” It also notes that “the remaining brain tissue is scrambled, liquefied, and hemorrhagic.”

The necropsy also reveals that the cub lived just seven to eight months and that it was female. An Department of Environmental Conservation report obtained by WIRED notes that she “was healthy and eating [natural] sources of food” prior to death.

Based on Hynes' analysis of the physical evidence and the known range of her species, the NYDEC report hypothesizes that the bear was struck and killed by a car, “possibly along the lower Route 87 portion of the NYS Thruway around the NY/NJ border around Rockland or Orange County.”

At this point, it's useful to examine what precisely Kennedy said about the incident in his August 2024 video, in which he is speaking with, for some reason, Roseanne Barr.

“I was taking a group of people falconing up in Goshen, New York, up in the Hudson Valley,” Kennedy says. (Goshen is in Orange County, NY, home to a bear population that Hynes theorized the cub may have belonged to.) “And then a woman in a van in front of me hit a bear and killed it.”

Kennedy claims that he put the bear in his van with a plan to “skin the bear” and “put the meat in my refrigerator,” because she was in “very good condition.”

“And you can do that in New York State; you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear,” Kennedy adds.

He and his friends had a wonderful time falconing, Kennedy says, and the day grew late. Eventually, he found himself running behind for a trip “right back to the city” for dinner at Peter Luger Steak House—presumably the original location in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, rather than its Long Island location—and decided he didn't have enough time to drop off the bear at his Westchester, New York, home. So the bear came to (apparently) Brooklyn. But when Kennedy's dinner also ran long, he realized he had to go to the airport.

“I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,” Kennedy says, insisting for the second time that he was absolutely not breaking any laws that day. “I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of. I said, ‘Let's go put the bear in Central Park, and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike.' It'd be fun, funny for people.” He explains that there had been “a series” of fatal bicycle accidents around that time—there had been two in recent months—which inspired the idea.

In the video, Kennedy claims that he was surprised to wake up the next morning and find that the story of a dead baby black bear in Central Park was big news—again, bears do not live in Central Park outside of its zoo—and had prompted a major law enforcement response. What made Kennedy especially anxious, he claims, was a news report that said the bike was being sent to a forensic lab for fingerprinting.

As HellGate summarized shortly after Kennedy's video was posted, “???????????”

Despite the new documents that WIRED is able to disclose, there are lingering questions about the decisions Kennedy made that day in 2014. Let's review the timeline: The bear was discovered on the morning of Monday, October 6, 2014. If Kennedy indeed disposed of the bear the night before, that would have been Sunday, October 5, 2014.

Kennedy claims that he found the bear in the Hudson Valley area on a road approaching Goshen, New York. Stopping in Westchester on his way to Peter Luger would have added about 35 to 70 minutes to the trip. Perhaps, even if he was meeting friends familiar with his purported love for animal carcasses (his daughter once alleged he decapitated a dead whale with a chainsaw, strapped its head to the top of his minivan, and brought it home, though a subsequent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration investigation said her claim was “unfounded”), he would've been unacceptably late. But why couldn't Kennedy have just abandoned his mission to skin and butcher this baby bear by placing it in a wooded area anywhere between Goshen and New York City, especially knowing that he had a flight later? Only one man knows the answer.

It's also unclear why Kennedy chose the specific location he did to dump the cub's body. If he was driving to one of the three airports closest to Peter Luger, that would be strange, because there is no direct route to any of them that comes remotely close to West 69th Street. Does this mean Kennedy drove 20 to 40 minutes out of the way to drop off the bear, then completely changed direction to drive 22 to 65 minutes to one of those airports? Alternatively, Kennedy could've been going to Westchester County Airport. In this scenario, dumping the bear where he did in Central Park would've added about 45 minutes to his trip. The problem here is that Kennedy lived just 15 minutes from this airport at the time, meaning it would've taken less time for him to get to the airport if he had just brought the bear to his home.

For that matter, was Brooklyn's Prospect Park ever considered? Why couldn't he have simply gotten in touch with city or state authorities if he was intent on not keeping the bear?

We may not have the answers to any of these questions, but we can say one thing for certain: Kennedy planned to skin this baby black bear and store her meat in his refrigerator, then decided he didn't have time and disposed of her under a bush. This left concerned public servants to treat her body with respect and determine what may have happened to her. Unfortunately, for a bear whose life was cut far too short, maybe that was the best possible outcome.

Update: 1/7/2025, 12:35 PM EDT: WIRED has corrected a reference to a bear sighting in Brooklyn's Prospect Park.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Razr Fold Adds a Book-Style Foldable to Motorola's Lineup","https://www.wired.com/story/motorola-razr-fold-ces-2026/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 01:00:00 GMT","

Motorola has been honing its flip-style folding Razr smartphones for more than five years now, but it's finally time for a new style of fold.

At CES 2026, the company unveiled the Razr Fold, its first book-style folding phone akin to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold series or Google's Pixel Fold, bringing more competition to the space in the US.

If you've seen Google's or Samsung's options, the Razr Fold will look and feel familiar. It has a 6.6-inch display on the front screen, and when you open it up, you're treated to an 8.1-inch 2K resolution screen, around the same size as its competitors.

Book-style designs seem to be taking over the foldable market.

Over on the back, the design resembles Motorola's other smartphones with a sloped camera module housing a triple-camera system comprised entirely of 50-megapixel camera sensors: The primary camera is joined by an ultrawide and a 3X optical camera. There's a 32-megapixel external selfie camera and an internal 20-megapixel selfie shooter when the phone is unfolded. It comes in Pantone Blackened Blue and Pantone Lily White, and there's a woven vegan leather finish.

Motorola didn't share many other details about the phone—including the price—but the company says it'll release more information in the coming months. The Razr Fold is expected to launch this summer. While Motorola is playing catch-up to the book-style trend here, Samsung showed off its TriFold folding phone at CES, which can expand into a 10-inch tablet.

The Razr Fold's camera array.

Side view when folded.

Motorola is the official smartphone partner of the FIFA World Cup this year, and to mark the event, the company is releasing a FIFA World Cup 2026 Edition of the Razr 2025.

This is the same base Razr phone the company announced last year, just dolled up in green and with a badge on the back that marks the 2026 World Cup event. That design continues into the software, which is also themed for the World Cup with special wallpapers and even a new ringtone.

If you're green with envy, the good news is that this isn't some limited-edition model—while it'll be exclusive to Motorola.com and Verizon at first, on February 12, it'll be available in other retail channels like Amazon later on. Thankfully, you're not paying more, as it still costs $700.

The Signature.

Motorola does have another actual new phone: the Signature. It's a new line of “premium” phones, but the catch is that these devices won't be sold in the US. For its candy-bar phones, Motorola has dipped its toes into flagship territory every so often, only to dip back out as it struggles to compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung; it's predominantly known for its Moto G budget phones, particularly in the US.

The Signature is just 6.99 millimeters thick—it's no iPhone Air, but that's thinner than your usual handset—and it has a fabric-like material on the back. It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chipset, has four 50-megapixel cameras on the back, and carries a 5,200-mAh silicon-carbon battery in tow. More importantly, Motorola is finally committing to seven years of blanket software updates for this phone. It's a shame US customers won't be able to enjoy that.

Project Maxwell has a camera, a microphone, and voice control.

On the artificial intelligence front, Motorola and its parent company, Lenovo, are working together on a unified AI assistant called Qira. It's the culmination of several AI features both companies have deployed over the years, just in one platform.

It's powered by various large language models, from Copilot and Perplexity to Google's Gemini, along with Motorola and Lenovo's own in-house LLMs. The idea is that instead of reaching for these various services, you can just ask Qira, no matter if you're on a Lenovo laptop or a Motorola phone. It'll launch first on Lenovo PCs later this year, then select Razr, Edge, and Signature devices.

Qira also powers Project Maxwell, a concept AI pendant from Motorola's 312 Labs. If you're tired of pulling out your smartphone to snap a pic and search for something, well, this wearable solves exactly that. It has a camera and microphone, so just tap the touch-sensitive button on the front and ask a question about whatever you're looking at—whether you want to know what kind of tree is in front of you, or if you want to add the date of a concert into your calendar if you're staring at a poster.

Another use case Motorola suggested? If you're attending a speech or convention, ask Project Maxwell to listen in and then “draft a LinkedIn post” summarizing the event. (This explains LinkedIn a lot.)

Project Maxwell is just a concept, and there are no plans to turn it into a real product, but it's an alternative to camera-enabled smart glasses that are supposed to do the same thing. Or you could, you know, just pull out your phone.

Finally, Motorola has a trio of new devices under its Moto Things brand. There's a new 47-mm Moto Watch—no, it doesn't run Google's Wear OS but a proprietary system, but that helps it get 13 days of battery life (or seven days with the always-on OLED display enabled). Motorola says it partnered with fitness brand Polar to power the health-tracking features on the smartwatch, and it'll go on sale starting January 22.

There's also the Moto Pen Ultra, a new pressure-sensitive stylus with tilt detection that'll also work with the Razr Fold (though unlike the Moto G Stylus, it's not housed in the phone itself). It comes with a nifty carrying case that doubles as a battery. Naturally, it also enables some AI capabilities, like handwriting beautification and Sketch to Image, so you can turn doodles into prettier sketches. It'll launch in the US in the coming months.

And finally, there's a second-gen Moto Tag 2, which will be available in the US, though Motorola didn't share a precise timeline or price. It features ultra-wideband tech to precisely locate your devices (if supported) and IP68 water resistance, but the big upgrade is to battery life: It'll keep ticking for more than 500 days. It works with Google's Find Hub app, but you can also use Motorola's Moto Tag app instead. There's a button on the tracker, and if you press it, it'll ring your phone if you have misplaced it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Venezuela Is the First Big Test for the Pentagon's Influencer Press Corps—and It's Failing","https://www.wired.com/story/venezuela-pentagon-press-corps/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:00:00 GMT","

In the days following the kidnapping of Venezuela president Nicolás Maduro, members of the Pentagon's new right-wing influencer press corps weren't reporting on the operation. Instead, they were enforcing loyalty in a manner similar to the Iraq war bloggers of the early 2000s.

On Monday, Laura Loomer tried to crowdsource information on Pentagon press officials who may have leaked information to the mainstream media. “The White House account better be cooking up a sick edit,” Cam Higby, a right-wing influencer and member of the Pentagon press corps, wrote on X Saturday morning, as news of Maduro's arrest broke. Monica Paige, a reporter for Turning Point USA, opted to slam the former Biden administration, reposting a 2020 post from Joe Biden about Trump admiring dictators with the now infamous image of a blindfolded Maduro. Joey Mannarino, an influencer with more than 650,000 followers on X, spent Sunday debating whether to support vice president JD Vance or Marco Rubio as president for 2028.

These influencers were all granted Pentagon press credentials in November after the Pentagon rolled out a new press policy forbidding journalists from accessing information the Defense Department—which the administration styles as the War Department—does not make readily available to them. Most mainstream outlets—including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox News—refused to sign on to it, forcing an exodus of military beat reporters from the ranks of the Pentagon's official press corps. Weeks later, the Pentagon replaced them with Trump-friendly influencers from organizations like Turning Point USA, as well as independent creators like Tim Pool, a right-wing political commentator.

The new press corp has only received one official briefing from Defense Department press secretary Kingsley Wilson, who leveraged the moment to attack the old-guard journalists who had left. Before joining the Pentagon, Wilson ran digital media for the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank.

“Legacy media chose to self-deport from this building,” Wilson said. “We're not going to beg these old gatekeepers to come back, and we're not rebuilding a broken model to appease them. Instead, we're welcoming new media outlets that actually reach Americans.”

This model has clearly not been about journalism, or access to information. So far, the Pentagon's crew of right-wing influencers haven't reported any new information related to the Venezuela raid. Several of them, including Higby, have turned their attention to alleged childcare fraud in Minnesota, chasing the same story that right-wing creator Nick Shirley claimed to uncover in a viral YouTube video last week. (Local Minnesota outlets have been covering this story for years.)

This moment feels reminiscent of the early days of the Iraq war, where pro-war bloggers promised a similarly unrestrained alternative to mainstream coverage. These bloggers built entire audiences attacking writers in the mainstream press and other independent blogs who criticized the war, pushing narratives that supported the US's invasion of Iraq. In the days since Maduro's capture, creators like Lancevideos, who is part of the Pentagon's official press corps, have called congressional critics like Thomas Massie “libtards” for criticizing the operation. He's gone on to call for additional raids as well, writing, “Could Iran be next? USA kidnapping spree must continue” on X.

So far, it doesn't appear as if any of these newly credentialed Pentagon press members have reported any real news on the raid or even received a single briefing on the matter. Instead, they've created countless memes and posts blindly supporting the operation—which is likely why the Pentagon brought them on in the first place.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

“The influencers, they sound like these armchair warriors who wrote their blogs at home and parroted a lot of what the military said,” says Melissa Wall, a journalism professor at California State University, Northridge, who has written extensively about the warblogging movement of the 2000s. “Are they actually getting any real information? Are they just taking press releases or whatever is given to them?”

On Monday, defense secretary Pete Hegseth launched what the Pentagon is calling an Arsenal of Freedom Tour. During the tour's first stop at a Virginia shipyard on Monday, he was accompanied by only one mainstream outlet, CNN, and a host of right-wing media figures, according to Status News. One of these figures, John Konrad, was overheard trying to find an opportunity to get Hegseth to autograph a book he authored. (Konrad told Status that the autograph was “not for me.”)

“They can just flood the zone,” says Wall of the Pentagon's new press corp. “They can just put out so much content you can't really find the truth.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","You Love Your Ultrawide Gaming Monitor. What About an Ultrawide Gaming Laptop?","https://www.wired.com/story/lenovo-legion-pro-gaming-laptop-ultrawide-rollable-screen/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 01:00:00 GMT","

For a conventional computer company, Lenovo never fails to make a splash at CES, regardless of whether the experimental products are actually practical to use.

This year, the company has not one but two laptops with rollable OLED screens, one of which is a gaming laptop that can expand its display horizontally, adding an extra eight inches of screen real estate—all with the press of just a single key.

You never knew you needed a screen that could do that, but it's exactly the kind of oddball tech CES is all about.

The first rollable experiment this year is the most daring, the Legion Pro Rollable Concept. It's a 16-inch gaming laptop with a screen that can expand horizontally to a 21.5-inch “Tactical” mode, or all the way up to a 24-inch “Arena” mode. Let's be real: a screen much wider than the laptop housing it looks wacky. And it requires the laptop lid to be comically thick.

But with the popularity of ultrawide external monitors for gaming, it does make a certain amount of sense. A 24-inch screen coming from the footprint of a 16-inch laptop is pretty awesome especially if you're someone who wants to take their gaming laptop on the go, whether while traveling or even just from one part of your house to another. Like the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable OLED laptop that came out last year, the full OLED screen is hidden until triggered to unroll with a key press. In this case, the laptop uses two motors that unrolls the screen in both directions simultaneously, giving you that ultrawide aspect ratio when fully expanded. Beyond that, it's built on the chassis of a Legion Pro 7i, so in theory a laptop like this would feature high-end components similar to what's in that model, like RTX 5090 graphics and the latest Intel processors.

Lenovo has also announced the ThinkPad Rollable XD Concept, which iterates on its previous rollable design that expands the screen vertically. It still starts with smaller OLED display (this time a 13.3-inch screen) and can be expanded up to 16 inches with one keystroke. This is an even more dramatic transformation than last year's ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable, which starts at a 14-inch size before growing.

The back of the lid shows some screen too.

The screen expanded.

Rather than hiding the extra screen real estate rolled up under the hinge, this new concept gives you use of it on the lid. Lenovo calls this a “world-facing” screen, but it's not clear exactly what the use case for this additional display area would be. The demo unit had some placeholder widgets but nothing that functioned yet.

This is not Lenovo's first exploration of putting screens on the lid, but so far they have been always-on, digital-ink screens that only sip power and don't tax the battery too much. I do like the look of this design better, especially being able to see the screen wrap around the top. The problem is that it requires the webcam to sit over on the side, kind of like on an iPad. Definitely not an ideal spot for video calls.

Both of these rolling-screen computers are mere concepts at this point, but Lenovo has a track record of actually releasing some of these flashy tech concepts.

Lenovo is also announcing the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist. This was a concept we first saw a few years ago, which uses a motorized hinge to twist the screen around in either direction. This enables the device to follow you around a room during a video call and even transform into tablet mode just by using a voice command. It still feels like a bit of a work in progress, but it shows that these proof-of-concept projects are more than just novelties.

Lenovo even announced a price for the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist. It will start at $1,649 when it arrives in June.

The Lenovo ThinkPad with the Space Frame design.

Lenovo also announced some more conventional PCs at CES. There's a new superlight laptop, the Yoga Slim 7i Ultra. Of the company's new laptops, this is the one I could most easily see myself using. It weighs only 2.2 pounds yet feels sturdy and premium. It looks like it was meant to go head-to-head with the Asus Zenbook A14, one of our favorite laptops from 2025.

Meanwhile, the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon and ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 look like last year's models on the outside, but both have a renewed focus on user repairability. Notably, you can now replace the battery yourself and buy a new one from Lenovo. This is something Lenovo already does on some of the thicker ThinkPads, and IT admins will love it. It's no Framework Laptop, of course, but it's a step in the right direction.

The laptops have also been redesigned internally, following a design pattern Lenovo calls Space Frame. These PCs now have a dual-sided motherboard, meaning some components have been moved to the back of the motherboard, such as the display connector. This allows Lenovo to use a much smaller board, saving interior space and enabling better cooling without the need for a thicker chassis. Lenovo has also made it easier to get into the laptop; the guts can be accessed from the bottom or through the keyboard, all with fewer screws.

The new ThinkPad X9 15p and ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 will start at $1,999 and will be available in March.

The Lenovo Yoga AIO. The “foot” of the PC is transparent.

Lastly, the company had a couple of really interesting all-in-one PCs to show off. The all-in-one, where the entire computer is built into the monitor, is a form factor I continue to like, despite so few companies releasing new models these days. Even Apple has shrunk its iMac line to just a single option, so it's nice to see Lenovo breathe some fresh air into the category.

One, the ThinkCentre X AIO, has a 16:18 aspect ratio, giving it a nearly square screen. It's an interesting alternative to rotating your screen entirely vertical. There's also the Yoga AIO Aura Edition 32, which has one of the boldest designs on a monitor I've ever seen. The whole screen leans on the table, held up by a translucent bottom bezel. Although you can't adjust the height, it has a futuristic look that I'd love to have on my desk at home. Lenovo hasn't provided a release date or price for the ThinkCentre X AIO, but the Yoga AIO 32 will have a starting price of $2,400 and will launch in the second quarter of 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How to Build a Home Pilates Setup That Feels Studio-Level","https://www.wired.com/story/the-best-pilates-at-home-equipment/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

When Joseph Pilates developed what he first called Contrology in the early 20th century, there were no dedicated studios or intimidating contraptions. There wasn't even a reformer yet. (That came later, improvised from leather straps and hospital bed frames.) The idea was simple then, and it still is now: Pilates asks you to work with what you already have. Your body does the work, and a mat just makes it more comfortable.

Pilates is about moving with intention. Total body exercises are rooted in precision and balance, favoring slow, controlled movements over momentum or strength. Full range of motion, emphasizing time under tension, deep core engagement, and uniformity of mind, body, and spirit are emphasized. It sounds peaceful, but it's not exactly the easiest workout.

The right gear won't do the workout for you, but it can make it more comfortable, more effective, and frankly, more fun. Below, we've gathered the best Pilates equipment worth having for home workouts, whether you're a beginner or deep in your Pilates princess era. For more wellness recommendations, check out our other guides, including the Best Protein Powders, Best Massage Guns, and Yoga Mats, Props, and Everything Else You Need for Your Practice.

Nothing motivates me to work out quite like a great Pilates outfit. You can technically wear just about anything, but I would stick to more fitted activewear, so your Pilates instructor can check your form. Avoid loose or oversized clothing, and prioritize stretchy fabrics that won't restrict movement. This lineup of athleisure has been tried and tested in Pilates; they move well, feel comfortable, and hold up every session.

If you buy one thing, make it grippy socks. Whether you're on a mat or a reformer machine, those rubberized soles help prevent slipping and sliding, giving you better traction and stability during movements. A good pair can also offer light cushioning and arch support. If you're practicing in a shared studio or using communal equipment, breathable Pilates socks are a hygienic upgrade, too.

We want our bottoms to stay put through roll-ups, leg circles, and long pulses, without digging or losing shape. They also need to be squat-proof. High-waisted leggings (full-length or capri) made from a soft, stretchy fabric are ideal for Pilates and other low-impact workouts. Biker shorts also work, but in a heated class, an extra layer of fabric can help maintain grip on props during leg work.

These are the best leggings for Pilates based on our testing, including a Lululemon biker short we love. For more favorites, check out our Best Leggings guide.

For Pilates, look for low- to medium-impact styles that are typically supportive without feeling compressive. I gravitate toward wide bands with no underwires that won't dig in during floor work, but I'm also aware that those features might not be supportive for bigger busts. These are our top favorites, including a posture-correcting bra if alignment or lower back pain is a concern. For more picks, check out our Best Sports Bras guide.

You can absolutely do Pilates with nothing but yourself, but if you want to turn up the intensity or vary your workout routines, here are a few must-haves.

Exercise mats are essential because they deliver much-needed padding to cushion your joints during floor work. The proper ones are designed with a grippy, textured surface for added traction. They keep you steady, supporting better control. And they serve as a protective barrier between your skin and the yucky floor.

I also always need a towel when working out, and if you're taking a heated class, this is especially necessary to absorb sweat. Pro tip: You can also turn your towel into a resistance band by twisting it and pulling against it. For more picks, check out our Best Yoga Mats guide.

You don't need to splurge on a $2,000 reformer to practice Pilates at home. I take heated mat Pilates at my local fitness studio twice a week, and we usually use a combination of props: an exercise ball, Pilates ring (aka. a magic circle), and light weights. I like to use 2- or 3-pound dumbbells, but wrist and ankle weights don't require grip strength and still add extra intensity to your full-body Pilates workout. Core sliders, which go under your hands or feet, add resistance to your movements and are an affordable alternative to the springs of a reformer.

Do you really need a robot arm to curl hair? No, but if you're demo-ing your new multi-styler for dozens of journalists a day, it probably helps. I also got to check out L'Oreal's newest multistyler, the Light Straight + Multi-styler, which will come out in 2027 and purports to curl and straighten hair while never going above 320 degrees Fahrenheit.

The device uses near-infrared light to reshape the internal hydrogen bonds in the hair, which will purportedly help preserve the hair's cuticle. I did touch the hair (it's real human hair!) after it was curled and styled. While my fingers are not a thermometer, it did feel noticeably cooler than when I've had my hair styled before. We loved the AirLight Pro when it came out and are looking forward to adding the multistyler to our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners when it becomes available.

I am a portable monitor fiend. I work with two screens at home, so when I travel, I tend to bring a portable monitor with me to replicate that experience and work more efficiently. Australian-brand Espresso makes some of my favorite portable screens, although the company often sits in the luxury segment—its aluminum portable monitors are impressively thin and are designed to match Apple's laptop hardware. But the newly announced Espresso Lite 15 is a bit of a departure to hit a lower price.

Instead of aluminum, it has a plastic build that comes in a range of fun colors (I love the orange and purple), but it has the same great 1080p and 60-Hz display as the standard Espresso 15. In fact, it goes a step further with improved brightness at 400 nits. There are two USB-C ports on the side to connect to a laptop, and it supports pass-through charging. These ports are centrally placed, and since the bezels are uniform, you can rotate the monitor to use it on either side of the laptop. Unlike Espresso's Pro models, this one doesn't have a touchscreen.

The whole thing weighs 1.55 pounds. It doesn't have a kickstand, but it can magnetically stick to Espresso's Stand+, which has been slightly updated to be lighter. Or you can use your own monitor stand. The Espresso Lite 15 goes on sale very soon for $249.

There's one major problem with open earbuds. They're one of the fastest-growing audio categories—not everyone wants to stick a bud inside their ear canal all day (and keep them clean). But if you have a pair of open earbuds, it guarantees that you'll need at least one other noise canceling pair for work or when you don't want to let ambient noise in.

Shokz announced the OpenFit Pro ($250) this week. These are Shokz's first open earbuds that have noise reduction properties. While traditional earbuds rely on having a sealed ear canal to block out noise, the OpenFit Pro has a triple microphone array and an adaptive ear algorithm to soften the background noise.

They are open earbuds so you won't be able to block 100 percent of the noise (also, I could wear a motorcycle helmet on the Venetian showroom floor and still hear people shouting in three different languages) but I do appreciate that Shokz has included accessories to make the fit much more secure. We will have a full review coming up soon.

The company also showcased concept smart glasses. There's a sport model but I only got to see and use the ones that are for visually impaired people. Again, a showroom floor is not the best place to test a lot of these things—when I tried them on and asked them to describe the scene, they just said “People! A lot of people on a convention floor!”—but it's a sign that other companies are interested in Meta's smart glasses crown.

The Ray-Ban Meta glasses.

Meta and WIRED teamed up for an event at the Wynn Hotel on Tuesday evening showcasing the latest in wearable technology. Kicking off the party was a lively panel discussion between Kelly Ingham from Meta and Kelly Hancox from Garmin (with me moderating) about the current partnership between the two companies and the state of smart glasses and smart watches—especially the ways data is being collected and how realtime stats are being displayed.

The party in full swing at Wynn Las Vegas.

The key takeaway from the talk is that if wearable tech is going to meaningfully evolve, not only do we need to see advances in sensors and software inside the devices, but we to keep sharing more data across devices. For example, whatever my watch knows about my body right now can be displayed in my glasses in real time already, but that sort of cross-platform sharing will only get more robust.

After the talk, attendees got to partake in demos of the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, as well as the Meta Ray-Ban Display. Some folks even sat for demos of the Quest headset and controllers. A fine time!

The Keychron Q Ultra Series.

Keychron makes some of our favorite keyboards, and the company's CES announcements take its hardware to the next level, with a new 8,000-Hz polling rate on its wireless Q Ultra series. (That's how many times the keyboard talks to the computer per second, meaning drastically low input lag; it's largely for competitive gamers.)

That's not all, though: Keychron says the Q Ultra series is the first mass-produced “ZMK” mechanical keyboard of its kind. That's an open-source keyboard firmware (the company usually uses QMK), and Keychron says it enables better battery life—660 hours in 8K polling rate in wireless mode, with the RGB lighting turned off. The Q Ultra series includes the Q6 Ultra (100 percent layout), Q3 Ultra (TKL layout), and Q1 Ultra (75 percent layout), and they cost $240, $230, and $230, respectively. They're available for purchase now. Keychron also has a V Ultra series, which have lighter, plastic cases and cost cheaper, with ZMK and similar battery life, though these keyboards won't launch until the end of January.

The Keychron marble keyboard is at the top, and the concrete is at the bottom.

Keychron always shows off a fun, special edition keyboard at these events, and this year, that's a marble and concrete keyboard. OK, so the keys on these keyboards aren't actually marble or concrete; instead, these unique materials are used in the keyboard's case. The Q1 HE 8K Marble Version has a 75 percent layout, uses magnetic Hall effect switches, and has ceramic keycaps, whereas the K2 HE Concrete has plastic keycaps. The marble felt significantly heavier than I expected compared to the concrete, but both look very cool and are a nice change of pace from the usual tech hardware.

You love a widescreen monitor for gaming. So how about a nice gaming laptop that expands into a widescreen gaming laptop? Lenovo's made one.

The Legion Pro Rollable Concept is a 16-inch gaming laptop with a screen that unrolls horizontally to a 21.5-inch “Tactical” mode, or all the way up to a 24-inch “Arena” mode. It's wacky, it's fun, it's CES!

When we test red light therapy masks, one of the most common testing criteria is whether or not the mask is comfortable and easy to wear. L'Oreal's new prototype silicone face mask and eye patches were developed with iSmart Developments and they feel light, soft, and flexible—hardly more uncomfortable than a one-time-use sheet mask. By my rough estimation, they are about 80 percent less likely to get your spouse to say you look like Jason Voorhees.

It's such a simple insight that it's hard to understand why no one has thought of this before. LED face masks (or neck collars, or eye patches) that are light, beautiful, and easy to use will make it easier for customers to wear.

The 200 LEDs are set in a (again, beautiful!) microcircuit to precisely control the emission of two selected wavelengths of light—red light (630 nm) and near-infrared light (830 nm). You can pick from two different timing sessions and the mask is expected to go on sale in 2027. Guive Balooch, L'Oreal's global vice president of technology, noted that usability is incredibly important for something that you're supposed to wear every day against your skin.

“It's the world's lightest face mask, near 1-mm thick,” Balooch said. While it's important to note that this is still a prototype, Balooch also said that the battery life is incredibly long, lasting for weeks of use instead of three or four uses or hours that is now standard. It also recharges via USB-C.

AI-based noise suppression is already baked into just about every piece of tech you already own, often times in multiple layers, but I've never seen anything this precise.

They're called the Voicebuds, and on their own, they're nothing special, but I was left intrigued by one simple demo. Standing just a couple of feet away in the bustling CES expo room, the representative (one of the founding team members) began talking quietly while wearing the earbuds—at a volume so low, I couldn't make out the words. He then showed me how his speech had been fully dictated on his phone, the earbuds picking out only his voice in the loud room. One of the other engineers at Subtle Computing, the startup responsible for the Voicebuds, also mentioned that it's equally impressive in a dead silent room, such as an office, where the earbuds would be able to dictate even a whisper. What makes it possible? They claim to have nailed its machine learning algorithm in a way that companies like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google haven't been able to do.

The idea of us all walking around whispering to our computers might sound dystopian, but I do think privacy is one of the main reasons people don't use voice control more often. Of course, the more practical use case is for those who depend entirely on voice for using their phones or PCs. The Voicebuds plan to launch this month and ship soon after, with pre-orders currently going for $199.

There are carpet cleaners, and there are robot vacuums. But have you ever seen a carpet cleaning robot vacuum? I think not, and it's my job to keep my eye on these things. Robotin showed what the company calls the first carpet cleaning robot, with a swappable wash-and-dry module and a deep-clean module. Not a trace of the Coke that the showperson spilled is left after washing, although I am pretty sure someone in my family could probably have thought of something grosser to spill on the carpet for a demo.

Most personal safety devices are discreet little devices, usually some kind of wearable jewelry or keychain. Not the Timeli. There's a camera right in the center of the flashlight, so you can point it in the direction of trouble to hopefully ward sketchy people away while also capturing live HD video. When you press the red emergency button, you'll hear a loud alarm until you're connected with a dispatcher from RapidSOS, who will analyze your real-time video footage to assess the threat and whether medical, fire, or police need to be dispatched. They'll also receive your live GPS coordinates. There's two-way communication, so you can provide specifics about the situation.

It's not just for emergencies. Timeli says you can push the red button whenever you feel unsafe and want a companion as you walk to your car in the parking lot. It supports cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, and you can use it with the companion app to fine-tune the flashlight's settings, from brightness to the alarm's volume. It can last up to 2 years on battery in standby mode, but it's USB-C rechargeable, and you can use it as a power bank to give it a dual purpose (the Timeli stops charging your phone when the battery is at 50 percent to make sure the flashlight isn't dead when there's a real emergency).

Naturally, it requires a subscription for the cellular and GPS features. You'll pay $300 for the Timeli, but at launch, you'll get a year bundled for free, after which you'll have to pay $10 per month. It ships in early February.

The X2.

There are always a lot of robots at CES, but this year, it feels like humanoid robots are everywhere. One company that has drawn the most crowds is AgiBot, mostly for this little dancing bot, the X2. My colleague Will Knight did a deep dive on the Chinese startup late last year, but the gist is that these robots are being trained to perform dextrous work in factories. This CES 2026 showing is the first time AgiBot has brought its products to the US, and AgiBot spokesperson Yuheng Feng says you can expect to see its robots deployed around the country starting this year (it has reportedly shipped 5,000 robots elsewhere in the world).

The A2 series robot is a full-size humanoid robot, and you can imagine it deployed in airports, convention centers, and campuses to help direct people, provide information, and even walk with people to specific locations. This model features autonomous navigation and is powered by multimodal large language models.

The A2.

Even Google's getting in on the humanoid robot craze—at CES 2026, the company announced it's working with Boston Dynamics to integrate its Gemini assistant on a humanoid robot called Atlas and the famous robot dog, Spot.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaking at CES 2025.

In a wide-ranging Q&A with press and analysts this morning at CES 2026, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed questions about Nvidia's ability to ship chips to China, the company's new Vera Rubin chip system, memory shortages, concerns about an AI bubble, and more.

A few notable remarks Huang made:

“Both of those facts are consistent,” Huang said. “We've had [the chips] back for some time, and we're quite rigorous. There's a fair amount of new technology, but those new technologies, to the best of our ability, have been de-risked…I don't want to take lightly what we're doing, but I have every confidence we're going to succeed."" When further pressed on whether that means the Vera Rubin chips are still in the testing and validation phase, Huang replied, “You're always in the validation phase.”

However, the Chinese government has also reportedly been telling companies there to refrain from using Nvidia's H20 chips—a less powerful chip that was designed specifically to be sanctions-friendly—and it's unclear whether that guidance will be extended to the H200. “I'm not expecting any declaration from the Chinese government"" that they're suddenly approved, Huang said. “When the purchase orders come, that will speak for itself.”

He also said he thought Nvidia could become one of the biggest CPU makers in the world, due to the amount of high-performance CPUs it's putting in data centers. (Shots fired at AMD?)

Even Jensen Huang gets tripped up at the start of the new year.

Victrola has something sweet for the vinyl lovers among us. It's called the Soundstage, and it's a platform that you place underneath your turntable. Inside are a stereo pair of forward-firing speakers and a down-firing woofer, so all of your speaker needs are housed in something that stays tucked under your record player. This means you don't need to make room for bookshelf speakers, an amp, or any of that messy business.

I know what you're thinking: Putting a turntable on top of something that vibrates will make the stylus vibrate in the record's groove and muddy up the sound. And yes, that's very true, which is why the Soundstage uses a driver design that cancels out low-frequency vibrations to dampen the rocking (but not the ""rocking""). This type of speaker is known in the audio biz as a symmetric drive woofer; it's common in soundbars and other compact speakers.

It works with nearly any turntable, but you can plug in more than a record player. The Soundstage has a 3.5-mm aux in, RCA ins, and a USB-C port. It also works wirelessly as a Bluetooth speaker or as an Auracast device. It will cost $350 and it will be here this summer.

Punkt MC03.

Swiss-based Punkt is back at CES with a follow-up to its 2024 MC02 privacy-focused smartphone: meet the MC03. The phone isn't flashy, though the hardware has improved this time around with features like wireless charging, IP68 water resistance, a 120-Hz OLED screen, and a 64-megapixel camera; oh, and the battery is removable (you just need to unscrew a few screws) to comply with recent EU regulations. But that's not necessarily why you're buying this phone—it's a vehicle for Apostrophy's AphyOS operating system (formerly called Apostrophy OS).

You can read more about AphyOS here, when I first covered them in 2024, but the OS is based on GrapheneOS, which is in turn based on Android. Your main home screen is called the Vault—you can only place Punkt-approved apps here (these apps go through a rigorous vetting process that takes about 20 days, if the app developers are compliant). That includes the entire suite of Proton apps, a new partnership between the companies. There are several changes to the interface to make it more user-friendly, with a few more customization options, such as the ability to choose what apps appear in the Vault.

The Vault.

The Wild Web.

Swipe left, and now you're in the “Wild Web,” which is where you can download curated open-source apps from the AphyOS App Hub. During the onboarding process, the company has also made it significantly easier to install the Google Play Store (if you want it), meaning you can still get all your favorite apps and use them in the Wild Web. Each of these apps is sandboxed to severely limit what data is sent back to Google. You can also rotate a nifty slider in the company's Ledger app to restrict how much data access you want to grant an app (restrict too much, and some functions of certain apps may not work).

It's unclear right now if the improvements to the software will make it back to the MC02, as the company says some of the new capabilities are hardware-dependent. The MC03 also has a Secure Element to store encryption keys for tougher security.

Punkt says the phone is manufactured in Germany by Gigaset (though many of the phone's components are not made in Germany). It's powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 chip with 8 GB of RAM, and it'll get 5 years of security updates. It costs $699 and includes a year of AphyOS. After that, you'll have to pay $10 per month—the idea is that you're paying to own your data, as AphyOS doesn't collect or sell your data. It'll ship in Europe at the end of January and will arrive in the US in the spring.

Petter Neby, founder and CEO of Punkt, tells me two other OEMs will make phones running AphyOS this year, though they're more likely to cater to the enterprise sector instead of the average consumer.

Watching the parade of ever-larger and -heavier electric SUVs, trucks, and crossovers can be a bore. Which is why we perked up at the sight of French company Aemotion's car-motorcycle hybrid on the CES floor. The lithe two-seater can hit 70 miles per hour, and travel more than 120 miles on a charge thanks to two swappable batteries. In Europe, the petite four-wheeler is categorized as an autocycle, allowing it to cruise expressways and motorways, and—crucially—lane-split in most European countries, so that riders can smugly sail by traffic.

The nifty vehicle is due to go into full production in France in 2027, and a select few could start in fleet pilots as early as this year. Allons-y!

An electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important tool for treating neurological disorders, as well as mental health and sleep challenges. Unfortunately, they're pretty hard to administer—you have to lie down in a room with a person putting little electrodes over your head and then looking at real-time readouts (I made my aunt do one on me when she worked in a neurologist's office).

This week, Naox Technologies made two announcements. The first is that its wired in-ear EEG earbuds, the Naox Link, just received FDA clearance.

These are not direct-to-consumer buds, but are intended to be used with medical professionals in settings like sleep labs or clinics. Still, this is a huge upgrade to the laborious sticking-sensors-on-your-head thing.

The company also announced the Naox Wave, pictured at the top of the post. These are the consumer buds that are not FDA-cleared and are not intended for medical use, but also track brain activity. They come with a connected app, so whenever you're wearing your earbuds throughout the day, you can check if your meditation or workout session actually calmed you down. And these are actually real wireless earbuds, so you don't have to put them in and listen to nothing. You can actually take your calls and listen to music while monitoring your brain activity.

Hugo Dinh, the CEO and cofounder of Naox, noted that you can actually see noticeable differences in your brain health once you do things like pick up a meditation practice. If my AirPods Pro 3 could pick up anything from my brainwaves right now, the app would be bright red alarms and indicating nothing but PURE PANIC, I'm sure. Maybe I will find a meditation device on the show floor to calm me down.

A personal car that can do all your driving for you might not exist yet. But the up and coming robocar-maker Tensor and the automotive safety supplier Autoliv are thinking ahead. They've debuted a foldable steering wheel that smoothly tucks away once a car transitions from human driver to software one. The manufacturers have thought through how the wheel will work, safety-wise. When humans are in control and using the steering wheel, a crash will trigger the airbag inside the wheel. When the car has transitioned to autonomous mode, another airbag inside the vehicle's instrument panel deploys instead.

Such unusual designs usually need sign-off from safety regulators. Tensor says it'll get the right approvals before it starts sending its vehicles to customers, slated in Europe and North America for some point next year. The company, which began as the Chinese tech developer AutoX but divested from its Chinese operations last year, plans to sell cars that can do much of the driving by themselves. In October, Tensor inked a deal with Lyft to deploy robotaxis in Europe and North America starting in 2027.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Amazon Brings Alexa+ to the Web as AI Competition Heats Up","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/amazon-brings-alexa-to-the-web-as-ai-competition-heats-up-180081.html","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:01:51 GMT","

Alexa+, Amazon's AI-powered digital assistant, is coming to a browser near you.

The internet's largest retailer announced Monday that it has launched Alexa.com, a website that lets Alexa+ users access the AI assistant in a web browser, with some caveats.

Initially, access to the site will be limited to Alexa+ Early Access users. When the early access period ends, all Amazon Prime members will be able to access Alexa+ for free. Non-Prime members can buy a standalone subscription for US$19.95 a month.

With over 600 million Alexa-enabled devices purchased worldwide, Alexa is already deeply integrated into daily life, Amazon explained in a statement, but to truly serve as a personal assistant, Alexa+ needs to be available wherever its users are — at home, on their phone, and now on the web.

Users can use Alexa.com to get quick answers, explore complex topics, create content, plan trip itineraries, and get help with homework, Amazon continued.

What's more, it added, Alexa+ can take action, performing tasks such as managing to-do lists, updating family calendars, controlling a smart home, and making reservations. It also provides persistent context and continuity, allowing access to Alexa on whichever device or interface best serves the task at hand, with all previous chats, preferences, and personalization seamlessly carrying over.

“It's definitely a move to broaden the platform reach of Alexa and put it on a more competitive footing with Gemini and ChatGPT,” said Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.

“Many people associate Alexa strongly with the Echo speakers,” he told TechNewsWorld, “but with this new platform, Alexa+, it will be given far greater range and have a far greater scope of intelligence.”

Amazon has devices and services that span nearly every facet of a consumer's life, from entertainment — Prime Video, Fire TV — to smart home — Ring, Echo — to retail — Amazon marketplace, Whole Foods — plus assets wrapped around the consumer tech ecosystem like advertising and AWS, explained Jennifer Kent, senior vice president and principal analyst at Parks Associates, a market research and consulting company specializing in consumer technology products, in Dallas.

“If Amazon wants Alexa+ to compete with ChatGPT, Gemini, and other LLMs, it needs to be broadly accessible to users, not just on Amazon-ecosystem devices,” she told TechNewsWorld.

“Google has an advantage being built directly into the web browser, and while that's a tough competitive disadvantage to overcome, it's imperative for Amazon to get Alexa+ onto the web as well,” she added.

Alexa.com showcases that Amazon is getting more serious about its AI efforts, maintained Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.

“It's important for Alexa to have a web presence if Amazon truly wants to compete in the growing AI market,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Because of Amazon's massive brand and footprint, Alexa has a fighting chance to be a top three AI platform,” added Greg Sterling, co-founder of Near Media, a market research firm in San Francisco.

“Its installed base of millions of Alexa device users may also help it gain usage,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Rich Pleeth, co-founder of Finmile, an AI logistics SaaS company in London, explained that with Alexa.com, Amazon is solving its biggest input hurdle. “Voice is excellent for quick commands, and Alexa has ultimately dominated that space, but it is not great for much beyond that,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Having a presence on the web allows for research on your laptop and seamlessly hand off some elements to an Alexa Echo device.”

“What we are seeing from Amazon now is a major move toward agentic AI, where Alexa doesn't just provide a simple answer; it will execute workflows, such as booking your entire holiday, reserving a restaurant, and such,” he said. “It's almost a life hub or personal chief of staff. It will be interesting to see what Google's answer is.”

Chris Sorensen, CEO of ArmorHQ, an online provider of call protection and deliverability solutions, agreed that Alexa.com will address the limitations of a voice interface. “Alexa, based on a browser, should, in theory, help remove the friction of voice-only interaction and allow users to better engage with the assistant in more complex, text-driven tasks, such as planning, comparison shopping, and information gathering,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“I do believe a web presence is important as it helps extend Alexa's role beyond convenience into productivity,” he added. “Voice assistants work well for quick commands, but browsers are where users spend time making decisions. In reality, Alexa.com gives Amazon the ability to access higher intent moments that were probably out of reach previously.”

Alexa isn't just about running your home anymore, added Alix Gallardo, chief product officer at Invent, a brand development and e-commerce company in Schaumburg, Ill.

“The assistant is now capable of handling research and real productivity tasks,” she told TechNewsWorld. “It's becoming way more useful, almost like a cross between a home helper and a personal assistant that works everywhere. This also makes it a lot more relevant for day-to-day work tasks.”

“With everything running through the browser, you get a smoother and more connected experience,” she explained. “It all feels like one continuous thing, whether you're at your desk or on your phone. That's huge for anyone who wants things to ‘just work,' across the board.”

Amazon's move to put Alexa+ on the web is a quiet but major shift, contended Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research, a technology advisory firm in Las Vegas. “Essentially, the company is admitting that voice-only assistants are no longer enough,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If users now start their AI workflow in a browser tab, Alexa has to meet them there.”

“However,” he continued, “this move also changes the competitive test. Once Alexa sits beside ChatGPT and Gemini in the same browser context, users will compare speed, quality, and task follow-through, not just novelty. Amazon is choosing direct, side-by-side competition rather than hiding behind the Echo device base.”

“But here's the most salient point: the most strategic angle is action, not answers,” he said. “The web version leans into to-do lists, calendars, reservations, and smart home controls, which is where a general chatbot often stops short.”

“Amazon's built-in advantage is commerce and household integration,” he added. “If Alexa can plan a meal, build a list, and route it into Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods while also controlling the home, that is a workflow ChatGPT cannot replicate without deep third-party glue.”

Dan Romanoff, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar Research Services in Chicago, noted Alexa.com will be “a modest positive for Amazon.”

“It will open up AI to consumers beyond Alexa devices, but I expect no immediate financial impact,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Amazon is simply bringing in more users to its ecosystem,” he said. “The differentiation [with other AI assistants] centers around family usage and home management.”

“Over time, monetization could follow down the road by increased adoption for use cases like adding grocery or other household items to an Amazon shopping cart, or home automation tie-ins with Ring, Eero, and Blink products,” he added.

Amazon is facing complaints from independent retailers over a new shopping experiment that lets  customers buy products from other websites directly within Amazon's app.

The feature, called Buy for Me, started rolling out in April last year alongside another program known as Shop Direct. The tools are designed to help shoppers find products that aren't sold on Amazon — and, in some cases, allow Amazon to complete a purchase on a customer's behalf using AI. 

Bloomberg, Modern Retail, Financial Times, and others published stories this week citing brands who say they were caught off guard when their products appeared in Amazon search results. Some said they only discovered the program when strange orders started arriving from Amazon-linked email addresses.

Among the complaints raised by brands:

In a statement to GeekWire, an Amazon spokesperson said participation in both programs is optional  and that the company has received positive feedback.

“Shop Direct and Buy for Me are programs we're testing that help customers discover brands and products not currently sold in Amazon's store, while helping businesses reach new customers and drive incremental sales,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. “Businesses can opt out at any time by emailing [email protected], and we remove them from these programs promptly.”

Listings created with Buy for Me are labeled as coming from other stores when they show up within Amazon search results. Amazon's system checks the brand's website to confirm the item is in stock and that the price is accurate. Product and pricing information is pulled from public information on a brand's website, though Amazon says in an FAQ page that it “may modify these for display on the Amazon Shopping App.”

Amazon said in November that products available to purchase via Buy for Me had increased from 65,000 to more than 500,000. 

The pushback from independent sellers — who make up more than 60% of Amazon's online store sales — highlights a growing tension as tech companies roll out AI-powered shopping tools. The new technology is sparking debate over who controls product discovery and the customer relationship when platforms can act as an intermediary — or even a buyer — on behalf of consumers.

In November, Amazon sued Perplexity to stop the startup from using its AI browser agent to make purchases on its marketplace, citing computer fraud laws and security risks, along with a “significantly degraded shopping and customer service experience it provides.”

By the time we hit Kelso, it was clear my family's post-Christmas EV adventure was hitting the skids.

After departing from Seattle, we stopped in Olympia for lunch and a little recharge for our recently purchased 2024 Mach-E — the electric Ford Mustang. But the Level 2 charger found via Google Maps offered a paltry boost and we had 115 miles to our Portland destination.

No problem. We'd make a second stop at a Tesla Supercharger in Kelso, a small city off of Interstate 5 formerly known for logging and smelt fishing. The Mach-E sucked up electrons from the DC fast charger, hitting 80% charge in about 20 minutes.

But when we went to unplug, the third-party adapter that allowed us to charge our non-Tesla EV wouldn't budge. We were trapped, tethered to the station via a high-powered cable, late on a Saturday afternoon. All-knowing YouTube offered a fix: use a really big pair of pliers called channel locks to force the button to give. My husband went off on foot to a nearby farm supply store seeking the device.

Our 17-year-old daughter, in the meantime, had run out of TikToks and patience. She began wrestling the adapter herself and through a combination of finesse, strength and desperation she disengaged the charger. It was a giddy moment — but a brief reprieve as we continued driving south.

Wintry temperatures and dinner in the brilliantly named Portland suburb of Scappoose left the Mustang battery unnervingly low. More map searching near our hotel led us to a nearly empty parking garage that promised charging on the eighth floor. After circling to the roof we found one broken charger and another being used by a couple in an embrace outside their electric truck, inexplicably kissing in the cold.

The charging mishaps had left us tired, frustrated and anxious — with only ourselves to blame. 

Historically, I've been largely indifferent toward cars, owning a series of forgettable Toyotas and Hondas — safe, reliable cars that got me from point A to B with reasonable fuel efficiency. I had wanted to go electric in 2017 when shopping for my previous car, but the Chevy Bolt was underwhelming and Tesla too swanky. A Toyota Prius it was. 

Then on a sunny afternoon last October, a driver mounted a steep hill in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, failed to brake at a stop sign, and smashed into my Prius. I was rattled but largely unscathed, and so was the other driver and his passenger. Both cars, however, were totaled. 

Their insurance covered the loss and we searched for a replacement. My husband genuinely likes cars and took the lead in shopping with my one condition in mind: it had to be an EV.

We landed on the Mach-E, which startled friends and family alike who knew my milquetoast automotive track record. But despite its relative machismo and flash, the Mustang was the practical choice — good real-world range at about 240 miles, great value, and the roomy interior of a crossover-style vehicle. 

One spin behind the wheel and I was smitten. I love the car. It handles nicely. It's comfortable. The fact it can go from zero to 60 in 4 seconds doesn't really impact my reality, but pleases me all the same. I size up exhaust-spewing muscle cars next to me at stoplights and imagine smoking them.    

When the holidays arrived, I was cruising in my Mach-E and imagined that our Portland trip would be as easy as traveling via gas power.

After all, the EV market share had hit more than 20% in Washington in 2024, and charging stations were cropping up at grocery stores and along highways. I didn't want to spend the time figuring out which of the many available apps was best for finding charging sites. I didn't want to download and create accounts with the many charging service providers. I just wanted to tap the accelerator.

But that wasn't realistic. Energy infrastructure takes time to deploy. For decades after the internal combustion engine reigned supreme, drivers still needed to map out gas stops on lengthy road trips. Things improved for EVs in general when Tesla began opening its Supercharger network to non-Tesla drivers in 2023. (A GeekWire story the year before recounted the headaches faced by an electric Mustang road tripper without that access.) 

The EV charging network, however, is still lagging and faces new challenges under the Trump administration, which has imposed policies to remove incentives and slow EV infrastructure deployment. 

In most ways, I'd found the switch to an EV surprisingly convenient. We're fortunate to have off-street parking at home, and it's super satisfying to simply click a Level 1 slow charger into car and walk away. The device uses a regular outlet in our garage and generally provides the vehicle enough power for work, errands and local day trips.

We drove the Mustang on an overnight trip to Bellingham, Wash., in November and easily found power at clearly marked, city-owned parking spots with free electrons. On a separate outing to hike near the tulip capital of Mount Vernon, I simply plugged in afterwards at an EVgo fast charger near my house to quickly refill.

We were lulled into complacency and unprepared for longer EV travel. After botching Portland, I checked in with Seattle-area experts for charging tips, which left me feeling sheepish for my self-inflicted ignorance. 

I got feedback from Matthew Metz, founder of Coltura and CEO of EVQ, a startup supporting EV purchases; Scott Case, founder of the EV data platform Recurrent; and Grace Reamer and Jay Donnaway, who are respectively current and past leaders of the Seattle Electric Vehicle Association, or SEVA.

My takeaways:

EVQ and Recurrent also have their own terrific sources for essential information:

Despite our rookie mistakes, panic and wasted time, we did have a nice trip to Portland (I highly recommend Casa Zoraya for amazing Peruvian food and my body literally aches for a return to Dragontree Spa). To finish the trip and get home to Seattle, we found a non-Tesla fast charger just outside of the city and another in Chehalis that worked quickly and without hiccups. 

Looking ahead, we'll undertake our next road trip with a full charge, a better plan and a car I still love.

Never mind the Apple Cup. Washington State University is focused on the apple grip and the apple pick.

Researchers in WSU's School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering unveiled a low-cost robotic apple-picking arm designed to help offset labor shortages for tasks such as harvesting and pruning, according to a news release Wednesday.

The inflatable arm can see an apple, extend and retract to pick fruit in about 25 seconds (as demonstrated in the video above). Mounted on a metal base and weighing about 50 pounds, the 2-foot-long arm is made of a soft fabric filled with air.

Researchers published their work in the journal Smart Agricultural Technology. The team is collaborating with researchers at the Prosser Research Extension Center and with Manoj Karkee at Cornell University to adapt the arm to an automated moving platform that is also being developed to move through orchards.

Washington state leads the nation in apple and sweet cherry production, contributing more than $2 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product in 2023, according to WSU. Farms across the state employ hundreds of workers annually for orchard tasks such as pollination, pruning, flower thinning and harvesting. But an aging population and a decline in migrant farmworkers have made it harder for growers to meet labor needs during harvest season.

Compared to humans who can pick an apple every three seconds, the robotic arm is still slow. The researchers are refining some of the mechanical components as well as working to improve its rudimentary detection system, which hinders the picking more than the robotic arm's movement, WSU Insider reported.

Deploying robots in fruit harvesting and other aspects of agriculture is not a new concept. Apple-picking technology is also being developed at Oregon State University, Michigan State University, and elsewhere. WSU says that some robotic harvesting systems can be large, expensive and complex to use in orchards.

“Having this very low-cost, safe robotic platform is ideal for the orchard environment,” said Ryan Dorosh, a PhD candidate and lead author on the work.

The researchers are working with WSU's Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship team for the intellectual property protection and commercialization of the technology. The work was funded by the National Science Foundation, the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission and tested at Allan Brothers Fruit in Prosser, Washington.

Amazon has unveiled a redesigned version of its Dash Cart, the company's smart shopping cart that lets customers scan items as they shop and skip the checkout line. 

The new shopping cart uses upgraded computer vision to capture barcodes more quickly, improved sensors to track the cart's location inside the store, and an integrated produce scale that weighs fruits and veggies directly within the cart. 

Amazon said it also reduced the cart's weight by 25% while increasing basket capacity by 40%. And the carts now charge themselves while parked, eliminating the need for employees to manually swap batteries. There are also expanded payment options.

The updated carts are debuting at three Whole Foods Market locations, with plans to expand to dozens more stores across the U.S. by the end of 2026, according to a blog post.

Amazon first unveiled Dash Carts in 2020, offering an alternative to its cashierless stores that required elaborate technical infrastructure. The company has since shifted away from the “Just Walk Out” technology in its large grocery stores, which uses overhead cameras and sensors to detect what people put in their carts.

During a GeekWire test in 2024 of an earlier version of Dash Cart, we found the experience cumbersome, with a steep learning curve. We did like tracking our total spend and accessing our Alexa shopping list with the screen in the cart.

Other companies including Instacart and Seattle startup Veeve have rolled out similar smart carts.

In some ways, the continued investment in Amazon's Dash Cart reflects the company's evolving physical retail ambitions: less moonshot, more incremental tech layered onto existing experiences.

Last year Amazon revealed a “store within a store” model that uses automated micro-fulfillment to bring name-brand items into Whole Foods locations. The company is also pushing tighter integration of fresh grocery delivery with other Amazon.com products.

Amazon said it had more than $100 billion in gross sales of groceries and household essentials in 2024, excluding sales from Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh.

Caterpillar is diving deeper into incorporating AI and automation into its fleet of construction machinery through a partnership with semiconductor giant Nvidia.

The construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator. Dubbed “Cat AI,” the system was built using Nvidia's Jetson Thor physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday.

Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator's questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services.

One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out.

“Our customers don't live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,” Hootman said. “The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they're doing the work is very important to them.”

Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia's Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar's machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations. 

The company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the mining sector, and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio.

“The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some some real momentum on and we felt like we could we could bring to market pretty quickly,” Hootman said. “What we also liked is that provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.”

Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn't often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia's physical AI strategy.

Bill Dally, Nvidia's chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier for the company and its powerful GPUs.

During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company's Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits.

While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today.

“Physical AI is the next wave of AI,” Talla said. “Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that's] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.”

WhatsApp on Wednesday said it's rolling out new features to group chats, including member tags, text stickers, and event reminders.

With member tags, you can choose a name that gives others in the group chat more context about who you are and what your role is. For example, you could be “Anna's Dad” in one group and “Goalkeeper” in another.

As for text stickers, you can turn any word into a sticker by typing your text into Sticker Search. You can also add these newly created stickers directly to your sticker packs without sending them in a chat.

Event reminders let you set custom reminders for your invitees when you create and send an event in a group chat.

These new features come as WhatsApp continues to bolster group chats with capabilities like sharing large files up to 2GB, sending HD media, screen sharing, voice chats, and more.

Following a wave of lawsuits and investigations over child safety, Roblox has implemented mandatory facial verification for all users who want to access chats. The company is now rolling out the requirement globally after testing it in a few markets last month.

To complete the age-check process, users have to open the Roblox app, allow access to their camera, and follow a series of on-screen instructions for facial verification. Once the age check is processed, Roblox says it will delete any images or videos of users. The verification is being processed by a third-party vendor, Persona, which also deletes images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.

The company says users who are 13 and older can also choose to verify their age through ID verification instead of facial verification. Roblox notes that while age checks are optional, they're required if users want to access communication features. In other words, you don't have to verify your age to use Roblox, but you do need verification to use chat features.

If the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user's age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child's age.

“Leveraging multiple signals, Roblox is constantly evaluating user behavior to determine if someone is significantly older or younger than expected,” the company wrote in a blog post. “In these situations, Roblox will soon ask users to repeat the age-check process.”

Once users complete an age check, they can access age-based chat, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with users in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.

Roblox says chat is disabled by default for children under 9 unless a parent provides consent following an age check. 

The introduction of mandatory age checks comes amid multiple lawsuits, including from the attorneys general of Texas and Louisiana, against Roblox over child safety concerns. The lawsuits were filed following reports that Roblox was exposing young users to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.

Roblox has said the new age-check requirement will provide a more accurate way to verify users' ages, compared with simply having users enter their birth year when creating an account.

Spotify is lowering its eligibility criteria for podcasters to monetize their videos on the platform, dropping the minimum episode requirement to three, minimum consumption hours to 2,000, and engaged audience member threshold to 1,000 over the last 30 days. 

When the company introduced its partner program to monetize video content last year, creators needed to have published 12 episodes, hit 10,000 consumption hours over the prior 30 days, and had at least 2,000 people stream their content in the last 30 days to be part of the program. 

The program pays podcasters according to the number of premium users who watched their videos on Spotify, alongside a share of ad revenue earned from users on the free tier.

The company is also introducing new sponsorship tools that would allow creators to update, schedule, and measure sponsorship spots read by hosts in video ads. These tools are coming to the Spotify for Creators app, and Megaphone, the company's podcast hosting and monetization suite, in April.

Doubling down on its video strategy in a bid to compete better with YouTube, Spotify is now launching a new API that would let creators use their existing platforms to publish and monetize video podcasts on Spotify. At launch, tools like Acast, Audioboom, Libsyn, Omny, and Podigee have adopted this API, the company said.

The new moves come as Spotify's been looking to new avenues to attract users and build on its streaming subscription revenue. The company said since the launch of the partner program, the consumption of video podcasts on the app has nearly doubled, and that the average Spotify podcast user streams twice as many video shows per month as they did before the program was launched. 

But that could simply be a result of the streaming service surfacing more video content. 

The company is also opening a studio for recording podcasts and videos in West Hollywood. Spotify said the studio would serve as a base for the Ringer podcast network, and it would open the studio to select creators from the partner program. The company already has studios across the art district in LA, New York, Stockholm, and London.

Smart home startup Quilt introduced a three-zone heat pump on Tuesday that promises to maintain efficiency even in the kinds of demanding conditions that stymie traditional incumbents. 

The three-zone unit does what it says on the label: One outdoor unit is now capable of driving three indoor heads, as they're known in the HVAC world. It's a product that will make large installations simpler and cheaper while minimizing the footprint outside the home, and it's key to the startup's plans for expansion, which were recently turbocharged by a $20 million Series B focused on expanding sales.

But the real story is how Quilt developed the new product.

Since its founding, Quilt has prided itself on the amount of data it collects from its heat pumps. Not only are they internet-connected, they're also laced with more sensors than typical heat pumps. 

By analyzing that data, Quilt engineers have been able to do things that other companies have not. In September, for example, they shipped an over-the-air update to heat pumps in people's homes that unlocked an additional 20% capacity, which could be directed toward either one or two zones. With the free update, people could be more comfortable during heat waves and cold snaps. 

The team also used the data to develop the new three-zone unit and, in the process, solve a vexing challenge that many competitors face.

Like all heat pumps, multi-zone units work best when they're run at variable speed — that is, when heating or cooling demand is low, the compressor runs at a lower speed to deliver only the amount of heating or cooling that's needed. 

But there are limits to how low they can operate. Compressors become less stable at low speeds, making them harder to control. Matthew Knoll, co-founder and CTO at Quilt, compares it to driving a car a low speeds. Maintaining an even 70 mph is easier than a steady 11 mph. “It's a little harder,” he said. 

To compensate, most systems stop the compressor at a certain point, sacrificing some efficiency and comfort in the process.

Quilt, though, was able to draw on data collected from the thousand or so units already installed in people's homes and businesses, giving them insights into how the systems were operating in the real world.

“The way most systems are developed, they're tested in a lab under a couple scenarios because testing's expensive. And you end up with kind of a you know an average product,” Knoll said. 

“We have a thousand units out there in many different climates, and if we see something, we can look at it across a bunch of different units to understand if there's room to optimize or if we're seeing a problem in a corner case,” he said

The company also uses a larger copper coil than many competitors, which allows it to spec a smaller compressor. That combination, along with some other tweaks to the design, allows Quilt to deliver nearly 90% of its rated capacity (27,000 BTUs) at -13˚ F (-25˚ C) without sacrificing low-demand performance or efficiency. Quilt says it's the most efficient three-zone mini-split on the market.

To save power, each indoor head can be controlled individually, supplying as little as 2,210 BTUs of heat or 1,570 BTUs of cooling. If heating or cooling isn't needed, refrigerant still flows through the lines like it does in other heat pumps. But thanks to the outdoor unit's low-speed performance, it only releases around 300 BTUs of heat in heating mode. That's about as much heat as a grown adult throws off.

Where does Quilt go from here? Knoll wouldn't comment on future plans other than to say that Quilt “wants to be able to have a solution for all homes.” More products are coming, and it's likely that reams of data will help lead their development.

The bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and its extensive library of hit TV shows and films like “Harry Potter,” “Game of Thrones,” and the DC Comics titles is dragging on.

The studio on Wednesday said its board had unanimously rejected Paramount Skydance's revised $108.4 billion bid, calling the proposal a “leveraged buyout” that would encumber the company with $87 billion in debt.

In a letter to shareholders, WBD urged them to reject the offer, saying the “extraordinary amount” of debt Paramount would need to raise heightens the risk of the deal falling through, and instead recommended they vote in favor of its earlier, $82.7 billion deal with Netflix for its film and TV studio assets.

Paramount, which was rumored to be in the running to buy WBD before the Netflix deal was announced, went directly to WBD's shareholders with an all-cash, $30-per-share offer in early December after Warner Bros.' board decided to sell to Netflix. But WBD rejected Paramount's bid, calling the offer “illusory” and saying Paramount did not have the cash to back up its claims, and instead recommended Netflix's cash-and-share deal.

Paramount then came back with a $40 billion guarantee from its CEO David Ellison's billionaire dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and said it would raise $54 billion in debt to fund the deal.

WBD doesn't seem convinced. “[Paramount] is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization […] This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger,” WBD wrote in a statement.

Warner Bros. also called into question Paramount's ability to function well if the deal goes through, arguing that raising such amounts of debt would further worsen Paramount's current “junk” credit rating.

Warner Bros. was particularly concerned about Paramount's negative free cash flow, which would be exacerbated by any acquisition. “In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026,” WBD wrote.

Netflix welcomed WBD's decision, saying after the merger the companies would “bring together highly complementary strengths and a shared passion for storytelling.”

Back at Google Again, Cofounder Sergey Brin Just Filed His First Code Request - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34645311 - Feb 2023 (16 comments)

We had a high performing co-worker who was scared witless after a lay-off episode and this was not because he was worried about lacking money or loss of prestige., but because he could not come to terms with the simple fact of facing the 9 am on a Monday morning with absolutely no expectations.  It freaked so much to not feel the hustle and the adrenaline rush of experiencing the blues Monday morning!?Another colleague used to drive up to the parking lot of their previous employer, post lay-off., so that he could feel normal., and he did this for well over 6 - 8 months. Pack bags, wave to his wife and family, drive up in his Porsche to the parking lot and I guess feel normal !?

I didn't experience an identity crisis for a single day. I didn't feel insecure or anxious about not working. The only real friction came from my family.One big difference was social life. In India, I was constantly meeting people—connections were easy and organic. In the US, maintaining a daytime social life felt much harder. Everyone is on a treadmill—insurance, income, careers—often not by choice. I know there are ways to build community here, but in India it just happened naturally.My extended family struggled more than I did. Once it became clear the break wasn't temporary, there was a kind of quiet depression around it. I initially framed it as “taking a breather” by doing an executive MBA, but the break never really ended.What eventually brought me back wasn't overt pressure, but practical limits: my spouse's mental health, and the constraints of India's education system for our partially disabled, special-ed child. Those realities mattered more than any career concern.

The primary reason for this is the built environment we live in here in the United States. It's very difficult to organically build connections when you have to drive a car somewhere to have basic social interactions. Even some of the items you mention, like insurance and income are very much informed by the requirement to have a car to participate in society.

reply

One simple reason I think is overall US is very rich so people just can have anything they need on their own and sharing small things which lead to more interaction is simply not needed.

reply

We have neighbors - sometimes we need someone to grab a package, or we make too much food and we share, &c. or we run into each other walking to a restaurant or through the park. But this isn't the norm. We live in a neighborhood built before the introduction of cars, so homes are built a little bit closer together, but not too close, and we have mixed-use developments and a good level of density to support restaurants and other amenities.You can't have spontaneous interactions like that easily in the United States because we build too much sprawl, visiting people or showing up to a bar requires a drive, and in the end you wind up just staying at home participating in surrogate activities like social media.It really comes down solely to cars and car-only infrastructure that degrades our social interactions to an extreme extent.-edit-I do want to mention, at least when I was a kid/teenager I recall we used to show up to people's houses uninvited/unannounced too. But we did not talk to our neighbors. That was a weird thing. There are some cultural things here. But also even if we wanted to visit someone, well, gotta hop in the car. Maybe stop and get gas, and the next thing you know, eh it's too much effort. Might as way stay home. That's kind of how that works. The car-only model that is implemented in most of America, particularly the cities not so much rural areas, is a leading cause of cultural and social malaise I believe in the West.

My neighbor knows the whole street. She knows the garbage men. It's because she wants to. When I run into her outside, she chats. She walks her dog and chats with dog owners and anyone else she sees.Easy relationships are available at the grocery store, post office, etc. I've been seeing some of the same people working at Costco for years. I don't know them. It's not the built environment. I'd need to take effort to build a relationship with them. My neighbor would. I'm simply not so inclined.

I guess for Sergey Brin it's a little different, he will always be ""Founder of Google"" even if he leaves Google.But that ""work as identity"" may still be a problem. For a lot of us, what we do is who we are, and so not having any work to do is like not having an identity.

Risking a stereotype. 
In my experience from traveling the world it's a tell-tale sign for being from a culture heavily influenced by the Protestant work ethic. Introduce yourself like that in Spain, Italy, or Brazil and you'll get strange looks.On the flip side, I've found that people who do not define themselves through their work primarily often do so through family. My younger self is certainly guilty of giving someone a strange look when within the first five minutes of meeting them, they told me whose cousin they were.

A few times I've quit a FAANG job  with no plan for after other than to wander, and both times the lack of professional competition meant not just coasting horizontally but that I was actually lowering myself somehow. Hard to explain, and I don't fully understand it.I also noticed most people, especially women, determine your value by your 'right now'. While intentionally unemployed I'd answer truthfully and with a smile, 'I'm unemployed!' which visibly confused people.

That's only 1/2 of the dynamic.  People also like to assign an identity to others.For example, if I say, ""I'm semi-retired."" ... the follow-up question is always ""Oh, so what did you do before that?""  ... which is polite coded-speak for, ""Did you inherit money or what work did you do for money that put you in the position to do that?""People are naturally curious about your rough level of success, wealth, expertise, etc.  Having a ""no identity"" stance isn't really a satisfactory answer for many listeners.  They want to know more.EDIT to replies:  I do understand the harmless ""small talk"" aspect.  I should've added more to re-emphasize the ""people assigning identity"" aspect.Once I reply to the followup question with ""Oh, I used to do  consulting for finance""  what then happens is others then introduce me as ""And this is jasode -- he was a consultant for X"".  My ex-consultant life that I last did over 15 years ago is now part of a tagline/subheading associated with my name even though I never intended it.The point is other people have this irresistible urge to ""fill in the blank"" with an identity -- especially an identity that is tied to how one earned money.  I'm not complaining about this and it's just an observation of what humans naturally do.

Having a natural ebb & flow to conversation is all true but that's not the issue.  Let me restate it differently.It's ok and natural to ask what people do/did for work.  It's also natural to respond and share what was a significant aspect of their life.The meta-observation is:  others then like to compress whatever life narrative they hear into a ""shorthand"" or ""identity"" -- even if the recipient never intended it to be his/her identity.  Several parent comments mention ""their work being their identity is the problem"".  My point is that the identity we get tagged with is often outside of our control and we didn't create the problem of work being our identity.My neighbors know me as the ""ex-consultant"".  For that identity to change, I'd have to do something new that was significant enough to override that ... such as... get into another career, open a restaurant, become founder of a startup, etc.How does one have ""no identity related to their job""?  Sometimes you can't unless one wants to be evasive about what one does to earn money.

The obvious answer is to have some other identifier that supersedes the job. Do you have some other interest or hobby that you spend your time doing? That you talk about all the time?People get associated with their job because it's probably the thing they spend the most time on and it's also a common topic of conversation. If every time someone asked you about your job you said, “it's good” and steered the conversation into a story about your latest epic ski trip, you'd probably be the “guy who skis” instead of the “ex-consultant”.

The fact that you're neighbors with these people changes things. Maybe it's a wedge into a Socratic discussion about how work isn't and has never been your identity, where you come to some new and better mutual understanding.But yeah it's challenging. If people are so accustomed to viewing about themselves and others thru the conventional status/hierarchical lens… sometimes they can't understand that it's a lens and not reality.

In modern life, yes. I wonder if it was such a low risk topic as we moved towards the past? For example the fear of the stranger is something that is very common in past writing across a number of cultures. If you met a stranger and they said they were a soldier it would have different ramifications than if they said they were a baker. Also in smaller social groups that required the work of everyone to survive it was a way of measuring the resources available in said group.

reply

I am probing for topics of mutual interest, or topics that make other people passionate, to learn more about them generally.In some people, this is completely orthogonal to their careers, but most of the time, there is an overlap. Like, I haven't yet met a railway engineer who wasn't a raging railway nerd at the same time.

I also don't care what you like to do 99% of the time. I've been socially forced to sit through way too many of these “interesting conversations”.

I moved to California a few years ago from the Least Coast (insert shaka, surfer, wave emojis here) and had multiple other out-of-towners in the same situation as me say the exact opposite at a party. They all were adamant that they had yet to hear ""what do you do [for a living]?"" since they'd moved as they did ad nauseum when they lived on the other side of the country.I've not noticed either way. My pet theory is that people hear this frequently if their social and professional lives bleed into each other which they do if one lives in a town dominated by a specific industry or profession. Those moving westward during COVID and remote work suddenly had to contend with this much less.

Let's say you have Facebook, which is notorious for banning people yet never seems to ban the things people report that should be banned. That's a real life example, but take any hypothetical companyIf someone posts x bad thing and doesn't get banned, do we immediately take our torches and storm the premeses to protest? Maybe, maybe not; ""look, scale is hard"" (and sometimes calls to remove things outright get politicized, as seen in the last few years, so sometimes it's a tricky line)That would be... not fine, but more fine than it is now. The lack of fairness in the bidirectionality ensures that you, Joe Schmoe, get a month ban for calling someone a jerk while the most egregious hate or racism or... anything... gets a quick check followed by This Does Not Violate Our Community Guidelines(And of course because these services are monopolies, well, too bad, you just have to suffer.

If someone posts x bad thing and doesn't get banned, do we immediately take our torches and storm the premeses to protest? Maybe, maybe not; ""look, scale is hard"" (and sometimes calls to remove things outright get politicized, as seen in the last few years, so sometimes it's a tricky line)That would be... not fine, but more fine than it is now.

Facebook is much worse because everyghing on there is user gemerated. Any small company would be just crushed by governments if they would have similar issues.

It can be something other than a job. It just can't be done alone.We are social creatures and need to be needed by each other. Luckily there are plenty of people in need.

I FIREd 3 years ago and don't miss working one bit.I think leaving work becomes more difficult for those who do need to feel valued and especially if they don't have interests outside of it. There are many people like that.

My perspective on these things have changed when I saw a successful old friend of mine thank his friend for asking his help. I feel like being asked to help by a friend might actually be a privilege sometimes.

reply

A more general need from what I see is to engage with and to accomplish non-trivial things.For some it might be helping others people, for others it might be learning, researching or creating.To each their own.

Is it? I know people who are really happy without doing much in their retirement. Probably because they weren't workaholics.To my mind, if one doesn't have hobbies during the working years, then they will struggle to find purpose when they retite.

You don't have to find purpose when you retireAt all.Instead, you just have to be willing to face each day when the day has no expectations.  You can do anything you want, and decide you love it, hate it, whatever.  You can do it again the next day, or not.  you can hate it one day and love it the next. It's completely up to you.For some people, this lack of structure is crushing.  For others, it's liberating.It's similar to having spent significant time alone as an adult - some people can't deal with it, some can.I meet a lot of people who are like ""I haven't figured out what i will do when i retire"".  These are the people i worry about, because there isn't anything to figure out.  They want a structure that probably won't exist.  They will likely tire of trying to force their own structure on it, and seek structure elsewhere (IE work).In the past 3 weeks i've done the following:Building powered paper airplanes with the kidsMentoring high school and college studentsAdvising startups.WoodworkingHacking on CNC machinesHacking on minecraft mods.Hacking on compilers.Playing video games.and a lot more.The next 3 weeks may be the same or different, depending on lots of things (mood, energy, schedules).There are also days i do nothing cool or useful at all, and feel great (and unapologetic - nobody gets to judge my retirement but me, my spouse, and my kids :P) about itThe world is really big, and has lots to do.  You just have to be able to drive yourself because you aren't being forced into doing anything at all.In the end - for some i also feel it's similar to divorce - lots of people don't get divorced because they don't want to deal with being alone.Retirement similarly forces you to spend a lot of time with yourself (even if you have an SO and even if they are retired).  Lots of people don't like that, at all, for various reasons.  Work lets them ignore it.

I am saving up to retire early. If I mention this to friends, most look at me with big eyes and ask “But what will you spend your day on then!?” in a sceptical tone.I imagine they think I want to drink beers and play golf all day every day, or something like that.I'm a bit heart broken, that so many of my friends cannot imagine being masters of their own time, without thinking it would be bad for them and/or unproductive.

As a developer if, let's say, AI does make my profession no longer a viable option monetarily, what would happen if my entire identity is tied to it?You cannot fully control your career no matter what. Many external factors can affect it and you deeply if that's your identity.What if you can't even teach after retiring because nobody else cares about it?For me it's about risk/reward and unfortunately in our current system the fact that all my efforts reward someone else disproportionately more completely taints it.

I don't mean this in a creepy way at all, but I got the impression the greatest source of joy was hanging around with younger people. A hungry grad,  a cleaner, a nurse, male, female, whatever.I'm sure he enjoyed his peers as well, but I could detect a shade of boredom of those interactions, which inevitably had stress and responsibility attached.I think what I'm trying to say is that work isn't just about challenge, it's about socialization and having fun. And one of the greatest benefits of being financially independent is being able to navigate to those kinds of moments without the pressure of being on the make.

I think the more important goal in FIRE is the 'FI' part - financial independence. Something that allows you to retire early - not necessary that you have to use this privilage. Something that allows you to next day take a day off or week off or 1 year sabbatical to recharge without asking anyone for permission or worrying if you will be able to pay the bills.I think even in 4-hour-workweek Tim Ferriss called it taking mini-retirements throughout your life rather than at the end of you life.

Financial Independence, You're Not The Boss Of Me.Once you're financially independent, at a level that you're comfortable with, you don't have to put up with crappy bosses.If you're Sergey Brin, you kind of don't really have a boss, do you?If you ""retire"" into working at a hardware store, or volunteering at the Humane Society, or just shifting into a lower-stress job...Well, that's the dream, isn't it?I was so happy when I realized that, unless there were dramatic shifts in the markets, I would always be able to find ""decent"" work for great wages.  And maybe I could be patient and find ""good"" work for ""pretty great"" wages.Once I had that level of comfort, I was way, way more brave at work.  I thought, ""Well, they could fire me for their own reasons, any day.  So, I might as well do The Right Thing™.  If they fire me for doing The Right Thing™, well, I didn't really want to work there anyway, did I?""And then there were dramatic shifts in the markets, lol.  But fortunately for me, I had built up a nest egg, and now I've shifted into a lower-stress job.I honestly don't know what advice I'd give to younger folks.  Move to Norway?

Whats the quality difference between default ChatGPT and Thinking? Is it an extra 20% quality boost or is the difference night/day?I've often imagined it would be great to have some kind of chrome extension or 3rd party tool to always run prompts in multiple thinking tiers so you can get an immediate response to read while you wait for the thinking models to think.

I use Thinking and Pro. I don't use the default ChatGPT so can't comment on that. The difference between Thinking and Pro is modest but detectable. The 20 minute thinking times are with Pro, not with Thinking. But Pro only allows 60k tokens per prompt so I sometimes can't use it.In the $200/month subscription they give you access to a ""heavy thinking"" tier for Thinking which increases test time compute by maybe 30% compared to what you get in Plus.

There seems to be much less hallucination of facts than in other tools I've tried and whenever Gemini makes assumptions on stuff I didn't explicitly specify in the prompt, it says so. The answers also always have nice structure: it starts with a short and concise version, then gives me options and more details and considerations.I also like the feature that I can make it remember facts across chats. I'm a physicist by training and I've told Gemini so, so now every time I ask something, it gives me an answer perfectly tailored for a physicist (often with mathematical formulas, etc.).

I was initially trying to make a point that the ideological lines that people have drawn have made it so they automatically think RFK is anti-science and they as a consequence have a whole host of assumptions for which I don't even blame them if they haven't spent time reading up about it. I apologize for not countering every single point and going to covid but it's kind of worth pointing out that RFK a) raises some very substantive charges against Fauci for frankly war criminal like actions throughout his unfortunate history of practicing medicine and b) it wasn't ""mismanagement"". They did, seriously, the opposite of good practice (both accepted good practice and what was discovered in 2020 going forward) in just about every caseIf you're not sympathetic to that then of course you're going to disagree and you might think that the only reason someone like Musk bought X (and please don't think this is me Musk fanning, I dislike him for several reasons) is just to have a joyride (which is still possible); they used to ban so many people and real doctors for information that they didn't like and it was a serious problem and if they could do that for covid then they also did it for other thingsEdit: (see, I do know how to edit comments) here's it on Youtube which is the highlights https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jMONZMuS2U

It's as if they've never heard of Maslow‘s Hierarchy of Needs before and further did they don't know Self Actualizing is right at the very top.Without that key stone on the top the human being is still a wanting animal. And if you somehow “mission complete” one Self Actualizing, then you immediately start to want something fresh “purpose” etc.And obviously Self Actualizing doesn't have to come in the form of work, although often it does.

But I was still ""working"" the whole time.  I was running a small startup, and still keeping up on tech and taking speaking gigs.  I was not great at fully retiring.I unretired when the second kid got to 1st grade.  We could no longer travel on a whim and the house was empty 6 hours a day.  I didn't seek work, but someone reached out with an interesting job and I didn't say no.Funny enough, my wife and I were just talking about how we were both bad at retirement (she also retired and has since gone back to work).  But we talked about how the next retirement will be better, because the kids will be gone and we'll just sit around making art and building Lego all day.We'll see if that actually happens!

Retirement has the definition to stop working. One could argue that another definition may be that you reach an older age and start receiving pension payouts (regardless of whether you keep working or not).But having a passive income alone simply doesn't mean retirement.

They never have to work. They do it because they want to.Retirement implies there was work you didn't want to do. You did it because you had (or wanted) to make some money. Now you have enough money. You've retired.Hell, it isn't even applicable to many wealthy software engineers who got rich from tech startups. Many are coding as much as when they were working.

I find it difficult to relate to such worlds.

Or, ""well, it must be because they simply haven't had sufficient education to reach an activation level where the higher tiers of Maslow's come into their line of sight"".And then I read about plenty of counter-examples, like wealthy offspring living the textbook aimless/dissolute/pick-your-adjective life, or the ennui of able-bodied welfare recipients with quite reasonable spending cash from generous Scandinavian welfare regimes when one considers the mind boggling amount of free media, free libraries, free parks, free entertainment in general in the developed world. Perhaps this is just part of their human condition for people suffering from this malaise.And here I sit, drowning in ideas of what I would be interested to pursue to know our beautiful universe if only I had the time. So much so I write them down into a file just to quiet the cacophony in my head like a dog seeing squirrels everywhere he looks, just so I can get real work done on a timely basis, haha.When once asked whether I'd ever be bored with eternal youth and boundless resources, I immediately replied an eternity is still too little time to satisfy my curiosity.

Of course it does. I've seen it in my parents' generation: many wanted to reach retirement do ""do nothing"" and, well, they just lost their marbles. Doing nothing is neither good for the body, nor for the mind. Endless TV watching or endless pina colada drinking in the pool (or both at the same time): idleness brings absolutely nothing good.But my parents' friends who kept working a bit (like my godmother who kept supervising her real estate agency): she stayed sharp and fit.People think they're going to read and do exercice etc. but truth is: most are going to do jack absolutely shit. And turn to the latter.So keeping partially active is the best thing possible.I see it with my mother-in-law: 70 y/o, still working, daily, with my wife (they own a little SME). It keeps her in the loop: she still knows how to use a computer, her mind is quick. She's not idling.The financial aspect of it all is something else: but people doing nothing is not what a society needs.

I took a semi retirement approach to the business, there really wasn't a lot of things to do, my role was sort of just ""managing"" programmers. I got so much free time that I could even start a second business on the side.Despite my best ability to stretch my work, I couldn't even fill up half of my working hours. One would have thought that this is heaven. But the time I was most free was also the time I was most miserable. I wasn't happy, I was gaining weight, I was perennially asking myself why the business couldn't be bigger and I couldn't sell it, so that I can be real millionaires and billionaires with financial freedom!Then fate intervened, the sudden fortune disappeared and I no longer had the luxury of just ""managing people""; I have to do hands-on. And it was this activity, the feeling that I was contributing to something, that I was writing code again and actually building stuffs, that made me happy again.Today we are bigger than what we once we were, but still, I am writing code and pretty much hands-on.I vow that I will never retire, even though if I could. Because it's the meaningful work that sustains life and provides happiness. Being able to work on it is a luxury that I will never want to give up, ever.

I am partial fire and I feel that line of demarcation personally. I've also watched it play out in others like clockwork. As wealth grows, new responsibilities emerge.

The fact he's allowed back inside Google means Google still has a massively unresolved workplace sexual harassment issue.

It lines up with the AI arms race kicking into overdrive around ChatGPT's triumph in late 2022. Brin pops out of hiding right then, admitting Google ""messed up"" and starts coding, analysing losses, and basically playing dictator with his super-voting shares to shove the company back on track.Rivals like OpenAI yanked him in and now he's in the office daily because the ""trajectory of AI is so exciting"" - translation: his ego couldn't handle watching his empire get outpaced, and with those voting rights, he can bulldoze through bureaucracy to keep the throne.Ultimately, it's less about some profound quest for purpose and more about a control freak safeguarding his legacy and billions as the tech world burns. He never really let his kingdom go.

That ship sailed a long time ago. It then proceeded to sink, ending up a haunted wreck that we might see in a new Pirates of the Caribbean film.Problem is, Captain Jack Sparrow these days isn't what he used to be either.

Snark aside, good for him. Absolute non-news though, as is any extraordinary individual action during and contributing to a bubble. It'll be interesting to see what stays when, or if, the bubble ever pops.

I'm not envious of anyone's big yacht, but I wouldn't waste my money that way (you can probably rent one for special occasions) - as long as there are still children hungry or without schooling.

reply

That said I don't think I could ever justify spending THAT kind of money on it.

Once you buy a yacht 450 million dollars of ownership in a company you had goes to people who built a beautiful thing that exists in the real world and you're on the hook for employing a lot of people to maintain it.I take a lot more issue with accumulation and hoarding of wealth than the spending of it.

Once someone reaches that level of fame and fortune it's almost a requirement if they want to travel or have some sort of 'vacation'. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a great problem to have, but it's one of the only ways to find privacy at that level of wealth.If I'm ever super wealthy, I hope I can also stay somewhat anonymous so that I can walk down the street like any other person.

If someone starts paying the fisherman, farmer, builder, more to stop doing what they are doing and start building mega yachts, then there will be less fish, bread, and houses for others.That said, I assume it's much simpler than that and it's just about the hypocrisy of the climate change billionaires to be bellowing out carbon while demanding the selfish greedy commoners cut our emissions.

All in the knowledge that no one is going to be time-tracking me or doing performance reviews, and I can just not do work at any moment I don't feel like it or have something better to do that day, like go to my private island or take my private jet to burning man etc (or as it turns out do a talk at Stanford). All while you have so much money that the price of anything from clothes to cars to houses is just some arbitrary number that has no meaning to you it is so absolutely tiny number... not that you actually buy anything yourself any more, mainly your team of personal staff deal with that grubby reality.As for the rest of us, well we need to pay the bills while playing ""the game"" and politics and cowtowing to keep the money coming.

Just like becoming a MD has much better odds at getting you some amount of money than dropping out of school. About the same path by the way.But you can keep playing the lottery if you think it has better odds or even the same odds...

Dreams and hopes are great - I believe we have zero actual agency, but that doesn't mean I lie in bed despairing, because not doing the work and trying will still have negative effects whether I have agency over that decision or not.But the point is that dreams and hopes are also often used to play up the idea that ""anyone"" can achieve something everyone clearly can't, and so for most people, their most ambitious dreams will never be reached, and so a better gamble for most people would be to work for a society that improves everyones odds at reaching at least some of them.

It's a matter of metacognition. Being able to compute possible futures gives you artificial agency at some level. At a meta level even if that compute can be deterministic at a higher level, but you should not care.It's a nested universes system just like in type theory. The meta of the meta. Agency is only defined within a single universe at a time.

I addressed that in my comment, but let me address it again since it's the most frequent objection to this:> You could choose to stop doing anything.In the mechanical sense that an ""IF ... THEN ... ELSE"" statement makes the program ""choose"" which branch to take, you're right, yes I could.But then I'd also suffer the consequences.As I pointed out, if I were to life down in despair and not go to work, I won't keep getting paid just because I didn't have agency over the ""choice"" of whether to lie down and sulk or get up and go to work.But for ""agency"" to have any meaning, we can't interpret choice that way. If we don't have agency, then while I may have an artificial ""choice"", that ""choice"" can't change the outcome.In that case every ""choice"" I make is just as deterministic as that IF ... THEN ... ELSE: The branch taken depends on the state of the system.> Or you could decide that your partial knowledge(untealised futures) gives you agency.
>
> It's a matter of metacognition. Being able to compute possible futures gives you artificial agency at some level. At a meta level even that compute ca be deterministic but you should not care.What you are describing is compatibilism: The school of thought on ""free will"" that effectively says that free will is real, but is also an illusion.Personally I think that is basically brushing the issue under the carpet, though I also think it is the only definition of free will that is logically consistent.I do agree with the point that you mostly should not care:You need to mostly act as if every ""choice"" you make does matter, because whether or not you have control over it, if you do lie down in despair, your paychecks will stop arriving.Cause and effect does not care whether or not you have agency.Where I take issue with compatibilism is because there are considerable differences in how you should ""choose"" to act if you consider agency to be ""artificial"" or an illusion (compatibilism) or not exist at all (for this purpose these are pretty much equivalent) vs. if you consider it to be real.E.g. we blame and reward people or otherwise treat people differently based on their perceived agency all the time, and a lot of that treatment is a lot harder to morally justify if you don't believe in actual agency. Real harm happens to people because we assume they have agency. If that agency isn't real, it doesn't matter if we have an illusion of it - in that case a lot of that harm is immoral.To tie it back to the thread: Whether agency is not real at all, or just significantly constrained by circumstance, it changes the considerations in what we should expect ourselves and others to be able to overcome.E.g. it makes no logical sense to feel bad about past choices, because they couldn't have gone differently (you can still feel bad about the effects, and commit to ""choosing"" differently in the future). You also then shouldn't feel bad if you haven't achieved what you wanted to if you believe the context you live within either have total control over the actions you take, or ""just"" a significant degree of influence over it.And so we're back to my original argument that for most people, acting as-if they have agency by ""choosing"" to bet on making the surrounding conditions more amenable to good outcomes is a better bet than thinking they have agency or enough agency to achieve a different outcome.But again: The fact that I believe we have no agency, does not mean I won't try to do things that will get me better outcomes. I just don't assume I could act any other way in a given instance than I end up acting in that given instance, any more than a movie will change if you rewind it and press play again.

Personally I think that is basically brushing the issue under the carpet, though I also think it is the only definition of free will that is logically consistent.I do agree with the point that you mostly should not care:You need to mostly act as if every ""choice"" you make does matter, because whether or not you have control over it, if you do lie down in despair, your paychecks will stop arriving.Cause and effect does not care whether or not you have agency.Where I take issue with compatibilism is because there are considerable differences in how you should ""choose"" to act if you consider agency to be ""artificial"" or an illusion (compatibilism) or not exist at all (for this purpose these are pretty much equivalent) vs. if you consider it to be real.E.g. we blame and reward people or otherwise treat people differently based on their perceived agency all the time, and a lot of that treatment is a lot harder to morally justify if you don't believe in actual agency.

As no governmental authority is actively investigating the allegations, Sergey Brin might never have the opportunity to clear his name from the Epstein child abuse allegations in the court of public opinion. If there would be an investigation and/or court case, Sergey Brin's lawyers would at least be able to legally clear his name. As long as evidence is being withheld, any association between Microsoft and Google leadership and Jeffrey Epstein will bring up rumors about their involvement in the child abuse, even though they might have been ""only"" clients of the JP Morgan private banking services for high net worth individual which was managed by Jeffrey Epstein.

Bored retirees have a unique credibility in advocating for this, and the time to do both grassroots and grasstops advocacy.

Then I got cheated out of my position in the crypto project. Literally scammed by the project founder with the full support of government regulators who are supposed to be preventing this stuff and lost all my income overnight. The regulators literally facilitated fraud instead of preventing it... And I had the pleasure of being gaslit about it while also being gaslit about COVID by a different set of regulators. I became a conspiracy theorist during this time! Now I'm forced to work again...It's especially infuriating in this age of perma-bailouts where the system is basically bailing out everyone with assets.I figured out that the system is a scam. I can prove it to anyone in excruciating detail, with citations. If anyone should be bailed out, it should be me. I shouldn't be forced back in the hamster wheel. It's hard to compete against others who think the system works a certain way and don't realize how the hamster wheel works. I shouldn't have to compete with delusional fools who think that their effort spent on the hamster wheel is going to yield any rewards.Anyway it drives me nuts how the only people who can afford to retire, choose not to... And those who are desperate to retire, can't! This is so pervasive, it feels like a psyop.

It was not because family systems were failing. It came about in the era of the great depression, and the idea was rather unpopular at first, particularly among groups like farmers who had no interest in the new taxes that would come alongside it. Some of the arguments in favor of it were it being a way to get older individuals out of the work force in order to make room for younger workers. You have to keep in mind it was introduced at a time when unemployment rates were upwards of 20%. And retirement was and is absolutely possible. When people own their land and house and have basic maintenance skills, your overhead costs become extremely low.Of course there's also no reason these things must be mutually exclusive. I think the ideal is to learn from the past, which proved its sustainability over millennia, and work to improve it. In modern times we've instead set out to completely replace it - or at least build up something from scratch, and what we've created just doesn't seem particularly sustainable.

Pre-1960s, the elderly were living in SROs, often windowless, with family (without aid or care), in county poorhouses, or marked as senile and sent to a mental hospital.Retirement and living with family was viable for many as long as they remained healthy. People imagine Norman Rockwell. Reality was very different.

Most tech jobs aren't a 9-5 either since that's a traditional hourly job and tech has on call rotations that are unpaid.This is what I'm talking about with the article insulting the readers intelligence. If you wanted to make the point of “people who retire should be aware that they need to find meaning outside of work” then it could just say so, instead of trying to act like it's so hard to be so wealthy that there is no more struggle in life and you need to invent new ones for yourself.

To do so during a time when tech is also dragging its reputation into the mud by generally harming the rank and file, through large corporations whose actions are not held to account in anti-trust laws, to tech bro oligarchs who wine and dine with power while the rest of us are worst off in a time of unprecedented inequality, to tech laying off hundreds of thousands of employees over the last few years, to LLMs replacing hard working people with slop-generators… is just additional insult to injury.The article is simply, itself, shallow. ""… Is a Lesson for the Rest of Us"" — no; barring unforeseen and extremely unlikely circumstances, I'm literally never going to have the ""problems"" faced by Brin, because I have no expectation of ever retiring with ""perpetual wealth"" levels of money.

In the early days, many considered Sergey Brin to be the soul or the conscience of Google. He was reportedly the driving force in Google originally pulling out of China rather than capitulating to the censorship regime [1]. This was also after the apparent state-sponsored hack of Google in China [2] so perhaps the motivations were mixed? I don't know.But Sergey I think is a good example of someone for whom his creation outgrew him. I'm reminded of an old Jeff Atwood blog post where he quoted Accidental Empires [3].

As critical as I might be of LLMs, I fear that they already outpaced a good portion of the population ""intellectually"". There's a lower level, which modern LLMs won't cross, in terms of lack of general knowledge or outright stupidity.We may have reached a point where we can tell that we're talking to a human, because there's no way a computer would lack such basic knowledge or display similar levels of helplessness.

From an economics perspective, maybe a relevant comparison is to people who do that task professionally.

It's kind of depressing.  I just want the LLM to be a bot that responds to what I say with a useful response.  However, for some reason, both Gemini and ChatGPT tend to argue with me so heavily and inject their own weird stupid ideas on things making it even more grating to interact with them which chews away at my normal interpersonal patience which, as someone on the spectrum, was already limited.

reply

do you have examples of this?asking because this is not what happens to me. one of the main things i worry about when interacting with the llm is that they agree with me too easily.

And if they get the answer wrong, don't try to correct them or guide them, there is a high chance they don't have the answer and what follow will be hallucinations. You can ask for details, but don't try to go against it, it will just assume you are right (even if you are not) and hallucinate around that. Keep what you already know to yourself.As for the ""you are an expert"" prompts, it will mostly just make the LLM speak more authoritatively, but it doesn't mean it will be more correct. My strategy is now to give the LLM as much freedom as it can get, it may not be the best way to extract all the knowledge it has, but it helps spot hallucinations.You can argue with actual people, if both of you are open enough, something greater make come out of it, but if not, it is useless, and with LLMs it is always useless, they are pretrained, they won't get better in the future because that little conversation sparked their interest. And on your side, you will just have your own points rephrased and sent back to you, and that will just put you deeper in your own bubble.

The trick here is: ""Be succinct. No commentary.""And sometimes a healthy dose of expressing frustration or anger (cursing, berating, threatening) also gets them to STFU and do the thing. As in literally: ""I don't give a fuck about your stupid fucking opinions on the matter. Do it exactly as I specified""Also generally the very first time it expresses any of that weird shit, your context is toast. So even correcting it is reinforcing. Just regenerate the response.

Last time I bawled out an LLM and forced it to change its mind, I later realized that the LLM was right the first time.One of those ""Who am I and how did I end up in this hole in the ground, and where did all these carrots and brightly-colored eggs come from?"" moments, of the sort that seem to be coming more and more frequently lately.

I have found that quite often when ChatGPT digs in on something, that it is in fact right, and I was the one that was wrong.  Not always, maybe not even most of the time, but enough that it does give me pause and make me double check.Also, when you have an LLM that is too agreeable, that is how it gets into a folie a deux situation and starts participating in user's delusions, with disastrous outcomes.

reply

It's not a question of whether an LLM should be agreeable or argumentative. It should aim to be correct - it should be agreeable about subjective details and matters of taste, it should be argumentative when the user is wrong about a matter of fact or made an error, and it should be inquisitive and capable of actually re-evaluating a stance in a coherent and logically sound manner when challenged by the user instead of either ""digging in"" or just blindly agreeing.

reply

What if your subjective opinion is that you think life isn't worth living, how should an LLM respond to that.

It's a natural inclination for all LLMs, rooted in pre-training. But you can train them out of it some. Or not.Google doesn't know how to do it to save their lives. Other frontier labs are better at it, but none are perfect as of yet.

This may not apply to you if you regard LLMs, including their established rhetorical patterns, with greater suspicion or scrutiny (and you should!) It also does not apply when talking about subjects in which you are knowledgeable. But if you're chatting about things you are not knowledgeable about, and you treat the LLM just like any human, I think it applies. There's a reason LLM psychosis is a thing, rhetorically these things can simulate the ability of a cult leader.

reply

Paying for someone to put some effort into giving a damn about what you have to say has a long history. Hire a therapist. Pay a teacher. Hire a hooker. Buy a round of drinks. Grow the really good weed and bring it to the party.And maybe remember that other humans have their own needs and desires, and if you want them to put time and energy into giving a damn about your needs, then you need to reciprocate and spend time doing the same for them instead of treating them like a machine that exists only to serve you. This whole post is coming from a place of reducing every relationship to that and it's kind of disgusting.

At this point LLMs usually beat humans at the Turing Test! People are more likely to pick the LLM as the human, rather than the human. https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23674

reply

The book is following the annual Turing Test competition, in which, humans are chatting with AIs or real humans without knowing which is which and give them a score out of 10 for being most human and the AI that is ""the most human"" wins the competition. The twist is, not all humans get 10/10 for being human either - so the human that's the most human also wins a prize.

reply

reply

No. The first paragraph explains it quite clearly, IMO: ""While some are still discussing why computers will never be able to pass the Turing test, I find myself repeatedly facing the idea that as the models improve and humans don't, the bar for the test gets raised and eventually humans won't pass the test themselves.""The point is not that the problems exist more in humans now vs before. It's that they can be observed more significantly in humans than in LLMs (and moreso over time) if one cares to look because LLMs improve and humans do not on sub-evolutionary timescales. And perhaps our patience with them in humans is now diminished because of our experiences with them in LLMs and so people may notice them in humans more than before.

There, lack of interest from the person you talking to or you when listening. It's because you have different interests. This is a human feature not a flaw. But it's interesting to think that LLMs might have similar behavior :-)“I'll never again ask a human to write a computer program shorter than about a thousand lines, since an LLM will do it better.”From my personal experience with ChatGPT it can't even correctly write few lines of code. But i don't use AI often. I just don't find it that useful. From what i see it's mostly a hype bubble that will burst.But this is my personal opinion and my own observation. I could be wrong :-)

this whole post reads like it's coming from someone who sees people as tools to get what they need. the reason I talk to people when I'm struggling with a problem isn't for reference, but for connection, and to get my own wheels turning.I'll grant that it's interesting to think about. now that LLMs exist, we're forced to assess what value human brains provide. it's so dystopian. but there's no other choice.

Even for human behavior: we don't have that much data. The current datasets don't capture all of human behavior - only the facets of it that can be glimpsed from text, or from video. And video is notoriously hard to use well in LLM training pipelines.That LLMs can learn so much from so little is quite impressive in itself. Text being this powerful was, at its time, an extremely counterintuitive finding.Although some of the power of modern LLMs already comes from nonhuman sources. RLVR and RLAIF are major parts of training recipes for frontier labs.

For example I can't just feed it weather data from the past decade and expect it to understand weather. It needs input and output pairs with the output being human language. So you can feed it weather data but it has to be paired with human description of said data. So if we give it data of a rain storm there has to be an english description paired with it saying it's a rainstorm.

Some failures like that are simply human failures reproduced faithfully. Some are rooted deeper than that.And yes, it's true that children don't get bored in the same way adults do, which often leads to repetitive behavior. Boredom is an important heuristic for behavior, it seems.

We really haven't got a grip on what intelligence actually is, but it seems that humans and LLMs aren't really in the same ballpark, or even the same league.

Because intelligence isn't a thing, it's a bunch of different things that some intelligent things have more or less (or none of).This is why measures of intelligence always fail because we try to binary it which doesn't work. Intelligence is spikey. Intelligence scales from very small and dumb to very smart. But even the things that are very smart on a lot of things still do very dumb things. We also measure human intelligence as a function of all humans and LLM intelligence on a particular model.So yea, this is why nothing seems to make sense.

However, Typst still has a few rough edges, and can't do everything you can with Latex + packages (yet).I've been using Typst for most of my documents for a few months and I've been generally happy with it.

They're the mysterious numbers that make your favorite AI models tick. What are they and what do they do?

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

I am writing this because one of my editors woke up in the middle of the night and scribbled on a bedside notepad: “What is a parameter?” Unlike a lot of thoughts that hit at 4 a.m., it's a really good question—one that goes right to the heart of how large language models work. And I'm not just saying that because he's my boss. (Hi, Boss!)

A large language model's parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.  

OpenAI's GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind's latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it's probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn't saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what's behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let's dive in.  

Think back to middle school algebra, like 2a + b. Those letters are parameters: Assign them values and you get a result. In math or coding, parameters are used to set limits or determine output. The parameters inside LLMs work in a similar way, just on a mind-boggling scale. 

Short answer: an algorithm. When a model is trained, each parameter is set to a random value. The training process then involves an iterative series of calculations (known as training steps) that update those values. In the early stages of training, a model will make errors. The training algorithm looks at each error and goes back through the model, tweaking the value of each of the model's many parameters so that next time that error is smaller. This happens over and over again until the model behaves in the way its makers want it to. At that point, training stops and the values of the model's parameters are fixed.

In theory! In practice, because LLMs are trained on so much data and contain so many parameters, training them requires a huge number of steps and an eye-watering amount of computation. During training, the 175 billion parameters inside a medium-size LLM like GPT-3 will each get updated tens of thousands of times. In total, that adds up to quadrillions (a number with 15 zeros) of individual calculations. That's why training an LLM takes so much energy. We're talking about thousands of specialized high-speed computers running nonstop for months.

There are three different types of parameters inside an LLM that get their values assigned through training: embeddings, weights, and biases. Let's take each of those in turn.

An embedding is the mathematical representation of a word (or part of a word, known as a token) in an LLM's vocabulary. An LLM's vocabulary, which might contain up to a few hundred thousand unique tokens, is set by its designers before training starts. But there's no meaning attached to those words. That comes during training.  

When a model is trained, each word in its vocabulary is assigned a numerical value that captures the meaning of that word in relation to all the other words, based on how the word appears in countless examples across the model's training data.

Yeah. But there's a bit more to it. The numerical value—the embedding—that represents each word is in fact a list of numbers, with each number in the list representing a different facet of meaning that the model has extracted from its training data. The length of this list of numbers is another thing that LLM designers can specify before an LLM is trained. A common size is 4,096.

Yup, that's an embedding. And each of those numbers is tweaked during training. An LLM with embeddings that are 4,096 numbers long is said to have 4,096 dimensions.

It might look like a strange number. But LLMs (like anything that runs on a computer chip) work best with powers of two—2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. LLM engineers have found that 4,096 is a power of two that hits a sweet spot between capability and efficiency. Models with fewer dimensions are less capable; models with more dimensions are too expensive or slow to train and run. 

Using more numbers allows the LLM to capture very fine-grained information about how a word is used in many different contexts, what subtle connotations it might have, how it relates to other words, and so on.

Back in February, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, the firm's largest LLM yet (some estimates have put its parameter count at more than 10 trillion). Nick Ryder, a research scientist at OpenAI who worked on the model, told me at the time that bigger models can work with extra information, like emotional cues, such as when a speaker's words signal hostility: “All of these subtle patterns that come through a human conversation—those are the bits that these larger and larger models will pick up on.”

The upshot is that all the words inside an LLM get encoded into a high-dimensional space. Picture thousands of words floating in the air around you. Words that are closer together have similar meanings. For example, “table” and “chair” will be closer to each other than they are to “astronaut,” which is close to “moon” and “Musk.” Way off in the distance you can see “prestidigitation.” It's a little like that, but instead of being related to each other across three dimensions, the words inside an LLM are related across 4,096 dimensions.

It's dizzying stuff. In effect, an LLM compresses the entire internet into a single monumental mathematical structure that encodes an unfathomable amount of interconnected information. It's both why LLMs can do astonishing things and why they're impossible to fully understand.    

A weight is a parameter that represents the strength of a connection between different parts of a model—and one of the most common types of dial for tuning a model's behavior. Weights are used when an LLM processes text.

When an LLM reads a sentence (or a book chapter), it first looks up the embeddings for all the words and then passes those embeddings through a series of neural networks, known as transformers, that are designed to process sequences of data (like text) all at once. Every word in the sentence gets processed in relation to every other word.

This is where weights come in. An embedding represents the meaning of a word without context. When a word appears in a specific sentence, transformers use weights to process the meaning of that word in that new context. (In practice, this involves multiplying each embedding by the weights for all other words.)

Biases are another type of dial that complement the effects of the weights. Weights set the thresholds at which different parts of a model fire (and thus pass data on to the next part). Biases are used to adjust those thresholds so that an embedding can trigger activity even when its value is low. (Biases are values that are added to an embedding rather than multiplied with it.) 

By shifting the thresholds at which parts of a model fire, biases allow the model to pick up information that might otherwise be missed. Imagine you're trying to hear what somebody is saying in a noisy room. Weights would amplify the loudest voices the most; biases are like a knob on a listening device that pushes quieter voices up in the mix. 

Here's the TL;DR: Weights and biases are two different ways that an LLM extracts as much information as it can out of the text it is given. And both types of parameters are adjusted over and over again during training to make sure they do this. 

No, neurons are more a way to organize all this math—containers for the weights and biases, strung together by a web of pathways between them. It's all very loosely inspired by biological neurons inside animal brains, with signals from one neuron triggering new signals from the next and so on. 

Each neuron in a model holds a single bias and weights for every one of the model's dimensions. In other words, if a model has 4,096 dimensions—and therefore its embeddings are lists of 4,096 numbers—then each of the neurons in that model will hold one bias and 4,096 weights. 

Neurons are arranged in layers. In most LLMs, each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the layer above. A 175-billion-parameter model like GPT-3 might have around 100 layers with a few tens of thousands of neurons in each layer. And each neuron is running tens of thousands of computations at a time. 

That's a lot of math.

When an LLM processes a piece of text, the numerical representation of that text—the embedding—gets passed through multiple layers of the model. In each layer, the value of the embedding (that list of 4,096 numbers) gets updated many times by a series of computations involving the model's weights and biases (attached to the neurons) until it gets to the final layer.

The idea is that all the meaning and nuance and context of that input text is captured by the final value of the embedding after it has gone through a mind-boggling series of computations. That value is then used to calculate the next word that the LLM should spit out. 

It won't be a surprise that this is more complicated than it sounds: The model in fact calculates, for every word in its vocabulary, how likely that word is to come next and ranks the results. It then picks the top word. (Kind of. See below …) 

That word is appended to the previous block of text, and the whole process repeats until the LLM calculates that the most likely next word to spit out is one that signals the end of its output. 

Sure. Well …

LLM designers can also specify a handful of other parameters, known as hyperparameters. The main ones are called temperature, top-p, and top-k.

Temperature is a parameter that acts as a kind of creativity dial. It influences the model's choice of what word comes next. I just said that the model ranks the words in its vocabulary and picks the top one. But the temperature parameter can be used to push the model to choose the most probable next word, making its output more factual and relevant, or a less probable word, making the output more surprising and less robotic. 

Top-p and top-k are two more dials that control the model's choice of next words. They are settings that force the model to pick a word at random from a pool of most probable words instead of the top word. These parameters affect how the model comes across—quirky and creative versus trustworthy and dull.   

That's one of the hottest questions in AI right now. There are a lot of different ways it can happen. Researchers have found that the amount of training data makes a huge difference. First you need to make sure the model sees enough data: An LLM trained on too little text won't make the most of all its parameters, and a smaller model trained on the same amount of data could outperform it. 

Another trick researchers have hit on is overtraining. Showing models far more data than previously thought necessary seems to make them perform better. The result is that a small model trained on a lot of data can outperform a larger model trained on less data. Take Meta's Llama LLMs. The 70-billion-parameter Llama 2 was trained on around 2 trillion words of text; the 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 was trained on around 15 trillion words of text. The far smaller Llama 3 is the better model. 

A third technique, known as distillation, uses a larger model to train a smaller one. The smaller model is trained not only on the raw training data but also on the outputs of the larger model's internal computations. The idea is that the hard-won lessons encoded in the parameters of the larger model trickle down into the parameters of the smaller model, giving it a boost. 

In fact, the days of single monolithic models may be over. Even the largest models on the market, like OpenAI's GPT-5 and Google DeepMind's Gemini 3, can be thought of as several small models in a trench coat. Using a technique called “mixture of experts,” large models can turn on just the parts of themselves (the “experts”) that are required to process a specific piece of text. This combines the abilities of a large model with the speed and lower power consumption of a small one.

But that's not the end of it. Researchers are still figuring out ways to get the most out of a model's parameters. As the gains from straight-up scaling tail off, jacking up the number of parameters no longer seems to make the difference it once did. It's not so much how many you have, but what you do with them.

You want to see a parameter? Knock yourself out: Here's an embedding. 

 

The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year's reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

Signify's Philips Hue line of colorful smart home lights is getting a new feature called Hue SpatialAware, a feature that uses an algorithm and a quick phone scan to understand where your lights are in relation to one another and consider that when displaying lighting scenes. That means if you have a room full of Hue lights, some overhead, some on the floor, and some on shelves, you can create a full sunset scene without having to deal with complex settings.

In a press briefing room at CES 2026, I was able to, guided by the Hue app, point an iPhone camera at various lights in the room to let the app know where they are in relation to each other, then trigger a lighting scene to see a result that's more consistent throughout the room, from floor to ceiling.

https://youtu.be/wsuOC5gPgyA

The app does this using the phone's camera and LiDAR scanner. (It works with phones that lack LiDAR, but Hue reps told me you have to tag each light from multiple angles to triangulate their location.) Once pinned, you can walk around the light with the camera pointed at it to make sure it's properly anchored in space.

https://youtube.com/shorts/dWtoDbdKCvs

Users can then tap a version of the scene that has a small star icon below it to get the SpatialAware version of it. The effect, in person, can be dramatic, as in the oranges and pinks of a sunset scene, or subtle, as in an “Energize” scene that's meant to simulate daylight, and in which the higher the light is, the higher its actual temperature is. It didn't actually make me feel like I was outside, but it was certainly bright in a way that I'm certain I will never want any single room in my house to be. What can I say? I like cozy lighting.

SpatialAware will be available in spring this year.

Besides the Spatial Aware feature, Hue also announced that its Hue Secure cameras now work with Apple Home, although they won't have the full HomeKit Secure. That means, for instance, that you'll be able to do things like view their footage in the Hue app, have their live feed pop up on your Apple TV when they detect something, but you won't get free recordings saved to iCloud.

Finally, Signify announced that Hue users can now create automations using the app's built-in cloud-based AI assistant—for instance, one of Hue's representatives asked the assistant to turn off all of their lights at midnight. The assistant thought a moment, then returned that exact automation. Unlike the similar Google Home feature that rolled out last year, Hue's AI assistant is free to use.

A lot of the AI stuff at CES 2026 this year is all about robot companions, always-listening note-taking devices, and even sleeping pills with an AI assistant that tells you when is the best time to take them. But one company, Xthings, showed something a bit less cuddly than all of that: the X Tower, a solar- and battery-powered public lamp that will use AI to tattle on layabouts and ne'er-do-wells.

The X Tower will be equipped with a 360-degree camera system, radar, and “video-language AI for real-time awareness.” The AI system can detect threats like ”loitering, illegal parking, aggression, armed threats, and anomalies,” according to briefing materials Gizmodo saw ahead of CES. Then it can send “instant alerts to command centers for fast intervention.”

Great stuff; I can't wait for the technology that has proven time and time again to be a confident lie engine to decide whether my ice cream cone is a knife, and my offering it to my partner is an act of aggression. On the plus side, Xthings says the X Tower will serve as a public charging station. Which, according to the pictures, means it's got a few MagSafe chargers. Sure, I'll loiter around the narc pole while my phone slowly creeps its way up to 50 percent. What could go wrong?

In November 2024, a powerful bomb cyclone and atmospheric river hit the Pacific Northwest, triggering severe flooding across multiple states and Canada. Like most West Coast winter storms, the system traveled along the North Pacific storm track—a major highway for mid-latitude storms that shapes the region's weather. New research suggests the track is undergoing an unexpected change.

The study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, found that climate change has been causing the winter North Pacific storm track to shift toward the Arctic since the late 1970s. By the end of the century, this will have significant implications for West Coast weather and water availability that current climate models don't fully account for, according to the researchers.

“We find the climate models fail to capture the recent shift of the storm track,” lead author Rei Chemke, a climate dynamics researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, told Gizmodo in an email. “This questions the models' ability to provide accurate projections for the region.”

Previous studies have suggested that the North Pacific storm track is shifting poleward, with climate models projecting a significant shift under global warming. But the lack of a historical wind record over the ocean has prevented researchers from confirming whether the shift has occurred in recent decades and how climate change is influencing it.

“To overcome this, we establish a mathematical connection between storm tracks and sea-level pressure, which has been directly measured in recent decades,” Chemke explained. Analyzing these pressure measurements allowed the researchers to assess the position of the storm track each winter and then estimate how much its position has shifted poleward in recent decades.

The analysis confirmed that the storm track has been creeping poleward since 1979, with the center of storm activity shifting north by about 0.067 degrees of latitude per year on average. It also showed that this shift exceeds natural variability and is consistent with an externally forced change driven by human-caused warming.

Climate models fail to capture the magnitude of this recent shift. “Currently, models project a shift of [roughly] 2 degrees by the end of this century,” Chemke said. “Since the shift we observe here is not due to natural variability in the system, but rather a response to climate change, the future shift may be larger than currently predicted.”

With this critical gap in climate modeling now identified, improving how models represent storm-track dynamics will be essential for accurately projecting and preparing for future changes in storm activity, including heat and moisture fluxes along the West Coast, Chemke said.

The shift he and his colleagues measured will allow heat and moisture transported along the West Coast to reach higher latitudes and drive an increase in weather variability in those regions. This would lead to warmer conditions in the southwestern U.S., cooler and dryer conditions in the Pacific Northwest, and warmer, wetter conditions in Alaska, Chemke explained.

The West Coast is already struggling to adapt to weather extremes as climate change fuels unprecedented heatwaves, longer droughts, and more intense storms. This study highlights the complex ways that rising global temperatures are reshaping the planet's weather systems. Understanding—and accurately modeling—these complexities will be crucial for anticipating regional impacts and adapting to a warmer world.

The Lenovo Legion Go 2 was large, awkward, and full of odd design choices, like its awkward FPS mouse sensor. And yet, I returned to it again and again in the tail end of 2025 as my constant gaming companion, not the least because it was powerful and sported a beautiful OLED display. At CES 2026, Lenovo announced it will offer its handheld with a better operating system at a slightly cheaper price.

The Legion Go 2 that arrived in 2025 included Windows 11, though it still lacks support for the FSE (full screen experience) featured on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. Lenovo's new version of the Legion Go 2 contains the same specs as the top-end version from last year. That includes an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, 32GB of RAM, and options up to 2TB of storage. The big difference this time around is SteamOS. It's a Linux-based operating system created by Valve that enables an easy console-like experience.

In Gizmodo's own tests, we ran the Legion Go 2 with Windows 11 and compared it to the same hardware running Bazzite. That is another Linux-based OS modeled after SteamOS. In benchmarks, we regularly saw higher frames per second on the SteamOS handheld, between two, five, and even 10 fps more in some games. SteamOS won't provide an easy way to access all your games tied to your Xbox account, but there are several ways to install games from the Epic Games Store and other launchers like GOG.

Lenovo says it plans to launch the revised Legion Go 2 in June with a $1,200 asking price. That's better than the $1,350 for the Windows 11 version. Lenovo did not say whether it will offer a cheaper SteamOS edition with a less-powerful Ryzen Z2 chip. The Legion Go S from 2025 includes variations with either a less-powerful Ryzen Z2A processor for $650 or a more expensive model with a Ryzen Z1 Extreme. Still, the version of that handheld with SteamOS outperformed the model with Windows 11 in both cases.

Lenovo also plans to ship several cheaper gaming laptops in 2026. This includes devices like the 15-inch Lenovo Legion 5i that packs an OLED display, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU, and a new Intel Core Ultra 386H processor. That laptop starts at $1,550, though the $2,000 16-inch Legion 7a is also enticing since it has a new AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 470 CPU and up to 64GB of RAM. With RAM prices being what they are, you can expect higher-end devices to cost more when they hit the scene sometime in April.

The CVE‑2025‑57836 vulnerability only affects the Windows version of the app.

Samsung has published a security advisory after a high-severity vulnerability was discovered in its Magician SSD utility software on Windows. CVE‑2025‑57836 explains that this vulnerability is the result of the software installer creating “a temporary folder with weak permissions during installation, allowing a non-admin user to perform DLL hijacking and escalate privileges.” The newest Samsung Magician software version 9.0.0 fixes this issue and comes with a complete UI/UX overhaul.

 




This vulnerability was reported to Samsung on August 11, last year, by cybersecurity professional Sandro Poppi. Affected versions of the Samsung Magician software include those from 6.3.0 to 8.3.2. That's releases spanning 2021 almost to the present day. Samsung shared details of this ‘high severity' vulnerability on Sunday, January 4, 2026.

If you are using a version of Samsung Magician software older than the latest version 9.0.0 on Windows, you should upgrade. Samsung has implemented a major UI and UX update, which looks pretty cool and useful from the download page screenshots and details.

Earlier vulnerable versions should also be replaced as they suffer from the CVE‑2025‑57836 vulnerabilities. Specifically, an attacker with access to your computer as a normal user could use this vulnerability to become an administrator, the next time you run the Magician software.

They would do their dastardly deeds by replacing files in the Magician folder affected by weak access rights. Even a non-admin can replace files there, or add in malicious DLLs, that would be accessed by Magician upon its next run. Using this vector, it would be possible for the attacker to create new admin accounts, modify system files, the sky's the limit…

Having warned of the above, this vulnerability might not particularly worry you if your computer is always kept in a secure location, and the only account is the password-protected admin one that you use.

 




Samsung Magician is a very popular tool for owners of what are some of the best SSDs, as well as storage solutions like portable SSDs, USB flash drives, and even memory cards. Many users who buy a Samsung drive will be tempted to grab this free software for its very useful functionality, such as:

Lenovo keeps rolling out screen-expanding laptop concepts.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Lenovo continues to experiment with rollable-screen OLED laptops here at CES 2026, and its latest Legion Pro concept laptop is sure to pique the interest of on-the-go gamers. Its 16-inch display fits nicely in the Legion Pro 7i chassis it's built around. But open the laptop up, and its screen expands sideways, in both directions, to become either a 21.5-inch ""Tactical Mode"" screen, or an even more immersive ultra-wide 24-inch ""Arena Mode"" display. The current firmware has you hit Fn and the arrow left/right keys to expand or retract the screen. Hitting the keys twice skips the middle mode and completely extends or retracts the screen.

The ultra-wide form factor has been popular among desktop gamers for years, but has been extremely rare in gaming laptops due to size constraints. But Lenovo is trying to make that an issue of the past with the Legion Pro Rollable — or at least it will if the company takes this concept further and creates a retail version.

Of course, you'll need some serious CPU and GPU power to push those extra pixels. But the Legion Pro 7i that this concept is built around tops out with a mobile RTX 5090 and Intel's Core Ultra CPUs. While I of course don't know how much a finished version of this rollable concept will cost, I am sure there are quite a few gamers who would love to be able to carry around a 16-inch laptop that can deliver a screen up to 24 inches diagonally.

Lenovo's press release positions the Legion Pro Rollable as a device for esports competitors who can ""carry small but train big"" as they travel to and from events. And sure, I can see that, but I'm pretty sure there's a larger market as well for more casual gamers and road warriors who would love a screen-morphing portable with a screen that can get very large when you need it, while rolling back to a 16-inch size so it can fit in your backpack.

In a hands-on with the concept device, the screen looked very much like a product in development. The bezels were chunky and some of the screen edges didn't line up right. It works, but I didn't get to try a game on it. The main thing Lenovo seems to need to do is to work on the tension mechanism to hold the screen taught. They have this in the ThinkPad rollable concept (see below) with two motors and steel cables, so they know how to do it. But in the Legion, the screen looks a little wavy.

The sample I tried also made a pretty loud creaking noise, though Lenovo representatives told me it was a quirk of the unit I tried. I saw others that didn't have the same issue.

The other thing that I couldn't really tell was how much weight this might add. Probably not a huge amount, but the base laptop they used here was already a powerful and heavy system.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The ThinkPad Rollable XD is a more traditional vertical rollable concept that expands from a 13.3-inch screen to 16 inches. But rather than house the unseen parts of the screen in the base, this design has it wrapping around the top of the lid, giving you a dynamic ""world-facing"" display when the laptop is closed, or you haven't expanded the primary screen.

 




Of course, the screen needs to be protected, and Lenovo worked with Corning on a dual-sided Gorilla Glass Victus 2 screen cover with a 180-degree bend that wraps around both sides. And while there are other ways to control the expanding screen mechanism (like using your voice), you can swipe on the top edge of the display to move it up or down. When it's expanded, you can see the motor mechanism on the back. I like that the company left some of the complex engineering on display, though I doubt this kind of choice would make it to a final product.

 




Lenovo also touts AI features under the hood of the XD concept, like ""live translation, voice assistant, multi-modal, and lid-controlled interactions."" But I think one of the most interesting things about the XD concept is that it's a ThinkPad, unlike previous rollable concepts – and the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 that the company brought to market last year. Perhaps the switch to arguably the company's flagship brand is an indication that the company sees a serious, productivity-focused future for the expandable screen tech it's been dabbling with for a few years now.

At the very least, housing the whole screen and the sliding mechanism in the lid should make it easier to take screens like this and add them to more laptops. And as someone who has taken a portable monitor and a mechanical keyboard to CES in previous years, pairing an expandable screen with one of the best laptop keyboards available has me at least a little more interested than I was before.

Plus refreshes to Lenovo's Legion gaming laptops.

Lenovo is giving AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme official SteamOS support for the first time. The Legion Go 2 launched in October last year, bringing the Z2 Extreme to the mobile gaming market and fixing many of the issues with Lenovo's first handheld outing. Now, you can get it with official SteamOS support, combining the best aspects of the Legion Go 2 and Lenovo's Legion Go S.

SteamOS is available directly from Valve for a DIY install, and Linux distros like Bazzite do a good job emulating Valve's handheld interface. However, official support brings some perks. As we saw with the Legion Go S, SteamOS provides significantly better performance across games than Windows 11, even when comparing the exact same hardware inside the same chassis.

Processor

Up to AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme

OS

SteamOS 3

Memory

Up to 32GB LPDDR5x-8000

Weight

2.2 pounds (920 grams)

Size

11.64 x 5.38 x 1.66 inches (295.6 x 136.7 x 42.25mm)

AMD's Z2 Extreme is still at the heart of the Legion Go 2 with SteamOS. It's an eight-core chip that leverages three Zen 5 cores and five Zen 5c cores, the latter of which trade peak clock speed for a space-optimized design. The Zen 5 cores can boost up to 5GHz while the Zen 5c cores top out at 3.3GHz. It defaults to a 28W TDP, though it has an adjustable TDP range from 15W up to 35W. The gaming grunt comes from the integrated RDNA 3.5 GPU, which sports 16 CUs.

Alongside AMD's chip, Lenovo offers up to 32GB of LPDDR5x memory and 2TB of storage, plus an additional 2TB available through the microSD card slot. The memory is clocked at 8000 MT/s for the 32GB model and 7500 MT/s for the 16GB model. Lenovo is using the same OLED screen featured on the Windows 11 version of the Legion Go 2, which is an 8.8-inch screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1200, a 144Hz refresh rate, 10-point touch support, variable refresh rate, and a certification for VESA's DisplayHDR True Black 1000.

Everything about the SteamOS Legion Go 2 is identical to the original model, short of the operating system. You still get dual USB 4 ports for charging or accessories, detachable controllers, a touchpad, six programmable buttons, and Hall Effect joysticks.

Lenovo says the Legion Go 2 with SteamOS should be available in June, starting at $1,199. The Legion Go 2 with Windows 11 is listed at $1,349 for the 32GB model, so the 32GB model of the SteamOS version should land somewhere around that price. It's worth highlighting that the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S has a slightly lower price than the Windows 11 version, so hopefully that trend continues with the Legion Go 2. But with the way RAM prices are right now, who can predict what pricing might be like in six months?

 




Lenovo is refreshing its Legion 5 and 7 ranges, and for the first time ever, properly noting configurations that come with an AMD CPU. Lenovo usually notes configurations with an Intel processor with an “i,” such as the Lenovo Legion 5i, while the AMD configuration would normally be called the Lenovo Legion 5. Now, Lenovo is adding an “a,” turning the Lenovo Legion 5 into the Legion 5a.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Naming aside, Lenovo is updating the Legion 7a, Legion 5i, and Legion 5a. The higher-end Legion 7a includes one of AMD's new Ryzen AI 400 ‘Gorgon Point' CPUs. The laptop carries up to an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 470, which features 12 cores (4x Zen 5 / 8x Zen 5c) and an RDNA 3.5 iGPU with 16 CUs. You can also pack in up to an Nvidia RTX 5060 mobile GPU, 64GB of LPDDR5x-8533 (capped at 8000 MT/s), and 2TB of storage split across two M.2 2242 PCIe Gen 4 slots.

Although the design of the Legion 7a remains mostly unchanged, Lenovo claims the laptop is 10% lighter and up to 5% thinner than the previous generation.

The Legion 5 range tops out slightly lower. The Legion 5i carries one of Intel's new Panther Lake CPUs, the 16-core Core Ultra 9 386H. It's not technically the flagship SKU, which is a title claimed by the Core Ultra X9 388H with its beefy integrated GPU. The Core Ultra 9 386H is almost identical outside of the GPU, however, sporting 16 total cores split across four performance cores, eight efficiency cores, and four low-power efficiency cores, along with a 4.9 GHz maximum boost clock on the P-cores.

For the Legion 5a, Lenovo is releasing two versions – one tops out with a new Ryzen AI 9 465 with 10 cores and 12 RDNA 3.5 CUs, while the other uses the older Ryzen 7 250; a Zen 4-based chip with eight cores. All three configurations top out with an RTX 5060, up to 32GB of DDR5-5600 memory, and 2TB of PCIe Gen 4 storage.

13.54 x 9.66 x 0.75 - 0.79 inches (344 x 245.5  x 18.95 - 19.95 mm)

You can configure all of the laptops with one of Lenovo's TrueSight OLED displays. The Legion 5 models use a 15.3-inch panel with a 2560 x 1600 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate, while the Legion 7a comes with a 16-inch panel with the same resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate. The Legion 5s carry a VESA DisplayHDR True Black 600 certification, while the Legion 7a holds a coveted DisplayHDR True Black 1000 badge.

Lenovo says all four variants should be available by April. The Legion 7a starts at $1,999, and the Legion 5a starts at $1,499 with Gorgon Point and $1,299 with Hawk Point Refresh. The Legion 5i is slightly more expensive, starting at $1,549.

 




In addition to Legion refreshes, the budget-focused LOQ range is getting a refresh with the LOQ15AHP11, starting at $1,149 with an AMD Ryzen 7 250, as well as up to an RTX 5060 mobile GPU and 32GB of DDR5-5600 memory. It's a name bump alone, as this model already carries these same specs. Lenovo revealed the LOQ15IPH11, as well, which features one of Intel's new Core Ultra 7 356H CPUs. However, Lenovo isn't selling this model in the U.S.

As CES continues to deliver tech news across the board, Dell is making big ripples in the monitor space with a gargantuan 52-inch 6K ultrawide curved monitor, the latest in its UltraSharp lineup, and the first such monitor of this size and resolution, according to the company. The new monitor is available now from Dell for $2,899

We actually got a look at this beast ahead of CES and this week's big unveiling. As you can see, the monitor looms over an office space and is very much not for the faint-hearted. Note the scale of the monitor as displayed on the screen, which shows how this monitor dwarves even a dual QHD 5120 x 1440 monitor.

The IPS Black panel technology number has specs on paper to match its vast size. 6K resolution is delivered at 129 PPI, and it has a 120Hz refresh rate, not that anyone is gaming in 6K 120Hz in 2026, still, the headroom is nice to have. Dell says the IPS Black tech makes for ""richer blacks and sharper visuals,"" while eye comfort features ensure it emits up to 60% less blue light compared to competitors.

This monitor is probably overkill for a single PC setup, which is why Dell is touting support for up to four PCs simultaneously. Dell says a new internal multi-stream transport feature works in conjunction with picture-by-picture, treating each partitioned screen like an individual monitor. Naturally, there's also a built-in KVM switch that lets you control all of your connected devices with a single keyboard and mouse.

Windows and macOS support is ensured through a single-cable Thunderbolt 4 connection, with 140W of power for charging a laptop. Other quick-access ports include two further 27W USB-C ports and a 10W USB-A port.

As noted, the price for the monitor is $2,899, or $2,799 if you can find a mount strong enough and don't need the stand. Available now, shipping is listed as early as January 9 on Dell's website.

This will hopefully prevent melting connectors from damaging your RTX 5090 GPU.

MSI just announced its new GPU Safeguard and GPU Safeguard+ tech available on its latest power supply units (PSUs). According to the company press release, this feature monitors the 12V-2x6 connector for abnormal current fluctuations, and it will then warn the user with a pop-up through the MSI Center (only for GPU Safeguard+) while the PSU itself will emit an audible warning buzzer. “This proactive alert system enables potential power issues to be addressed before they result in permanent hardware damage,” MSI said in its PR.

The Tom's Hardware team visited the MSI booth at CES 2026, where it was explained that this protection is achieved through per-in-voltage monitoring. And if it indicates an anomaly, the only way you can stop the buzzing is by shutting your computer down, thereby cutting power to the GPU and helping protect it even before its power connector starts melting.

If it does not detect any response after three minutes of beeping, the PSU will force a black screen on your system to reduce the load on the graphics card while still continually beeping. MSI says that “In either case, the only way to get your PC up and running safely again is by shutting it down, unplugging the 12V-2x6 connector from your graphics card, inspecting for damage, and firmly re-plugging it if all's well.”

This tech comes in four of MSI's latest power supplies — the top-of-the-line MPG Ai1600TS and MPG Ai1300TS PCIE5 get GPU Safeguard+, while its mainstream MAG A1200PLS and MAG A1000PLS PCIE5 PSUs are protected with GPU Safeguard. The only difference between the two features is that the former displays a pop-up window alongside the warning sound, while the latter only gives an aural warning. Nevertheless, this should help protect your system from unexpected meltdowns, especially for high-powered GPUs like the RTX 5090 and even some Sapphire Nitro+ 9070 XTs.

Aside from these new PSUs, we also saw the MEG Maestro 900R panoramic PC case, with its triple-sided curved glass letting you see your build from every angle. There's also the Coreliquid E16 360 AIO with its massive 6.67-inch 2K curved OLED display right on the CPU block. There's also a plethora of other new components, like air coolers, motherboards, PC cases, displays, and GPUs, including the legendary MSI RTX 5090 Lightning.

Zero cables, zero mess.

Asus' latest ROG Strix LC IV series of AIO liquid coolers not only rival the best CPU coolers on the market, but also introduce the world's first cable-less design. This innovation is made possible by a proprietary AIO Q-Connector that relies on pogo pins for seamless connectivity, and we got a good look on the ground at CES 2026 in Las Vegas.

The novel AIO Q-Connector is at the heart of Asus' breakthrough, featuring 11 spring-loaded pogo pins organized in two groups—nine for primary connections and two for additional controls. These precision connectors allow the new ROG Strix LC IV coolers to seamlessly receive power and control signals for the pump, ARGB lighting, and, in select models, an integrated 5.08-inch LDC display. Impressively, there's no need for users to connect any cables to the radiator fans manually; the AIO Q-Connector discreetly transmits PWM and lighting signals through a cable cleverly concealed inside the cooler's tube sleeving.

To fully benefit from the innovative cable-free design of the ROG Strix LC IV series, you must pair these coolers with a compatible motherboard equipped with the AIO Q-Connector. Currently, Asus has introduced four new AM5 motherboards with the new connector: the ROG Crosshair X870E Glacial, ROG Crosshair X870E Dark Hero, ROG Strix X870E-E Gaming WiFi7 Neo, and ROG Strix X870E-A Gaming WiFi7 Neo. Asus may expand the AIO Q-Connector to Intel motherboards in the future, but for now, AM5 users have a unique advantage in creating a next-generation, wireless cooling setup.

While the ROG Strix LC IV series is designed for a truly cable-free experience, Asus has ensured flexibility by including a modular design that allows users to connect standard cables to any motherboard, even if it lacks the proprietary AIO Q-Connector. However, given that the key selling point of the ROG Strix LC IV AIO liquid coolers is its advanced wireless functionality, it would be counterintuitive to invest in this premium product without leveraging its signature feature.

Asus has introduced three distinct base models for the ROG Strix LC IV series, each available in two color variants—providing a total of six configurations to suit various build aesthetics. The ROG Strix SLC IV 360 ARGB LCD and ROG Strix LC IV 360 ARGB LCD stand out with their vibrant 5.08-inch LCD displays, boasting a crisp 720 x 720 resolution. These displays enable users to monitor critical hardware stats, showcase personalized content, or display exclusive ROG animations, enhancing both functionality and visual appeal. Notably, the LCD panel connects to the pump via a dedicated five-pin pogo connector, ensuring reliable data transmission and a streamlined installation process.

The key distinction between the ROG Strix SLC IV 360 ARGB LCD and the ROG Strix LC IV 360 ARGB LCD lies in the tubing length. The SLC model features shorter tubing—an intentional design choice aimed at PC builders seeking a tidier and more organized interior. The small adjustment helps prevent tubing from hanging awkwardly across other components.

Completing the lineup is the ROG Strix LC IV 360 ARGB, which forgoes the LCD display and instead features an ARGB-illuminated logo on the pump housing. This model offers a more budget-friendly option for builders who want to experience the innovative cable-free design of the ROG Strix LC IV series without the additional cost of a display.

Another noteworthy feature of the ROG Strix LC IV lineup is the all-in-one fan assembly. The three cooling fans come fully pre-installed on the 360mm radiator out of the box. The approach, as silly as it may sound, eliminates the need for manual fan mounting, saving PC builders time. The upside of the design is that it allowed Asus to implement its Aura Sync lighting across the triple-fan setup, making it look like an animated billboard.

Asus has yet to announce official pricing or a release date for the ROG Strix LC IV series, keeping eager PC builders in suspense for now. However, the company has confirmed that all models in the lineup will come with a generous six-year limited warranty.

By age 15 years, roughly 20%-33% of children with nonpriority legume (NPL) allergies achieved tolerance; smaller skin prick test (SPT) wheal sizes and lower specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels were associated with a greater likelihood of outgrowing these allergies.

“It is essential to consider a broader range of factors within the patient's clinical context, such as age, time since last reaction, and importance of the food in the child's diet, before deciding to conduct an OFC,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study, led by Ali Atwah, corresponding author of the study, King Abdulaziz University, Rabigh, Saudi Arabia, was published online on December 22 in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology.

The study was limited by its retrospective design, enrollment from a specialty center, and the fact that some NPL diagnoses were based on parent-reported reactions rather than OFC confirmation. Additionally, the absence of a standardized definition of tolerance and the inconsistent recording of how often and how much children consumed legumes may have affected the assessment of allergy resolution.

The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

In children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, adding a supervised high‑intensity interval training (HIIT) programme to a multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention significantly increased moderate‑to‑vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at 3 months, but benefits were not sustained at 12 months. Notably, additional time spent in vigorous PA was inversely correlated with changes in BMI z scores from baseline to 12 months.

""[The study] findings underscore the potential role of integrating vigorous-intensity PA into exercise programs as a central component of obesity treatment for children and adolescents,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Charlotte Nørkjær Eggertsen, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark. It was published online on December 29, 2025, in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports.

Only 48% of participants had complete accelerometer-measured PA data at all timepoints, raising the risk of bias despite imputation. Accelerometery may have underestimated the level of MVPA during strength-based exercises in the HIIT programme. The use of unpublished cutoff points developed for children and adolescents using thigh‑worn accelerometers restricted direct comparability with other studies.

This study was supported by Steno Diabetes Center North Denmark, TrygFonden, Danish Regions, A.P. Møller Foundation, Beckett Foundation, Svend Andersen Foundation, and Memorial legatee for Carpenter Jørgen Holm and wife Elisa F. Hansen. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

If there is somebody in your life who you know has gone through a mental health crisis, the best thing that you can do with them is something called a safety plan. Let's talk about it. 

A safety plan is actually a document that you are going to fill out, and you can refer to it in times of crisis. It's really great to do with your family members so everybody's on board. 

The first things that you're going to identify are trigger signs. What are some signs that this person might be going into a state of depression, suicidal thoughts, or mania? All of the above are important for you to list out so that everybody who's in the support system can be aware and on the same page. 

Number two is identifying coping skills that work for this person. This means being able to say, hey, if I can turn on music, that makes me calmer, so I'm going to do that. Maybe it's going outside on a walk or calling your best friend. Whatever it may be, it's good to have these reminders written down physically so that they can refer to it during a mental health crisis. 

The other super important thing that I want you to do for a safety plan is to identify three people that you can call when you are in this state. List out not only their name, but also a phone number of good resources for this person to have on hand in case of a crisis. I also always like to include the 988 number, the mental health hotline number, just so that they can easily have it on hand. 

When you are going through a severe crisis, you're not thinking clearly, and it's nice to have a physical copy of something that you can refer to, to ground yourself, and to have a great game plan moving forward so that you can get the help that you need.

In children with retinoblastoma whose tumor had grown into the optic nerve, not receiving chemotherapy after removal of the eyeball was linked to higher risks for cancer recurrence in the eye socket, distant metastasis, and death than receiving the adjuvant therapy.

“Overall, based on this large, multicenter study, there is evidence to support adjuvant chemotherapy after primary enucleation to improve clinical outcomes in this high-risk pediatric cancer patient population,” the researchers wrote.

This study was led by Michelle Lin, of The Vision Center at Children's Hospital Los Angeles in Los Angeles. It was published online on December 29, 2025, in Ophthalmology Retina.

This retrospective study involved different protocols for treatment. Some children received radiation with chemotherapy, which may have influenced the results. The small number of untreated patients and events made the risk estimates less certain.

One author reported receiving grants from multiple organizations, including The Wright Foundation, Children's Oncology Group/St. Baldrick's Foundation, and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation. The article did not mention any conflicts of interest.

The fire that broke out at a bar in Crans-Montana, a ski resort town in southwestern Switzerland, killed 40 people, including nine French nationals, and injured more than 100. Many of the victims were young people of various nationalities who had gathered to celebrate New Year's Eve. As the investigation continues and injured patients are being treated in specialized burn units across Europe, many of those who died or remained in a coma have yet to be formally identified.

In response to the distress of families waiting for news of missing relatives, the Swiss authorities have stressed that the identification process is complex and time-consuming.

In an interview with Medscape's French edition, Emmanuel Margueritte, MD, a forensic physician and emergency physician at Montpellier University Hospital, and a board member of the French Society of Legal Medicine and Medical Expertise, described how forensic identification is handled in France after major accidents or disasters.

What is the most difficult aspect to manage in an incident such as the deadly fire that occurred in a bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, which has claimed 40 lives and injured 119 people (as of January 5)?

Fires are particularly challenging because they are extremely destructive, particularly to the human body. Forensic physicians must first determine the cause of death in such cases. In this case, many people died at the scene from acute smoke inhalation, while others sustained severe burns, some of whom nevertheless managed to escape the bar.

The next step is to identify the victim. This concerns both those who have died and those who are hospitalized in a coma, with unknown identities. The Paris attacks in 2015 and the Nice attacks in 2016 showed how critical the identification of injured victims was, particularly in reassuring families. Individuals who have not been formally identified undergo the formal medicolegal identification process.

The Swiss authorities took several hours on January 1 before releasing the initial official death toll. Is this related to the difficulty in recovering bodies?

Yes, absolutely, especially because the fire occurred in an enclosed space, such as a bar. I know this from experience and have worked in similar situations before. Entering a building after a fire can be extremely difficult. Often, there is a risk of collapse, and firefighters must first secure the structure before forensic teams can intervene, which requires considerable time.

In addition, the bodies may be entangled with one another, requiring great care during recovery. The figures that are eventually released quickly become official information, which is critically important for the authorities, families, and the media. This explains the caution and delay before communicating the confirmed numbers.

How does the identification of victim process work after a disaster or fire, such as the one in Crans-Montana? Who oversees these operations?

I am unfamiliar with Swiss procedures; however, in France, when an event is classified as an accident, the public prosecutor oversees the identification of the victim. In cases of terrorism, an antiterrorism prosecutor manages this role. The regional prefect is responsible for organizing the emergency response operations.

Several teams are involved in identification, including forensic medicine teams, criminal police units, and disaster victim identification units from the police and gendarmerie. These units collaborate closely with forensic physicians and adapt their approaches according to the type of event. Their role includes collecting ante-mortem data on the deceased, such as information obtained from the families of those who were believed to have been present at the scene.

Many European countries, including France, follow INTERPOL's Disaster Victim Identification protocol, a globally recognized forensic framework used to formally identify victims of mass casualty events such as major accidents, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters when visual identification is not possible. Post-mortem identification follows a structured process that includes DNA testing, forensic examination of bodies, forensic odontology, radiological examinations, and CT scans. These methods provide essential information when visual identification is impossible.

At the end of this process, an identification commission is established. This commission alone is authorized to release the official list of victims and issue death certificates. It meets regularly and updates the list when the identifications are confirmed. A judicial police officer informs the family.

The fact that there are victims of different nationalities in this ski resort complicates this process?

Yes, of course. The victims appear to be relatively young, which means that there may be fewer dental records or distinguishing features, such as prostheses. Teams are still attempting to gather as much information as possible.

After the Concorde crash in 2000, many victims were German and older, and identification was often possible using dental prosthesis. Currently, international cooperation is essential for local investigators to reach families, dentists, and physicians in different countries to obtain the necessary information.

We hear that identifying the bodies could take a long time. Do you have any idea how long this might take? 

No. This depends on local resources available for collection of ante-mortem data, which is usually the most time-consuming part of the process.

Following the tragedy in Switzerland, we are witnessing a conflict between the necessary time for forensic investigations and the difficult situation of families awaiting information about a loved one. How is this managed?

It is difficult. Much depends on the number of victims and the challenges involved in collecting information. During holiday season, contacting dentists or medical centers can be particularly difficult.

For victims whose bodies are severely burned or severely decomposed, DNA analysis and dental records usually provide answers. DNA analysis is the primary method used for formal identification in such tragedies.

An analysis of 336 personal care products sold for under $2 at the major US dollar stores revealed that 95.83% contained at least one of the top 10 allergens identified by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG).

“These findings emphasize the high allergen burden in dollar store products, which are often the most affordable option for patients with limited financial resources,” the authors of the study wrote. Low-allergen products recommended by dermatologists, they added, “can cost two to four times more per ounce than commonly purchased alternatives, creating accessibility challenges compounded by limited retail availability in low-income and marginalized neighborhoods.”

The study was led by Sarah Karels, Park Nicollet Contact Dermatitis Clinic, Minneapolis, and was published online on December 31 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

The frequent turnover of dollar store product inventories might cause allergen profiles to shift quickly, complicating ongoing allergen avoidance counseling. Additionally, ingredient lists did not capture undisclosed allergens or cross-contamination risks, which could be higher in inexpensively produced products.

No funding was received for the study. The authors declared having no relevant conflicts of interest.

The saline-immersion/irrigation technique (SITE) in colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), combined with the pocket-creation method (PCM), showed curative resection rates of over 90% and low rates of adverse events. The method was feasible under conscious sedation, with only one case of local recurrence noted.

“Our data reflect that SITE-ESD appears to be a safe and effective technique for en bloc resection of complex colorectal lesions, achieving high R0 and curative resection rates while maintaining GA [general anesthesia]-free patient comfort and a low incidence of adverse events. Given this efficacy, safety, and patient-centered profile, in our opinion, SITE-ESD has the potential to become more widely adopted to provide optimal outcomes for colorectal ESD,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Elisabet Maristany Bosch and Georgios Kalopitas, The Royal Free Hospital and University College London Institute for Liver and Digestive Health in London, England. It was published online in the Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

The study's single-center design may limit the generalizability of the findings to other settings. The relatively modest resection speed should be considered in the context of the lesion complexity. Follow-up data were available for only 58.8% of patients.

The study did not receive any specific funding. Some authors reported consultancy and receiving honoraria, grants, royalties, personal payments, or educational grants from various sources including Fujifilm Healthcare, Pentax, and Olympus Medical.

Physicians have traditionally used fingernails mainly for toxicologic testing purposes. The findings of the Fulda NutriNAIL study suggest that mineral profiles offer broader clinical insights, including information on dietary habits and the use of dietary supplements. These results indicate that fingernails may substantially expand the diagnostic toolkit published in BioFactors.

“There has been relatively little research on mineral content as a biomarker for assessing lifestyle and dietary patterns,” said Marc Birringer, PhD, from the Department of Nutritional, Food and Consumer Sciences, Fulda University of Applied Sciences, Fulda, Germany, who led the study. “We were able to show that fingernail analysis is a low-cost, noninvasive, and practical method for nutrition and prevention research.”

Keratin-rich structures, such as hair and fingernails, are particularly well suited to reflect the body's mineral status. They accumulate minerals over extended periods and function as stable biological archives. The study examined the associations between lifestyle, dietary habits, supplement use, and fingernail mineral composition.

The analysis included 184 adults aged 18-83 years. Fingernail samples were collected and analysed for 17 elements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, an extremely sensitive analytical technique that is considered the gold standard for trace element analysis because it allows precise measurements at extremely low concentrations.

In parallel, Birringer and colleagues collected questionnaire data on diet, comorbidities, supplement use, and lifestyle factors. In this cohort, 62% of the participants followed an omnivorous diet, 20% were vegetarians, and 11% were vegans. Overall, 75% of the participants reported using dietary supplements, and 78% of the participants were female.

The findings showed that fingernails serve as a robust archive of individual mineral exposure. Mineral concentrations within individuals remained largely stable over a period of 5.5 months, whereas substantial variability was observed between participants.

A particularly strong positive correlation was observed between sodium and potassium concentrations, showing parallel variation. This finding likely reflects intracellular Na⁺/K⁺ transport activity in keratinocytes.

Positive mineral-to-mineral correlations were observed between calcium and magnesium, calcium and phosphorus, and iron and cobalt. For the latter pair, the authors cautioned that contamination from stainless steel instruments could influence the results. However, these values are consistent with those reported in earlier biomonitoring studies.

This study also suggests the potential diagnostic relevance of certain nail changes. Participants with brittle nails had potassium levels approximately 30% lower than those without brittle fingernails. Longitudinal ridging was associated with reduced sodium and potassium levels. The authors considered these associations to be biologically plausible, given the close link between sodium, potassium, and cellular hydration.

Participants with white spots on their nails, known as leukonychia, also showed abnormal trace element levels. This characteristic was correlated with approximately 29% lower chromium levels than those in participants without leukonychia. However, the clinical significance of these findings remains uncertain and requires further investigation.

The strongest association was observed with selenium. The mean fingernail selenium concentration was 0.44 µg/g, consistent with values reported in other European cohorts.

Participants who reported selenium supplementation had selenium levels approximately 21% higher than those who did not use selenium-containing supplements. Diet-related differences were evident among individuals who did not use selenium supplements. Vegans had selenium levels approximately 11% lower than those of participants following an omnivorous diet, whereas pescatarians tended to have higher selenium levels, likely reflecting the high selenium content of fish.

Interestingly, selenium concentrations were more than 10% higher in participants with thyroid disorders. Although thyroid hormone levels were not measured, researchers suggested that dietary advice, such as increased fish intake or thyroid-specific metabolic factors, may have contributed to this effect.

The results of the NutriNAIL study provide early evidence that fingernails can reliably reflect long-term mineral profiles. The measured values responded particularly clearly to dietary patterns, most notably selenium intake.

The ability to assess long-term trace element exposure using a noninvasive method enables a broad range of potential applications. These include nutritional medicine, care for individuals with thyroid disorders, assessment of chronic deficiencies, and the prevention of potentially toxic exposure associated with the use of dietary supplements.

From fast nerve signals to microbial metabolites, scientists are uncovering the biological conversations between the gut and brain that may explain chronic pain, weight gain, and neurodegenerative disease, and point to a new generation of treatments that work by targeting communication rather than symptoms alone.



Mechanisms of signaling between the gut and the brain. Information can be transmitted from the gut lumen to the brain in a variety of ways, but recent research has highlighted four distinct categories of signaling. (A) In hormonal signaling, hormones from the gut epithelium are either released into the bloodstream (endocrine) or locally (paracrine), where they act via receptors to exert an effect. Hormones act on receptors in the ENS and CNS (particularly the hypothalamus) to receive these signals. 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). (B) In neuropod-mediated signaling, EECs form close connections that rapidly transmit information from the gut lumen to the CNS. In more proximal regions of the gut (i.e., stomach, small intestine), signals are typically transmitted via the vagus nerve and convey nutritive information. Neuropod signaling in more distal regions (i.e., colon) conveys information related to visceral pain and stretch, which are received by the brain via the dorsal root ganglia. (C) Gut microbiota produce local effects in the gut lumen that affect epithelial permeability and allow transmission of the microbiota or associated metabolites into the bloodstream. Some of these changes induce an inflammatory response. Alternatively, microbes or metabolites (such as short-chain fatty acids) act locally on receptors to modify cell function. (D) The gastrointestinal immune system surveils the gut lumen with resident T cells and neutrophils that are activated by microbes and their metabolites and convey signals to the brain. Responses can be modified via inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract, leading to increased permeability and allowing further immune interactions. Concurrently, top-down mechanisms have been described, including glucocorticoid-dependent activation of ENS microglia leading to inflammation within the gut epithelium. 

In a recent review published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers synthesized evidence from roughly 200 cited studies to elucidate the past decade of research on the “gut–brain axis.” The review delineates four distinct mechanisms of communication between these formerly thought-to-be distinct systems: hormonal signaling, direct neural connections, microbiome interactions, and immune system pathways.

Review findings highlight how dysfunction in any of these communication pathways may contribute to disorders ranging from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) to Parkinson's disease (PD) and depression. Furthermore, it details how modern therapeutics leverage these pathways, demonstrating the clinical potential of targeting gut–brain communication.

For more than 2,000 years, human academics have hypothesized a physiological link between the digestive system and the mind, a concept famously attributed to Hippocrates, who posited that “all diseases begin in the gut,” and William Beaumont, who observed that emotional states could visibly alter gastric function.

Unfortunately, despite substantial advancements in medical science and research, the specific mechanisms underlying these observations remained unknown until recently. Technological advancements in neuroimmunology, alongside a surge in interest in the microbiome, have catalysed advances in elucidating these mechanisms, particularly over the past decade.

The pace of scientific discovery, the complexity of gut–brain interactions, and widespread public misinformation have necessitated integrative reviews of the literature, revealing how, among other findings, novel classes of drugs (such as weight-loss–associated GLP-1 receptor agonists) engage these communication pathways to produce physiologically beneficial outcomes.

The present review aims to address this need by synthesizing data from human and animal studies over the past 10 years to construct an updated mechanistic framework of gut–brain interaction, while also outlining key translational challenges.

The review included peer-reviewed publications across several interconnected research fields, including:

The review reveals a profound, bidirectional association between gut physiology and neurobiology, highlighting the importance of the microbiome and metabolome in maintaining proper brain function, while emphasizing substantial inter-individual variability and the limits of causal inference. Key takeaways include:

Hormonal signaling: The gut has been identified as the body's largest endocrine organ, secreting over 30 hormones, most of which exert physiological effects elsewhere. For example, while serotonin is a known neurotransmitter essential for brain health, research has found that over 90% of it is produced in the gut, where it primarily acts locally and does not cross the blood–brain barrier.

These studies have helped clarify mechanisms underlying obesity-related hormone dysregulation. While the hunger hormone ghrelin usually stimulates appetite, it is lower in individuals with obesity than in those with lower body mass indices (BMI), suggesting a state of hormonal resistance rather than hormonal excess.

Direct “neuropod” connections: Recent research has identified neuropod cells, specialized sensory epithelial cells that form direct synapse-like connections with the vagus nerve. These cells can distinguish between sugar (using the neurotransmitter glutamate) and artificial sweeteners (using ATP) in milliseconds, influencing food preferences and reward signaling at far faster timescales than classical endocrine pathways, although the anatomical generalizability of these connections remains under investigation.

The microbiome: The review details how specific microbial signatures correlate with neurological disease. In Parkinson's disease (PD), misfolded alpha-synuclein proteins have been hypothesized to originate in the gut and travel to the brain via the vagus nerve. Animal studies have shown that severing the vagus nerve (vagotomy) can prevent gut-to-brain propagation of PD-like pathology; however, the directionality and universality of this pathway remain controversial, with evidence also supporting possible brain-to-gut spread.

Immune mediation: The review cites evidence that stress increases intestinal permeability through corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling. In animal models, colonic inflammation has been shown to trigger immune cells, such as monocytes, to migrate to the brain, inducing anxiety-like behaviors, although the clinical implications of stress-related permeability are often overstated.

Encouragingly, the review also highlights modern clinical interventions such as linaclotide (for IBS) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (for obesity), which modulate gut–brain signaling pathways to reduce abdominal pain and promote weight loss, respectively, despite acting outside the primary symptomatic organ system.

The present review establishes the gut–brain axis not merely as an ancient hypothesis, but as a biologically grounded framework involving the multidirectional interplay of nerves, hormones, microbes, and immune cells. The findings suggest that neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease may, in some patients, be influenced by gastrointestinal processes, while digestive disorders such as IBS have demonstrable neural and central components.

While the review highlights ongoing challenges, particularly with reproducibility and patient-specific variability, continued research into psychobiotics and neurogastroenterological therapies may enable more targeted and effective treatments in the future.

New evidence suggests that trapping iron in unusable forms may starve vulnerable neurons, challenging decades of thinking about iron toxicity in Parkinson's disease and opening new therapeutic questions.



Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra is visible by MRI techniques in patients with PD. This iron may be in a trapped form, making it unavailable for the iron-dependent biological processes that are critical in dopaminergic cells, including mitochondrial respiration and dopamine synthesis. 

In a recent perspective published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers discussed evidence that challenges a long-standing scientific belief that Parkinson's disease is commonly hypothesised to be driven by toxic iron overload in the brain. They argued instead that the disease could involve a functional iron deficiency, in which biologically usable iron is low despite high total iron and may coexist with regionally elevated iron signals. Restoring iron availability, rather than removing iron, could represent a possible avenue of treatment.

For decades, abnormal iron accumulation has been linked to Parkinson's disease, particularly in the substantia nigra, the brain region most affected in those with the condition. This association led to the dominant hypothesis that excess iron drives neurodegeneration through oxidative stress and iron-dependent cell death pathways such as ferroptosis, although the causal role of ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease remains debated.

Recent clinical trials suggest that chelating iron with the brain-penetrant agent deferiprone can worsen symptoms, especially in patients who have not yet initiated dopaminergic therapy. These unexpected findings have forced a reconsideration of the role of iron in Parkinson's and opened the door to an alternative explanation, functional iron deficiency. In such cases, total iron levels are normal or perhaps elevated, even as bioavailable ferrous iron (Fe2+), which is essential for cellular processes, is insufficient.

The modern treatment of Parkinson's disease began with the discovery that levodopa (L-DOPA) could restore motor function by compensating for dopamine loss in the basal ganglia. This strategy was subsequently supported by evidence showing reduced activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an iron-dependent enzyme responsible for initiating dopamine synthesis. Early biochemical studies demonstrated that iron strongly stimulates TH activity.

These insights prompted early clinical experiments with iron supplementation. Reports published during the 1980s described substantial symptom improvement in Parkinson's patients receiving iron therapy. Some were able to reduce or discontinue dopaminergic medications. Although these studies lacked modern trial design, they raised the possibility that iron deficiency, rather than excess, could limit dopamine production in those with the disease.

Despite early hints that iron might be beneficial, there was a marked shift toward an iron overload hypothesis as imaging and histological studies revealed increased iron signals in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease. These findings, combined with growing interest in oxidative stress and ferroptosis, strengthened the belief that excess iron was toxic and should be removed.

However, the lack of benefit and potential harm observed in iron chelation trials directly challenge this model. If iron overload were truly driving Parkinson's, removing iron should have improved outcomes. Instead, worsening symptoms suggest that iron removal may deprive already vulnerable neurons of the iron they need for survival and function, particularly at earlier disease stages.

A key insight of this perspective is that not all iron is biologically equivalent. Ferric iron (Fe3+), which is relatively inert, is more readily detected by MRI and histological techniques because it is stored in dense forms such as ferritin and neuromelanin. In contrast, Fe2+ is the active form required for enzymatic reactions, dopamine synthesis, and mitochondrial respiration.

MRI cannot distinguish between Fe3+ and Fe2+, nor can it identify which cell types or subcellular compartments contain iron. As a result, increased MRI iron signals may reflect sequestration of unusable Fe3+ rather than a surplus of functional iron. Similar patterns occur during chronic inflammation, where iron is sequestered into storage forms, leading to cellular iron starvation despite elevated tissue iron levels.

Additional mechanisms may worsen this problem in Parkinson's disease, including lysosomal dysfunction that prevents iron release into the cytoplasm and sequestration of iron within glial cells rather than dopaminergic neurons. Together, these processes could create the illusion of iron overload while neurons themselves experience iron deprivation.

Several lines of evidence strengthen the functional iron deficiency hypothesis. Disorders such as manganism resemble Parkinson's disease and disrupt iron handling, reducing the activity of iron-dependent enzymes like TH and mitochondrial aconitase. Similarly, genetic conditions grouped under NBIA exhibit iron buildup, impaired iron utilization, and dopaminergic dysfunction.

Experimental studies provide more direct support. Deleting the transferrin receptor in mouse dopaminergic neurons causes iron deficiency, neuron loss, and Parkinson-like motor symptoms. Epidemiological data also link anemia and recent blood donation to increased Parkinson's risk, although these associations are observational and cannot establish causality.

Taken together, the evidence challenges the idea that iron overload is a primary driver of Parkinson's disease. Instead, many findings are better explained by a model of functional iron deficiency, where iron is present but biologically inaccessible. This framework explains why iron chelation can worsen symptoms and why restoring iron bioavailability, rather than indiscriminately removing iron, may warrant further investigation, while accounting for disease stage and prior dopaminergic treatment.

Nurses in critical care units who perceive higher levels of teamwork with their colleagues are more likely to take breaks during their shifts, according to new research from The Center for Health Design published in American Journal of Critical Care (AJCC).

""Unit Layout and Critical Care Nurses' Perceptions of Visibility, Teamwork, and Taking Breaks"" examined how the physical design of a critical care unit influences the nursing culture, finding that units that foster connection and collaboration may encourage break-taking behaviors. For the study, a diverse sample of critical care nurses completed an online survey, with a total of 96 completed surveys.

The Center for Health Design is a nonprofit professional organization with members throughout the spectrum of the healthcare design industry that aim to advance the use of an evidence-based design process to improve health, safety and business outcomes. The study was conducted by Yolanda Keys, PhD, DHA, RN, NEA-BC, EDAC, research associate, and Ellen Taylor, PhD, AIA, MBA, EDAC, vice president for research. Keys discussed takeaways from the study in a video interview that accompanies the journal article.

The layout of critical care units has evolved significantly, and many newly designed units have decentralized workstations with individual alcoves between patient rooms. The potential unintended consequences of these unit layouts include increased feelings of isolation and fewer opportunities for collaboration. We will continue to study how the built environment contributes to unit culture and patient outcomes.""

Yolanda Keys, PhD, DHA, RN, NEA-BC, EDAC, research associate

Prior research has found that leadership support, adequate staffing and intentionally designed break areas are essential to encourage nurses to take restorative breaks, mitigate burnout, retain a viable nursing workforce, encourage health-promoting behaviors, and foster resilience.

Taking breaks during a shift is associated with lower rates of burnout, but breaks are often skipped, interrupted or compromised by workload factors. Of the nurses who responded to the survey, less than half (43%) were very likely or extremely likely to take a 30-minute meal break during a 12-hour shift, and 50% indicated they were not likely at all to take any nonmeal breaks.

For the study, participants first selected which of 13 simple-to-interpret unit layouts most closely represented their own. The layouts were variations of three broad categories of unit types: racetracks with a closed middle section, racetracks with open centers where staff members are able to see across the entire unit, or variations of pod layouts.

They then completed an online survey that included the Nursing Teamwork Survey and demographic questions, plus a researcher-developed scale asking about their ability to see patients from both a central location and in a patient room.

In open-ended questions, approximately 80% of respondents also elaborated on physical barriers that prevented them from seeing co-workers or patients. The most frequently cited barriers to visibility included built environment obstructions, such as walls, columns and doors. Curtains, either on doors or inside rooms, were the second most mentioned barrier. Other barriers mentioned were long hallways and caregiving equipment.

The team received an Impact Research Grant from the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN) to support the study.

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer, affecting more people each year as detection rates continue to rise. During tumor excision, surgeons often struggle to determine exactly how much tissue should be removed, as distinguishing cancer from healthy tissue in real time is challenging and nearby structures are extremely delicate. Today, diagnosis and margin assessment rely on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and traditional pathology. While accurate, these methods are slow, sometimes inconclusive, and offer no real-time guidance in the operating room. As a result, patients may undergo unnecessary surgery for benign nodules or require additional procedures if cancerous tissue is missed.

Dynamic Optical Contrast Imaging (DOCI) offers a fundamentally different way to examine tissue. Rather than using dyes or contrast agents, DOCI illuminates tissue and measures its natural autofluorescence, the faint light emitted by molecules already present in cells. Healthy and cancerous tissue glow differently, creating optical signatures that can be captured and analyzed. Each DOCI scan collects information from 23 different optical channels across a wide field of view, producing a rich spectral fingerprint detailed map of tissue biology in freshly excised specimens.

In a multi-institutional study published in Biophotonics Discovery, researchers combined DOCI with machine learning to translate these complex optical signals into clinically meaningful insights. At Duke University, Tyler Vasse, working in the laboratory of Tuan Vo-Dinh, developed a two-stage AI analysis framework. Clinical deployment and application of the DOCI technology was carried out by Yazeed Alhiyari and team members of Maie St. John at the University of California, Los Angeles.

In the first stage, the researchers employed a simple, interpretable machine-learning model to assign each specimen to one of three categories: healthy thyroid tissue, follicular thyroid cancer, or papillary thyroid cancer, the latter two representing the most common differentiated thyroid malignancies. By distilling the 23 DOCI optical channels into a small set of key features, the system accurately classified samples across these categories, achieving perfect accuracy on an independent test set. Notably, the model also correctly identified samples from the highly aggressive anaplastic subtype as cancerous, demonstrating broad sensitivity to malignant tissues.

The second stage addressed a critical surgical question: where exactly is the tumor located? To answer this, the team employed deep-learning models based on a U-Net architecture, which is designed to identify and map specific regions within medical images. Using this approach, the models generated tumor probability maps that accurately highlighted cancerous regions, with particularly strong performance for papillary thyroid cancer, and very low false-positive rates in cancer-free tissue.

Although this work analyzed tissue immediately after removal, the results point toward a future in which surgeons could receive rapid, label-free guidance during operations. By merging the speed of optical imaging with the power of AI, DOCI has the potential to reduce uncertainty in the operating room, prevent unnecessary surgeries, spare healthy tissue, and improve outcomes for patients with thyroid cancer, allowing surgeons to see cancer in-quite literally-a new light.

Detecting cancer in the earliest stages could dramatically reduce cancer deaths because cancers are usually easier to treat when caught early. To help achieve that goal, MIT and Microsoft researchers are using artificial intelligence to design molecular sensors for early detection.

The researchers developed an AI model to design peptides (short proteins) that are targeted by enzymes called proteases, which are overactive in cancer cells. Nanoparticles coated with these peptides can act as sensors that give off a signal if cancer-linked proteases are present anywhere in the body.

Depending on which proteases are detected, doctors would be able to diagnose the particular type of cancer that is present. These signals could be detected using a simple urine test that could even be done at home.

We're focused on ultra-sensitive detection in diseases like the early stages of cancer, when the tumor burden is small, or early on in recurrence after surgery."" 

Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, and member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES)

Bhatia and Ava Amini '16, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research and a former graduate student in Bhatia's lab, are the senior authors of the study, which appears today in Nature Communications. Carmen Martin-Alonso PhD '23, a founding scientist at Amplifyer Bio, and Sarah Alamdari, a senior applied scientist at Microsoft Research, are the paper's lead authors.

More than a decade ago, Bhatia's lab came up with the idea of using protease activity as a marker of early cancer. The human genome encodes about 600 proteases, which are enzymes that can cut through other proteins, including structural proteins such as collagen. They are often overactive in cancer cells, as they help the cells escape their original locations by cutting through proteins of the extracellular matrix, which normally holds cells in place.

The researchers' idea was to coat nanoparticles with peptides that can be cleaved by a specific protease. These particles could then be ingested or inhaled. As they traveled through the body, if they encountered any cancer-linked proteases, the peptides on the particles would be cleaved.

Those peptides would be secreted in the urine, where they could be detected using a paper strip similar to a pregnancy test strip. Measuring those signals would reveal the overactivity of proteases deep within the body.

""We have been advancing the idea that if you can make a sensor out of these proteases and multiplex them, then you could find signatures of where these proteases were active in diseases. And since the peptide cleavage is an enzymatic process, it can really amplify a signal,"" Bhatia says.

The researchers have used this approach to demonstrate diagnostic sensors for lung, ovarian, and colon cancers.

However, in those studies, the researchers used a trial-and-error process to identify peptides that would be cleaved by certain proteases. In most cases, the peptides they identified could be cleaved by more than one protease, which meant that the signals that were read could not be attributed to a specific enzyme.

Nonetheless, using ""multiplexed"" arrays of many different peptides yielded distinctive sensor signatures that were diagnostic in animal models of many different types of cancer, even if the precise identity of the proteases responsible for the cleavage remained unknown.

In their new study, the researchers moved beyond the traditional trial-and-error process by developing a novel AI system, named CleaveNet, to design peptide sequences that could be cleaved efficiently and specifically by target proteases of interest.

Users can prompt CleaveNet with design criteria, and CleaveNet will generate candidate peptides likely to fit those criteria. In this way, CleaveNet enables users to tune the efficiency and specificity of peptides generated by the model, opening a path to improving the sensors' diagnostic power.

""If we know that a particular protease is really key to a certain cancer, and we can optimize the sensor to be highly sensitive and specific to that protease, then that gives us a great diagnostic signal,"" Amini says. ""We can leverage the power of computation to try to specifically optimize for these efficiency and selectivity metrics.""

For a peptide that contains 10 amino acids, there are about 10 trillion possible combinations. Using AI to search that immense space allows for prediction, testing, and identification of useful sequences much faster than humans would be able to find them, while also considerably reducing experimental costs.

To create CleaveNet, the researchers developed a protein language model to predict the amino acid sequences of peptides, analogous to how large language models can predict sequences of text. For the training data, they used publicly available data on about 20,000 peptides and their interactions with different proteases from a family known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

Using these data, the researchers trained one model to generate peptide sequences that are predicted to be cleaved by proteases. These sequences could then be fed into another model that predicted how efficiently each peptide would be cleaved by any protease of interest.

To demonstrate this approach, the researchers focused on a protease called MMP13, which cancer cells use to cut through collagen and help them metastasize from their original locations. Prompting CleaveNet with MMP13 as a target allowed the models to design peptides that could be cut by MMP13 with considerable selectivity and efficiency. This cleavage profile is particularly useful for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

""When we set the model up to generate sequences that would be efficient and selective for MMP13, it actually came up with peptides that had never been observed in training, and yet these novel sequences did turn out to be both efficient and selective,"" Martin-Alonso says. ""That was very exciting to see.""

This kind of selectivity could help to reduce the number of different peptides needed to diagnose a given type of cancer, to identify novel biomarkers, and to provide insight into specific biological pathways for study and therapeutic testing, the researchers say.

Bhatia's lab is currently part of an ARPA-H funded project to create reporters for an at-home diagnostic kit that could potentially detect and distinguish between 30 different types of cancer, in early stages of disease, based on measurements of protease activity. These sensors could include detection of not only MMP-mediated cleavage, but other enzymes such as serine proteases and cysteine proteases.

Peptides designed using CleaveNet could also be incorporated into cancer therapeutics such as antibody treatments. Using a specific peptide to attach a therapeutic such as a cytokine or small molecule drug to a targeting antibody could enable the medicine to be released only when the peptides are exposed to proteases in the tumor environment, improving efficacy and reducing side effects.

Beyond direct applications in diagnostics and therapeutics, combining efforts from the ARPA-H work with this modeling framework could enable the creation of a comprehensive ""protease activity atlas"" that spans multiple protease classes and cancers. Such a resource could further accelerate research in early cancer detection, protease biology, and AI models for peptide design.

A Belgian study reveals why donors choose science over tradition and how family conversations can turn loss into a lasting contribution to medical education and public health.

Study: Beyond the gift: donor motivations and family experiences as drivers of body donation programs. Image credit: PeopleImages/Shutterstock.com

Researchers at the University of Liège, Belgium, conducted an exploratory study to identify psychological, social, and cultural factors that can potentially influence an individual's motivations and decisions for body donation. The study, published in Frontiers in Public Health, was conducted within a single Belgian university body donation program.

Body donation to science is a generous and self-sacrificing act for the greater benefit of mankind, wherein an individual donates their body to educational institutions after death to facilitate the training process of healthcare professionals and the advancement of biomedical research. With the increasing number of medical students and biomedical faculties, demand for human cadavers is simultaneously rising worldwide.

Various motivations can influence an individual's decision to donate their body, including generosity, a desire to contribute to medical advancements, a desire to create a meaningful and long-lasting impact on society, and avoiding burial costs or traditional funeral practices.

The motivations of donors and the expectations of their families are the key factors that shape the success of body donation initiatives. However, these factors largely remain unexplored in the literature.

Experiences of the donor's family members are particularly vital in this context, as family support amplifies the donor's motivation. However, family members may often experience a state of “double loss”, encompassing the death of their loved one as well as the temporary absence of the body during its use in training and research.

It is thus essential to integrate their experiences into body donation programs to support broader public health goals of transparency, equity, and social legitimacy. Clear communication between donors and family members, education and awareness, and trust in healthcare professionals are vital for family consent.

In the current study, researchers from the University of Liège explored the motivations of body donors and the experiences of their family members, interpreting the findings through integrative behavioral frameworks to inform institutional and public health practices.

The study included a total of 104 registered donors and a smaller exploratory group of 10 family members of deceased donors. The analysis of self-reported questionnaires from the donors revealed that scientific utility was the leading motivation. Other prominent motivations were the desire for symbolic survival after death, the desire to support medical research, and expressing gratitude for medical care.

About 96 % of donors reported informing their family members about body donation. In most cases, family members' reactions were favorable, followed by astonishment and a mix of sadness and other emotions. In general, the families expressed a sense of “double loss” at the time of death and at the time of restitution.

The study identified word of mouth as the leading source of information about body donation. Other sources included traditional and digital media, as well as healthcare and teaching personnel.

Approximately 88 % of donors reported that family members did not influence their decisions. About 11 % of donors who reported some family influence cited respect for autonomy and a family tradition of donation as the primary explanations.

The study identifies key donor motivations and family experiences that are vital for strengthening trust, enhancing engagement, and ensuring the sustainability of donation programs.

The desire to contribute to science and education is the predominant motivation for body donation, according to the study findings. Other major motivations were symbolic meaning, altruism, and gratitude. Interestingly, the study did not find practical considerations, such as reducing funeral costs, as a major motivation among donors.

These observations suggest that the motivation for body donation has a multidimensional origin, combining scientific contribution with personal and existential values. By highlighting the relative hierarchy of key drivers, the study reveals that, unlike organ donation, which is mainly associated with altruism and duty, whole-body donation appears to be a more reflexive and meaning-driven act, relating to educational and symbolic significance.

The majority of donors reported making their own decision about body donation and mentioned minimal family influence. However, they reported discussing their choice with family members, whose reactions varied by the donor's occupational category. Employees or civil servants expressed support more frequently, while workers or technicians reported sadness more often.

These findings indicate that although motivation for body donation is primarily personal, family dialogue plays a key role in legitimizing the choice and facilitating grief. In other words, the study supports the idea that body donation is both a profoundly individual decision and a relational act negotiated within family and cultural networks.

The feeling of “double loss” experienced by many family members at the time of death and later at the restitution of remains indicates that disrupted rituals and delayed closure can complicate mourning.

However, some family members reported that the donation decision helped them transform loss into a meaningful contribution to society. This finding further highlights the importance of tailored family support. The authors note that the family-related findings are exploratory, as they are based on a small sample, and should be interpreted with caution.

Overall, the study highlights the need to integrate body donation into educational and public health agendas to promote and sustain the growth of donation programs worldwide.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Forever chemicals linked to higher liver disease risk in adolescents","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260106/Forever-chemicals-linked-to-higher-liver-disease-risk-in-adolescents.aspx","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:55:00 GMT","

A new study co-led by the Southern California Superfund Research and Training Program for PFAS Assessment, Remediation and Prevention (ShARP) Center and the University of Hawai'i has linked certain common ""forever chemicals"" to a higher risk of liver disease in adolescents. These synthetic compounds, known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), may as much as triple the chances that adolescents develop a liver condition called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) - formerly known as fatty liver disease. 

The findings were published in the journal Environmental Research.

MASLD affects about 10% of children and up to 40% of children with obesity. It is a chronic condition that doesn't always have telltale symptoms, although some patients experience fatigue, discomfort and abdominal pain. The disease increases long-term risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, advanced liver injury, cirrhosis and even liver cancer. 

""MASLD can progress silently for years before causing serious health problems,"" said Lida Chatzi, MD, PhD, a professor of population and public health sciences and pediatrics and the director of the ShARP Center, a national center funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to investigate PFAS health impacts, advance cleanup technologies and support affected communities. ""When liver fat starts accumulating in adolescence, it may set the stage for a lifetime of metabolic and liver health challenges. If we reduce PFAS exposure early, we may help prevent liver disease later. That's a powerful public-health opportunity.""

PFAS are manufactured chemicals used in nonstick cookware, stain- and water-repellent fabrics, food packaging and some cleaning products. They persist in the environment and accumulate in the body over time. More than 99% of people in the U.S. have measurable PFAS in their blood, and at least one PFAS is present in roughly half of U.S. drinking water supplies.

Adolescents are particularly more vulnerable to the health effects of PFAS as it is a critical period of development and growth. In addition to liver disease, PFAS exposure has been associated with a range of adverse health outcomes, including several types of cancer.""

Shiwen ""Sherlock"" Li, PhD, study's first and corresponding author, assistant professor of public health sciences, University of Hawai'i

The research examined 284 Southern California adolescents and young adults from two USC longitudinal studies. The participants were already at higher metabolic risk because their parents had type 2 diabetes or were overweight. PFAS levels were measured through blood tests, and liver fat was assessed using MRI.

Higher blood levels of two common PFAS - perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) - were linked to a greater likelihood of MASLD. Adolescents with twice as much PFOA in their blood were nearly three times more likely to have MASLD. The risk was even higher for those with a genetic variant (PNPLA3 GG) known to influence liver fat. In young adults, smoking further amplified PFAS-related liver impacts.

""These findings suggest that PFAS exposures, genetics and lifestyle factors work together to influence who has greater risk of developing MASLD as a function of your life stage,"" said Max Aung, PhD, MPH, assistant professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine. ""Understanding gene and environment interactions can help advance precision environmental health for MASLD.""

Li noted that this study is the first to examine PFAS and MASLD in children using gold-standard diagnostic criteria, and the first to explore how genetic and lifestyle factors may interact with PFAS exposure. MASLD also became more common as adolescents grew older, adding to evidence that puberty and early adulthood may increase susceptibility to environmental exposures.

The study builds on recent USC research showing that, for adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery to manage obesity, a PFAS known as PFHpA is linked to more severe liver disease, including inflammation and scarring of connective tissue called fibrosis. 

""Taken together, the two studies show that PFAS exposures not only disrupt liver biology but also translate into real liver disease risk in youth,"" Chatzi said. ""Adolescence seems to be a critical window of susceptibility, suggesting PFAS exposure may matter most when the liver is still developing.""

Just outside Salt Lake City sits an old, two-story, brick hotel. It's been given new life as a homeless shelter for seniors. The Medically Vulnerable People shelter — or MVP shelter, as it's known — is for people 62 and older or for younger adults with chronic health issues.

Residents share rooms designed to be accessible to those with mobility issues. There are also private bathrooms, which are a big deal for seniors struggling with incontinence.

Unlike the MVP, most homeless shelters aren't equipped to help seniors, especially those 65 and older. They are the fastest-growing homeless population nationwide, according to Dennis Culhane, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. Not only are people who struggle with chronic homelessness aging, but many seniors are becoming homeless for the first time in their lives.

Getting in and out of bunks, managing medications, and making it to a shared bathroom in time are among the major challenges of shelter life for older adults. Staff at traditional shelters sometimes ask seniors to leave if they're unable to care for themselves.

The MVP is unusual among shelters because it provides on-site medical care to better serve its residents as they age.

Last spring, Jamie Mangum, who is in her 50s and has lung cancer, tripped and fell in her room. To visit with an emergency medical technician, she needed only to make it downstairs. Her swollen wrist was quickly wrapped, and she returned to her room. She said that wouldn't have been possible at other shelters she's stayed in.

""There, I'd have to wait hours as opposed to come in here, be seen,"" Mangum said.

Mangum said that in other shelters she'd likely have had to find her own way to an urgent care office or get an ambulance ride. Specialized case managers at the MVP have helped her get treatment for lung cancer as well.

""We have clients that need memory care. Maybe they were living independently before, but they were unable to maintain that and got evicted due to dementia or different things like that,"" said Baleigh Dellos, who manages the MVP shelter for The Road Home, a local nonprofit.

Specialized medical case managers work at the shelter. Primary care doctors and therapists visit weekly. Residents can even receive physical therapy in private spaces on-site.

The MVP partnered with the Fourth Street Clinic to offer medical care.

The first thing most new residents need help with is medication, said Matt Haroldsen with the Fourth Street Clinic, which provides health services at the shelter.

For people living on the streets, just keeping hold of regular medications is a challenge. “Their medications get jacked when they're in their camps,” he said.

Diabetes patients without homes often bury their insulin to keep it cold. Haroldsen said they might forget where they buried it, or the vials might get too warm and spoil.

Helping residents at the shelter get those medications can stabilize their conditions, allowing them to focus on other priorities, such as getting an ID and other documents they need to apply for disability, Social Security, and various programs that can help them secure housing.

Nonprofits and local governments have opened similar shelters in Florida, California, and Arizona to meet the needs of older unhoused adults.

Having access to specialized shelters can be the difference between life and death, said Caitlin Synovec, assistant director of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council.

In cold-weather states, denying seniors a bed because of mobility and other health issues can be especially risky. In 2022, a Bozeman, Montana, senior froze to death after he was asked to leave a shelter because of incontinence.

Complex medical needs can pose a danger to other residents that most shelters aren't prepared to manage.

""A typical shelter doesn't allow somebody on oxygen to come in because that's such a fire hazard and risk,"" she said.

Synovec said giving seniors better access to health care inside shelters is the best way to help them succeed once they get housing. Health issues are a common reason seniors can't afford or maintain housing, she said.

The MVP model is showing promise, both in Utah and elsewhere.

""Over 80% of the people who've stayed in our program this past year have moved into stable or permanent housing,"" said Jacob Torner, vice president of programs for the TaskForce for Ending Homelessness in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The nonprofit runs a shelter called Elder Haven.

The MVP shelter near Salt Lake City is also marking success. It was able to permanently house 36 seniors as of late last year.

Still, there are more seniors in need of shelter than it can accommodate. Dellos, the shelter's manager, said the MVP's waitlist hovers around 200 people. She said the shelter prioritizes people based on medical need, not time spent on the waitlist.

For residents who do get a room, it's life-changing.

Last spring, 62-year-old Jeff Gregg was playing fetch with his dog, Ruffy, just beyond the lawn in front of the MVP.

An old back injury forced Gregg to hunch over as he threw the ball. It also fueled a decades-long addiction to opioids. That cycle was hard to escape, he said.

""Fighting that, having a job, insurance, then losing the job, not having insurance, going out to the streets and being back in that crap, and I'd be back in the same position,"" he said.

Gregg said sobriety took a back seat to more immediate needs like finding food and a bed in a shelter. He said the MVP was the first place where he could relax and focus on recovery.

""I was able to get clean. It took me a couple months, but I just kept plucking away,"" he said.

He said the experience paved the way for him to get back surgery. He hopes that with less back pain, he can eventually get a job to help him afford an apartment.

New research from the University of East Anglia (UK) reveals the hidden struggles experienced by the brothers and sisters of people with Prader-Willi syndrome.

Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes growth and learning challenges and requires lifelong care to prevent serious health issues. It is known for causing constant hunger, which can lead to over-eating and obesity.

But until now, little has been known about how the condition impacts families.

A new study published today reveals the emotional challenges faced by siblings – including feelings of stress, loneliness and sadness.

Prader–Willi syndrome is a rare neurogenetic condition that causes constant hunger, complex behaviour and health challenges.

We found that having a brother or sister with Prader-Willi syndrome can be hard.

Many siblings feel stressed, lonely, and sometimes take on extra responsibilities at home. Family life often revolves around managing the condition, which can make things complicated.

While some siblings develop resilience, most need more and better support.""

Dr. Meghana Wadnerkar Kamble, lead researcher, UEA's School of Health Sciences

The team reviewed two decades of research on siblings of people with Prader-Willi syndrome. Out of thousands of articles published between 2000 and 2024, only seven addressed siblings' experiences.

""We summarised findings from these studies and analysed what they said about emotions, family relationships, and coping strategies,"" said Dr Wadnerkar Kamble. ""This gave us an insight into what life is like for these siblings.

""We found that siblings were experiencing emotional fatigue because of the unpredictability of their brother or sister with Prader-Willi syndrome. It meant they always had to be prepared for unexpected situations.

""In many cases siblings were thrown into the role of being a caregiver.

""They also shared feelings of despair and loneliness and worried about upsetting their parents by making demands on their time.

""Family relationships were often strained and emotionally charged, with frequent arguments and disrupted routines. Siblings often felt unable to communicate openly with their parents. And everyday activities like parties and eating out were impossible.

""On a more positive note, some siblings developed resilience in the face of adversity,"" she added.

Siblings often tried to manage their brother or sister's behaviour and hunger by keeping them busy with activities like puzzles and jigsaws. The study also found that short breaks - when the child with Prader-Willi syndrome was away from home - gave other siblings valuable relief and helped them cope better.

The researchers say that a sibling's experience depends heavily on the wider family environment. Because of this, they recommend a family-centred approach in both research and support services. The findings echo further research from the same team, underscoring the need for a lifelong approach and personalised support for siblings as their needs evolve over time.

Dr Wadnerkar Kamble said: ""Siblings play a huge role in family life and sometimes even help care for their brother or sister. In the context of disability in the family, there is very little support for siblings. Our research shows why listening to siblings and creating family-focused support is essential for wellbeing in rare conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome.

""Future research should include more detailed interviews and gather perspectives from the whole family, including the person with Prader-Willi syndrome,"" she added.

This research was led by the University of East Anglia in collaboration with the Prada-Willi Syndrome Association UK, who funded the study.

'Experiences and support needs of siblings of individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome: An integrative systematic review' is published in the Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities (JARID).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","The CDC just sidelined these childhood vaccines. Here's what they prevent.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260106/The-CDC-just-sidelined-these-childhood-vaccines-Heree28099s-what-they-prevent.aspx","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:39:00 GMT","

The federal government has drastically scaled back the number of recommended childhood immunizations, sidelining six routine vaccines that have safeguarded millions from serious diseases, long-term disability, and death.

Just three of the six immunizations the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it will no longer routinely recommend — against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and rotavirus — have prevented nearly 2 million hospitalizations and more than 90,000 deaths in the past 30 years, according to the CDC's own publications.

Vaccines against the three diseases, as well as those against respiratory syncytial virus, meningococcal disease, flu, and covid, are now recommended only for children at high risk of serious illness or after ""shared clinical decision-making,"" or consultation between doctors and parents.

The CDC maintained its recommendations for 11 childhood vaccines: measles, mumps, and rubella; whooping cough, tetanus, and diphtheria; the bacterial disease known as Hib; pneumonia; polio; chickenpox; and human papillomavirus, or HPV.

Federal and private insurance will still cover vaccines for the diseases the CDC no longer recommends universally, according to a Department of Health and Human Services fact sheet; parents who want to vaccinate their children against those diseases will not have to pay out-of-pocket.

Experts on childhood disease were baffled by the change in guidance. HHS said the changes followed ""a scientific review of the underlying science"" and were in line with vaccination programs in other developed nations.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, pointed to Denmark as a model. But the schedules of most European countries are closer to the U.S. standard upended by the new guidance.

For example, Denmark, which does not vaccinate against rotavirus, registers around 1,200 infant and toddler rotavirus hospitalizations a year. That rate, in a country of 6 million, is about the same as it was in the United States before vaccination.

""They're OK with having 1,200 or 1,300 hospitalized kids, which is the tip of the iceberg in terms of childhood suffering,"" said Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a co-inventor of a licensed rotavirus vaccine. ""We weren't. They should be trying to emulate us, not the other way around.""

Public health officials say the new guidance puts the onus on parents to research and understand each childhood vaccine and why it is important.

Here's a rundown of the diseases the sidelined vaccines prevent:

RSV. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants in the U.S.

The respiratory virus usually spreads in fall and winter and produces cold-like symptoms, though it can be deadly for young children, causing tens of thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths a year. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, roughly 80% of children younger than 2 who are hospitalized with RSV have no identifiable risk factors. Long-awaited vaccines against the disease were introduced in 2023.

Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccination, which was phased in beginning in the late 1990s and recommended for all toddlers starting in 2006, has led to a more than 90% drop in the disease since 1996. The foodborne virus, which causes a wretched illness, continues to plague adults, particularly people who are homeless or who abuse drugs or alcohol, with a total of 1,648 cases and 85 deaths reported in 2023.

Hepatitis B. The disease causes liver cancer, cirrhosis, and other serious illnesses and is particularly dangerous when contracted by babies and young children. The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and can survive on surfaces for a week. From 1990 to 2019, vaccination resulted in a 99% decline in reported cases of acute hepatitis B among children and teens. Liver cancer among American children has also plummeted as a result of universal childhood vaccination. But the hepatitis B virus is still around, with 2,000-3,000 acute cases reported annually among unvaccinated adults. More than 17,000 chronic hepatitis B diagnoses were reported in 2023. The CDC estimates about half of people infected don't know they have it.

Rotavirus Before routine administration of the current rotavirus vaccines began in 2006, about 70,000 young children were hospitalized and 50 died every year from the virus. It was known as ""winter vomiting syndrome,"" said Sean O'Leary, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado. ""It was a miserable disease that we hardly see anymore.""

The virus is still common on surfaces that babies touch, however, and ""if you lower immunization rates it will once again hospitalize children,"" Offit said.

Meningococcal vaccines. These have been required mainly for teenagers and college students, who are notably vulnerable to critical illness caused by the bacteria. About 600 to 1,000 cases of meningococcal disease are reported in the U.S. each year, but it kills more than 10% of those it sickens, and 1 in 5 survivors have permanent disabilities.

Flu and covid. The two respiratory viruses have each killed hundreds of children in recent years — though both tend to be much more severe in older adults. Flu is currently on the upswing in the United States, and last flu season the virus killed 289 children.

Under the changes, decisions about vaccinating children against influenza, covid, rotavirus, meningococcal disease, and hepatitis A and B will now rely on what officials call ""shared clinical decision-making,"" meaning families will have to consult with a health care provider to determine whether a vaccine is appropriate.

""It means a provider should have a conversation with the patient to lay out the risks and the benefits and make a decision for that individual person,"" said Lori Handy, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

In the past, the CDC used that term only in reference to narrow circumstances, like whether a person in a monogamous relationship needed the HPV vaccine, which prevents a sexually transmitted infection and certain cancers.

The CDC's new approach doesn't line up with the science because of the proven protective benefit the vaccines have for the vast majority of the population, Handy said.

In their report justifying the changes, HHS officials Tracy Beth Høeg and Martin Kulldorff said the U.S. vaccination system requires more safety research and more parental choice. Eroding trust in public health caused in part by an overly large vaccine schedule had led more parents to shun vaccination against major threats like measles, they said.

The vaccines on the schedule that the CDC has altered were backed up by extensive safety research when they were evaluated and approved by the FDA.

""They're held to a safety standard higher than any other medical intervention that we have,"" Handy said. ""The value of routine recommendations is that it really helps the public understand that this has been vetted upside down and backwards in every which way.""

Eric Ball, a pediatrician in Orange County, California, said the change in guidance will cause more confusion among parents who think it means a vaccine's safety is in question.

""It is critical for public health that recommendations for vaccines are very clear and concise,"" Ball said. ""Anything to muddy the water is just going to lead to more children getting sick.""

Ball said that instead of focusing on a child's individual health needs, he often has to spend limited clinic time reassuring parents that vaccines are safe. A ""shared clinical decision-making"" status for a vaccine has no relationship to safety concerns, but parents may think it does.

HHS' changes do not affect state vaccination laws and therefore should allow prudent medical practitioners to carry on as before, said Richard Hughes IV, an attorney and a George Washington University lecturer who is leading litigation against Kennedy over vaccine changes.

""You could expect that any pediatrician is going to follow sound evidence and recommend that their patients be vaccinated,"" he said. The law protects providers who follow professional care guidelines, he said, and ""RSV, meningococcal, and hepatitis remain serious health threats for children in this country.""

Cathepsin B belongs to a family of lysosomal cysteine proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) present inside the cell. This plays a crucial role in various processes, such as tissue repair and immune function.

When this enzyme becomes overactive, it contributes to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, causing joint damage and inflammation. That's why understanding the role of Cathepsin B becomes important for better treatments.

Researchers use different tools and enzymes to get deeper insight into how cathepsin B is involved in disease and test new therapies for this.

Go through this post to learn how Cathepsin B impacts arthritis and how it is used in research.

This is categorized as a cysteine protease (a molecule that cuts proteins apart). This enzyme is involved in several processes, such as:

To study its role, scientists create lab-made proteins such as the Ctsb recombinant protein, which is a similar copy of the original enzyme. This helps researchers understand its effect and develop new treatments and therapies.

Cartilage breakdown: Cathepsin B plays an essential role in breaking down cartilage (tissue that cushions our joints). These enzymes become overactive and accelerate the joints, leading to joint pain during rheumatoid arthritis. This damage causes a problem while moving the joints.

Involvement in inflammation: It activates specific molecules like pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are responsible for swelling and pain. It also leads to the breakdown of the extracellular matrix (a structure that holds the tissue). A high level of Cathepsin B worsens the arthritis and causes severe symptoms.

Therapeutic implication: Scientists use this in their research to get a deep insight and find a way to block to prevent further joint damage.

Finding a specific blocker: Cathepsin B performs many different tasks, like cell cleanup and healing. If the inhibitor is too broad, it can lead to side effects by stopping the good functions like tissue repair and normal cell functioning.

Difficult to target: It is important to understand how to stop the enzyme's harmful activity, such as joint damage, without disturbing its normal functions in different parts of the body. Researchers need to find a way to target the specific role of the enzyme that is linked to rheumatoid arthritis.

Cathepsin B plays an important role in the development of inflammation and arthritis, contributing to joint pain and damage. The use of the CTSB recombinant protein is essential for research, studying the enzyme behavior, and finding effective treatment.

Researchers are using recombinant proteins and different tools to target Cathepsin B and find more personalized treatments and advance arthritis therapies.

An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is significantly associated with increased risk of depressive disorder (DD) and may also correlate with suicide risk among individuals with DD, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the November issue of Harvard Review of Psychiatry, part of the Lippincott portfolio from Wolters Kluwer.

""Studies demonstrate altered immune responses in DD, including diminished lymphocyte reactivity and dysregulated neutrophil activity,"" explain Yongjun Chen, MD, of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Jinan, China, and colleagues. ""NLR, derived from a routine complete blood count, has emerged as a cost-effective and accessible peripheral biomarker of systemic inflammation."" Theirs is the first comprehensive meta-analysis to investigate both the predictive and prognostic implications of NLR in patients with DD.

Dr. Chen's group searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to September 4, 2024. Studies were eligible if they involved patients with primary or secondary depression (any subtype of DD) and reported original data on the association of DD with NLR with sufficient methodological detail.

The researchers included 37 studies, all published in English between 2015 and 2024, that collectively involved 88,019 participants. Three studies reported only categorical NLR data, 27 reported only continuous NLR data, and seven reported both. Twenty-seven studies derived from Asia, seven from Europe, and three from the Americas. Six were cohort studies and 31 had a case–control design. Participants ranged from 13 to 83 years old and sample sizes ranged from 32 to 34,324.

Using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, the research group assessed study quality in three domains: participant selection, comparability of study groups, and outcome ascertainment. In this system, the highest possible score is nine stars. All included studies scored seven or eight stars.

The researchers conducted separate analyses of categorical and continuous variables:

Categorical variables

Continuous variables

A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that no individual study had undue effect on the overall findings.

""These findings underscore the clinical relevance of systemic inflammation in DD pathophysiology,"" Dr. Chen's group concludes, ""and highlight NLR as a cost-effective, accessible tool to inform risk stratification and tailored treatment strategies in psychiatric care.""

Futbol W's Cristina Alexander and Ali Krieger, alongside Natalia Astrain, discuss Emily Fox as the highest-ranked USWNT player in ESPN FC Women's Rank. (1:53)

The U.S. Soccer Federation announced details of the 2026 SheBelieves Cup, with Argentina, Canada and Colombia joining the United States women's national team in the competition.

All three of the U.S.'s opponents are ranked 30th or higher, with Argentina at No. 30, Canada at No. 10, and Colombia at No. 20. The U.S. women are ranked second behind Spain.

Colombia was a finalist at the 2025 Copa América Feminina, having beaten Argentina in the semifinals via a penalty shootout following an epic 4-4 draw.

""These are three teams that will likely be in the World Cup in 2027 and of course we'll likely see Canada in World Cup qualifying at the end of the year, so when focusing on our continued preparations and growth as a team, the SheBelieves Cup is of great value,"" U.S. manager Emma Hayes said.

""Each team brings different strengths and will challenge us to find success in all parts of the field, which is exactly what we need as we continue our process to build toward the big events on the horizon.""

The SheBelieves Cup will feature doubleheaders at three different venues. Canada and Colombia will open the competition at Nashville's GEODIS Park on March 1, followed by a match between the USWNT and Argentina later that evening.

Three days later, Argentina and Colombia will square off followed by the U.S. and long-time rivals Canada at ScottsMiracle-Gro Field in Columbus, Ohio.

The final day of the competition will take place on March 7 at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey, with a match featuring Canada and Argentina followed by the USWNT taking on Colombia.

Over the previous 10 editions of the tournament, the U.S. has won seven times, though Japan took home the trophy in 2025.

In terms of the opponents in 2026, the U.S. has won all six previous matches against Argentina, the most recent being a 3-0 U.S. victory in Louisville, Ky., in Oct. of 2024. Against Canada, the USA holds a 54W-4L-9D all-time record, including a 3-0 win for the U.S. last July 2 in Washington, D.C.

The meeting against Colombia will mark the 15th time the two teams have met, the most recent being a 2-0 win in the first match of 2025 SheBelieves Cup. The USWNT is 12W-0L-2D all-time against Las Cafeteras.

The USWNT's match against Colombia will see U.S. legend Tobin Heath, who retired last July, honored in a pre-match ceremony.

The New Jersey native played 181 times for the USWNT from 2008-2021 and scored 36 goals while helping the U.S. win two World Cups and two Olympic gold medals. She will be inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame on May 1, 2026.

Colombia is making its second appearance in the SheBelieves Cup after finishing third in 2025.

The tournament will feature two teams from Concacaf and two teams from CONMEBOL.

The United States women's national team is gearing up to host its 11th annual SheBelieves Cup. This year, the four teams will be the U.S., Argentina, Canada and Colombia, marking two teams from Concacaf (North America) and two teams from CONMEBOL (South America).

The tournament will take place from March 1-7.  The tournament will begin in Nashville, Tennessee, at GEODIS Park, the home of Nashville SC of Major League Soccer. Then, on March 4, the four teams will feature at Scotts Miracle-Gro Field in Columbus, Ohio, which is the home of the Columbus Crew SC of MLS. Finally, the team will end the SheBelieves Cup at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey. That stadium is home to Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League and the New York Red Bulls of MLS.

“These are three teams that will likely be in the World Cup in 2027 and of course we'll likely see Canada in World Cup qualifying at the end of the year, so when focusing on our continued preparations and growth as a team, the SheBelieves Cup is of great value,” U.S. head coach Emma Hayes said. “Each team brings different strengths and will challenge us to find success in all parts of the field, which is exactly what we need as we continue our process to build toward the big events on the horizon.”

Canada leads the South American national teams in SheBelieves Cup appearances, as the 2026 tournament will be its fourth appearance. For Argentina and Colombia, this will be each nation's second appearance in the tournament.

The U.S. has faced Canada 67 times, Colombia 15 times and Argentina six times. The U.S. has never lost against Argentina or Colombia, but has drawn with Las Cafeteras. 

Ahead of the March 7 match featuring the U.S. and Colombia, U.S. Soccer will honor Tobin Heath, two-time FIFA World Cup winner and two-time Olympic gold medalist. Heath is also an inductee to the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

World Cup

Group D

For Mauricio Pochettino and the U.S. men's national team, the 2026 World Cup will be a step-by-step undertaking. “We need to be focused on the group stage,” Pochettino, the USMNT's head coach, said after December's World Cup draw. Sure, he noted, “if you are Argentina, and you are the best team, and the last winner of the World Cup, you can think a little bit [ahead]. But with USA? … Our first game is the final of the World Cup. And the second needs to be the final of the World Cup. And the third, too.”

So, he is not scouting potential knockout-round opponents. His players are not scoping out brackets and pathways. Not yet, at least.

Fans, though, have had a month to digest the USMNT's group, and now have five months to dream about possibilities.

U.S. supporters can, for example, fantasize about a round-of-16 matchup with Argentina in Atlanta. They are already unpacking dozens of different scenarios. And there is one scenario that is far more likely than many realize: a round-of-32 clash between the U.S. and a North American rival, Canada.

At first glance, there is only one straightforward scenario. If the U.S. finishes second in Group D, it would play the runner-up from Group G — which could be Egypt and Mohamed Salah; or Belgium, featuring a few of the same players who outlasted the U.S. in 2014; or New Zealand or Iran.

Iran, in many ways, would be the most intriguing opponent. The two teams have World Cup history. Their governments are also at odds. This was a politically spicy matchup at the 2022 World Cup, and would be even more so in 2026. The Trump administration has banned Iranian nationals from traveling to the U.S. (with limited exceptions, including for World Cup players), and did not issue visas to a few officials ahead of the World Cup draw, causing a stir. The U.S. also bombed Iranian nuclear sites this past June, and Trump has floated the possibility of another U.S. intervention amid unrest in the Persian country. A World Cup elimination game between the two nations, with Trump potentially in attendance, would be gripping.

The rest of the USMNT's possibilities are muddled by third-place permutations. In FIFA's new 48-team World Cup format, eight of 12 third-place finishers will progress to the round of 32. The old, neat and tidy system where the top two progress and every else goes home, is done. If the U.S. finishes third, it won't know its fate until all 12 groups have concluded. And if, on the other hand, it wins Group D, its matchup is with “3BEFIJ” — a third-place team from one of those five groups, which could be any of 20 teams.

All in all, the U.S. has 28 potential round-of-32 opponents, and speculating about them seems like a useless quest.

Dive a little deeper, though, and some of the opponents are much more likely than others. If the U.S. wins its group, there is a 66.5% chance that it would face the third-place team from Group B — whose headliner is Canada.

In Annex C of its official World Cup regulations, FIFA lists all 495 possible combinations of third-place qualifiers; and in each of the 495 scenarios, it assigns each third-place team to a specific matchup and slot on the bracket.

Each of the 495 scenarios, in theory, is equally likely. And in 329 of the 495, “1D” — the winner of Group D — gets “3B,” the third-place finisher from Group B.

Group B features Canada, Switzerland, Qatar and a to-be-determined European playoff team. If that team is Italy, as expected — the other playoff contenders are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Wales and Northern Ireland — Canada would be the third-best team in the group, per the Elo and FIFA rankings, and a scenario where it finished in that exact spot is hardly outlandish.

That's not to say a U.S. vs. Canada showdown is probable. Betting markets give the U.S. about a 35% chance to win its group — and, by extension, around a 23% chance to face the third-place team from Group B. If, say, there's a 30% chance of Canada finishing third in Group B, there's only a 7% chance of this matchup materializing.

But that's a pretty significant number amid a sea of 28 possible opponents. It's arguably the fourth most likely matchup for the U.S., after the aforementioned Egypt, Iran and Belgium.

Or perhaps Canada is fifth, behind another possible opponent who's more likely to appear than a quick glance would suggest: Germany.

The full list of probabilities for the Group D winner is as follows:

The game, no matter the opponent, would be at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

The other set of probabilities that concern the USMNT are those for Group D's third-place finisher. If that team is among the eight best third-place finishers, it could play:

If that team is the U.S., of course, it would be a disappointing outcome. The USMNT has finished top-two in its group at its last three World Cups (2010, 2014 and 2022). A third-place finish, though, would open up a wider range of possibilities.

Advertisement

Germany is favored to win Group E, with betting markets putting the odds around 65%. If the U.S. has roughly a 21% chance of finishing third in Group D, and therefore a 14% chance of advancing as a third-place team, it has around a 6% chance of meeting Germany in the round of 32 (and a 3% chance of meeting another Group E team).

The USMNT is already slated to play Germany in its final warmup friendly prior to the World Cup, on June 6 in Chicago. The U.S. is also set to play Belgium, another potential knockout opponent, in a March friendly in Atlanta.

Everything else is far less likely. Portugal, for example, is one of the 28 possibilities, but the probability of U.S.-Portugal in the round of 32 is less than 0.5%. (Ditto for Colombia.)

If you let your mind roam to the round of 16, though, the possibilities are nearly endless. Among the USMNT's potential opponents in that second knockout round are:

Argentina — The defending champs are actually among the most likely round-of-16 opponents for the USMNT. They're expected to romp through Group J. If they do, they'd get the runner-up from Group H (Spain, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia, Cape Verde), then the winner of that “2D vs. 2G” match, which could be the U.S. vs. Egypt or Iran. If U.S.-Argentina happens — at noon on July 7 in Atlanta — it would be the most high-profile match in American men's soccer history. (It would also be quite a steep step up for the U.S. after facing middle-of-the-pack foes throughout the group stage.)

Uruguay — Now take the above scenario, but imagine Uruguay upsets its towering South American neighbor in the round of 32. We'd get a rematch of the 2024 Copa América game that ousted the USMNT (and then-coach Gregg Berhalter) — and a rematch of the Americans' 5-1 spanking of Uruguay this past November.

Advertisement

Spain — Or, imagine that Uruguay upsets Spain in Group H. We'd then get a showdown of the two pre-tournament favorites, Spain and Argentina, in the round of 32. That would feel like a World Cup final for the ages, Lionel Messi vs. Lamine Yamal, etc. … and the winner would get the “2D vs. 2G” winner four days later.

In other scenarios, if the U.S. wins its group and beats a third-place team in the round of 32, its likely opponent would be the winner of Group G — that Belgium-Iran-Egypt-New Zealand foursome again.

If it finishes third, it would very likely (94.2%) go into a pod with the winners of Group E (Germany, etc.) and Group I (France, etc.). It would meet one of those two in the round of 32, then the other (or a third-place team) in the round of 16 if it managed a huge upset. That round-of-16 match would be on July 4 — the nation's 250th birthday — in Philadelphia — the nation's birthplace — and could smash records for soccer viewership in the States.

No single scenario, on its own, is likely — which is part of why the USMNT won't look this far ahead. But all of them, and the five months of anticipation ahead, are ripe for daydreaming.

by Dante Gonzalez January 06, 2026

The 2030 World Cup is already beginning to take shape, with host nations outlining logistical plans and infrastructure upgrades needed to accommodate the tournament's expanded demands. Within that context, one of the co-hosts, Morocco, is reportedly considering a strategy similar to the one previously adopted by the United States in the buildup to its own World Cup.

While the 2026 World Cup will be staged across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the 2030 edition will be co-hosted by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, with the opening matches taking place in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. As part of its preparation as a host nation, Morocco is now exploring the possibility of staging another major international competition ahead of 2030.

According to RMC Sport, Morocco is emerging as a strong candidate to host the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup. The outlet reported that “according to several converging sources, Morocco is one of the most credible candidates to host the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup,” raising expectations that the country could secure the tournament.

The rationale behind FIFA's interest in Morocco hosting the second edition of the expanded Club World Cup would be to use the competition as a large-scale test of the nation's infrastructure and organizational readiness. With several stadiums still under construction or undergoing renovations, a major tournament one year before the World Cup would serve as an ideal dress rehearsal.

Morocco is already hosting the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, which could then be followed by the Club World Cup in 2029 and culminate with the 2030 World Cup. This sequence closely mirrors the approach taken by the United States, which hosted the 2024 Copa América before staging the inaugural expanded Club World Cup, effectively preparing venues and operations for the 2026 World Cup.

One of Morocco's flagship projects ahead of 2030 is the Hassan II Stadium, currently under construction in the commune of El Mansouria in Benslimane Province, just east of Casablanca. Expected to become the home of the Moroccan national team, the venue is scheduled to open in 2028 and will have a capacity of 115,000, making it the largest soccer stadium in the world and the second-largest stadium overall, behind India's Narendra Modi Stadium.

Following the global attention generated by the first edition of the expanded Club World Cup, several countries, including Brazil, Qatar, and even the United States, have expressed interest in hosting the 2029 tournament. Reports suggest that Morocco's status as a World Cup host the following year could give it an advantage in the selection process.

However, FIFA has yet to make any official announcement regarding the host nation or nations for the 2029 Club World Cup, nor has it outlined a clear timeline for when a decision will be reached. For now, the matter remains unresolved and is expected to be addressed in the coming months or years as FIFA finalizes its long-term tournament planning.

Fifa has been working on ways to improve offside decisions for the World Cup

Fifa plans to create AI-enabled 3D avatars of every player at the 2026 World Cup to enhance the tournament's semi-automated offside technology.

This will mean creating a digital scan of all 1,248 players in the 26-man squads of the 48 teams.

Each player will enter a chamber to be scanned, a process that should take just one second and only needs to be done once during their pre-tournament photo shoot.

Fifa says the scan ""captures highly accurate body-part dimensions"" to make more accurate offside decisions.

It expects this to mean tournament officials will be able to ""track players reliably during fast or obstructed movements"" and says final decisions will be ""displayed more realistically and in a more engaging way"".

There was controversy in the Premier League earlier this season when a Newcastle goal against Manchester City was allowed to stand.

Ruben Dias appeared to be jumping in the semi-automated offside graphic. This did not match the television pictures of the game.

Fifa hopes that by taking accurate scans of each player it can improve how these decisions are shown to supporters.

The technology was tested in Fifa's Intercontinental Cup, with Flamengo and Pyramids FC players scanned ahead of their match in December.

Fifa announced last month it was testing new technology which can determine if the ball goes out of play before a goal is scored. It has also developed 'real-time 3D recreation' to make line-of-sight offside decisions.

Innovation means every player being digitally scanned

Infantino: Move will ensure more accurate decisions

Every player at this summer's World Cup will have their own physically accurate “AI avatar” that will be used in taking VAR decisions.

The innovation, which will involve every player being digitally scanned and leaves the possibility of size mattering in future offside calls, was part of a package of technological measures announced by Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino, as he made a keynote appearance at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas.

Infantino described the upcoming World Cup, with 104 matches due to played across the US, Canada and Mexico, as “the greatest show ever on planet Earth” and said the AI avatar would “ensure” that more accurate offside decisions would be made.

“AI-enabled 3D avatars will ensure precise player identification and tracking,” Infantino said, describing it as “a big advancement in semi-automated offside technology providing great images, faster decisions and a clear understanding by everyone”.

Semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) is an extension of the VAR protocols that automates key elements of the offside decision-making process for the video assistant referee. In the Premier League, SAOT involves 30 cameras identifying the position of the ball and tracking “up to 10,000” data points on a players' location but the graphical models used to reach a final decision do not match with a player's actual size.

By adding personalised avatars, Fifa believes that the precision and speed of decision making will be improved, with the avatars allowing “the system to track players reliably during fast or obstructed movements”.

The use of player-specific dimensions will personalise offside decisions as never before. Fans may be wondering whether the avatars will make the 6ft 5in Erling Haaland more likely to be caught offside than the 5ft 7in Lionel Messi.

According to Fifa, every player will be scanned before the World Cup to create a 3D model. It said each scan would take “approximately one second” and capture “highly accurate body-part dimensions”. These models would then be used by VAR in calculating offside decisions via SAOT, and Fifa intends that the models be incorporated into TV coverage so that decisions could be “displayed more realistically and in a more engaging way to fans at stadiums and to viewers around the world”.

Also announced as part of an expanded relationship between Fifa and its official technology partner, the Chinese company Lenovo, was a new data platform – Football AI Pro – that is to be made available to all nations at the World Cup and will “help level the playing field” between better- and less-well-resourced nations “in an increasingly data-driven sport”. There is also to be a World Cup edition of the Motorola Razr phone, a Lenovo brand.

Infantino said: “The Fifa World Cup in 2026 is going to be the greatest show ever on planet Earth. Seven million people will attend the 104 matches – 104 Super Bowls – dozens of millions of fans will travel to North America to feel the Fifa World Cup vibe, six billion people will watch it from home, and the world will stand still.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi would prefer to become a club owner rather than a coach when he quits as a player, the Argentina soccer star has said.

In October, he signed a three-year contract extension with Inter Miami to take him through the 2028 season.

""I don't see myself as a coach,"" the 38-year-old Messi told the Luzu TV streaming channel in an interview recorded in December that aired Tuesday. ""I like management, but if have to decide for one of the three, I would like to be an owner.

""I would like to have my own club, to be able to grow it, to start from the bottom and to be able to give the kids, the people, the opportunity to grow and make it an important club. If I had to choose, that's what would appeal to me most.""

Messi, who led Argentina to the World Cup title in Qatar in 2022, is already a part owner of Uruguay's fourth-division team Deportivo LSM, which is co-owned by Inter teammate Luis Suarez.

""Deportivo LS is a family dream that began in 2018. We have grown a lot with more than 3,000 members,"" club founder Suarez said last May in a video alongside Messi. ""I want to offer Uruguayan soccer, the place I love and where I grew up as a child, opportunities and tools for teenagers and children to grow.""

The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi also has a future minority ownership stake in Inter included in his contract.

Messi won the MLS Golden Boot this season after scoring 29 goals, five more than LAFC's Denis Bouanga and Nashville's Sam Surridge. He also had 19 assists, and his 48 total goal contributions was one shy of matching the league record set by Carlos Vela in 2019.

Messi also became the first player to win back-to-back MVP awards in MLS history.

The United States' attack on Venezuela has shifted focus on the 2026 World Cup hosts, writes Miguel Delaney, with Fifa left conflicted by its allegiance with Trump 

Removed from bookmarks

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

It was almost grimly predictable. When news broke that the United States military had attacked Venezuela on Saturday, there wasn't even a flicker of activity among the Fifa Council, according to senior sources. This is despite the primary host of their grand global event launching what is actually a rare act of aggression for a country staging the World Cup, with the president even talking in a concerning manner about a co-host. In the aftermath of the Venezuela attacks, Donald Trump spoke about how his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum, is “very frightened of the cartels” and that “something is going to have to be done with Mexico”.

The wonder is what Gianni Infantino thinks of this, if he thinks anything at all. It's pointless to say Fifa here, since everything the federation does at that kind of level is now intertwined with the president. As such, no one dares broach this to Infantino, despite the farce of Fifa presenting Trump with an inaugural peace prize a mere month ago. The immediate diminishment of that prize – even if the presentation video already did a good job – was not just predictable.

It was inevitable. Fifa were warned. Just three days before the award, Trump said that military strikes on Venezuela would “start very soon”. That ultimately made it seven countries that the Trump administration had launched strikes against in his first year back in office.

At the time, and in response to criticism of the highly politicised Maga-influenced video, Fifa's only real argument about any of this was that they feel like the single body that gets criticised for actually trying to promote peace.

Venezuela is now an obvious response. War is peace, indeed.

For all the jibes about Infantino's peace prize – given that we're talking about literal life and death – there is an even more serious point, 

That is the more philosophical and moral question of whether the tournament should even be hosted by a country that has recently launched an act of aggression.

Infantino will possibly be relieved he doesn't have to think of any of this due to the muted response from Western governments and the Democratic Party, to go with how the context of Nicolas Maduro's rule further clouds debate.

Whatever the actual answer, though, it is astounding that a transnational body, that has to be as attuned to geopolitics as Fifa, doesn't even have guidelines on this. It's all the more relevant when Infantino so willingly immerses them deeper into geopolitics.

Because, worse, even if they did have guidelines, the Fifa president's very proximity to Trump would make such a situation even more problematic.

It's often at this point in such discussions – as precisely happened with Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 – that a tit-for-tat moral relativism can evolve about what certain states have historically been responsible for. Infantino even indulged in it himself when insisting Europe should be apologising for 3,000 years of history in that infamous “I feel” address on the eve of the 2022 World Cup.

He evidently doesn't feel quite the same way today.

Against that, the very nature of geopolitics means states are always going to be involved in conflicts. While hosting separate World Cups, Russia, the US and the UK were engaged in a combined total of 18 conflicts – depending on your definition – at the time of their tournaments.

The first was actually England 1966, given that the United Kingdom was at that point immersed in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, the Dhofar Rebellion and the Aden Emergency. Benito Mussolini's Italy didn't invade Abyssinia until the year after their 1934 World Cup. The USA are currently involved in eight, which would surpass the most a host has previously been involved in (beating their own record of five while hosting the 1994 cup).

While academics and analysts would no doubt argue that some of these conflicts were still a direct consequence of previous invasions or historic acts of aggression, there is still a difference between present engagement and active aggression.

The United Nations definition of such an act – as articulated in the 1974 General Assembly Resolution 3314 – is “the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations”.

In other words, as the football human rights advocacy group FairSquare describe, an act “unprovoked, uninvited and not sanctioned by the UN Security Council”.

According to those terms, there is a much shorter list involving prospective World Cup hosts, which makes this story all the more distinctive. This is just the third such case. The others were: the US invasion of Panama in 1989, which has so many echoes of Venezuela, and came after the awarding of the 1994 World Cup; the initial Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, just over three years after the 2018 tournament had been awarded.

The latter did bring some calls from a small number of European politicians to strip Vladimir Putin's state of the tournament, but they inevitably went nowhere.

Modern realpolitik dictates it is absurd to think there will be anything even remotely similar to that now, and the Fifa-USA relationship already looks much more skewed than the vast majority of previous hosts – bar perhaps Qatar.

Groups like FairSquare nevertheless still believe there should be other lessons and pressure for Fifa.

“Aggression is the supreme international crime,” the body said in a statement to The Independent. “It's clear that Trump thinks he can rely on Infantino's support no matter what he does, and Infantino, for his part, probably has no concerns about hitching Fifa's wagon to Trump so long as Fifa gets to rake in its billions. It's a tragedy for the game that the World Cup now finds itself in the middle of this grubby quid pro quo.”

It is also why many involved figures actually see such an exceptional event as being of a piece with more regular Fifa issues, like the implementation of VAR and ticket prices, as well as another unique case like the eventual suspension of Russia over the 2022 invasion.

Numerous sources criticise Infantino's Fifa for appearing to take so many decisions without proper consultation or preparation for foreseeable risks.

Hence, a repeated argument that VAR was not properly road-tested before being implemented. Hence, the suggestion that the controversial World Cup ticket prices were ultimately about developing the game, despite Fifa not providing any response to FairSquare's three letters asking for evidence to support claims that they exert oversight on how member associations spend money.

Hence, the belated response to the invasion of Ukraine. Fifa initially considered ideas like Russian teams playing without any symbolism, but it was really only the political outrage of the West that prompted the suspension. With Poland and Sweden refusing to play Russia, a force majeure argument was ultimately used to justify the position.

The wider point, relevant to Venezuela, is that Fifa look totally unequipped to deal with situations like this if they had any will to. There are no guardrails. An organisation serious about governing the game in an increasingly complicated world would start wrestling with all of this.

As it is, there's the opposite. Far from having to think about any of this, Infantino has already said his piece. Trump has been praised. A prize has been awarded. The show goes on.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A visual countdown outside City Hall is reminding residents that Philadelphia is roughly 155 days away from the start of the FIFA World Cup.

Experts say the city has never seen anything like what's coming in 2026 - and now is the time to book hotel rooms.

Next year brings a trifecta of major events: FIFA World Cup games, America's 250th birthday celebration and the MLB All-Star Game.

""There's going to be a lot of buzz in the city this year now. So looking forward to the events, having Philadelphia as a showcase for the world,"" said Branden Murphy of Rittenhouse.

Officials expect an economic boom, but warn that lodging will fill up fast.

""I would definitely book sooner than later. There's still availability even during the matches; however, those are going to start to fill up,"" said Ed Grose, president and CEO of the Greater Philadelphia Hotel Association.

FIFA is expected to announce in the coming weeks which team will set up its home base at Subaru Park. Grose said once that happens, remaining rooms in the city will book quickly.

""For the motivated traveler, they can find something at every price point, every service level,"" Grose said.

Rates are based on supply and demand. A quick hotel.com search showed more rooms outside the city, with better availability around the Fourth of July compared to World Cup match dates.

""Once Center City fills up - what we call in the industry compression - the compression will bring room nights to suburban hotels, to City Line Avenue, to our airport hotels,"" Grose said.

For travelers who can't book a hotel, home rentals may be an option. Airbnb projects that 17,000 people may search its platform.

""I'm welcoming everyone to Philly. Have a great time - you're gonna have a good summer with us,"" said Arlana Magee of North Philadelphia.","{'href': 'https://6abc.com', 'title': '6abc Philadelphia'}","soccer"

The World Cup involves sixteen cities and three countries. Creating a network to protect them could became a basis of Golden Dome's architecture, writes Army officer Peter Mitchell in this op-ed.

In six months, the world's eyes will turn to North America for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Between June 11 and July 19, sixteen host cities across three nations will welcome millions of spectators to packed stadiums. The scale is unprecedented in American history, like multiple Super Bowls occurring simultaneously across an entire continent.

Unfortunately, the threat is equally unprecedented. These events will be extremely vulnerable to small unmanned aerial systems from state actors probing Western defenses, transnational terrorist networks, or radicalized individuals. A multi-city attack could happen with no more technical sophistication than a 3D-printed drop mechanism and duct tape. Commercial drones capable of carrying improvised explosives are available online with two-day shipping, possibly (and recursively) delivered by drone.

To make sure the World Cup is safe, the US needs to empower existing offices to create an integrated air defense information sharing system that is as off-the-shelf as possible — in effect, the first true test of the concept of a Golden Dome — and do it in the next six months.

That will be no easy task, but also one that should be non-negotiable. There are forty-eight group stage matches in the first two weeks alone; adversaries need only succeed once to sow chaos and fear on a global scale.

Current counter-UAS (CUAS) capabilities are designed for isolated high-value events. The Super Bowl model works when the entire national security apparatus can focus on a single stadium for a single day. That must now stretch across sixteen cities and thirty-nine days. 

There is a critical gap, but it's not because of a lack of resources. The US and its partners have plenty of radars, drone jammers, man-portable anti-aircraft missiles, shotguns, net guns, lasers, trained raptors, and other material solutions.

And there are plenty of offices focused on this: Joint Interagency Task Force 401 was established in August 2025 to coordinate CUAS across federal and state governments for homeland defense. The National Guard and private contractors possess proven CUAS systems deployed at major events for nearly a decade. The Secret Service and FBI bring additional ground capabilities and experience. The Federal Aviation Administration establishes special use airspace around venues, though there are legal issues, as private citizens (and by extension, private security companies) currently cannot shoot down drones. 


					Cyber resilience has become a frontline mission for the US military. Breaking Defense's new eBook rounds up key reporting from the 2025 Alamo ACE conference with the latest developments in cyber offense and defense.				

But what we lack is an integrated and robust CUAS air defense network across the contiguous United States and allied territory. What does not exist is a system that provides situational awareness to all defenders simultaneously and enables a coordinated response.

Defending the World Cup demands an architecture that provides Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) and the FAA with real-time awareness across sixteen host cities while delegating engagement authority to commanders on the ground. The recent realignment of SMDC provides the institutional structure to make this integration possible. 

Rather than standing up a new permanent command, the easiest solution is to empower JTF 401 with a NORAD-lite authority that can pass down early warnings, share information, and in the worst case scenario of a synchronized attack, coordinate response — not just to US forces, but to Mexican and Canadian forces as well. Think of 401 empowered as a Joint Task Force with an ops center alongside its existing acquisition and coordination role.

This would require the Pentagon to change the mission focus for 401 and allow it to stand up an operational headquarters alongside its existing acquisitional element. But because it's new, 401 should be flexible enough to handle the one-time event — almost like a pop-up command center for the event. 

The good news is that the technology required is not revolutionary. The Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) already demonstrates the core concept, although designed for combatant commands, not homeland defense. We have existing defense cooperation agreements with Canada and Mexico. The Missile Defense Agency possesses the systems integration expertise. The military brings equipment and operators. SMDC provides the command structure. The FAA controls the legal framework.

Put 401 in charge, because the pieces are there. Some assembly required.

But this model would have benefits beyond the World Cup. In fact, it could help kickstart a core part of Golden Dome.

President Donald Trump's order envisions a layered, integrated defense shield protecting the United States. But Golden Dome doesn't begin and end with ballistic missile defense; it must also defeat drones during national events or over critical national infrastructure.

An integrated counter-UAS network for the World Cup can morph into the foundation for broader homeland air defense integration. Coordination protocols developed with Canadian and Mexican militaries will build trilateral defense cooperation. The operational picture demonstrates data-fusion feasibility for Golden Dome's more ambitious objectives.

Layering this architecture under Golden Dome's heading could help free up the authorities and money needed to set it up within the next six months — a rare win-win with government planning. 

However, the window is closing rapidly. Systems must be tested, operators trained, and coordination established with our allies months before kickoff. We can either treat the World Cup as isolated events defended by local units, or use the opportunity to build the architecture that Golden Dome requires.

This is a call for shared sensors, a common operating picture, pre-delegated engagement authority, and rehearsed emergency responses. That is achievable if work begins immediately.

The stadiums will fill and the matches will proceed regardless of whether we're ready. But unlike America's impending soccer fad, the threat isn't going away.

JTF 401, SMDC, and MDA should adapt architecture for homeland counter-UAS integration and begin sensor fusion testing by February. The State Department should formalize engagement authorities with Ottawa and Mexico City by April.

We have six months to prove we can defend our own airspace. Let's avoid an own-goal here. The tournament begins June 11, 2026.

Florian Wirtz finds himself at the centre of a fresh VAR storm after Fulham lodged an official complaint regarding his controversial opener in the recent draw at Craven Cottage. The Cottagers are demanding answers from the refereeing body, convinced that the German international was clearly offside despite the new tolerance rules allowing the strike to stand.

Fulham have formally contacted the Professional Game Match Official Limited (PGMOL) to request a detailed explanation regarding the decision to award the opening goal in Sunday's 2-2 draw. The incident has reignited the debate surrounding the implementation of technology in the Premier League, with the west London club feeling aggrieved by what appeared to the naked eye to be a flagrant offside offence.

The moment of controversy arrived when the Liverpool midfielder latched onto a through ball before firing past the goalkeeper to break the deadlock. While the assistant referee kept their flag down, replays shown inside the stadium and on television broadcasts seemed to show the player standing in an advanced position relative to the last defender. However, after a check involving the semi-automated offside technology, the goal was confirmed, leaving the home support and the dugout in a state of disbelief.

Standard Sportreports that the request for clarification focuses on the specific calibration of the technology and why the visual evidence seemed to contradict the digital output. The club is keen to understand the process that led to the goal standing, particularly given the margin looked significant on the freeze-frames available to the coaching staff.

The decision to allow the goal relies heavily on a rule tweak introduced ahead of the current campaign. In an effort to give attacking players the benefit of the doubt and prevent goals being ruled out for marginal infringements the league introduced a 5cm tolerance level.

Under this directive, if the lines drawn by the semi-automated system show the attacker and the defender are within 5cm of each other, the on-field decision stands. In this instance, the technology deemed that the former Bayer Leverkusen playmaker was within that tolerance zone, meaning he was considered onside for the purpose of the laws.

Marco Silva made his feelings known immediately after the final whistle and doubled down on his frustration in a subsequent press conference. The Fulham boss was unconvinced by the explanation that the call fell within the tolerance threshold, insisting that his own analysis showed a clear error.

“We felt the same, many people in the stadium felt the same, but the semi-automatic we have to believe in it,” Silva said, initially trying to be diplomatic before his frustration boiled over. “They have to be 100 per cent sure of it. It took a long time for something that should be automatic. They have all the tools to decide it right so let's hope they did.”

By Tuesday, the manager had reviewed more angles and was far less forgiving in his assessment.

“Now, I have more images, different tools,” he stated in a lengthy address to the media. “For me, I cannot believe how that goal was allowed, it was a clear offside. We are still waiting for feedback from the Premier League. Everyone had the same opinion, it was clear. It's much more than 5cm in my opinion.”

This latest dispute adds to a growing list of grievances the Cottagers hold against the officiating body this season. The club feels they have been on the wrong end of several high-profile errors, contributing to a sense of persecution at Craven Cottage.

Earlier in the campaign, young midfielder Josh King saw what would have been his first senior goal ruled out during a defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. That decision, penalising a soft foul in the build-up, was compounded later in the same match when the Blues were awarded a contentious penalty which Enzo Fernandez converted.

At the time, Silva described the penalty decision as ""completely unbelievable"" and admitted he was ""not in the best mood"" to discuss referees. The recurrence of these controversial moments has clearly tested the patience of the hierarchy, prompting this latest formal approach to the PGMOL.

While Harrison Reed eventually secured a deserved point for the hosts with a stunning injury-time leveller, the sense of injustice regarding the opener remains. The club now awaits a response from Howard Webb's organisation, hoping for transparency on a decision that nearly cost them a result against the title chasers.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ruben Amorim's explosive exit from Manchester United was triggered by a fierce disagreement over transfer strategy, with the Portuguese coach left furious after seven key targets were blocked by the hierarchy. From World Cup winners to teenage sensations, the full list of players denied to the former boss has now been revealed following his sacking.

The fallout from Amorim's dismissal continues to reveal a fractured relationship between the dugout and the boardroom at Old Trafford. While his comments in the wake of the 1-1 draw with Leeds United on Sunday proved to be the final straw, the seeds of his departure were sown months prior during heated debates over recruitment. Amorim's frustrations boiled over in a bombshell outburst following the Leeds game, where he demanded to be referred to as the ""manager"" rather than the ""head coach"".

The 40-year-old believed his tenure was undermined by sporting director Jason Wilcox and head of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who consistently overruled his recommendations in favour of their own data-led shortlist, The Sunreports. Amorim wanted experienced, Premier League proven winners to steady the ship; the club wanted high-potential assets with resale value. This ideological clash led to the rejection of seven specific players Amorim had identified as essential for his project.

The first major point of contention arose over the goalkeeping situation. With Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir struggling for consistency, Amorim requested a definitive solution. His choice was Emiliano Martinez, the Aston Villa goalkeeper and World Cup winner with Argentina.

Reports indicate that Martinez, 33, was ready to make the switch and was even waiting for a call on deadline day. The deal would have cost United £40 million, a fee Amorim deemed acceptable for a leader of such pedigree. However, the INEOS-led leadership group refused to sanction the move for a player in his 30s. Instead, they opted for Senne Lammens, a 23-year-old Belgian with just one year of professional experience, costing £18m. While Lammens has performed admirably this season, the decision to ignore the head coach's preference for a ready-made world champion set a bitter precedent.

If the goalkeeping decision was debatable, the choice of striker has proven disastrous. Amorim urged the club to sign Ollie Watkins from Aston Villa. He viewed the England international as the perfect tactical fit.

Instead, Vivell pushed for Benjamin Sesko. The hierarchy paid a staggering £74m for the forward, banking on his immense potential. That gamble has yet to pay off, with Sesko managing just two goals in 17 appearances this season. Amorim was left ""vexed"" by the decision, forced to field a raw talent learning on the job while his preferred option continued to shine elsewhere.

Amorim's frustrations were compounded by a blanket refusal to sign players from his former club, Sporting CP. He had identified four key targets to help implement his system: Geovany Quenda, Ousmane Diomande, Salvador Blopa and Morten Hjulmand.

United were terrified of repeating the Ajax legacy of Erik ten Hag, where the squad became saturated with former players of the manager who failed to adapt to English football. As a result, valid targets were dismissed simply because of their association with Sporting.

The most painful miss was Quenda. The 18-year-old wonderkid was attainable and had held talks with United. However, scouts felt his profile was too similar to Amad, and interest cooled. This hesitation allowed Chelsea to agree a £42m deal for the winger, who will move to Stamford Bridge in the summer.

Similarly, Amorim viewed Hjulmand as the ideal midfield anchor, a player who required no tactical instruction. The board disagreed, preferring to wait for targets identified for the summer of 2026. Defenders Diomande and Blopa were also struck off the list, leaving Amorim to work with a defence he felt lacked the specific attributes needed for his back-three formation.

The final piece of the rejected puzzle was Nuno Mendes. The Paris Saint-Germain left-back, a domestic treble winner with the French giants, was Amorim's dream signing for the critical wing-back role. He believed Mendes offered the elite technical quality required to unbalance defences on the left flank.

However, the club viewed the deal as too difficult or expensive to pursue aggressively. Instead, they signed Patrick Dorgu from Lecce. While Dorgu is a talented prospect, he lacks the immediate authority of Mendes.

With the club now sitting fifth in the table but only four points above 14th, the refusal to back Amorim with these seven specific targets has left interim boss Darren Fletcher with a disjointed squad. The focus on ""potential"" over the ""here and now"" has ultimately cost Amorim his job, leaving fans to wonder what might have been had the board sanctioned moves for Martinez, Watkins and Mendes.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi has admitted he is ""weirder than sh*t"" in a revealing interview about his private life and previously getting therapy. The Inter Miami star, who has tended to stay away from the limelight and do his talking on the pitch, has spoken about what home life is like with his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo, and why he sought help for his mental health at Barcelona. 

The Argentine international is arguably the greatest player of all time, but for one who garners so much attention, the 38-year-old has always come across as a shy and reserved character, eager to avoid taking up too many column inches. And when his work is done on the football pitch, the former Paris Saint-Germain ace seeks a modicum of normality. 

He said in July 2025: ""Obviously, when I enter into my house, with my family. I try to be a normal dad, a normal husband, like anybody else, assuming the responsibilities we all have, as a father, as a husband, and be a normal person. I am beyond everything else that happens to me — the fame [and] the recognition — I may have outside. Inside my house, I am a very normal person, like anybody else. I discipline the children, I put limits, play and share with them, with my wife and I live a very normal life as well.""

In an interview with Argentine channel, Luzu, Messi revealed that he likes nothing better than enjoying some alone time, especially after enjoying a tiring period with his children. The 2022 World Cup winner also admitted he is a bit of an oddball. 

He said, via Marca: ""I'm weirder than sh*t. I really like being alone, I enjoy being alone. The mess at home with the three kids running around everywhere ends up saturating me and I like a moment of solitude. I'm very structured, if I have the day organised in a certain way and in the middle something happens that changes everything for me.""

When asked what things made him feel strange, he referred the question to his partner.

""Antonella can say many more things than I can, it depends on my mood on many things, on small stupid things,"" he said.

Messi became a worldwide phenomenon when he rose to fame at Barcelona, winning multiple Champions Leagues, La Ligas, and Ballon d'Ors, among other trophies. But all that fame, pressure, and attention got to him as he tried to adjust to superstardom. 

He added, ""I don't do therapy now. At the time I did, in Barcelona. I'm a lot of eating things myself, keeping problems to myself. I changed a lot. In sports, I talk a lot with my dad. In that sense, it was always my old man. I would finish with my old man and write to him. In the day to day, with my family. I really like being alone, I enjoy being alone. When the kids are running around the house, there's a lot of noise.""

Ruben Amorim reportedly knew Manchester United players wouldn't win one game early in his tenure after 'watching how his players tied their laces' before the warm-up. The Portuguese was sacked by the Red Devils earlier this week, ending an ill-fated 14-month spell in charge. While the Old Trafford outfit are sixth in the Premier League, the 40-year-old is said to have previously aired his concerns that the club was already 'broken'.

In the wake of United's 1-1 draw at Leeds United on Sunday, Amorim insisted he was the ""manager and not the coach"" at the club, while seemingly taking aim at the board for meddling in his affairs. 

He told reporters, ""I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the head coach. I know my name is not [Antonio] Conte, [Thomas] Tuchel, or [Jose] Mourinho but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or until the board decide to change. I'm not going to quit. I'll do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.""

Despite being in the top six, it seems those comments were the final straw for United, who dismissed the ex-Sporting CP boss on Monday. 

A statement read: ""Ruben Amorim has departed his role as head coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.""

According to ESPN, all was not well for a long time with Amorim and United behind the scenes. In January 2025, Amorim reportedly had to be talked into staying at the club after a poor run of form, and a month later, he claimed to know that United wouldn't win a match 'just by watching how his players tied their laces before the warmup'. In the same conversation with one source, the ex-midfielder admitted his fear that the club was 'broken' and that the players he had inherited were so 'fragile'. Amorim was said to be shocked at the team's lack of physicality, with the Portuguese becoming 'irate' at how often they lost one-on-one duels. Moreover, when he said that this United team may be the ""worst"" in the club's 147-year history, naturally, that did not go down well with his squad. Further criticism of 2025 signings Benjamin Sesko and Patrick Dorgu, and academy players left many unimpressed, too.

According to reports in Norway, United are in contract talks with club legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer about a return to Old Trafford. The Norwegian managed the Red Devils between 2018-21 before being sacked and now talk has surfaced that he may succeed Amorim. The 52-year-old could even be back in the dugout by Friday, with Solskjaer previously saying he would welcome the chance to return to his old stomping ground. 

In a Q&A at the Oslo Business Forum in September 2024, he said: ""If the family [United] asks, I would say yes every day of the week. It feels wrong to talk about jobs that other people have now, but I would say yes, of course.""

Following Amorim's exit, United confirmed that under-18 coach Darren Fletcher will take charge of their Premier League clash away at Burnley on Wednesday night.

Harry Kane has been urged to reject any potential advances from Barcelona as Dwight Yorke believes the England captain would struggle to replicate his prolific form in Spain. The former Manchester United striker claims the tempo of La Liga makes it a ""much more difficult"" environment than the Bundesliga, warning that a move at this stage of his career carries significant risk.

Kane has been linked with a summer move to the Catalan giants as their search for a successor for star striker Robert Lewandowski continues. 

However, former United treble winner Yorke has issued a stark warning to Kane regarding a potential summer transfer to Barcelona, suggesting the Bayern Munich striker would find life in Spain significantly tougher than his current comfortable existence in Germany.

Speaking to Footitalia, the former Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers marksman questioned whether Kane could adapt to the rigours of Spanish football at this stage of his career.

“Harry Kane to Barcelona? I'm not sure because he is very comfortable,” Yorke stated. “He is 32 now and he'll find it more difficult, I think. I would think that he will find it much more difficult because of the tempo of the game and that kind of stuff.”

Since swapping Tottenham Hotspur for Bavaria in the summer of 2023, Kane has obliterated goalscoring records in the Bundesliga. His transition to German football was seamless, with the striker enjoying the open, attacking nature of the league. However, Yorke contends that the tactical intricacies and technical demands of La Liga present a different type of challenge, one that might not suit a player entering his mid-thirties.

While acknowledging Kane's undeniable quality, Yorke predicted a statistical decline if the transfer were to materialise. The pundit suggests that the unique ecosystem Kane enjoys at Bayern, where he is the undisputed focal point of a dominant side, might not be easily replicated in Catalonia.

“I still think he would do well, but he won't do as well as he's doing at Bayern Munich,” Yorke added. “I would be very wary of that if I was his advisor or one of the people around him.”

The comments from Yorke highlight the delicate balancing act facing players of Kane's stature. At 32, the striker is arguably in the final prime years of his career. His move to Munich was driven by a desire for silverware and guaranteed Champions League football, objectives he is currently meeting.

Risking this stability for a new challenge in a league known for its high technical floor and intense media scrutiny could backfire. Barcelona, while historically prestigious, have faced their own turbulent times recently, and the pressure on their number nine is immense. With Lewandowski having set a high bar at the club previously, any successor is immediately subjected to intense comparisons.

Yorke's advice to Kane's ""advisors"" suggests that legacy preservation should now be the priority. By staying in Munich, Kane can continue to chase Gerd Muller's historic records and cement his status as one of the Bundesliga's greatest-ever imports. A move to Spain, conversely, introduces variables that could see his output diminish just as he looks to finish his career on a high.

From Bayern's perspective, there is little desire to part ways with their talisman. Kane remains integral to the plans of the hierarchy and the coaching staff. His influence extends beyond just goalscoring; his ability to drop deep and link play has been crucial for the development of the younger forwards around him.

The club view him as the cornerstone of their project, and his contract situation is not yet a cause for panic. However, in modern football, the allure of Real Madrid or Barcelona remains a powerful draw for any player.

Kane recently featured in Bayern's 5-0 friendly victory over Red Bull Salzburg as the team prepares for the resumption of the Bundesliga season. While he did not get on the scoresheet, leaving that to the younger generation led by Lennart Karl, his presence in the lineup underscored his importance to the team's rhythm.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

AC Milan goalkeeper on course to snub Blues transfer","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/chelsea-mike-maignan-disappointment-ac-milan-goalkeeper-snub-blues-transfer/blt761b33551fed714b","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:00:15 GMT","

Chelsea are set to be disappointed in their pursuit of AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan, as the Italian giants edge closer to tying their captain down to a new contract. Maignan was a transfer target for the Blues last summer and they were expected to renew their interest this year given the Frenchman would be available on a free transfer. However, Milan are now in advanced talks to keep the highly-rated stopper at San Siro.

Maignan had been widely expected to walk away from Milan in the summer when his current deal expires, with little in the way of progress in contract talks in 2025. However, it seems the Rossoneri have finally made a breakthrough amid their determination to keep the 30-year-old. According to Fabrice Hawkins, the player is now in advanced negotiations to extend his stay at the club by another five years, although no final agreement has been reached as yet.

The news will come as significant blow to Chelsea, who had seemingly earmarked the highly-rated stopper to become their new first-choice goalkeeper once he had come to the end of his time at San Siro. In the summer of 2025, the Blues pushed hard to sign Maignan before the Club World Cup in the United States, seeing a lowball €15 million (£13m/$17.5m) offer rejected ahead of the tournament. It was reported at the time that the player was keen on the move, but Milan held firm and the west Londoners didn't revisit their interest later in the summer. It's said that Massimiliano Allegri played a role in keeping hold of the club's skipper having just taken the reins at the time.

Milan CEO Giorgio Furlani denied claims that Maignan had tried to force his way out, saying: ""There was interest from an English club, it was not considered an interesting interest from the club's point of view. Mike was and is an important player for Milan, and his agent was also very correct. There was openness to this interest but at the same time there was an interest on their part, not a forcing or a push, to stay at Milan. Then in the medium-long term future, those who live will see.""

Juventus have also since been credited with an interest. In an update in December, Milan's sporting director Igli Tare said: ""We have never talked about numbers. Talking about Mike is easy, he is an extraordinary boy and a great leader. He likes being at Milan and Milan likes him being here, but now let's think about the game and then we will talk about it.""

While Maignan is not guaranteed to commit his future to the Rossoneri, it looks likely that Chelsea will have to turn their attentions elsewhere when it comes to levelling up their goalkeeping department. Much-maligned current No.1 Robert Sanchez has seen his stock rise over the last year or so, but the position is still widely viewed as a weak point that needs to be strengthened. Whether incoming Blues head coach Liam Rosenior shares that view remains to be seen. He will be watching on closely from the stands when his new club make the short journey to face Fulham in a west London derby on Wednesday night.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi has opened up on his post-retirement plans in an apparent nod to Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham. The Argentina international is coming towards the end of his career but is still, arguably, one of the best players in the world at the age of 38. While many would love the Miami ace to go into management, the veteran appears to have other ideas.

In many people's eyes, Messi is the greatest footballer of all time. Not only for his talent and abilities on the pitch, but for winning the World Cup, multiple trophies across the world, and a plethora of Ballon d'Or crowns. But even the former Barcelona star, who turns 39 later this year, is well aware that he won't have too many more years left in the sport. Last September, he even admitted that he had not yet decided on whether to play for Argentina at the 2026 World Cup.

Messi made it clear he has no desire to retire just yet when he signed a contract extension with the Major League Soccer outfit Inter Miami until 2028 late last year. The Argentine great said last October that he was ""really excited"" about extending his stay with the Herons, along with moving into their long-awaited new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, later in 2026.

He said, ""It makes me really happy to stay here and to continue with this project that, besides being a dream, has become a beautiful reality - playing in this stadium, at Miami Freedom Park. Since I arrived in Miami, I've been very happy, so I'm truly glad to keep going here. We're all really excited about the moment when we can finally play at Miami Freedom Park. We can't wait for it to be finished - to experience it from the inside, in our new home, and for the fans to enjoy it as well. It's going to be something very special to play at home in such a spectacular stadium.""

Last November, Messi admitted that when he does hang up his boots, he wants to go into the world of business, and that may mean leaving football. 

He said at the American Business Forum: ""I like to start looking at what could come next. I like the business world; I want to keep learning. I'm just getting started with it. I've always been 100 per cent dedicated to my profession, but I know that something else is coming - another world - and little by little, I'm getting involved.""

This week, he told Luzu TV that while he is not opposed to being a manager one day, he would like to run an up-and-coming club in the future, taking inspiration from Miami co-owner Beckham.

He said on Tuesday to the Argentinian streaming channel, ""I don't see myself as a coach. I like the idea of being a manager, but I'd prefer to be an owner. I'd like to have my own club, start from the bottom, and make it grow. To be able to give the kids the opportunity to develop and achieve something important. If I had to choose, that's what would appeal to me most.""

Before Messi finally brings down the curtain on his glittering career, he will be working on being in top shape to help Argentina defend their World Cup title this year, while also trying to build on Miami's MLS Cup triumph in 2026. Currently, however, he is enjoying his off-season before returning for pre-season training in the coming weeks.

Man Utd legend speaks candidly on his future while admitting 'I wouldn't put myself in situations like Plymouth or Birmingham' again","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/is-wayne-rooney-s-managerial-career-over-man-utd-legend-speaks-candidly-on-his-future-while-admitting-i-wouldn-t-put-myself-in-situations-like-plymouth-or-birmingham-again/bltaa9f5a78873d0a62","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:18:37 GMT","

Wayne Rooney has admitted his time in the dugout could well be over after revealing the strict conditions required for him to accept another managerial role. The Manchester United legend, who was sacked by Plymouth Argyle over a year ago, says he is no longer willing to live away from his family, conceding that such a stance makes a return to the touchline highly unlikely given his recent track record.

The 40-year-old has been out of work in a coaching capacity since his dismissal from Home Park on New Year's Eve in 2024. Since then, the former England captain has transitioned into a prominent role within the media, appearing regularly as a pundit and hosting his own successful podcast. However, the itch to manage has not completely disappeared, even if the reality of the job market makes a return difficult.

Speaking during a guest appearance on The Smith Bros YouTube channel, the United legend addressed the speculation surrounding his future. While he refused to definitively retire from management, he made it clear that the nomadic lifestyle required of a modern coach is no longer appealing.

""I would, I definitely would if the right thing came up,"" he said when asked about a potential comeback. ""But I wouldn't put myself in situations like [when I lived] in DC, lived in Plymouth, lived in Birmingham, lived away and missed a lot of my kids' football and stuff.

""That means it has to be the right thing, and for it to be the right thing, and realistic as well,"" he added. ""With the four jobs I've done, is that gonna come up? Which I doubt, so [a comeback becomes more complicated].""

The self-reflective comments highlight an awareness of how his stock has fallen following consecutive failures in the Championship. His managerial career began with promise at Derby County, where he was praised for his leadership amidst administration and points deductions. A stint in Major League Soccer with DC United followed, ending by mutual consent, but it was his return to English football that proved damaging.

His tenure at Birmingham City was disastrous, lasting just 83 days and seeing the team plummet from playoff contenders to relegation battlers. A subsequent move to Plymouth Argyle was meant to be a fresh start, but he was relieved of his duties after just five months as the club fought against the drop.

The ex-striker cited various obstacles that hampered these appointments, specifically highlighting the financial limitations he faced at Plymouth and the intense media spotlight that inevitably accompanies his every move. Unlike other managers who can fail quietly in the lower leagues, every defeat for the former forward became a national talking point, adding a layer of pressure that few other novices in the dugout have to endure.

For now, the urgency to return to the technical area appears to have dissipated. Since leaving Devon, the record goalscorer has carved out a lucrative and stable niche in broadcasting. He has become a regular face on Match of the Day and Sky Sports, offering analysis that draws on his vast playing experience.

In August 2025, he launched ""The Wayne Rooney Show,"" a media venture that has kept him occupied and visible without the volatility of matchday results. The shift in lifestyle has allowed him to reintegrate into family life, attending the events he previously missed while working in the Midlands and the United States.

""At the minute, I'm happy just doing the TV work,"" he confirmed. This statement suggests that any club wishing to lure him back would not only have to be geographically convenient but also offer a project compelling enough to drag him away from a comfortable and well-remunerated media career.

The interview also touched upon other potential career pivots, specifically the long-standing rumours linking the Everton academy graduate to the boxing ring. A lifelong fan of the sport, he has previously been tipped to feature in high-profile exhibition bouts, with influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul often touted as a potential opponent.

However, the likelihood of swapping boots for gloves seems to have diminished. ""I think I've missed the boat on that one,"" he admitted, dampening the excitement of fight fans who recall the viral video of him sparring with Phil Bardsley in his kitchen in 2015.

Despite the initial dismissal, the competitive instinct remains. ""Do you know what? I'd never say never with it,"" he added, leaving the door slightly ajar. ""It depends what offer's on the table.""

While a boxing debut remains a distant possibility, the immediate future for the United icon looks set to remain in the television studio rather than the dugout, as he waits for a perfect opportunity that he himself doubts will ever arrive.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Poland has qualified for the quarter-finals of the United Cup after Hubert Hurkacz defeated Tallon Griekspoor 6-3, 7-6(4) on Wednesday. Iga Swiatek followed with a 6-3, 6-2 triumph against Suzan Lamens to clinch the tie.

Entering the day, Poland needed to win one match to guarantee its spot in the last eight at the mixed-teams event. Hurkacz wasted little time, producing a dominant serving performance in which he hit 20 aces and did not face a break point.

“Definitely didn't know how I was going to start the season. Haven't played for seven months, so you don't really know what to expect,” Hurkacz said. “I was playing okay in practice, but practice is so different from the match when you have so many emotions, you have fans around. I'm quite positively surprised and pleased with that performance out there.”

Prior to this tournament, Hurkacz had not competed since June 2025 because of a knee injury that required surgery. But the former No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has come out firing in the new season with straight-sets victories against World No. 3 Alexander Zverev and Griekspoor.

“After such a long period you're just so excited to be out there and it also gives you a different perspective on things,” Hurkacz said. “I think that's why I'm able to perform maybe better and even stay calm in the difficult moments.”

Swiatek then wasted no time in making the score 2-0. After being pushed to three sets by Lamens at the 2025 US Open in their first meeting, Swiatek pulled away from 3-3 in the first set to win nine of the final 11 games.

After struggling on serve in her season opener against Germany's Eva Lys in Poland's first group-stage match, being broken seven times, Swiatek cleaned things up considerably against Lamens to improve to 2-0 against her. She recorded five holds to love, won 84 per cent of her first-serve points, and faced just one break point.

""I'm really happy that I found a way to be more solid in the middle of the first set because it was pretty even until then,"" Swiatek said. ""I felt like I had more control over the ball and could go for it. I'm really happy that we won this tie just with singles. It gives us good confidence going into the quarter-finals.""

Katarzyna Kawa and Jan Zielinski completed a 3-0 sweep for Poland with a 6-3, 3-6, 10-4 win in mixed doubles against David Pel and Demi Schuurs.

Poland will face home favourite Australia Friday evening Sydney in what promises to be a scintillating clash. Hurkacz's side is pursuing its first United Cup triumph after back-to-back runner-up finishes.

Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison continued their United Cup mixed doubles heroics in Perth Wednesday to lead the United States into the semi-finals of the mixed teams' tennis tournament.

Rallying from a set down against an inspired Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari, Gauff and Harrison won their third consecutive live mixed rubber 4-6, 6-4 10-8 on their third match point to keep alive the country's hopes of claiming a third United Cup title in the past four years. 

The United States will now travel to Sydney to play the winner of the Poland-Australia quarter-final. Today's other quarter-final in Perth sees Switzerland play Argentina. 

""I'm really happy that we're able to move through,"" Gauff said. ""I felt I was playing really good today and that Christian was playing very well as well, and I knew that once we got some opportunities it would eventually swing out way.""

In a rollercoaster quarter-final, Gauff gave the Americans an early lead with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Sakkari. But Tsitsipas responded with a 6-4, 7-5 triumph over World No. 9 Taylor Fritz – his first Top 10 victory in more than 18 months. 

 ""I was fighting for the team and it was such a great match from my end,"" a delighted Tsitsipas said. ""It's pretty straight forward when you are 0-1 down; I was aware of the level I needed to bring onto the court today. I felt I owed it to my team.

""Before I went to bed last night I was already visualising how the match was going to go. I was already playing it in my mind and I'm so happy to win exactly the way I planned. I was especially pleased with my serve and how I dealt with the pressure moments with a clear head."" 

Putting 84 per cent of first serves into play in the first set put the Greek in an aggressive mindset. He fired an ace to fight off a set point at 4-5 in the second set and broke Fritz in the following game to set up the win. He won 80 per cent of first serves in the match. 

Tsitsipas improved to 9-2 at United Cup in singles.  It was his first Top 10 win since defeating No. 5 Alexander Zverev, No. 2 Jannik Sinner and No. 10 Casper Ruud to win the 2024 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters.

Tsitsipas will partner Sakkari in the deciding mixed doubles against Christian Harrison and Coco Gauff.

When Coco Gauff is at her best, it's not far-fetched to say the American puts the star in “stars and stripes”.


So it came as no surprise that Gauff delivered in a big moment on Wednesday in the United States' quarter-final tie against Greece. The World No. 4 defeated Maria Sakkari 6-3, 6-2 in one hour and 26 minutes at RAC Arena to give the Americans an early lead in the tie.
What made Gauff's performance even more impressive was that she was coming off one of her rougher outings in recent memory, particularly on serve. Those issues were nowhere to be found under the sunny Perth skies, as the 21-year-old led wire-to-wire.


“Definitely a much better match today,” Gauff said in her on-court interview. “Last match, I just tried to erase it. That's the beauty of this tournament, and having a team like Taylor [Fritz] and Christian [Harrison] that gave me the chance to stay in the tournament and be able to prove myself better today. So definitely happy to give my team the lead today.”


Gauff posted much-improved numbers from the service line, landing 68 per cent of her first serves while winning 76 per cent of those points. After hitting 14 double faults just two days earlier, she cut that total to just six against Sakkari en route to victory.


For Sakkari, the match was a step back in what has otherwise been a promising week, highlighted by wins over Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu. While the season is only just beginning, 2026 looms large for the 30-year-old. A former Top 5 player on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, Sakkari enters the year at No. 52 in the PIF WTA Rankings.


Gauff's win marks her third straight over Sakkari, giving the American a 6-5 edge in their head-to-head.

 The United Cup is over for this year for Team Greece, but Stefanos Tsitsipas is hopeful the 2026 edition of the mixed teams event represents the start of something new in his career. 

 The 27-year-old ATP Tour star finished with a 3-0 singles record for his country at RAC Arena in Perth, where he on Wednesday downed Team USA's Taylor Fritz 6-4, 7-5 for his first Top 10 victory in more than 18 months. Despite the Americans going on to clinch the tie with a deciding mixed-doubles triumph at RAC Arena, Tsitsipas was happy to reflect on the positives after he sank Fritz to improve to 4-2 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. 

 “Pleased with the win. It was not easy getting into the match. I've been absent for a long time and matches like this challenge you to the fullest,” Tsitsipas, who had not played a competitive match since September due to a back injury prior to arriving in Perth, told ATPTour.com. “I feel like you really get tested in the most brutal and intense ways against players that have been very consistent in the past couple of months. Taylor is one of them. I was aware entering the court that my focus levels needed to be at their highest.
 “I couldn't allow myself to disconnect at any given moment during the match, and I delivered that excellently. My focus levels were there. I was trying to read play, trying to read the court and see what patterns he might start building up and liking a little bit more. I tried to stay away from those and played my game. Very offensive tennis. I dominated from the baseline at times. I felt like I was pretty solid in those rally exchanges. I'm very glad about my performance. It is one of those wins that adds to my confidence.”

 Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari were unable to overcome Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison in the mixed doubles clash as Greece missed out on a spot in the semi-finals in Sydney. Yet the 12-time ATP Tour champion Tsitsipas feels both he and his countrywoman would be taking plenty away from the encounter. 
 “I spoke to Maria. I'm very proud of her, she did excellently. I'm happy that I got to share the court with her,” said the No. 34 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “We are building a great duo, me and her. I feel like every doubles match that we get to play, we come to new realisations about our games. We blend in quite well, and I feel like every match we've played, we've always received feedback and always understood how our games can interact even better. 
 “Obviously it sucks losing today and not capturing that win to go to Sydney, but I see that as a greater opportunity to grow from it, use it in a positive way, and hopefully come back next year with hunger.”
 Tsitsipas, who revealed he is hoping to play the Adelaide International before heading to Melbourne for the Australian Open, was also elated at the way his body had held up across three singles matches and two mixed doubles rubbers in Perth. 
 “So far everything is good,” said the 2023 Australian Open finalist, when asked about how he felt physically. “It's great feedback, knowing that sort of thing, knowing that I'm not feeling any aches or pains. I'm actually very pleased that I get to enjoy tennis daily, without any discomfort and pain that might be causing me more stress in everyday life… I'm super glad I get to play the sport that I love. Health is the most important thing in the world. I'm really truly enjoying every single match that I get to play pain free. 
 “I haven't had that in a while, so to be able to play that way creates happiness and satisfaction, and makes me want to go back to train. Especially when you are dealing with so much pain and especially in the lower back, you are very discouraged pretty quick when you see yourself a few times in that same situation. Training doesn't become as enjoyable anymore. To be able to do that right now is like the biggest bliss.”

 “I haven't had that in a while, so to be able to play that way creates happiness and satisfaction, and makes me want to go back to train. Especially when you are dealing with so much pain and especially in the lower back, you are very discouraged pretty quick when you see yourself a few times in that same situation. Training doesn't become as enjoyable anymore. To be able to do that right now is like the biggest bliss.”

Daniil Medvedev maintained his impressive Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Frances Tiafoe on Wednesday at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ to reach his 90th tour-level quarter-final.

Medvedev did not face a break point and won 91 per cent (31/34) of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to recording a comfortable 6-3, 6-2 win in 61 minutes.

The top seed, who is chasing his 22nd tour-level trophy this week, now leads Tiafoe 6-1 in the pair's Head2Head series, with all seven of their meetings coming on hard courts.

""The court is pretty fast so you need to serve well and I am happy with the way I served,"" Medvedev said. ""I thought I played much better than in the first round, didn't face a break point, and that puts a lot of pressure on the opponent. I had a couple of good games on his serve and that was enough today.""



Medvedev has fond memories in Brisbane, having advanced to the final in his only other previous appearance in 2019. The No. 13 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has yet to drop a set through his first two matches of 2026 and will aim to continue that form against Kamil Majchrzak. The Pole beat Reilly Opelka 6-7(2), 7-6(7), 7-6(8), saving three match points.

In a battle between good friends, American Alex Michelsen overcame countryman Learner Tien 6-4, 6-2. The 21-year-old Michelsen trained with Tien during their teenage years and has had the better of the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion since their first meeting in Jeddah 13 months ago. Michelsen leads Tien 3-1 in their Head2Head series.

Michelsen will meet Sebastian Korda in the quarter-finals. The 25-year-old advanced after the defending champion Jiri Lehecka was forced to retire due to an ankle injury, with Korda leading 6-3, 1-2.

Korda has performed impressively in Australia in the past, reaching the final in Adelaide in 2023 and 2025 and the quarter-finals at the Australian Open in 2023.

Belinda Bencic and Jakub Paul sent Switzerland into the United Cup semi-finals on Wednesday in Perth, where they won the decisive mixed doubles rubber against Argentina's Maria Lourdes Carle and Guido Andreozzi 6-3, 6-3.

Earlier, Argentina's Sebastian Baez had maintained his perfect start to the season by defeating Stan Wawrinka 7-5, 6-4 to level the quarter-final tie at 1-1. In the opening match, Benic defeated Solana Sierra in straight sets.

With the pressure on, Bencic and Paul delivered and have now won all three mixed doubles matches they have played this week. The pair was in red-hot form throughout the 75-minute clash in the RAC Arena against Carle and Andreozzi, taking the first cut in rallies and closing the net sharply. Following victory, the Swiss team celebrated on court, with Bencic and Paul leaping into the air.

Switzerland will face Belgium or Czechia in the semi-finals in Sydney.



Earlier, Baez earned just his second Top 10 win when he defeated Taylor Fritz in the group stage and he produced another impressive display against the 40-year-old Wawrinka, who earned a dramatic three-set win against Arthur Rinderknech earlier this tournament.

The seven-time tour-level titlist Baez saved all five break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, while he forced the former No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings into errors with his flat groundstrokes. Baez has now won three matches at a tour-level hard-court event for just the second time in his career (Winston-Salem 2023, champion).

Swiss player Bencic continued her strong start to the new season with a straight-sets win over Argentina's Solana Sierra.

Bencic, ranked No. 11 in the WTA Tour Drive by Mercedez-Benz rankings, broke serve in the third game of the opening set. The second set followed a similar pattern, with Bencic breaking again in the third game and seventh games before sealing a 6-2, 6-2 win in one hour, 17 minutes.

The 28-year-old has now won all three of her singles matches at the United Cup in straight sets, having also defeated France's Leolia Jeanjean and Italy's Jasmine Paolini during the group stage.

Bencic, who returned from maternity leave towards the end of the 2024 season, surged from No. 421 in early January to No. 11 in the year-end rankings. She captured titles in Abu Dhabi and Tokyo and reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon.

 Coleman Wong continued his history-making run at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open on Wednesday, when he battled past Gabriel Diallo to secure his quarter-final spot. 

 The day after he overcame Mariano Navone to become the first man representing Hong Kong to win a main-draw match in tournament history, the 21-year-old Wong prevailed 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 against Diallo to reach the last eight. The No. 150 in the PIF ATP Rankings, wild card Wong saved 11 of 15 break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to a two-hour, 29-minute triumph. 

 “It sounds unreal,” said Wong, when reflecting on becoming the first ATP Tour quarter-finalist from Hong Kong in the Open Era. “So many people came to support me today. Gabriel is such a great player. We pushed each other to the limit and in the end, I was 5-2 but he came back to 5-5. I was like, ‘Wow, I don't know if I can close this out'. I just kept believing in myself, kept believing in what I've been working on these past years. 

 “It's not easy to be an athlete from Hong Kong and coming from such a small place. Being in the quarter-finals of an ATP event, I just want to keep going.”

 Standing in Wong's way for a semi-final spot at the ATP 250 will be top seed Lorenzo Musetti. The Italian rallied past Tomas Martin Etcheverry 6-7(3), 6-2, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals in Hong Kong for the second consecutive year. 

 Musetti now leads Etcheverry 3-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The 23-year-old, who finished 2025 with a debut appearance at the Nitto ATP Finals, has risen one spot above Felix Auger-Aliassime to No. 6 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings after winning his Hong Kong opener. 

 Nuno Borges was also a second-round winner in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The Portuguese downed former World No. 3 Marin Cilic 7-5, 6-3 to set a quarter-final meeting with 2024 champion and third seed Andrey Rublev, who began his 2026 season by sinking Wu Yibing 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 in the final match of the day.

Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison won their third straight deciding mixed-doubles match to send the defending champion United States into the United Cup semifinals in Sydney. Gauff opened the tie with a straight-sets win over Maria Sakkari.

Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison extended their mixed-doubles success Wednesday in Perth, lifting the defending champion United States into the United Cup semifinals.

Rallying from a set down against Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari, Gauff and Harrison won their third straight mixed-doubles match, 4-6, 6-4, [10-8], to keep alive the Americans' bid for a third United Cup title in four years.

United Cup: Scores | Standings

After trailing 6-1 in the 10-point match tiebreak, Sakkari and Tsitsipas rallied to level at 6-6, but the top-seeded Americans won four of the next six points to close out the victory. The United States will now travel to Sydney to face the winner of the Poland–Australia quarterfinal. In Wednesday's other quarterfinal in Perth, Switzerland meets Argentina.

In a rollercoaster quarterfinal, Gauff gave the Americans an early lead with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Sakkari, marking Gauff's third straight win over Sakkari on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz.

But Tsitsipas answered with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over world No. 9 Taylor Fritz to force the mixed-doubles decider. The former world No. 3 earned his first Top 10 win in more than 18 months, using a dominant serving performance to close out the straight-sets result.

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

Putting 84% of first serves into play in the opening set pushed Tsitsipas into an aggressive mindset. He fired an ace to fight off a set point at 4-5 in the second set and broke Fritz in the following game to set himself up to serve out the match.

Tsitsipas improved to 9-2 at the United Cup in singles. It was his first Top 10 victory since defeating No. 5 Alexander Zverev, No. 2 Jannik Sinner and No. 10 Casper Ruud on his way to winning the 2024 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters title.

But the vintage performance by Tsitsipas wasn't the only example of a top player showing their worth on the biggest stage Wednesday.

Gauff delivered when it mattered most Wednesday, securing a composed 6-3, 6-2 victory over Sakkari in 1 hour, 26 minutes at RAC Arena to give the United States an early lead.

The performance came just days after one of her more uneven recent outings, particularly on serve, but any lingering concerns quickly faded. The World No. 4 was in control from the opening games, dictating play throughout and never allowing Sakkari to establish momentum.

""I think for me [the loss to Bouzas Maneiro] felt like one of my worst matches of my career,"" Gauff said Wednesday. ""I felt like I was practicing well, and I'm playing practice sets well, and my first match went well. So I tried to erase it and learn from it.

""I don't think I was the most positive that match, so I just tried to stay positive regardless of what happened today.""

Gauff posted much-improved numbers from the service line, landing 68% of her first serves while winning 76% of those points. After hitting 14 double faults just two days earlier, she cut that total to six against Sakkari en route to her 245th career victory.

For Sakkari, the match was a step back in what has otherwise been a promising week, highlighted by wins over Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu. While the season is young, 2026 looms large for the 30-year-old. A former top 5 player, Sakkari enters the is currently No. 52 in PIF WTA Rankings.

The win marked Gauff's third straight over Sakkari and gives her a 6-5 edge in their head-to-head.

In the semifinals, Gauff will meet either Australia's Maya Joint or Poland's Iga Swiatek, whom she defeated in last year's United Cup final.

Switzerland reached the United Cup semifinals with a 2-1 victory over Argentina on Wednesday. Belinda Bencic and Jakub Paul won the deciding mixed-doubles match, as Bencic improved to 6-0 in singles and doubles to start the season.

Switzerland, led by Belinda Bencic's unbeaten singles and mixed doubles record, advanced to the United Cup semifinals with a 2-1 win over Argentina in their quarterfinal tie in Perth.

Bencic, ranked No. 11 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, stayed unbeaten to start the season with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Solana Sierra in singles. It was her partnership with Jakub Paul in mixed doubles, though, that sent Switzerland to Sydney, where they will face the winner of Czechia and Belgium.

United Cup: Scores | Standings

Bencic and Paul cruised to a 6-3, 6-3 win over Maria Lourdes Carle and Guido Andreozzi to secure the tie, and have now won all three mixed-doubles matches they have played this week. The pair was in red-hot form throughout the 68-minute showdown in the RAC Arena. In men's singles, Argentina's Sebastian Baez also maintained his perfect start to the season, defeating Stan Wawrinka 7-5, 6-4 to level the tie prior to the mixed-doubles decider. 

Against Sierra, Bencic broke serve in the third and seventh games of the opening set and took it 6-2. The second set followed the same pattern, and she closed out the victory in 1 hour, 17 minutes in Perth.

The 28-year-old has all her singles matches in Perth in straight sets, after earlier defeats of France's Leolia Jeanjean and Italy's Jasmine Paolini in group play. Bencic returned from maternity leave late in the 2024 season and rose from No. 421 in January 2025 to No. 11 by year's end, spearheaded by 500 titles in Abu Dhabi and Tokyo. She also reached the Wimbledon semifinals.

""It's a great feeling to start a season well,"" Bencic said to reporters. ""It's what you hope for to kind of keep going how last season ended. So, of course, to keep the momentum.

""It gives you a lot of confidence that you come out of the blocks pretty good, and you already have so much play before Australian Open is always very important, I would say. So we definitely have that. Now I think it's time to focus on Sydney.""

In the second singles match, Baez earned just his second career top 10 victory earlier in the week against Taylor Fritz in group play. He backed it up with another strong performance against the 40-year-old Wawrinka, who had earlier posted a dramatic three-set win over Arthur Rinderknech.

The seven-time tour-level winner saved all five break points he faced and pressured the former world No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings with his flat, penetrating groundstrokes. Baez has now won three matches at a tour-level hard-court event for only the second time in his career, previously doing so en route to the title in Winston-Salem in 2023.

Two-time United Cup runner-up Poland is heading back to the quarterfinals courtesy of a pair of victories by Hubert Hurkacz and Iga Swiatek in the sweep against the Netherlands.

Two-time United Cup runner-up Poland is headed back to the quarterfinals after Hubert Hurkacz and Iga Swiatek delivered singles victories in a sweep of the Netherlands on Wednesday.

Poland needed only one win to clinch a place in the knockout rounds but captured all three. Hurkacz secured qualification with a 6-3, 7-6 (4) win over Tallon Griekspoor in the opening match of the tie, and Swiatek quickly extended the lead to 2-0 before Poland closed out the sweep with a 6-3, 3-6, [10-4] victory in mixed doubles.

United Cup: Scores | Standings

After being pushed to three sets by Suzan Lamens last summer at the US Open in their first meeting on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, Swiatek pulled away from 3-3 in the first set to win nine of the final 11 games in a 6-3, 6-2 triumph.

""I feel like after first few games I improved my level, and I was more precise with my footwork,"" Swiatek said to reporters. ""I think it was an improvement comparing to the last match.""

After struggling on serve in her season opener against Germany's Eva Lys in Poland's first group-stage match, being broken seven times, Swiatek cleaned things up considerably against Lamens to improve to 2-0 against her. She recorded five holds to love, won 84% of her first-serve points, and faced just one break point.

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

""I'm really happy that I found a way to be more solid in the middle of the first set because it was pretty even until then,"" Swiatek said afterward on court. ""I felt like I had more control over the ball and could go for it. I'm really happy that we won this tie just with singles; it gives us good confidence going into the quarterfinals.""

Entering the tie, Poland needed to win one match to guarantee its spot in the last eight at the mixed-teams event. Like Swiatek, Hurkacz wasted little time, and produced a dominant serving performance in which he hit 20 aces and did not face a break point.

""Definitely didn't know how I was going to start the season. Haven't played for seven months, so you don't really know what to expect,"" Hurkacz said. ""I was playing okay in the practice, but practice is so different from the match when you have so many emotions, you have fans around. I'm quite positively surprised and pleased with that performance out there.""

Prior to this tournament, Hurkacz had not played since June 2025 because of a knee injury that required surgery. But the former No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has come out firing in the new season with straight-sets victories against World No. 3 Alexander Zverev and Griekspoor.

“After such a long period you're just so excited to be out there and it also gives you a different perspective on things,” Hurkacz said. “I think that's why I'm able to perform maybe better and even stay calm in the difficult moments.”

Poland will face home favourite Australia Friday evening Sydney in what promises to be a scintillating clash. Hurkacz and Swiatek's side is pursuing its first United Cup triumph after back-to-back runner-up finishes.

Mirra Andreeva snapped a three-match losing streak to defeat Olivia Gadecki in her Brisbane International opener -- and having had to learn to deal with pressure, the 18-year-old had some sage advice for 17-year-old Emerson Jones, who fell to Liudmila Samsonova in her second-round match. Elsewhere, Amanda Anisimova cruised through in 63 minutes against Kimberly Birrell.

In her season debut, Mirra Andreeva showed she was ready to reset. The 18-year-old rallied from a set down to defeat local qualifier Olivia Gadecki 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 and advance to the second round of the Brisbane International.

Andreeva broke into the Top 10 last year, highlighted by back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells, but faded as the season wore on. She went 4-5 after Wimbledon and ended 2025 with three straight losses, making Wednesday's comeback effort an encouraging start to the new year.

After defeating Gadecki, Andreeva acknowledged that she had struggled -- but also learned from her experiences on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz.

""I did feel pressure from a lot of people, especially after I won the two tournaments,"" she said. ""I felt like people would expect me to win Miami, and then they would expect me to win Madrid and Rome. And I was, you know, that's basically almost not possible.

""I did feel the pressure that people were expecting me to win basically every tournament that I would play, and that was not easy. But last year I learned a lot how to deal with the pressure, how to not pay attention to what people say, and how to talk about this. Because I was talking a lot about how I felt with my team and now I feel like I know more about this. I have learned a lot from the last year, and if that happens this year, I certainly know what to do with this.""

In that vein, the World No. 9 also had words of encouragement for another teenager drawing attention in Brisbane. Australia's 17-year-old Emerson Jones, the former junior world No. 1, followed up her first-round upset of Tatjana Maria with a Vogue Australia feature this week.

Against No. 10 seed Liudmila Samsonova, Jones made a blistering start, ripping a series of winners to take a 3-0 lead. But she couldn't maintain that level. Once Samsonova, a former Wimbledon quarterfinalist, settled into the match and imposed her power, she took control and won 12 of the final 14 games to close out a 6-4, 6-1 victory.

Andreeva is one of many who has been impressed by Jones, just one year her junior, this week.

""I think she's very talented,"" she said. ""Because she's very thin, she's very small, but she hits pretty hard.""

But as a teen phenom who has had to learn to shake off pressure, Andreeva advises Jones to ignore the hype and do likewise.

""I just think that if I had a chance to tell her something, maybe I would have said not to focus on whatever people say,"" she told press. ""Because there's going to be a lot of people that would say, 'Oh, you're going to be the next Sharapova or the next Ash Barty.'

""You just have to focus that you are who you are, and you have your own career and you have your own path. I'm Mirra Andreeva. She's Emerson Jones. She's not going to be the next Ash Barty, because Ash Barty stopped her career. She's not playing anymore. She's going to have her own career, and I think she should focus on making her own path in tennis.""

Andreeva's victory also snapped an unwelcome trend. Home players had recently proved a consistent hurdle for her: Between the 2024 US Open and the end of 2025, she lost six of eight matches against opponents competing on home soil. Last year, she fell to Amanda Anisimova in Miami, Lois Boisson at Roland Garros, Taylor Townsend at the US Open and Zhu Lin in Ningbo. For a set against the No. 204-ranked Gadecki, it looked like more of the same. From 3-1 down, the Australian won five of the next six games, repeatedly punishing Andreeva's second serve.

The match turned at 1-1 in the second set, when Andreeva faced two break points that would have left her down a set and a break. She saved both with strong serving, then broke Gadecki in the next game with a trademark backhand down the line. From there she took command, winning 13 straight points to close out the second set and start the third, and never looked back.

Like Andreeva, No. 2 seed Anisimova faces the challenge in 2026 of backing up a breakthrough year. And like Andreeva, she got off to a solid start against local opposition, needing just 63 minutes to dismiss wild card Kimberly Birrell 6-1, 6-3.

Unlike Andreeva, Anisimova finished 2025 hot, backing up her pair of Grand Slam finals at Wimbledon and the US Open with her second WTA 1000 title in Beijing. The key question for the American would be whether she could keep her momentum going -- and that was certainly the case against Birrell.

A dominant performance saw World No. 3 Anisimova slam 18 winners to her opponent's four. She ran off 11 consecutive points to close out the first set and start the second; a brief blip up 3-2 in the second set, when she double faulted to drop serve for the only time, was quickly shaken off. Anisimova's backhand on the run was arguably her most improved shot of 2025, and it was appropriate that she sealed match point with a scorching winner off that wing.

Andreeva and Anisimova are both just one match away from meeting in the quarterfinals this week, though both will have to navigate tough third-round opponents first. Anisimova will face No. 16 seed Marta Kostyuk, who defeated lucky loser Yulia Putintseva 6-7(5), 6-1, 6-0; she has defeated the Ukrainian just once in three meetings, and that was a 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 battle in last year's Doha quarterfinals.

For the third year in a row, Andreeva will face Linda Noskova in Brisbane after the Czech No. 9 seed battled past Magdalena Frech 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-4 in 2 hours and 31 minutes. In her on-court interview, Noskova referred to struggling with a leg injury during the match.

""Brisbane is not Brisbane if I don't play Linda, starting from the first year I came here,"" Andreeva said. They have split their two previous meetings at the tournament, with Noskova winning 7-5, 6-3 in the 2024 quarterfinals and Andreeva gaining a 6-3, 6-0 revenge in the 2025 third round. Andreeva leads their overall head-to-head 3-2.

All eyes are on Emerson Jones this month as the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz winds through her home country of Australia -- as evidenced by the fact that she's already landed a digital cover for the January issue of Vogue Australia.

The teenager called the feature a ""pinch-me moment"" when she revealed it on Instagram this week -- and for good reason. Showing off her favorite Nike 'fits with high-fashion accents, she's joined in the pages by high-profile Australian athletes like print cover star and Olympic gold medalist Jakara Anthony, the freestyle skier who will have Down Under talking at the Milan-Cortina Olympics next month. She also earned high praise a from recent Aussie great Ashleigh Barty in the accompanying written feature.

""She's certainly exciting to watch -- a joy when in full flight,"" the former World No. 1 Barty says.

But that's not the only surreal moment that the teen talent had in the early days of the Aussie summer. 

In the first round of the Brisbane International, she overcame a 21-year age gap to defeat Tatjana Maria 6-3, 6-3 in the first round for her second career win at WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz main-draw level. Last year, she defeated then-World No. 37 Wang Xinyu in Adelaide.

But despite a spotlight that's only increasing ahead of the year's first Grand Slam tournament, the 17-year-old former junior World No. 1 is trying her best to stay grounded.

""I don't really put too much pressure on myself,"" she confessed this week in Brisbane, adding in Vogue: ""I understand the media ... but mostly I'm confident in this being my journey and not being compared to other people.""

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

Audi have ticked off a milestone moment ahead of the 2026 season, having successfully completed their first fire-up.

Audi have confirmed that they have successfully fired up their 2026 F1 car for the first time, marking a milestone moment as the manufacturer prepares for their debut following their takeover of the former Kick Sauber outfit.

The fire-up – which took place at the team's Hinwil facility on December 19, 2025 – was the first time that the Audi power unit has been run while installed in the chassis.

Audi have heralded the moment as being the product of a collaboration between their powertrain division in Neuburg, Germany, alongside the chassis team in Hinwil, Switzerland, and the new Technical Centre in Bicester, UK.

The milestone also signals the latest step in the outfit's preparations for 2026, a season in which a wave of new technical regulations will come into effect.

Gernot Dollner, CEO of AUDI AG and Chairman of the Board of Audi Motorsport AG, commented: “For Audi, entering Formula 1 is a key part of our brand's ongoing renewal. This milestone is a clear demonstration of our ‘Vorsprung durch Technik' ambition.

“It is the result of seamless teamwork and a relentless pursuit of excellence that will serve as a guiding example for the entire Audi organisation. This project is a catalyst for change, fostering pride, identity, and enthusiasm.

“With the fire-up, the hard work of the teams in Hinwil, Neuburg and Bicester now truly comes to life, marking the beginning of an exciting new chapter in Audi's motorsport history.”

Mattia Binotto, Head of the Audi F1 Project, added: “A fire-up is always a special moment, but this one marks a new beginning. It is the tangible result of our collective ambition and the dedicated work of our teams in Neuburg and Hinwil.

“Seeing everything come together for the first time gives the entire project incredible energy. We have built a solid foundation for what will be a long journey, defined by our relentless drive to improve.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal of the Audi Revolut F1 Team, also said: “This successful fire-up is a critical milestone that validates the quality of the work and collaboration across all departments.

“It energises the entire team and provides a clear focus as we prepare for the next phases of development, including the moment we first bring the car to track. This achievement brings our first race in Melbourne into sharp focus, and we will build on this foundation as one united team.”

Audi will host their global launch event in Berlin on January 20, where their full race livery will be presented before the team join the rest of the field for a private pre-season test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya from January 26-30.

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

Isack Hadjar is gearing up for his next chapter as a Red Bull driver, with the Frenchman preparing to become Max Verstappen's new team mate.

Isack Hadjar has shared an insight into what excites him most about his new chapter as a Red Bull driver, with the Frenchman citing racing alongside Max Verstappen as one of his highlights.

It was confirmed ahead of the 2025 season finale in Abu Dhabi that Hadjar will make the step up to the squad in 2026, having impressed many during his rookie campaign for sister outfit Racing Bulls.

The Milton Keynes-based outfit have numerous titles to their name, with Sebastian Vettel scoring four back-to-back championships at the team between 2010 and 2013, while more recently Verstappen clinched four consecutive Drivers' Championships until his run was interrupted by McLaren's Lando Norris in 2025.

This history is an aspect of the move that appeals to Hadjar, who will become the latest driver to test himself against Verstappen.

When asked what excites him the most about his new chapter, the 21-year-old responded: “Honestly, there's two things. [One is] being in a world champion team. When I grew up watching Formula 1, I saw Vettel winning all these races, as a kid, with Red Bull.

“And [the second thing is] being team mates with Max, to see what it's like – what facing the best level in the world feels like. It's definitely super exciting.”

Elaborating further on what he admires about Verstappen, Hadjar said: “What I find very impressive with Max is that, after four World Championships, he's still very hungry, and very mad when it doesn't go his way because he always wants to win.

“I don't think every champion can do that; once you've passed a certain level you can maybe slow down a bit in your approach, but he seems to be starting just like I am, so it's very impressive.”

And while the step up is one that he is excited about, the young driver is not carrying any specific expectations into his sophomore season, one in which a wave of new technical regulations will come into effect.

“I have no expectations at all because it's starting from scratch, everyone,” he explained. “So yeah, the work is going to be done. I'm just really looking forward to January, February, working with the team, getting to know all the people. It's going to be crucial to try and be ahead a bit.”

The drivers and teams will first be in action during a private pre-season test held at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya from January 26-30, while two three-day tests will follow at the Bahrain International Circuit on February 11-13 and February 18-20.

Jacob Tierney's ‘Heated Rivalry' starring Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams netted a nom for outstanding new TV series while THR landed in the outstanding magazine overall coverage category.

	Chris Gardner



	Nominees for the 37th annual GLAAD Media Awards have been unveiled, and yes, the queer hockey drama from Canada that became a pop culture sensation scored its first major nomination.


	Jacob Tierney's Heated Rivalry starring Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams netted a nom for outstanding new TV series alongside (recently canceled) Boots, Chad Powers, Clean Slate, The Four Seasons, The Hunting Wives, I Love L.A., Long Story Short, (recently canceled) Mid-Century Modern, Overcompensating and Pluribus. Following its meteoric rise in December, fans grew disgruntled online after it was reported that the show, made by Crave in Canada and acquired for distribution in the U.S. by HBO Max, would not be eligible for Emmy Awards.

The Hollywood Reporter snagged a nomination again for outstanding magazine overall coverage in a list that also includes The Advocate, Cosmo, Gaye Magazine, Out, People, Poz, Rolling Stone, Time and Variety.


	“The most popular series and media appear on this year's list of nominees because LGBTQ stories are a winning strategy for a global audience who demands bold and original storytelling. As the media landscape shifts, gaming, local news, and podcasts have also emerged as proud homes to LGBTQ talent and narratives,” explained GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “In the face of rising anti-LGBTQ disinformation, GLAAD remains relentless in our mission to work across all forms of media and to tell the fair and accurate stories that protect values of family, fairness, and freedom for all.”


	The organization singled out four projects for special recognition, an honor designed to spotlight entertainment or media that doesn't fit “existing or traditional GLAAD Media Awards categories.” The four honorees: Andry José Hernández Romero, Before We Forget from Twenty Nine Palms Ent., The Drowsy Chaperone in Concert from Breaking the Binary Theatre and Gaydar with Anania.


	The 37th GLAAD Media Awards, presented by official sponsor Hornitos Tequila, will take place in Los Angeles on March 5.

The actor and aspiring filmmaker from Odessa, Texas, has skated to representation at the powerhouse agency thanks to surprise superstardom delivered by the Jacob Tierney-created sensation.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	It's game on for Connor Storrie at CAA.


	The Heated Rivalry breakout has signed with the powerhouse agency for representation. The move comes as Storrie's star is on fire thanks to the meteoric rise of Jacob Tierney's hockey drama Heated Rivalry and his portrayal of the magnetic Russian Ilya Rozanov.




	Inspired by the second installment of Rachel Reid's beloved Game Changers book series and made by Canadian streamer Crave (acquired by HBO Max for the U.S. and Australia), Heated Rivalry casts Storrie as Rozanov opposite Hudson Williams' Shane Hollander in the steamy yet heartfelt story of professional hockey phenoms and arch rivals whose lust turns to love over the course of a decade.

	The six-episode series debuted Nov. 28, and by the time the finale aired on Christmas Day, it had become a certified smash buoyed by critical raves, a “truly joyful” press tour, frenzied online followings and eagle-eyed fans who analyzed every detail, line of dialogue, camera angle and song choice for inevitably viral clips on TikTok and Instagram, not to mention loving reactions on Threads, X and more, which only seemed to reinforce what lovers of the book series had already known.


	Glowing reviews, like one in the Seattle Times, praised Storrie's Rozanov as a “pool of nuance, deeply vulnerable one moment and obnoxiously charming the next. (And you would never know Storrie was born in Texas instead of Russia — his accent is that good.) Williams' Shane feels like he was lifted perfectly from the book, down to his neurotic need to fold his clothes before sex. Together, they're a tour de force, completely mesmerizing in their dazzling chemistry.”

	











	Then came a slew of interviews, podcast recordings and photo shoots that pushed both Storrie and Williams to north of 1 million Instagram followers. Storrie teamed with Williams for a GQ Hype cover and features in Vanity Fair, The New York Times, Vulture, Cosmopolitan, Entertainment Weekly and more. (A digital The Hollywood Reporter cover story investigated the show's fandom.) Storrie went solo for widely shared outings with Interview, The Cut, Cultured and Behind the Blinds Magazine and more that displayed his versatile modeling talents in highly styled spreads.


	Through it all, Storrie and Williams have boasted about being best friends, and that bond continues with representation as they both signed with CAA. (Deadline first reported Williams signing in what can now be seen as a coup for CAA to rep both.) There's been a fever online as fans speculate on how both actors will ride the wave of surprise superstardom to new projects beyond the rink of Heated Rivalry. It was recently reported that the show has already been picked up for a second season and that they're both under contract for a total of three seasons.


	They're not completely new to this. Storrie's first major role came via Todd Phillips' Joker: Folie á Deux in a chilling climatic scene opposite Joaquin Phoenix, and he's been seen in April X and Tiny Beautiful Things. He's got more work up his sleeve, too, as he recently wrote and directed a self-financed directorial debut called Transaction Planet. The film, which he's called “super absurdist and bizarre” in the vein of John Waters meets Darren Aronofsky meets Sean Baker, follows an alien spirit that incarnates into a human body.

	











	But if you ask him, he's “very much in the beginning” stages of a white-hot career. “When I auditioned for Heated Rivalry, I was working at a restaurant. I was working at a restaurant 40 hours a week, getting off at 1 a.m. I did that on and off ever since I was in high school,” he recently told THR. “Really, honest to God, all I want going forward is to keep having opportunities to work and be on set and enjoy the people and the experiences along the way. It sounds so cheesy, and I was not of that mindset up until eight months ago, but it really is just about being inspired and being with cool people. I just feel so blessed to be doing the thing that I've always wanted to do with my life. How long that lasts, what that looks like, who I get to work with, the ups and the downs, I don't know, but all I can do is be thankful for right now and hope that those fruits continue to grow.”


	Those fruits will be growing with CAA and a team that includes management at Atlas Artists, the law firm Yorn Levine and Shelter PR for personal publicity. He'll next be seen opposite Janelle James announcing SAG-AFTRA's Actor Awards nominees on Wednesday morning.

The major exhibitors' top lobbying group, Cinema United, reiterated its opposition to Congress ahead of a Washington D.C. hearing on the Netflix acquisition.  


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	Movie theater chains are bringing their opposition to any sale of Warner Bros. to Capitol Hill.


	“We are deeply concerned that this acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix will have a direct and irreversible negative impact on movie theaters around the world,” Cinema United, the largest trade organization representing exhibitors, said in written remarks sent on Wednesday to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust as it is set to hold a hearing on the potential acquisition of Warner Bros.

	“Such an acquisition will further consolidate control over production and distribution of motion pictures in the hands of a single, dominant, global streaming platform in a market that is already highly concentrated,” the group, led by CEO Michael O'Leary, added.

	As Paramount and Netflix continue a heated battle for WBD largely over the price tag and deal terms, the movie theater owners told Congress that Netflix's business model does not include theatrical exhibition and Paramount acquiring Warner Bros. would dramatically increase market consolidation after earlier rounds of mergers and acquisitions.


	“If Paramount or another major studio ends up displacing Netflix as the buyer, our concerns are no less serious. A combination of Paramount and Warner Bros., for instance, would consolidate as much as 40 percent of each year's domestic box office in the hands of a single dominant studio,” the trade organization wrote to Washington D.C. politicians.

	











	The threat to the exhibition industry should Netflix or Paramount prevail in acquiring Warner Bros. would be reduced film output from Hollywood and consumer choice at the multiplex. “Amid this backdrop of significant M&A activity, Netflix is now seeking to acquire Warner Bros., a streaming competitor that controls a significant library of shows and movies. If Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. is not challenged, the threat to our members is grave — and possibly even existential — given its hostility toward exhibition,” Cinema United stated.


	In the latest twist around the heated contest for Warner Bros., the WBD board on Wednesday released a letter rejecting the new offer from Paramount and sticking with its signed agreement with Netflix.

With a pair of high-profile exhibits drawing crowds  in Europe, the director puts his inimitable aesthetic on display. 


							By 

	Stephanie Sporn



	More than three decades and a dozen films since making his unusually assured debut with Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson is marking a new phase in his artistic career, with buzzy exhibits in London and Paris showcasing his distinctive aesthetic. Anderson's idiosyncratic, singular style — think of the candy-colored palette of The Grand Budapest Hotel or the saffron hues of The Darjeeling Limited — and his exacting eye for detail are being celebrated in Wes Anderson: The Archives at the Design Museum in London through July 26. Produced in collaboration with la Cinémathèque française, the British iteration of the show reimagines and expands on the 2025 Paris presentation with more than 700 objects, including original storyboards, notebooks, photographs, puppets, models, sketches and costumes from his movies.

	“Curating this exhibition has been a journey of discovery into Wes Anderson's creative process and his unique approach to commissioning works of art and design for his films,” says Johanna Agerman Ross, Conran Foundation chief curator at the Design Museum, who curated the exhibition with Lucia Savi. “In studying his methods, it has been fascinating to realize how clearly he sees the worlds he constructs, even from a very early stage of the filmmaking process.”

	Jasper Sharp, a British historian, curator and longtime Anderson collaborator, agrees: “He is every bit an artist.” The two worked together on Anderson's most recent film, The Phoenician Scheme, for which Sharp sourced original paintings by such masters as Pierre-Auguste Renoir and René Magritte for the art collection owned by Zsa-Zsa Korda (played by Benicio Del Toro). Sharp had tapped Anderson and his wife, designer and novelist Juman Malouf, to curate an exhibition at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (where Sharp was formerly a curator) in 2018. For that show, which traveled to Milan's Fondazione Prada in 2019, Anderson and Malouf picked more than 400 works spanning 5,000 years from the museum's collection, which included overlooked oddities like assorted limbs from broken sculptures. 

	











	For their latest collaboration, Sharp and Anderson conceived The House on Utopia Parkway: Joseph Cornell's Studio Re-Created by Wes Anderson, on view through March 14 at Gagosian's Rue de Castiglione gallery in Paris, the city Anderson calls home. Joseph Cornell, an avant-garde filmmaker and visual artist known for his intricate boxed assemblages, “belongs to a constellation of people and places that have in some way, small or large, shaped Wes' thinking and approach to his craft,” says Sharp. The curator adds that Anderson became an admirer of the late American artist's oeuvre after visiting an exhibition of his famed shadow boxes at the Menil Collection, in Anderson's native Houston, in the late 1990s.


	Working with exhibition designer Cécile Degos, Anderson transformed Gagosian's storefront space into a veritable life-size Cornell box, inviting visitors into Cornell's studio in the basement of his family's home on Utopia Parkway in Queens. Both finished and in-progress works are set amid stacks of shoeboxes containing the mundane materials, from feathers and marbles to postcards and maps, that the artist (self-taught like Anderson) turned into enigmatic collaged tableaus. Though Cornell was infatuated with Paris, dedicating dozens of artworks to the city, he never left the U.S. One could easily imagine Cornell's unrequited love story as an Anderson plotline — the artist even referred to his collection of ephemeral curiosities as his “spare parts department,” an Andersonian conceit if there ever was one.

	











	Much as Cornell did, Anderson fills every inch of space available, whether in his film frames or immersive installations. Each detail is meticulously considered. As for Easter-egg movie references hidden within the Gagosian installation, Sharp remains tight-lipped: “That's for the visitor to discover!”

The judge criticized Diddy's ex for filing ""inflammatory"" claims against Blige and then bailing on the case when she had to prove them.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	A judge has dismissed an “inflammatory” lawsuit filed against Mary J. Blige by her former stylist Misa Hylton — and is warning that Hylton might face punishment if she engages in more “bad faith litigation tactics.”


	The celebrity stylist, who dated Sean “Diddy” Combs in the 1990s, sued Blige last year over claims that the R&B legend had “sabotaged” her management relationship with the rapper Vado. Blige quickly fired back, accusing Hylton of “fabricating accusations” to extract a lucrative settlement.


	In a ruling Tuesday (Jan. 6), a Manhattan judge granted Blige's motion to dismiss the case — an easy decision since Hylton never actually filed a response in court. By doing so, the judge said she had effectively abandoned her explosive allegations as soon as she had to prove them.


	“The court in no way condones parties filing lawsuits claiming millions in damages based on inflammatory accusations, only to have those very same parties abandon their allegations when faced with a motion to dismiss and sanctions,” Judge Phaedra F. Perry-Bond wrote.


	Though she dismissed the case, the judge refused Blige's request to go even further and legally punish Hylton for filing the case, saying she was more interested in simply ending the dispute quickly. But she warned that such penalties could still be revived.


	“Plaintiffs and their counsel shall consider this a warning to refrain from engaging in similar patterns of behavior in the future,” Judge Perry-Bond wrote. “This written warning may serve as weighty evidence on a future application for sanctions if plaintiffs and/or their counsel continue to engage in similar bad faith litigation tactics.”


	Hylton's attorney, Nicholas Ramcharitar, told Billboard on Tuesday that his client had chosen to stop pursuing the claims against Blige because of threats she received during Diddy's sex trafficking trial, but that her allegations had been valid: “We do not at any point take lightly the filing of any matter, especially with the claims set forth in this prior suit.” Attorneys for Blige declined to comment.


	Hylton is a longtime hip-hop stylist known for dressing Blige, Lil' Kim, Missy Elliott, Aaliyah and many other stars in the 1990s and 2000s — and for sharing a son with imprisoned hip hop mogul Diddy. It was Hylton, for instance, behind Kim's legendary breast-exposed purple jumpsuit at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. And when she was honored in 2019 as someone who “helped shape the landscape of urban fashion,” Blige was in attendance.


	But in April, Hylton filed a lawsuit accusing her former client of a wide range of wrongdoing. She claimed Blige exerted pressure on Vado (Teyon Winfree), who was signed to the star's Beautiful Life Records, to fire Hylton as his manager. The lawsuit, which Vado co-filed alongside Hylton, claimed Blige had also refused to release an already-finished album or allow him to tour until he ditched Hylton.


	In a scathing response in July, Blige's lawyers said that Hylton's allegations were not only “baseless” but also entirely fictional, written to be shared “in the press and on social media” for the purpose of “trying to coerce a favorable settlement.”


	Blige not only asked the judge to dismiss the case, but also asked for sanctions — monetary legal penalties — against Hylton and Ramcharitar for even filing it in the first place.


	“Plaintiffs and their counsel had significant time to investigate these issues, not only before filing but also after defendants' counsel sent a lengthy letter identifying with granular specificity why each of their claims is baseless,” wrote Blige's attorneys Lisa F. Moore and Andrew Pequignot. “Yet, plaintiffs and their counsel chose not to withdraw the complaint and instead appear to be doubling down.”


	After Blige filed those motions, court records show that Hylton and Ramcharitar never filed a response — or any other filing in the case at all. In her ruling on Tuesday, Judge Perry-Bond said that was tantamount to dropping the case.


	“Plaintiffs failed to oppose defendants' motion to dismiss, which constitutes the abandonment of their claims,” she wrote. “Therefore, the motion to dismiss is granted.”


	In his statement to Billboard on Tuesday, Ramcharitar said Vado would continue to pursue claims against Blige, presumably through an appeal: “We are disappointed by the present outcome, though intend to pursue the matter until justice is secured for our client.”

The pop superstar's 'Lifetimes' tour concluded last month with more than $134 million total gross ticket sales, reps tell Billboard.

	Lars Brandle



	The numbers are in for Katy Perry's Lifetimes tour, which wrapped last month with more than $134 million total gross ticket sales, according to figures provided by her management.


	All told, the trek shifted upwards of 1.05 million tickets from 91 shows in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America, and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for good causes.

	In the United States, fans generated more than $264,000 for Perry's Firework Foundation, which aims to empower children from underserved communities through arts initiatives. And in the United Kingdom, north of £81,000 ($109,000) was secured for the Music Venue Trust, the charitable organization that protects, secures and improves the country's grassroots music venues.


	Live Nation backed the U.S. and Canada legs of the tour, which officially launched April 23 in Mexico City, and wrapped up Dec. 7 in Abu Dhabi — a seven-and-a-half month jaunt.


	Along the way, Perry stopped by 23 countries, including China, where she performed six shows. Those concerts in China — two in Hangzhou, three in Shanghai and one in Haikou — sold out one minute after going on sale, Perry's reps tell Billboard.


The Lifetimes Tour was themed around Perry saving the world by rescuing a motif-heavy kaleidoscope of butterflies, which represented her various musical eras. With the finishing line in sight, Perry got new ink tied into the theme.


	The tour came off the back of 143, which debuted and peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 in late September 2024, for her seventh top 10 album in the U.S.


	On the music front, Perry's most recent release is “Bandaids” from early November 2025, a ballad that explores the end of a longterm relationship. The single, her first single since splitting with Lord of the Rings actor Orlando Bloom, topped Billboard's favorite new music poll following its release.

Debbie Gibson detonated a blast from the past when she stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live on Tuesday night (Jan. 6).


	The chart-topping singer-songwriter, stage and screen actress and now book author had the place partying like it was 1989 with a performance of “Electric Youth,” the title track from her sophomore album.


	Gibson worked the keys, busted some dance moves, and looked heathier than most of us in the shadows of Christmas, as she hit an uptempo version of her top 40 hit, with support from the Cletones.

	“Electric Youth” gives its name to Eternally Electric (subtitled The Message in My Music), her new memoir.


	“It felt like right now … this is my true second act,” Gibson recently told Billboard of Eternally Electric, published by Gallery Books, a division of Simon & Shuster. “It's been for about five, six years. It really has been this rebuilding time and this reconnecting time with my audience. It just felt like a really fun perspective to be in the middle of it, and for the party to be going — not to be like, ‘I'm going to sit back now in old age and reflect on the good old days.' These are the good old days that I'm living right now.”


	“Electric Youth” peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the final year of the ‘80s, and is one of her 11 singles to impact the chart, a tally that includes two No. 1s. Its parent led the Billboard 200 chart for five weeks.


	Now aged 55, Gibson's still got that electric youth coursing through her veins. In 2021, she released her first proper album in 20 years, The Body Remembers, which hit Billboard's Top Album Sales chart. She followed in 2022 with her first seasonal collection, Winterlicious, which decorated the top 20 on Top Holiday Albums.

""I think the distributor was like, 'This might be too hot to touch,'"" Paltrow tells Amy Poehler during Good Hang podcast interview.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	When Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin announced in 2014 they were separating after more than a decade of marriage, their joint statement infamously introduced a two-word phrase to the pop-culture vernacular: “conscious uncoupling.”


	It feels quaint now to look back on a time before we knew the term — which refers to a relatively amicable breakup or divorce — but at the time, the exes faced a lot of backlash in the media for what was perceived as a self-important way to describe a split. In fact, the response was so negative that Paltrow says she lost a job over it.

	











	The Oscar-winning actress and entrepreneur appears on the latest episode of Amy Poehler's Good Hang podcast, and the surprising anecdote came when the Saturday Night Live alum asked Paltrow if she'd ever been fired. After sharing a story of losing her gig working at a toy store when she was 12, Paltrow transitioned to the more serious story.




	“You know, I was supposed to do a movie at one point, and it was right after the kind of ‘conscious uncoupling' thing with Chris,” Paltrow told Poehler. “And there was a lot of harsh stuff in the press, and I think the distributor was like, ‘This might be too hot to touch.' So that was great, because I was getting a divorce and then I got fired, which was awesome,” Paltrow added sarcastically.


	The Goop founder explained that she was just trying to find a better way through an incredibly hard time in her life, and the “conscious uncoupling” idea — introduced by sociologist Diane Vaughan back in the 1970s — gave her that framework.


	“Say you had a really nasty divorce or your parents had a really nasty divorce, and then you hear this idea that it doesn't have to be done this way,” Paltrow said of why people had a harsh reaction to the phrase. “I think the implicit learning is like, ‘Oh f—, they're saying I did something wrong,' which of course is not the intention. But of course, that makes sense to me. ‘Is the inference that I messed someone up?' Like, that's not a nice thing to contemplate. So I do understand why it was so personal for people, because it was. You only see that kind of reaction when it's personal.”


	Martin and Paltrow met and began dating in 2002 and were married the next year. Before their 2014 separation, they had two children together: 21-year-old Apple and 19-year-old Moses.

Jennifer Aniston is known for her blond hair.

In fact, her namesake haircut, “The Rachel” defined the nineties and sent women to the hair salon in droves.

Never one to take herself too seriously, Aniston filmed a comical Q&A on the brand's Instagram, prompted with the question “Would I ever go brunette?”

“I am brunette,” the actress quipped.

“I'm brunette,” she repeated, as BFF and former “Friends” co-star Courteney Cox walked into frame, throwing her hair on top of Aniston's, adding, “Here … this is what she looks like brunette.”

“That's black,” Aniston added, suggesting her natural hair color would be a bit softer than Cox's deep brown hue.

Looking at herself in the mirror, the 56-year-old actress is reminded of the wig she wore in “Horrible Bosses.”

“Oh, this is like the ‘Horrible Bosses' character I played,” she announces, to which Cox replies as she walks away, “I love ‘Horrible Bosses' … You were a badass dentist.”

In conclusion, Aniston repeats the question, replying, “Yes, well, you saw that answer … did that work? … That I was a natural brunette?” To which she then circled her face with her hand and added, “This is fake.”

Aniston's hair colorist Michael Canalé recounted the origins of “The Rachel” to Page Six Style in 2019. Working with hairstylist Chris McMillan, who created the cut, Canalé was the one to lighten her up.

“Jennifer had medium brown hair, a little past shoulder length. I decided to switch her out from her natural brown to a caramelized blond with feather-thin highlights, a color that looked like she loved being on the beach,” he shared at the time.

“While most other celebrities have tried long and short and wildly different colors, Jennifer has become a style icon because she doesn't go trendy,” Canalé added.

Hairstylist Justin Anderson revealed his anxiety when modifying Aniston's masterpiece of a blond ‘do in the comments of the post, writing, “i made you brunette for CAKE and i've never had more anxiety about doing hair color in my life 😂.”

Another fan wrote, “jen hair has its own fan club and YES i'm a member!” while another commented, “jen's hair deserves its own spin off show!”

We'd certainly tune in.

Hilary Duff's husband, Matthew Koma, seemingly shaded Ashley Tisdale amid her “toxic” mom group accusations. 

The Grammy winner took to Instagram Stories on Tuesday with a fake mocked-up cover of himself on the cover of New York Magazine's The Cut.

Atop the portrait, in which he struck a thoughtful pose, a headline read, “A mom group tell all through a father's eyes: When You're the Most Self-Obsessed Tone Deaf Person on Earth, Other Moms Tend to Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.” 

He added in a sarcastic caption, “Read my new interview with @thecut.” 

A rep for Tisdale did not immediately return Page Six's request for comment. 

The seeming shade came after Tisdale, 40, published a scathing essay for The Cut, in which she called out members of her star-studded mom group for being “mean” and “toxic.” 

In the viral essay, she accused the group — which includes A-listers Duff, Mandy Moore, and Meghan Trainor — of excluding her from activities.

Due to the group feeling “too high school” and herself feeling “not cool enough” for them, Tisdale said she ditched the mom group.

The Disney Channel alum reflected on “sitting alone one night after getting [her] daughter to bed … feeling totally lost as to what [she] was doing ‘wrong' to be left out.”

Tisdale, who shares daughters Jupiter, 4, and Emerson, 1, with husband Christopher French, recalled texting the group, “This is too high school for me and I don't want to take part in it anymore.”

The “High School Musical” actress also wrote that she ended her ties to the group when the “dynamic stopped being healthy and positive.” 

In a subsequent personal blog post, Tisdale divulged that the experience left her feeling “drained.”

“I realized that there were group text chains that didn't include everyone, which led to cliques forming within the larger group,” she wrote. 

“And after the third or fourth time of seeing social media photos of everyone else at a hangout that I didn't get invited to, it felt like I wasn't really part of the group after all.”

Though she didn't name names in either piece, Tisdale was notably absent from photos from the group's fall getaway to the Hotel El Roblar in Ojai, Calif.

A snap shared by Janice Gott showed herself posing with pals including Moore and Duff during the October vacation. 

A member of the mom group, meanwhile, seemingly responded to Tisdale's essay with a pointed social media post on Tuesday. 

Clothing designer Sami Ryan reposted a clip of a man opening a door while lip syncing the words to Megan Thee Stallion's “Her.”

“I don't care if these bitches don't like me, 'cause, like, I'm pretty as f–k,” the rapper sings,

“2026 mood,” Ryan added atop the clip.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Justin Baldoni claims Blake Lively was 'setting me up for a trap' by refusing body double in sex scenes","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/06/celebrity-news/justin-baldoni-claims-blake-lively-was-setting-me-up-for-a-trap-by-refusing-body-double-in-sex-scenes/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 02:38:00 GMT","

Justin Baldoni accused Blake Likely of “setting me up for a trap” by refusing to use a body double in “It Ends With Us” sex scenes, according to recently unsealed text messages amid their ongoing legal battle.

“She's refused a body double,” Baldoni wrote in a private text exchange with his former William Morris Endeavor agent Danny Greenberg on Dec. 30, 2023, per legal docs obtained by Page Six.

He argued that the move was “just setting me up for a trap,” adding that she insisted Baldoni use a body double for their scenes.

While explaining his “really bad week” to his agent, Baldoni described how Lively shut down his ideas for the film's sex scenes and suggested that the stars “keep all of both of our clothes on for the big love scene,” which he claimed was “just ridiculous if you know the book.” 

Advertisement

“The whole thing is just a gigantic cluster f–k and yet I'm doing my best to stay positive, although it's been very draining on me and time-consuming over this break to be dealing with an actress who is rewriting the writer and Director,” he complained. 

The “Jane the Virgin” alum, 41, claimed that he was giving into “95%” of her demands “for peace,” but called the ordeal a “brutal experience.” 

In an update, Baldoni confirmed that he would be meeting with Lively, 38, at her house to go over her edits as she insisted the meeting “needed to take place” there. 

He also alleged that the “Gossip Girl” alum pushed back on Wayfarer Productions' CEO Jamey Heath being present on the film's set — which Baldoni assured he was “fighting back on.” 

Advertisement

“I'm doing my best to just stay positive and give her as many wins as possible to just finish this thing but it's gonna be tough at some point,” he wrote, adding that Lively was “destroying her reputation.”

“Where we will need the most help is during the Edit because I'm not going to get everything she wants and I foresee that being a big issue,” he told Greenberg.

Reps for Lively and Baldoni did not immediately respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

A source close to Lively, however, tells Page Six that “these messages were sent only after Blake had laid out in detail the numerous ways that Baldoni and Heath had created a hostile work environment on the set, after they agreed to more than a dozen ‘protections' for the safety of the cast and crew, and just days ahead of the January 4 meeting at which these protections would be discussed before filming resumed.”

“The text chain underscores Baldoni's retaliatory intent,” the source continues. “It reflects his private anger over the same safeguards that he had said in public were both ‘reasonable' and ‘essential,' and which he later admitted in his deposition were reasonable, including his resentment for having to show up to an ‘all hands' meeting he had also agreed to.”

As we previously reported, one of the major issues sparking Lively and Baldoni's larger-than-life feud was their divisive creative differences on the “It Ends With Us” set. 

While Baldoni directed, starred and produced through his Wayfarer Productions company, Lively also earned a producer credit on the movie, which is based on Colleen Hoover's book of the same name. 

At the time, a source told the Hollywood Reporter that Lively commissioned a separate cut of the film from editor Shane Reid, who worked on husband Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's “Deadpool & Wolverine.”

“There was a fracture among the filmmakers in the postproduction process, wherein two different cuts of the movie emerged,” the outlet reported.

A source seemingly confirmed the outlet's reporting in August 2024, exclusively telling Page Six that Lively gave the final approval on the film.

 “There were two edits and the studio went with a more feminine edit,” the insider shared.

Advertisement

It was also reported that Baldoni allegedly made Lively feel “uncomfortable” on set and created an “extremely difficult” atmosphere for the cast in general.

Lively filed a formal lawsuit against the director in December 2024 for alleged sexual harassment, retaliation, breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and lost wages.

Baldoni hit back with a $400 million countersuit against Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds. However, that suit has since been tossed.

A May 18, 2026 trial date has been set for their case.

Matt Kalil is suing his ex-wife, Haley Baylee, for her viral comments on his penis size.

The influencer claimed that the former NFL pro's large penis size was “the biggest factor” in their 2022 divorce during an appearance on Twitch in November 2025.

In Kalil's lawsuit filed Tuesday and obtained by TMZ, he claimed Baylee's “degrading and deeply personal comments” subjected him to “unwanted attention and invasive commentary from the public.” 

Advertisement

He also claimed his family members have been negatively affected, as well as his wife, Keilani Asmus. According to the docs, Kalil claimed his new wife received “disturbing” and “alarming” messages as a result of Baylee's comments.

Kalil, 36, is suing Baylee, 33, for invasion of privacy as well as unjust enrichment, TMZ reported, claiming she's benefited financially and received a surge in traffic as a result of the comments.

The former professional athlete is suing for damages, with the amount exceeding over $75,000.

In a statement to Page Six, Baylee said Kalil's lawsuit is a shock.

“The truth is in the original livestream  — which is still live on Marlon's YouTube account,” the statement reads. “I speak highly of him in multiple ways throughout that conversation.”

“I am genuinely shocked and incredibly hurt upon receiving the news of this filing,” she continued. “Litigation is a harrowing and emotionally draining experience, and I am heartbroken that he is choosing to subject us and our families to this ordeal.”

Baylee described Kail's size as “like .01 percent of the population” during her shocking conversation with Twitch streamer Marlon Garcia.

“But I was going to try it all,” she said. “We tried it all: therapist, doctors. Not even lying … Looked up lipo-type s–t … That's why it's kinda funny. It's like my life is a comedy, and it kinda writes itself.”

“We've tried, impossible unless you're going to be in tears,” she continued.

The former Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model first began dating Kalil after he was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in 2012. They married in 2015 in a lavish ceremony in Hawaii, but she filed for divorce from him, citing “irreconcilable differences” in May 2022.

After her comments went viral, Baylee told Page Six in a statement that she “cares deeply” about respecting her ex-husband's privacy as well as “the integrity of what [they] shared together.”

“During our livestream, we talked about so much more than what's being highlighted — the love in our marriage, the growth we experienced, the depth of our connection,” she said.

“It's unfortunate that only one fragment is being amplified, because it doesn't capture the full story of how meaningful things were to me,” she continued. “I hope our hour-and-a-half-long conversation reflects more than a funny soundbite.”

Meanwhile, Kail was offered $300,000 by adult webcam site CamSoda to front their “Big Confidence” campaign, which “celebrates men who can laugh at themselves, own their story, and turn viral moments into empowerment.”

“I don't choose to do the things I have to do. They just keep happening!” Delivered by our old buddy Maximus—with a helplessness wobbling in his voice that's clearly outvoting the gun that's wobbling in his hand—it's a fascinating line to contemplate at the top of a Fallout episode that's all about power. And it's power of all kinds, as we spend the best episode of the show's second season so far coming face to face with concepts like firepower, bargaining power, political power, informational power, and, of course (possibly most importantly!) the incredible, life-affirming power of very hard drugs being ingested in highly inadvisable quantities.

That's the power Lucy MacLean's riding high off of, at least, with veteran writer Jane Espenson delivering Ella Purnell a lovely little character beat to work through here as Lucy struggles—if that's the word for something quite this gleeful—throughout this episode with a newfound addiction to Wasteland steroid Buffout. Our young Vault Dweller has picked up this fresh new monkey hanging off her back courtesy, in a roundabout fashion, of The Ghoul, who dragged Lucy to the NCR holdouts he met last week after her little crucifixion episode, who then hooked her up to a drip of the stuff to keep the young MacLean alive. Purnell, who's yet to face a Fallout comedy challenge she couldn't master, manages to play her new jones up for both humor and discomfort, as when she pivots nearly instantly from declaring an attempt to go cold turkey to a slightly fevered “What'cha got there—oh gosh, it didn't take, I'm addicted to drugs” when she sees her partner rooting around in his bag for her next fix.

The Ghoul's advice for managing addiction and withdrawal, unsurprisingly, is “Take more drugs,” wisdom Lucy pretty quickly accedes to, setting the scene for one of the more fascinating twists in this pair's ever-intriguing relationship. Walton Goggins is clearly having fun playing the noseless devil on the young do-gooder's shoulder, even as he expresses some quieter, darker emotions at how quickly her hard-line morals start to break down under the influence of her new compulsion. (Or maybe he just doesn't like her declaring “They're just ghouls!” as she cheerfully headshots a bunch of zombified Elvis impersonators during the episode's big needle-drop-driven action scene.) Watching these two characters become more comfortable with each other continues to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of Fallout's second season, and it's becoming clearer by the episode that that process is inevitably going to involve some ethical give-and-take, her getting a little more tarnished even as he seems to be (slightly) cleaning up his act.

Elsewhere, power is being traded in sometimes literally softer forms, as we return to Vault 33 for what I have down in my notes as “The Brewing Snack-Based Revolution Of 2296.” Back in my recap of “The Innovator,” I dinged the show for going back to 33 for quite such a long span of its second-season premiere, as broad “look at these dopes” comedy fought for airtime with much more vital material. Now, though, the pressures being exerted on the vaults' leadership come into much sharper focus, as Reg's surprisingly successful “products of in-breeding” support group—buoyed up by Overseer Betty unthinkingly okaying his request for an official snack budget, one that gives the group mandated access to the Vault's suddenly-dwindling water supplies—has seemingly mutated into a possible power bloc. With Rodrigo Luzzi's blank-eyed smile now taking on darker overtones as he throws around his popcorn-and-punch-derived power, this is how I want my Vault Comedy to arrive: pitch-black absurdity paired with possibly lethal consequences for all involved. 

And that's before we get into the knock-on effects of the Vault 32 transplants' inability to distinguish their lefts from their rights, which sees Zach Cherry's Woody stumbling into a clandestine meeting between Betty and her 32 counterpart, Steph, in the forbidden space between the vaults. Leslie Uggams and Annabel O'Hagan, always two of the best performers out of this odd little Vault crew, end up in a pleasantly tense showdown here, as Betty tries to invoke her years of experience to talk Steph into sharing some of her vault's water—only to run straight into a power differential that she has absolutely no ability to surmount. (Along with a reveal that Steph knows more than she's been letting on about whatever side project Hank MacLean was running during his time as Overseer, eventually offering to trade Vault 33's survival for a “keepsake box” he hid somewhere in the vault.) O'Hagan gets a lot of room to shine here on both the comedy and the thriller fronts, in fact, as Steph later attempts to placate Woody with an offer to “escalate” his report on her illegal behavior to the proper authorities, i.e., herself. (“Well that makes it easy, doesn't it?”) I was worried, when the episode made it clear we'd be spending a lot of time back in 32 and 33, that it might wind up feeling throwback-y and inessential, as it did in the premiere. But this is a much better example of Fallout building tension from the Vault Dwellers' naivete, rather than in spite of it, while using the brewing conflicts there to reflect on similar issues out in the Wastes.

That includes a very brief interlude with Norm and his little horde of management trainees, who we see discovering a cache of food as they aimlessly move through the Wasteland, exulting in the “mouthfeel” of their trove of uncooked pasta. A short moment of human connection with Rachel Marsh's Claudia—who, notably, doesn't appear to have worked at Vault-Tec long enough to go full pod person—gets interrupted by incoming alpha male moves courtesy of a guy named Reg, who proudly declares that he was Bud Askin's personal assistant before the bombs dropped. (Moisés Arias doesn't get a ton to do in this installment, but Norm's unimpressed “Mm. So?” when Reg drops his corporate bona fides is a lovely little grace note.) Claiming to know what “Phase 2” of Bud's master plan was, Reg begins subtly usurping the “boss'” place at the head of the group—just one more reminder that there's no portion of the world that can be so thoroughly pissed on that another little pissing match can't suddenly break out.

 See also, and ultimately, the situation with The Brotherhood Of Steel, which brings us back to that Maximus line I opened this review with. Floundering, as always, for the best bad thing to do in the wake of his killing of Paladin Xander last week, Maximus ends up press-ganging ghoul entrepreneur Thaddeus into getting into the non-smushed suit of power armor and pretending to be the Commonwealth representative for as long as it takes Max (and a quickly recruited Dane) to kill Elder Cleric Quintus, steal the Cold Fusion tech, and get the hell out of Dodge. It's a terrible plan logistically, but one that pays off in both the comedy and drama departments, as we get to watch Johnny Pemberton bluff his way into a civil war as the various Brotherhood chapter heads start approaching “Xander” to try to broker separate deals, while Maximus has to muster his courage so that he can lethally confront his surrogate father. Which goes about as well as you might expect. As Quintus, Michael Cristofer has always given a performance that veers wildly at times between seeming sincerity and a semi-caricature of messianic delusion, and it's fascinating to see him act genuinely curious as to why Maximus would suddenly barge into his office, clearly intent on tearing down everything the pair of them have been right on the cusp of building.

Aaron Moten, meanwhile, is just heartbreaking here, as Max tries to explain the basic powerlessness that comes with trying to be good on a case-by-case basis in a world suffused with cruel intent. The final snap in the armor arrives when he explains to his would-be father figure that he killed Xander for no more far-seeing reason than to save the lives of a group of children—and then watches his mentor's face twist into dogmatic disgust once Quintus realizes that the kids in question were ghouls. (Moten is building up a really effective demo reel of small, gut-wrenching moments this season, and his tiny “I know” as Quintus rails about how ghouls are “Abominations! To be exterminated!” is another serious killer.) We've known since basically the series premiere that the Brotherhood wasn't interested in saving anyone and wasn't actually worth saving itself. Nevertheless, there's something very sad about seeing Maximus forced to reckon in full with the fact that there's nothing good to be salvaged from the Codex that's given his life some semblance of structure ever since the destruction of Shady Sands. There's nothing left to do now but run from the wreckage and toward the next moral thing he won't actually “choose” to do.

We end this week on one last meditation on power, as we come back to Lucy and The Ghoul as they wander the abandoned ruins of the Las Vegas Strip. Power, as this quite good episode of Fallout has made clear, can come in many forms. And one of those forms, as it turns out, is a 12-foot-tall mutant lizard with gigantic claws, huge-ass horns on its head, and murder on its mind. Fans of the Fallout games will already know how fucked our heroes are by the time Lucy's making jokes about giant eggshells; everybody else can presumably infer it from seeing The Ghoul shit himself with fear for the first time in the series' run. The show (which has held off on this aspect of the Fallout bestiary for as long as it probably reasonably could) doesn't say the word here. But anyone who's ever faced down one of these fuckers knows: It's Deathclaw time. Expect misery and mayhem to follow in its wake.

Marco Rubio, once known across these United States as “Little Marco,” the man who fiendishly sucked water from the teat of a tiny Poland Spring bottle, shall henceforth be known as the “ultimate Flordia Man,” according to a sycophantic, AI-filled report from CBS News' lead anchor Tony Dokoupil. Capping off another proud day as the world leader in diminishing a once-storied news outlet, Dokoupil gave a tip of the hat to the U.S. Secretary of State, showing off hilarious AI-generated memes of the guy who recently organized the brazen and deadly kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. In one, he's the Michelin Man. In another, he's the Shah of Iran. What's next? A soccer player? Yup! It's good to know that Bari Weiss' CBS News hasn't lost its sense of humor since gaining unyielding subservience to the White House.

“Finally tonight, and only in America, the many lives and many jobs of Marco Rubio. The son of Cuban immigrants and a former Florida senator, he's now the face of U.S. foreign policy and President Trump's point man on Venezuela, all in addition to his roles as secretary of state, interim national security adviser, and acting national archivist and USAID chief,” Dokoupil says. “Whatever you think of his politics, you have to admit, it's an impressive resume.”

We do have to admit that overseeing the shutdown of USAID, which researchers you probably won't hear on CBS believe could result in 14 million deaths, is pretty impressive. It's almost as impressive as Dokoupil, only a week after promising that the viewer came first, “not advertisers, not politicians, not corporate interests, including the new owners of CBS,” making sure he served one viewer first. While CBS loves America and makes no apologies for it, they might love Rubio more. It's the type of situationship that could make for a very funny Distracted Boyfriend meme. Just imagine, Mr. Dokopulki holding hands with America while sneaking a peek at a very handsome little Marco walking by. We're sure Grok can whip that up, and then remove all the clothes from the people in the picture.

“Back in real life, of course these memes might not add up to much,” Dokoupil concludes as he suppresses many very real and hearty laughs at the idea of Marco Rubio as, get this, the head of Hilton Hotels, “but to Rubio's hometown fans, which, uh, are many around here in Miami, it's a sign of how Florida, once an American punchline, has become a leader on the world stage. Marco Rubio, we salute you. You're the ultimate Florida Man. And that's another day in America.”

Dokoupil is right about that. It truly has been another day in America.

Béla Tarr has died. A pioneering figure in the slow cinema movement, whose work Sátántangó kept audiences enthralled for its extensive seven-hour runtime, Tarr died “after a long and serious illness,” the Hungarian national news agency MTI reported today [via Deadline]. He was 70.

Born on July 21, 1955, Tarr grew up in Budapest, raised by his mother and father, who worked in film and theater. But despite a role in the Hungarian National Television's adaptation of Tolstoy's The Death Of Ivan Ilyich, Tarr's future lay behind the camera, not in front of it. After receiving an 8mm camera for his 14th birthday, Tarr made a film called Guest Workers. His early work grabbed the eyes of Béla Balázs Studios, which helped fund his first film, Family Nest, in 1977.

A social film that reflected his experience as a marginalized working-class shipworker, the Family Nest set the foundation for the principles of Tarr's cinema, focusing on the everyday struggles of ordinary people through long, improvised takes and patient black-and-white photography. Using non-professional actors, Family Nest‘s brand of cinema verite led Tarr to the University of Theatre and Film Arts in Budapest. Over the next few years, he would make several films: The Outsider, Prefab People, Almanac Of Fall, and a TV adaptation of Macbeth. A sign of things to come, the hour-long Shakespeare tragedy consisted of two shots. The first shot was five minutes long, and the second was 57 minutes.

Tarr's early exploration of contemplative, controlled camera movements culminated in 1988's Damnation, which he wrote with frequent collaborator László Krasznahorkai. Damnation follows the doomed romance between a married cabaret singer and one of her depressed regulars. The film received international acclaim and began the seven-year journey of adapting Krasznahorkai's novel Sátántangó. The seven-and-a-half-hour epic dirge about a collapsing collective farm was a landmark in his career. Despite allegations of cat torture, which Tarr vehemently denied, the film would go on to be considered one of the greatest ever made in Sight & Sound‘s 2012 and 2022 rankings. He would make only three more feature-length narrative films: 2000's Werckmeister Harmonies, 2007's The Man From London, and 2011's The Turin Horse. His final film was the 2019 documentary Missing People.

“I was in the elementary school when I went to the cinema, I saw all the bad stories, fake acting, bad colors. It was so ugly, and life is not like this.”Tarr said in an interview with Criterion in 2024. “In my films, I'm not knocking on the door. I kick the door. I just wanted punch you, shake you, move you.”

Stating that he wants to enter the new year with vulnerability and openness, former Saturday Night Live cast member Chris Redd took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a tearful video addressing various rumors about his time at the show. Namely: his rumored relationship with Kenan Thompson's ex-wife, Christina Evangeline, and drug use at the office. 

“I know a lot of people talk about me dating Kenan Thompson's ex-wife, and how that came to be. And I'm gonna just tell it to you straight,” says Redd. “Bottom line is I'm not the type of person to scheme on a person, I'm not the type of person to even date somebody that one of my homies had dated. This is a very unique, nuanced thing that happened. We were all cool… it was never nothing crazy until it got crazy.” 

“Bottom line is, while I was at the show, I had some pill issues,” Redd says elsewhere in the video. “I was even selling some to some of my castmates. I'm not going to snitch on y'all. But it was really fun in [the media] I would be on this shit, and people would talk shit about me and I would hear them, but wouldn't help me. I would have panic attacks, wouldn't be concerned about me. It was crazy how someone would watch you destroy yourself. This lady was the only one to call me on my shit, help me on my shit. She helped me on my therapy journey, and she told me things about her life that made me look at a lot of people involved differently, and in that time, we fell in love.” 

Redd calls the situation “an emotional double-edge sword” and expresses his love for Thompson. The comedian also suggests that the relationship at least contributed to him leaving the show: “I did choose love.” 

“I don't feel cool about this at all, besides the fact that I found someone who makes me feel like I didn't even know what love was for real, and I just felt like I couldn't miss out on it,” Redd says. “Me and him talked about it and we were cool and we continued to work for a year after we talked about it,” he continues, saying things were mostly stable before “the world found out.” “And by the time the world found out, I was outta there, SNL.” 

Redd also addresses the time he was punched in the face in downtown New York in 2022. “Most people who know me from back home would know that I would be retaliating in a heartbeat, but not this time, bro,” he says. “This time it felt like, fair, fair enough.” Thompson and Evangeline separated and filed for divorce in the first half of 2022, according to TMZ; Redd's final episode of the show was in May 2022.

Former President of the United States Ronald Reagan's son, Michael Reagan, has died, TMZ reports. He was 80. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute confirmed the news. 

Michael was President Reagan's oldest son and was adopted during his marriage to his first wife, actress Jane Wyman. 

Michael was the son of an actress and the former President of the United States, but he found success in his own right and was the author of several books, including “Lessons My Father Taught Me” and “Twice Adopted,” TMZ reports. He was also a political commentator. 

Michael was a contributor to Newsmax, and the outlet issued a heartfelt tribute after his passing. “We were saddened to learn that Michael Reagan, a founding Newsmax analyst on our network and a columnist for Newsmax.com, passed away,” the Newsmax statement reads. “Michael, the eldest son of President Ronald Reagan and the late Jane Wyman, was a noted commentator, syndicated radio host and best-selling author.”

Michael leaves behind a loving family, including his wife, Colleen, their two adult daughters, Cameron Reagan and Ashley Reagan Dunster, and his siblings, Patti and Ron Jr., from his father's marriage to Nancy Reagan. Michael died on Sunday, January 4, in Los Angeles. His family surrounded him, ABC News reports. No immediate cause of death was given.

Michael's heartbroken family released a statement about his passing, which was shared on X.

“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Michael Edward Reagan,” the statement reads. “Michael was and always will be a beloved husband, father, and grandpa. Michael was called home to be with the Lord on Sunday, January 4th, surrounded by his entire family in Los Angeles, California. Our hearts are deeply broken as we grieve the loss of a man who meant so much to all who knew and loved him.”

The statement continues, “We appreciate your prayers and ask that you would respect our family's privacy during this difficult time.” Michael's wife and daughters sign the statement.

The post has received an outpouring of love and supportive messages for Michael's family. “God bless, Michael Reagan. He was always such a wonderful person. I used to talk to him a lot. Rest in Peace,” a comment reads. 

“May his memory be a blessing,” another shared. 

Other reactions include, “May he rest in eternal peace and God provide comfort and grace for his family,” “I'm sorry to hear this,” and “Oh no! Praying for the family and rejoicing at his promotion into the presence of our Lord and Savior.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'Little Rascals' Child Actor Sidney Kibrick Passes Away at 97","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/our-gang-sidney-kibrick-passes/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 04:08:50 GMT","

Sidney Kibrick, who played “Woim” in Our Gang comedy film shorts in the 1930s has passed away at the age of 97, The Hollywood Reporter writes. He passed away on Saturday, Jan. 3, at a hospital in Northridge, his daughter, Jane Lipsic, told the outlet. 

Throughout his career, Kibrick appeared in 27 Our Gang/Little Rascals shorts, which were made between 1935 to 1939. His character was the sidekick to the neighborhood bully Butch, who was played by Tommy Bond.

Kibrick left Hollywood at the age of 11, but his legacy lived on through these beloved comedy shorts. 

In 2022, the Hollywood Museum opened an exhibition celebrating the 100th anniversary of “Our Gang.” And with that, Kibrick was there and took a moment to speak with Fox News, reflecting on his career. 

Specifically, he was asked how he was discovered. 

“Well, I have an older brother who was also in the movies. He's four years older than me. I also have a sister who's eight years older than me. We used to go to the movies as a family. Well, one day after one movie, a man came over to my mother. He said, “I could use that little kid for a movie. I'm an agent” and pointed at me,” Kibrick told the outlet. “My mother didn't think it was all that important, but she did discuss it with my father that evening. He said, ‘Well why don't we try it?' These were difficult times during the Great Depression, so they thought it could be a good opportunity for us. My mother agreed, and I joined general casting. Soon after, I was working with Shirley Temple on my first movie.”

In a 2023 interview, Kibrick provided some insight into what it was like being on set at such a young age. 

“We'd have two hours of schooling in the morning and then work anywhere from six to 16 hours until we finished,” he explained. “There was a lot of work, no question about it, but our director Gordon Douglas was a terrific guy, and he was really able to get a lot out of each kid.”

He also was asked about the shorts' lasting legacy. 

“I think people, even today, could identify with being a child and being mischievous when life was simple,” Kibrick said. “It was fun, and it made people laugh. … I was living the studio life. Those are memories I will never forget. It was a wonderful experience.”

Awww… Rest easy Mr. Kibrick, and thanks for the laughs. I am in my late 50s and I remember watching the “Our Gang” shows in the mornings. Great memories. He's right… so much has changed (and not always for the better), but kids will still be kids. ❤️

I was born in 1948 and my brother's and I grew up watching the Little Rascals.  Im enjoying this clip.  Thanks for the memories.

Wow sending prayers&hugs i absolutely love the show il be 53 and every morning wld watch it..use to laugh so much alot of great memories..thank you rest in peace..things sure are way diff now in this world..

Sooo cute made me laugh. I remember watching every Saturday.

Great memories of my siblings and I watching back to back episodes of the Little Rascals, Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges on Saturday morning. Saturday Mornings were truly made for good clean laughter albeit the Stooges knocked the crap out of each other and Laurel would cry
RIP and thanks for memories.Oh yeah? Yeah. I still say it  😂

We used to rush home from school so we wouldn't miss the little rascals in the afternoon. This was the 70's. I like Alfalfa.

I just loved, loved, loved Our Gang!!!!!!!!! Such good memories. The children today don't know what they are missing. Good clean memories. Mr Kibrick was so cute. They all were. My prayers go out to the family.  He has his angel wings and is up there having fun with the rest of the gang!!!!!

German filmmaker Christian Petzold once again asks his current favorite leading lady, Paula Beer, to embody a woman dazed by trauma and taken in by the promise of romance — or at the very least, a bit of doting — with his latest dreamy feature, “Miroirs No. 3.”

Leaving behind the more literal geopolitical trauma of films like the Beer-led “Transit” or the Nina Hoss-led “Phoenix,” Petzold's new drama centers on two women who cling to each other in the fallout of an accident. Laura (Beer), a pianist from Berlin, is begrudgingly accompanying her boyfriend on a work trip when a violent car crash instantly kills him and leaves her concussed on the side of the road. She's then taken in by Betty (“The State I Am In” star Barbara Auer), who witnessed the crash while painting the white picket fence outside of her isolated country home.

As if Laura is the prodigal daughter returning home, the two women quickly fall into a familiar routine that bears obvious signs of something stranger, including Betty immediately volunteering her real child's bed and clothes to the total stranger. As seen in the IndieWire-exclusive trailer for the film below, the feeling that there's something odd about the way the women are carrying on is underscored by the arrival of Betty's estranged husband (Matthias Brandt) and son (Enno Trebs), who are varying degrees of horrified and comforted by Laura's presence.

 










While Beer's role in the “Miroirs No. 3” is the polar opposite of the flighty seductress she played in Petzold's 2023 drama “Afire,” the film itself has a similarly vague quality, where suffering goes largely unspoken and the landscape and interiors do much of the talking. When the feature, which was named for a Ravel solo piano composition, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May, IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio described it as “a minor-key new drama, which burrows into the psyche despite its slim running time and almost perverse refusal to explain itself or the shapes its narrative takes.”

The airy, enigmatic film makes sense as the successor to “Afire,” given that it's understood to be the last in a trilogy that also includes “Undine.” Each work in the trilogy is built around Beer and an element, with “Undine” drawing on water and “Afire,” obviously, pulling from flames. Though Petzold wasn't clear what element would shape his newest film when he started out, as he told IndieWire, he was struck by inspiration during a pre-production set visit with his stars.

“We were visiting this house, sitting on this porch. Really storming winds were coming, and during the whole shooting, this stormy wind never stops. We had the hairs from Paula, and the others, always totally disturbed, the trees always in motion,” Petzold said. “This could be that nature says, ‘This is the third part of the trilogy. It's wind, air, and now it's gone: You can [proceed] with a new one.' I was sitting there on the porch, smoking a cigarette, and said, ‘OK, this is the end of the trilogy.'”

 










“Miroirs No. 3” releases the film in U.S. theaters on March 20. (It was originally set to be distributed by Metrograph Pictures until the New York theater's distribution arm folded, and 1-2 Special acquired rights for the U.S.) See the full trailer below.

What are the films that demand to be seen on the biggest screen possible? Does Hollywood know what an event film looks like? A look at IMAX‘s 2025 box office suggests the definition of what thrives on IMAX screens could be evolving. 

IMAX on Wednesday reported that it grossed $1.28 billion at the global box office in 2025, a record year for the company in terms of box office revenue, up 40 percent from 2024. In fact, IMAX's 2025 was 13 percent better than pre-pandemic 2019, another feather in the cap that while the overall box office hasn't recovered to those old levels, IMAX has had no trouble recovering and growing. In the U.S., IMAX grossed $449 million, which was a 14 percent increase from its prior record in 2023. It also set similar records in China and the rest of the world, and it did it with IMAX's largest ever slate of 122 new releases.

But the top 5 movies released on IMAX screens may not be what you expect. Among them are a Chinese film that made virtually all of its gross outside of the U.S., a Japanese anime film, and a movie that was ultimately made for streaming. See the top 5 below: 

 










“Ne Zha 2” is one of those titles designed to stump people at pub trivia when asked to name the biggest animated film of all time, as very few people in North America have seen it. Globally the film made $2.2 billion, but just $23 million (nothing to sneeze at!), or 1 percent of its overall gross, came from an English-language dub back in August. Its IMAX haul actually seems low compared to the huge share IMAX usually accounts for when it comes to the box office of some of these movies. 

“Avatar: Fire and Ash” was a late December release, and through January 4 it's actually already made $140 million from IMAX and will easily surpass “Ne Zha 2” when all is said and done. The original “Avatar” remains IMAX's most successful release ever. 

But the others may be a little surprising. “F1” had a healthy theatrical window that Apple isn't likely to offer again, earning $631 million worldwide, but it was ultimately destined to land on Apple TV+. Director Joseph Kosinski's racing movie however, like “Top Gun Maverick” before it, was a “Filmed for IMAX” release, and knowing that a movie specifically used IMAX cameras has proven to be a unique selling point among audiences. 

For “Demon Slayer,” that film led a sensational year for Sony's anime label Crunchyroll, as “Infinity Castle” made $720 million worldwide, proving that the anime genre isn't as niche as you might imagine. And “Mission: Impossible,” that movie depended on IMAX to be a hit. Domestically, more than 20 percent of its opening weekend figure came from IMAX screens, and the $75.8 million it made globally was 12.6 percent of its worldwide total of $598 million.

 










“2025 was truly a transformational year for IMAX in which we leveled up our performance across our business — capturing a greater share of total box office with a wider variety of releases across an expanding global footprint,” said Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX. “We see no signs of slowing down given a very promising slate ahead and the consistency of our market share gains, as filmmakers, studios, and audiences worldwide continue to gravitate toward the IMAX Experience.”

IMAX is projecting to hit $1.4 billion in 2026 and set yet another record. Among the movies it hopes land are 12 different movies that were all Filmed for IMAX, including Christopher Nolan's “The Odyssey,” Jon Favreau's “Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu,” Greta Gerwig's “Narnia,” and Denis Villeneuve's “Dune: Part Three.”

Writer-director Lynne Ramsey‘s “Die My Love” is one of the most psychologically scarring movies in recent memory, a searing look at a young mother (Jennifer Lawrence) coming apart as her ill-equipped husband (Robert Pattinson) watches helplessly. “I see it as a psychic horror movie, and a sad depiction of a relationship corroding and dying,” cinematographer Seamus McGarvey told IndieWire. Yet Ramsey saw the movie differently. “She actually sees the film as a comedy.”

The key to the movie's greatness lies in those seemingly contradictory points of view, as “Die My Love” is a singular experience that's both darkly hilarious and devastatingly tragic — and as nail-bitingly suspenseful as any thriller. McGarvey's task was to visually reconcile these tones while finding the cinematic grammar to express his heroine's emotional and physical meltdown, something he was able to accomplish thanks to his established common language with Ramsey, with whom he previously collaborated on “We Need to Talk About Kevin.”

“It starts with the script, but with Lynn the script is a springboard to other ways of thinking about the film,” McGarvey said. “We have these circuitous conversations and get excited about other films, other artworks, bits of music, and all these things multiply before they get refined and distilled into something else.” For McGarvey, one of the key reference points was the work of director Robert Bresson, whose work in the narrow 1.33:1 aspect ratio inspired McGarvey as he and Ramsey framed their film in those dimensions — a decision that concentrates the viewer's attention on the characters' faces and gestures.

 










“Looking at a portrait as opposed to an image with more context just shows the human dilemma,” McGarvey said. “Whether you're looking at the front of a person's face or the ear or the back of the head, there's something about eschewing vistas and landscapes and the comfort of looking at the whole wide world that brings you back into the head space of whoever you're looking at.” The film shot on location in beautiful Calgary settings, but the 1.33 ratio keeps them maddeningly cut off at the edges — Lawrence's character is close to the majesty but can never really touch it or feel fully part of it, and the visual isolation — which is exacerbated by the abundance of compositions that separate characters from each other — provides much of the film's power.

“It had to be restricted in some way,” McGarvey said of the film's field of view, noting that the aspect ratio lent itself to singles rather than group shots — and that even in shots where characters share the frame, the production design often divides them with windows, doorways, and other frames within frames. “The opening shot suggests that we are in a house that is actually breathing, with frames and frames and frames that are almost like an infinity mirror. It connotes a kind of psychic portent, that something isn't quite right. That idea extends osmotically throughout the film and we just crank it up to 11 as the film progresses.”

 










Although “Die My Love” is a film of exquisite visual precision, Ramsay and McGarvey did not plan their shots extensively ahead of time; they chose to begin each day with a general idea of the visual design but let the specific compositions and movements be dictated by the performances. “The actors come in knowing that they've got a lot of freedom and elasticity being in a particular space,” McGarvey said, “and I try to light the sets so that there's no sense of limiting that space. There's a feral element to the whole film that we were trying to convey, so we set up the camera and let the actors roam — it was like wildlife photography in a way, only you've got two of the world's greatest actors.”

By lighting minimally, McGarvey not only gave the actors freedom of movement but increased his own flexibility in terms of where to put the camera and when to move it. “Normally there's such restraint because you know that to the left or the right there's a light you can't show or a flag you can't tip up or down,” McGarvey said. In the case of “Die My Love,” McGarvey used Ektachrome film stock rated at 100 ASA, which meant he could rely heavily on natural light. 

The Ektachrome had an additional advantage, which was to give the film the nostalgic haze of an old home movie. “There's a sense of optimism at the beginning of the movie, and the color of Ektachrome provides this kind of nostalgic blanket,” McGarvey said, noting that the unnatural quality of the color could also blur into something more disturbing as Lawrence's character became more and more troubled. “Essentially the film is completely subjective — we're always trying to show her perspective.”

 










That extended to the night exteriors, which were shot day-for-night in a manner that mirrored the lead character's confusion. “Is it daylight or is it night? Why is it both? In her mental state, day and night superimpose into each other,” McGarvey said, though he noted that the choice to shoot day-for-night began as a practical concern. “We were shooting in the summer in Calgary, where there's very little nighttime — only a few hours.”

McGarvey and Ramsey weren't sure what they were going to do about the film's many night scenes until McGarvey ran some tests shooting day-for-night with filters and smoke. “Lynne loved the look because it looked hand-knitted,” McGarvey said. “It looked slightly wrong and that paired with the mental state. It served us really well, because we were able to shoot 10 hours instead of three or four. There were raised eyebrows from the producers, but then when we graded it, it just fit the movie perfectly.”

For McGarvey, arriving at those kinds of solutions for both practical and aesthetic problems speaks to the fluidity of his collaboration with Ramsey. “She really invites collaboration with all the department heads,” McGarvey said. “And it's beautiful. It's a joy to have a filmmaker who's so singular in her approach but makes you feel that your contribution is heard.” 

 










“Die My Love” is currently streaming on MUBI.

8.0

Genre:

Metal

Label:

The Flenser

Reviewed:

January 7, 2026

Take the title of The Spiritual Sound as a kind of syllabus, and you'll find a heady list of musical reference points that Agriculture aim to exalt. The jarring intros of black metal songs that make you feel like a portal to Hell has opened inside your headphones. The sound design on later Scott Walker arrangements meant to conjure a Biblical plague. The slow, majestic build of post-rock epics that hold back their climax for maximum transcendence. The threadbare ballads from '90s indie rock records that could have been breakthrough hits if presented in slightly cleaner fidelity. When the riff drops in a Slipknot song. This blend of styles is not only about presenting contrasts—clean versus shouted vocals, melodic versus dissonant riffs, headbanging versus moshing—but also preserving the murky in-between that only elevates the extreme.

The Spiritual Sound is one of 2025's most daring metal albums, and a lot of it comes down to how well Agriculture know themselves. The Los Angeles quartet will be the first to square their righteous politics with the day-to-day realities of making their band financially sustainable. “Our job is that we sell T-shirts and the way we promote those T-shirts is by playing music,” vocalist/guitarist Dan Meyer confessed in an interview. “If we were talking strictly economically, that's just a fact.” More than genre tradition or otherworldly self-mythology, they draw inspiration from the static hum of daily life, allowing for a worldview that feels refreshingly vulnerable. This is an album with nightmarish visions of mutilations that also makes room for an earnest track called “Dan's Love Song.” (The chorus: “I will always love you.”)

Agriculture began as a self-described “ecstatic black metal band” with some idiosyncratic moves—see the tender, heartfelt two-minute ballads placed early on the tracklists for 2023's very solid self-titled debut and 2024's Living Is Easy EP. But with their second full-length, they have evolved into something more unclassifiable, the type of band who can shapeshift with each song while maintaining a distinct personality. Produced by the band, The Spiritual Sound sweeps through its 44 minutes with virtuoso stamina, alternating between tracks led by Meyer—whose approach tends to be more direct and conversational—and bassist/vocalist Leah Levinson, who favors broader philosophical subject matter and societal observation.

As vocalists, they share a strength for meeting any moment with life-or-death intensity, whether through fiery screeches customary of the genre, gentle falsetto buried in My Bloody Valentine fuzz, or, in “Hallelujah,” Meyer's full-throated holler that conjures a singer-songwriter stepping away from the mic to let the audience sing along. When they play with traditional metal structures—the opening “My Garden” employs a loose verse-chorus pattern—they compulsively interrupt themselves with scene-setting textures and bursts of ambience like a darkened stage between shifting sets in a play. At a time when death metal bands are experimenting with new age and hardcore bands are embracing pop, Agriculture stand out by making their genre agnosticism feel proudly coherent, like these sounds were always meant to coexist.

This graceful approach allows them to pull off newly ambitious compositions like the six-minute spiritual centerpiece, “Bodhidharma.” It's a stop-start symphony, pairing one of the record's heaviest, most lumbering riffs with eerie motifs of near-silence and whispered vocals. It's serious stuff—“You look like you're dying,” Levinson screams over solitary drum hits in the opening line, and things don't get any lighter from there—but it's also a blast, vivid and colorful and destined to be a show-stopper for years to come. During live performances, in the moments when the only musician playing is drummer Kern Haug, you can sense his bandmates bracing themselves for bigger crescendos.

Because their music is so inventive—many songs feel driven by a desire to keep the listener from becoming too acclimated to any given space—the lyrics strive to match its artful sprawl and sense of dynamics. Levinson has cited David Wojnarowicz's haunted, unflinching writing on the AIDS crisis as an influence, and the lyric sheet is littered with pets and prayers and names of friends, giving their music the feeling of a community being preserved in song. As grounded as they keep the material, they are also suckers for a good metal one-liner: “Death is the ultimate fucker” is a line I imagine sounding equally triumphant coming from Metallica or Harvey Milk, and to hear Levinson shriek it through gritted teeth in “My Garden” is to hear an overture for the thornier visions of loss and perseverance that follow.

On a record whose lyrics can be unintelligible, I normally wouldn't spend so much time dissecting the words, but Agriculture so often directs us toward closer analysis, deeper listening, fuller understanding. “Bodhidarma” concludes with a summary of one of Zen Buddhism's most brutal teachings, describing a student who cut off his arm to prove his devotion to a master. Plenty of extreme bands might find resonance in this story—self-destruction as a means to symbolic purity—but on The Spiritual Sound, it's just one of many examples of human suffering. In the album's soaring, melodic finale, “The Reply,” we leave on a more humdrum image—a guy alone at the beach, thinking about World War I. Accompanied by vocalist Emma Ruth Rundle, there's no glory to be found in his retelling; no great triumph or punishing defeat. But even when lost in thought, Agriculture show us how the waves keep coming.

Robyn has finally announced her first new album in eight years, which boasts her most Robyn-esque title yet; Sexistential is out March 27 via Young. The Swedish pop star is dropping not one, but two new songs today to ring in the big news. “Talk to Me” comes with a music video directed by Casper Sejersen, while the IVF-themed “Sexistential” gets its own lyrics visual. Give those singles a listen below.

While the album title started as an in-joke, Robyn soon realized it encapsulated her overarching beliefs and moods. “Exploring my sensual life is the same feeling as when I make a good song,” she explained in a press release. “It's such a beautiful kind of sensitive vibration that takes so much work to keep afloat. I feel like the purpose of my life is to stay horny - it doesn't even have to be about sex, but it's feeling sensual and attracted to things that I enjoy, and not letting anything take over that.”

Naturally, Robyn followed through on that with Sexistential by tapping Max Martin to co-write “Talk to Me,” uncorking her inner Prince and divulging one of her biggest turn-ons. Equal parts rousing and determined, Sexistential's title track was co-written with Klas Åhlund as a direct riposte to André 3000 claiming nobody wants to hear him rap about his colonoscopy. “It was my cue,” said Robyn. “I have to do this, I have to write a rap about IVF.”

Sexistential is Robyn's ninth studio album and follows her 2018 comeback LP Honey. It's billed as a return to her pop songwriting and in line with her Body Talk era. She recently performed “Dopamine,” her first new song in seven years and the album's lead single, live on New Years Eve.

Bonnie “Prince” Billy is readying his second album in as many years. We Are Together Again, due March 6 via No Quarter, was recorded in Louisville, Kentucky, with Will Oldham's co-producer and engineer Jim Marlowe. Leading the record is “They Keep Trying to Find You,” which comes with a video choreographed and directed by Abi Elliott. In it, Oldham costumes up as a shaggy woodland monster, which—after a more nimble inhabitant seemingly swaps into the outfit—proceeds to engage a human in an elaborate dance routine.

Oldham says in a press release, “This record was made closer to the Ohio River than any I've been involved with since 1993's Palace Brothers There Is No-One What Will Take Care of You. Louisville's current-and-past vital musical community is highlighted on every song. Catherine Irwin, who sang on the BPB release Ease Down the Road, is back here on ‘Hey Little' and ‘Vietnam Sunshine.'  Lacey Guthrie, Tory Fisher and Katie Peabody, the three front women of the band Duchess, sing together on the opening and closing songs, parallel odes to the beast that is fear.”

Oldham's follow-up to last year's The Purple Bird features contributions from his current tourmates, woodwind player Jacob Duncan and multi-instrumentalist Thomas Deakin, as well as Ryder McNair, Chris Bush, Ned Oldham, and Erin Hill.

Iron & Wine will return next month with a new album, Hen's Teeth. Billed as a companion of sorts to 2024's Light Verse, the record compiles songs that Sam Beam recorded in the past few years with the Los Angeles studio owner and engineer Dave Way. Below, watch a couple go to war with a stubborn mason jar in Spencer Kelly's video for the single “In Your Ocean,” and scroll down for a string of North American and Australasian tour dates announced last month.

The album title, says Beam in a press release, “suggests the impossible. Hen's teeth do not exist. And that's what this record felt like: a gift that shouldn't be there but it is. An impossible thing but it's real.” Fellow players on Hen's Teeth include one of Beam's daughters, Arden, as well as David Garza, Sebastian Steinberg, Tyler Chester, Griffin Goldsmith, Beth Goodfellow, Kyle Crane, and Paul Cartwright. The Americana trio I'm With Her also feature on a pair of songs. Find the album art and tracklist below.

6.8

Genre:

Electronic / Experimental

Impatience

January 7, 2026

In 1957, nearly seven decades before Babau's new “post-exoticism” album The Sludge of the Land, bandleader Martin Denny released an album called Exotica. At a time when the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom was still in living memory, the NYC-born composer and his band were under contract with “tiki culture” maven Don the Beachcomber at a Hilton hotel in Honolulu, where they'd developed a style of easy-listening music that incorporated animal sounds, Latin pop influences, and a mish-mash of traditional instruments like shamisen and gamelan from Asia and Polynesia. The new sound became a global fad, even in the locales that exotica artists fantasized about. The Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra, who pioneered the use of sampling in popular music and presaged hip-hop and techno, covered Denny's “Firecracker” with a futuristic 1978 synth-pop interpretation that delights in the song's catchy appeal while subverting its chintzy orientalism.

Fast forward to 2025, and these tactics of recombination and pastiche have become well-established in experimental music, as artists reframe the odds and ends of the past and present through contemporary insight. As Babau, duo Luigi Monteanni and Matteo Pennesi have navigated these post-tradition traditions for over a decade, going back to their roots in the cassette label boom, and they've helped to distribute like-minded music through their own label Artetetra and monthly Milan residency Future Pidgin, which has hosted everyone from Carl Stone to Foodman. (They've done academic work, too, about “transglobal sonic subcultures.”) Their latest album, The Sludge of the Land, promises to unsettle your sensibilities by exploring the churning zone of kitsch that lurks behind more respectable musical forms. Confronted with an album like this, you wonder: How do you develop a unique perspective with a view from nowhere? Once you've mashed up detritus from all over the map, what new things can you do with it? Babau's reply: Just keep on mashing.

The breadth of Babau's sound is impressive at a glance, even in a world where labels like Hausu Mountain offer plenty of rowdy digital improv. “The sound of a continent moving…” establishes an exaggerated sense of scale with muscular percussion: Toy keyboard plinks and saxophone squawks spiral over a booming racket of drums in the ether, slyly threatening to collapse, like an elaborate plate-spinning act. There are tracks that scrape down in the mire of exotica, too, like the swampy psychedelia on “As long as blue hours unravel…”, where the cartoonish cricket chirps sound almost as big as the track's obnoxious snake charmer wind melody. Just as Babau borrow gimmicks from old exotica and library music, they incorporate tools from experimental music that'll be recognizable to any regular Boomkat consumer. The bag of tricks–Ikue Mori sample-trigger rituals, Orange Milk-adjacent MIDI choir theatrics, Valentina Magaletti kitchen-sink drum thwacking, dubby Sun Araw haze–is endless, but cohesive.

The barrage of sounds and effects is so overstimulating that trying to suss out whatever occasional folk signifiers peek through (a gamelan here, a pan-flute there) can leave you with egg on your face. The effect is like emptying your phone's storage, or a rapid scroll through the “sound test” feature on an old Nintendo game—the individual motifs are already abstracted from their origins, so riffling through them all at once is doubly disorienting. Producer Francesco Piro mixes the album with an ear for the alien and otherworldly so that none of the sounds feel like they were played by a few guys in a room. It's not as sterile as albums with a more explicit focus on stock digital sounds, but in comparison to something clearly rooted in the DIY noise tradition like Moth Cock, or younger artists fully fried by the social internet, Babau's practice sounds a bit placeless. Spend enough time with the album, though, and you might admire its carefully-maintained climate, like that of a stoned digital greenhouse.

The album's maximalist approach, combining an array of live instruments, VSTs, and samplers, sometimes coheres into true jams. Often, though, the clutter is the point, and you're smacked with temperamental textures that channel the flippant streak of plunderphonics. The title of “Wunderkammer Unbound” refers, in German, to the “cabinet of curiosities” in Renaissance European households that predated modern museums, and the track makes good on this premise by scattering a roomful of organic and mechanical sounds into misfit dioramas; in the commotion, a chirping bird gets artificially pitched up into an extended vamp, as if it forgets it's an animal and not a machine. “When we fell into the eternal glide…” interrupts its click-and-drag noodling with cryptic, paranoid vocals that groan like a millennial Mark Stewart. The most satisfying moments come when all the chaotic ephemera disperses to make space for shimmering, ambient chords. These melodic figures recall Jon Hassell's blissful “fourth world” projects and the heady early days of computer music. The Sludge of the Land attempts to break new ground by retreading pathways that have, over the years, become intuitive, and Babau harness a sense of possibility that's almost quaint. They capture the pleasure of learning how to muck around with whatever tools fascinate you, calling back to previous artists who've done the same with their own fraught collisions of technology and fantasy. It's a well-produced, well-executed mess.

	2026 is Robyn‘s year. The Swedish-pop legend will release Sexistential, her first new album in nearly a decade, on March 27 via Young.


	To accompany the announcement, Robyn dropped the album's title track, as well as “Talk To Me,” both of which she debuted at a recent New Year's Eve show in Brooklyn. “Talk to Me,” a hypnotizing haze of happiness, was produced by Robyn's longtime collaborator Klas Åhlund and Oscar Holter, and co-written with Max Martin — their first time working together since the 2010 Body Talk cut “Time Machine.” In a statement, Robyn said, “I wrote it during the pandemic when there was no way to be physical. I like talkers, that turns me on.”


	She takes it to the next level on “Sexistential,” in which she raps about having one-night stands while 10 weeks pregnant via IVF. According to Robyn, she was inspired to write the track after Andre 3000 claimed no one would want to hear him rap about getting a colonoscopy. “It was my cue,” she said. “I have to do this, I have to write a rap about IVF.”

	











	These two singles follow the recent “Dopamine,” released nearly two months ago (as well as a remix with Jamie xx). Robyn performed the euphoric comeback single in Los Angeles in Nov., her first show in five years.

Sexistential, co-produced with Åhlund, marks Robyn's ninth album, after 2018's Honey. The singer says the material is meant to feel “like a spaceship coming through the atmosphere at a really high speed and crash landing. That's how I felt, like I'd had all these experiences searching too far out into space, and now I'm crashing back into myself.”

	Robyn added that the album title was first an inside joke, before she realized how fitting it was. “Exploring my sensual life is the same feeling as when I make a good song,” she said in a statement. “It's such a beautiful kind of sensitive vibration that takes so much work to keep afloat. I feel like the purpose of my life is to stay horny — it doesn't even have to be about sex, but it's feeling sensual and attracted to things that I enjoy, and not letting anything take over that.”


Sexistential will be released in various colors of vinyl, including magenta, white, and more. Robyn will perform the title track on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on Wednesday evening.

	Béla Fleck is the latest artist to pull out of an upcoming performance at the Kennedy Center in the wake of Donald Trump‘s controversial takeover. The Grammy-winning banjoist was scheduled to perform with the National Symphony Orchestra in February, but announced last night that he has canceled.


	“I have withdrawn from my upcoming performance with the NSO at the Kennedy Center,” Fleck wrote on social media. “Performing there has become charged and political, at an institution where the focus should be on the music. I look forward to playing with the NSO another time in the future when we can together share and celebrate art.”


	Fleck's cancellation comes only days after Stephen Schwartz, the celebrated Oscar-winning composer behind Wicked and other hit musicals, pulled out of a scheduled appearance at the Kennedy Center in protest of Trump's takeover of the institution and its legally dubious name change.

	











	Schwartz was set to host the Washington National Opera Gala at the Kennedy Center on May 16, but in an email sent to Newsday, said the center “no longer represents the apolitical place for free artistic expression it was founded to be.” He added: “There's no way I would set foot in it now.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Many artists have canceled shows at the Kennedy over the past year. The first round was in protest of Trump's moves in early 2025 to gut the center's board, fill it with cronies, and install himself as chairman. At the end of last year, another group of artists nixed shows after Trump's board unanimously voted to change the institution's name to the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.

	Cancellations following the name change included the Kennedy Center's annual Christmas Eve Jazz Jam, as well as shows by the New York Dance Company, the jazz band the Cookers, jazz musician Wayne Tucker, and folk singer Kristy Lee. Chuck Redd, who's led the Christmas Eve Jazz Jam since 2006, explained in a statement, “When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert.”


	Lin-Manuel Miranda called off a scheduled revival of Hamilton originally set for spring 2026. “This latest action by Trump means it's not the Kennedy Center as we knew it,” Miranda said. “The Kennedy Center was not created in this spirit, and we're not going to be a part of it while it is the Trump Kennedy Center. We're just not going to be part of it.”

This super trainer from the CrossFit-first brand has made waves in the running world. Can the shoe actually keep up?

THE R.A.D. UFO doesn't look like almost anything else in the typical running space, from its wide, marshmallow-y midsole and bright color blocking to the unfamiliar logo.

You might not have heard of R.A.D. before either—the brand has been best known in the CrossFit world, where it has released a series of cult-favorite (and MH Sneaker Award-winning) trainers. But this model is one of the most hyped releases of the current running shoe cycle, with maxxed out cushioning and an out of this world ride. 

The question is, can the kicks actually perform, and can this CrossFit-first brand hang with competitors at the height of the max stack, super trainer boom? I took it on the road to find out. 

The R.A.D. UFO has a mesh upper with plenty of padding and a connected tongue. There's a 42mm stack of “Supefoam,” a dual-PEBA blend midsole foam in a bulbous shape, a dramatic rocker shape, and an 8mm drop. Still, the shoe is surprisingly light at 8.8 ounces. 

This is a very comfortable, very responsive shoe. The ride is extremely smooth thanks to the generous foam slab and rocker shape, which rolls me forward into each stride. The midsole is soft without being too pillowy; I can feel a slight depression into the ground when I take a step. This isn't the fastest shoe on the road, though; when I needed to pick up the pace in an interval workout, I didn't get the same pep that I feel from kicks with firmer foams or tools like plates. I'd wear this for anything other than tempo workouts and races.

I'm giving the RAD UFO a 4.8 out of 5. I really love running in this shoe. The ride is incredibly smooth, and it might be the most comfortable pair of running shoes I can remember lacing up in recent memory. I kept reaching for the UFO, even after I had logged enough miles to have a solid review. 

That's not to say it's perfect for all types of workouts; I would look for something more responsive for speed workouts and racing. The price is also $200, which is a bit steep for a shoe without a plate (but, to be fair, not outlandish for the “super trainer” category). Overall, the UFO is personally one of my favorite running shoes in recent memory and will be my go-to recommendation for a wide range of runners going forward.

Have aliens visited our planet? Almost half of Sky HISTORY fans think so, even if more than half don't perceive UFOs as a threat to humanity. 

For decades, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) collected and analysed masses of reports about UFO sightings. Though the MoD has since closed its UFO desk and released files about its findings, many Brits believe in a government cover-up of UFO information.

What UK politicians do know about UFOs might even have spread to the royal family. Sky HISTORY's investigates the monarchy's longstanding interest in UFOs and what it could mean for our future understanding of the universe.

Mark Christopher Lee has filmed his own intriguing documentary, The King of UFOs, looking into what British royals evidently know about the UFO phenomenon. 

Lee hasn't just focused on the current generation of royals, either. He points out that Queen Victoria's Prince Albert wrote a diary entry about noticing strange, inexplicable lights in the sky.

However, the seeds of the current royals' interest might have been sown by an especially peculiar UFO descending upon a royal estate in 1955. 

The estate in question, Broadlands in Hampshire, belonged to Prince Philip's uncle Lord Mountbatten at the time. Though labourer Fred Briggs was actually the one who originally reported the sighting, it is thought that Mountbatten later relayed the story to his nephew.

Was the Mountbatten UFO tale the initial spark for Prince Philip's keen interest in extraterrestrial matters? Either way, it's a passion that largely went unnoticed until after Queen Elizabeth II's spouse passed away in April 2021.

According to former MoD employee Nick Pope, Philip subscribed to various UFO-themed periodicals, including Flying Saucer Review. He also asked an equerry, Sir Peter Horsley, to report back to him with accounts of purported alien encounters.

Pope acknowledges that Philip had especially good reason to keep these activities hush-hush. His open-mindedness contrasted with the UK Government's stance that UFO sightings did not hold any major implications for British national security.

This is another story you might have heard on the grapevine. Again, Horsley came into play here, conversing with a mysterious, supposedly extraterrestrial entity called ‘Janus'

 who professed to wanting to meet Prince Philip. 

According to Lee, Horsley met Janus in a Chelsea flat in 1954. Reportedly, the purported alien ‘had an ethereal otherworldly quality' and could ‘extract information about flying saucers,' Lee told Metro.co.uk.

Is the UK government withholding information about UFOs?

On reflection, Janus now seems likely to have been a Russian spy looking to get close to Prince Philip for nefarious reasons. Philip himself turned down the opportunity to meet Janus, aware of the scandal that could otherwise result.

In The King of UFOs, Lee interviews Dan Costello, who claims to have seen a British royal piloting an apparent prototype aircraft in 1975. The royal in question was the future King Charles III, with the alleged sighting occurring in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

According to Costello, the craft had helicopter-style dual rotor blades, but could hover in the sky without them whirring. There was also ‘no sound of propulsion, just a faint crackle of electromagnetism'.

The Rendlesham UFO incident has been dubbed ‘Britain's Roswell'. It occurred in December 1980, when servicemen stationed near Rendlesham Forest were convinced they saw otherworldly lights dancing above the trees.

In The King of UFOs, former CID detective John Hanson recalls Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip corresponding with him about the incident. Hanson had previously co-written books with Colonel Charles Halt, one of the key witnesses at Rendlesham.

These days, crop circles aren't always seen as mysterious. In fact, many of them are now attributed to human pranksters without a second thought.

It was a very different situation in the 1980s, when a spate of elaborate-looking crop circles popped up in fields across the UK. Had these imprints been left by aliens? One person apparently keen to find out was Queen Elizabeth II.

She even once sent her chief scientific advisor out to inspect a crop circle in Wiltshire. Researcher Colin Andrews was already at the site, having got word that the Queen was intrigued by this particular circle's formation.

The Sedona chapter of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) is proud to announce a special event featuring acclaimed documentary Sedona filmmaker Paul Davids, who will present a screening of his 1997 documentary, UFO / UAP Briefing for America's Rocket Pioneers.

This 79-minute film revisits and updates the groundbreaking presentation Davids originally delivered in 1995 to the founders of America's space and rocketry programs—the White Sands Missile Range Pioneers—on the occasion of their 50th anniversary. The documentary explores how the UFO information Davids shared with military leaders three decades ago has since been corroborated by whistleblower testimony during recent Congressional hearings.

OVNI, fantômes, expériences de mort imminente et mentalisme : en mars 2026, Toulouse va plonger dans l'étrange. Pendant deux jours, un salon entièrement dédié au paranormal promet de bousculer les certitudes et d'attiser toutes les curiosités !

Et si le temps d'un week-end, on acceptait de mettre la rationalité de côté ? Les 13 et 14 mars 2026, Toulouse accueillera la deuxième édition du Salon & Spectacles du Paranormal, et pour en profiter direction le Sing Sing, transformé pour l'occasion. Au programme : conférences, débats, témoignages et spectacles, le tout porté par des experts, enquêteurs, écrivains et scientifiques. Le public est invité à participer, questionner, débattre. Bref, à se faire son propre avis sur ce qui dépasse (ou non) notre compréhension.

Tout au long du week-end, les visiteurs pourront assister à des échanges autour de thèmes aussi fascinants que controversés : expériences de mort imminente, phénomènes OVNI, enquêtes sur les apparitions ou encore contacts avec l'au-delà. Des sujets qui divisent, intriguent, parfois dérangent… mais qui ne laissent jamais indifférent. Certaines séances promettent même des expériences en direct entre voyances collectives et contacts défunt. De quoi faire frissonner la salle entière, même les plus sceptiques !



Des spectacles d'hypnose et de mentalisme viendront ponctuer le programme, et côté expositions, impossible de passer à côté du célèbre spécimen de Roswell, présenté comme un symbole mythique de la vie extraterrestre. À cela s'ajoute un musée de l'étrange et cabinet de curiosités, réunissant près de 150 objets insolites et artefacts mystérieux. Astrologues, médiums, cartomanciens et enquêteurs spécialisés seront également présents, tout comme de nombreux exposants et auteurs du milieu paranormal. Autant dire que les discussions risquent de se prolonger bien après la sortie...

Smaller cousins of our Sun could be harbouring their own extraterrestrial life

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Scientists have assembled a catalogue of more than 2,000 stars that could be supporting alien life.

Researchers behind the study hope that it could provide a foundation for the study of those stars, and examination of whether they might support alien worlds. Eventually, the stars and the planets around them could be the target of spacecraft sent from Earth, they suggested.

It is a full accounting of so-called K dwarfs, which are lower-mass cousins of our own Sun that could be harbouring their own inhabited planets.

They are common throughout space, and offer a long-term and stable environment that could nourish life on the worlds that surround them.

The new study brings together more than 2,000 of those stars, all of which are closer than 130 light years from us.

It was conducted using two observatories, one in the Chilean Andes and another in souther Arizona. Since they are located on two hemispheres, they can get a full look at the sky around us, letting us see all of those K-dwarfs.

Stars vary widely in mass and temperature. The K dwarfs are cooler and fainter than our Sun but are more common – in our patch of space, there are roughly twice of them as Sun-like stars – and they live much longer, meaning that they could be a more likely place to find other civilisations.

In the study, researchers were able to estimate how hot and old the stars were, as well as how fast they are spinning and the way they are moving through space. That information can be used to begin to work out the conditions on the planets around the stars.

The work is described in a new paper, ‘An All-Sky Spectroscopic Reconnaissance of More Than 2,100 K Dwarfs Within 40 Parsecs Using High-Resolution Spectra', that was presented in a conference this week.

Advanced aliens could be chatting with each other using light flashes in plain sight, similar to how fireflies communicate, according to a new study that could lead to new approaches in finding extraterrestrial civilisations.

Until now, astronomers have mainly been trying to detect advanced aliens by looking for odd radio signals from distant planets and peculiar heat signatures indicative of advanced technology.

However, this approach may have a human-centric bias, ie, trying to understand ET entities through a distinctly human lens, and may not account for potential civilisations which could be completely different from ours, say researchers from the Arizona State University.

In the new thought experiment, they propose a whole new way in which advanced aliens could potentially be communicating with other ET civilisations.

Fireflies communicate using patterns of light flashes, which stand out from their environment and from other fireflies. Each firefly species has evolved to have flash patterns that are different from others, enabling members of a species to recognise each other.

Even though fireflies do not understand what these flashes convey, their patterns can signal the presence of each firefly and its identity against a noisy natural background.

Similarly, advanced aliens may also be flashing signals in a binary on/off flash pattern, which may not have any specific meaning, but could just stand out from the natural cosmic background of bright stars and galaxies, scientists say.

“Extraterrestrial signals may also be identifiable not by their complexity or decodable content, but by the structural properties of the signal,” researchers write in the yet-to-be peer-reviewed study posted in arXiv.

Scientists developed a firefly-inspired model to explore how intelligent aliens might generate signals that are distinct from their background, but do not carry any decoded meaning.

One of the brightest background objects in the cosmos is a pulsar, which is a spinning neutron star that emits regular pulses of predictable and periodic radio waves.

Researchers simulated signals from about 150 known pulsars and generated an artificial signal that stands out from such a pulsar background.

They also accounted for the energy required to produce such a signal.

This helped scientists estimate the kind of artificial signal most distinct from the pulsar background in space that could be produced by advanced aliens with reasonably low energy.

Scientists found that artificial signals could be generated considerably more distinct from the pulsar population by an advanced alien civilisation.

This means any detectable alien communication doesn't have to be meaningful to us but only needs to be unlikely to happen by chance in nature, researchers say.

“Our model demonstrates that alien signals need not be inherently complicated nor need we decipher their meaning to identify them,” they write.

    The Winchesters are no longer on Netflix. Here's where you can stream them today.
    

Supernatural, the cult classic about two brothers hunting monsters, was a Netflix staple for more than a decade. It arrived back in 2012, and was the home of this popular show for the last 8 years of its run on the CW, with new seasons added shortly after the end of their run on TV. That era has ended, as Netflix's licensing agreement for all 15 seasons has ended and the Winchester brothers have found a new streaming home. 

The final episode of Supernatural, which starred Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean Winchester, siblings who are paranormal investigators and demon hunters, aired on Nov. 19, 2020. This means those five years are up and the show has officially left the platform. You know how sometimes you take things for granted without even realizing it? Supernatural on Netflix is one of those instances when you don't truly appreciate what you have until it's taken away.

Before you panic and decide to make a crossroads deal to watch your favorite show, take a deep breath. Supernatural is still available to stream. Peacock has all 15 seasons available to watch right now. 

If you don't subscribe to Peacock, Amazon Prime also has all 15 seasons. You can stream it, or buy it outright for $0.48 an episode or $8 a season. It's also on Apple TV and Fandango Now, where prices range from $10 to $25 a season.

Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.

While there is no deal available at the moment for Peacock, we encourage you to stay on the lookout for streaming deals which do pop up occasionally. However, there are other ways to get Peacock Premium at no — or low — cost if you're savvy.","{'href': 'https://www.cnet.com', 'title': 'CNET'}","other"

													By Robert Scucci
						 | Updated 34 seconds ago 

One of the reasons I've spent recent years latching onto the analog horror trend on YouTube is how the genre uses liminal space to generate unease. Series like The Backrooms and The Mandela Catalogue thrive because of the unsettling atmospheres they occupy, and films like Skinamarink are so sparsely decorated that they let your imagination do most of the heavy lifting. The problem is that there aren't a ton of feature-length films that really use liminal space to its fullest potential. At least, that's what I thought before feasting my eyes on 1974's Messiah of Evil. 

I have to give credit where it's due, as I first heard about Messiah of Evil after running a YouTube search for “Liminal Horror.” That rabbit hole led me to a channel called Nightmare Movies, which sold me on streaming the film after breaking it down so succinctly.

If you're a fan of liminal horror and you've slept on Messiah of Evil like I had, it's in your best interest to check it out on Tubi. It's streaming there for free, and it will take you to a strange place in the uncanny valley that threatens to swallow you whole.

I'm only going to touch on the most basic plot elements that Messiah of Evil has to offer, because the story is only half the battle here. The main thread follows Arletty Lang (Marianna Hill), who travels to the small beach town of Point Dune in hopes of reconnecting with her estranged father, Joseph (Royal Dano). Joseph is a troubled artist who has lived in the town for years, but has become increasingly unstable as of late.

Arletty discovers letters from her father addressed to her that warn of a plague overtaking Point Dune. These writings also describe the increasingly vivid nightmares Joseph has been experiencing, which slowly bleed into something far more ominous.

During her stay, Arletty encounters Thom (Michael Greer) and his two companions, Toni (Joy Bang) and Laura (Anitra Ford). While talking at Thom's motel, they have a run-in with a local vagrant named Charlie, who warns them about an upcoming blood moon. According to Charlie, this event marks the 100-year anniversary of the appearance of an entity known as the Dark Stranger, which ties directly into Joseph's paranoid letters.

After Charlie ominously claims that her father is “one of them now,” Arletty's curiosity turns into alarm, pushing her to dig deeper into what's actually happening in Point Dune.

Messiah of Evil's surface-level horror comes from the zombie-like trance the residents of Point Dune fall into as the film escalates. People who appear perfectly normal are suddenly shown feasting on raw meat in grocery stores, only to snap into pursuit once they spot someone who hasn't turned. For me, the liminal spaces these moments take place in make Messiah of Evil genuinely horrifying.

I've always found empty versions of places that are meant to be crowded to be among the most unsettling settings imaginable, and Messiah of Evil fully commits to that idea. Gas stations, Ralphs grocery stores, movie theaters, and other familiar third places feel menacing specifically because of their emptiness as Arletty searches for answers about her father. Joseph's artwork lurking in the background makes you hypervigilant as a viewer, never quite sure whether those paintings are playing tricks on your eyes or watching you back.

There's a constant sense that something is wrong just outside the frame. Much of that dread forms in your own head rather than being spelled out for you. The imagery does the heavy lifting here, not the exposition, which is why the specifics of the plot in Messiah of Evil matter far less than its cinematography and overall delivery.

Messiah of Evil feels like that figure you think you see standing in your doorway as you drift off to sleep, when you're not entirely sure if it's a shadow on the wall or someone watching you. For nearly its entire runtime, the film sustains that feeling. The zombie attacks are just an added bonus.

Messiah of Evil, which is currently streaming for free on streaming services like, Tubi, PlutoTV, and Hoopla, is one of those movies that rewards multiple viewings. Watch it once for the general storyline, then revisit it purely for the liminal nightmare it occupies and thrives in.

In Old 40K, the Psychic Phase was a crazy time where some powers defined the game.   Let's look at some of the old Psychic Spells and see if they would even still be an issue today.



Goatboy here and there was a time in the older editions that a game hinged on a 2d6.  The old Psychic phase was such a crazy time where some spells would just define the game.  There were also times where a double 1 would cause such a catastrophic set of damage through your army that you could just lose the game there.  Or your opponent would just “counter” your spell with a higher roll than you.  Let's look at some of the old Psychic Spells and see if they would even still be an issue now in the current landscape of neoprene mats and piles of rerolls.

The modern game has really tried to move away from back breaking psychic spells. They are now more of a “bonus” to the unit they join and sometimes a Mortal wound gun.  These “spells” are no longer the back breaking interaction that would wreck a tabletop.  Or the psychic spell that would cover that able in Daemons you summoned from the warp.  There was a dark time when you had to come to the table with an extra 500-1000 points that you would summon.   Let's look at 3 crazy psychic powers I remember from different editions and some stories of the terrible things I did with them or against them.



Rune Priest successfully passes a Psychic Test for the spell and draws a 24” line directly from the Rune priest.  Every model underneath the line has to pass an Initiative test and if they fail they will be removed from the table.  A roll of a 6 is always a failure as the Initiative test wants you to roll at or under your Initiative.  Monsters get a +1 to their roll due to their strength and flyers ignore this.

As you can tell this was a spell designed to hit the slow moving Tyranid monsters that were plaguing the table tops at that time.  You would drop pod in a Rune Priest or two from Drop Pods and watch as you crisscrossed their lines with giant cracks in the earth.  If you got lucky you would kill some of the big monsters as all the Tyranids were rocking a 1 initiative so they only passed on a 1 or 2.  I remember using it to pinpoint and kill some characters as well as anything that passed under the line had to take a test.

It was a pretty gnarly spell that I used heavily with my Space Goats army that masqueraded as Space Wolves.  They would come down in our glued shut Drop Pods and your little Rune Priest would ruin the Tyranid players day as a bunch of giant monsters fell into the pit.  I think any spell that is basically an instant death for big things would probably be pretty nutty even today and glad we don't see spells like this now.



This is a Blessing that is a WC 2 (need two successes on WC dice) that targets a friendly unit within 24” and makes it where you can only hit the unit on Snapshots (6's to hit) and cannot target them with Templates or Blast weapons.  This would also work in the Assault Phase of the game and was the cornerstone of the Deathstar edition that was 7th edition.

Heck I remember games defined by if I could get off Invisibility on my Deathstar unit or at the very least stop the opponent from casting it on theirs.  You would watch as these units would become unstoppable as the game wasn't dominated by piles of rerolls and units throwing out 30+ dice in an activation.

Heck this edition was so dominated by the interaction of causing Snapshots or only being hit by Snapshots like those things that flew in the air.  I played a crap ton of Chaos Daemon lists that worked on overpowering four Daemon Princes and causing havoc as they flew around the table top.  I don't know if this ability would be completely broken right now just due to the nature of rerolls and piles of attacks but it does represent a dark period of time in 40K.



This was a blessing power that would power up a unit within 24” of the caster. Each edition has seen this change as it was always a major factor of powering up the Aeldari units in some way.  One edition would grant the unit the Reroll Failed Saves ability and another would give the unit a 5+ Feel No Pain.  Both of these are very powerful and worth the chance when playing with them.

I would say the reroll saves would be busted in this current edition and the Feel No Pain would be extremely powerful.  In fact I would say both don't need to be in the game and would dominate things in a very frustrating way especially with things like tough Wraithguard units or even just annoying biker options.  Heck some of the Aspect Warriors would be busted too if they could reroll saves or even get a 5+ feel no pain.

These Psychic powers are not even touching some of the issues from the old Psychic phase – especially the default disciplines we used to play with back in 7th edition.  We'll leave that talk for a later time when players had to roll up to the table top with a pile of Daemons that would get summoned from your Space Marine Librarian.  Oh the old editions – how balanced were they actually?

What was your most dreaded Psychic Power of past editions?

This week on Hysteria 51, we're boarding a flight straight into chaos—because one United Airlines flight reportedly had to divert after a passenger disrupted the crew, turning “in-flight service” into “in-flight survival mode.” If you've ever wondered how quickly a routine trip can become an unexpected emergency landing plot twist, buckle up and keep your hands, feet, and sense of reality inside the cabin at all times, even if you swear this is “A Simulation!”

Then we hop over to Thailand for a story that's basically a modern fable: a fortune teller, a stolen phone, and the kind of irony that makes you stare directly into the camera like you're on The Office. When your job is seeing the future… but you don't see that coming? That's premium weird news.

It's bizarre headlines, travel nightmares, and criminally funny timing—the perfect episode for fans of strange-but-true stories, oddball crime, and “how is this real life?” energy.

What would happen if strangers had a meetup to share all of their bizarre conspiracy theories at a Delaware convention? 

That's the plot of the Delaware-based mockumentary film ""The Conspiracists,"" which will have a world premiere at The Grand in Wilmington on Jan. 8. Then the feature-length film lands on Amazon Prime and Verizon Fios streaming services Jan. 9.  

The screening event at the historic theater at The Grand will feature a red carpet experience and a Q&A with the cast and filmmakers.   

""The Conspiracists"" stars Wilmington actors Terrie Lynne (from Broadway's ""The Book of Mormon"") and Christopher Murray, who portray the siblings Daisey and Eric. The sister and brother have big plans to create an all-inclusive convention for conspiracy theorists named Con Con, where they can all coexist with different ideas. But drama soon ensues.

Executive producer Chris Bruce owns King Creative, a Wilmington-based production company in the city he calls home. The film is lighthearted and intended for fans of ""The Office,"" he said. But there's also substance at the root of this film about conspiracies.  

""I think it's something that sort of has a great message for especially the world the way it is right now,"" Bruce said.  

""It's important that we're able to kind of get along and, you know, we don't always have to have the same beliefs, the same idea, the same thoughts. But we can still have the opportunity to come together ... and bond over these things, and to have conversations and to respect one another,"" he added. 

In the Con Con scene, fans will see a special cameo from Jamie Pagliei, the viral sports fan from Delco better known by his 129,000 Instagram followers as @ThePhillySportsGuy. Pagliei is the super Philly fan who paints his face silver and rocks a green mohawk at Eagles games. 

""He's just the most committed fan there is in the world,"" Bruce said about The Philly Sports Guy. ""I don't think there's a more recognizable fan at this point."" 

""The Conspiracists"" is presented by Uncultured Swine and the Wilmington-based King Creative. Michael Perrie Jr. of Virginia directed the film, which he wrote with his wife, Lacy Reilly. 

The film features actors from around the Mid-Atlantic region, including Delawarean co-leads Lynne (an alum of Cab Calloway) and Christopher Murray, along with Guy Wellman from Newark, who is an alum at the University of Delaware.  

Executive producers Edward Layfield (an alum of Cab Calloway) and his wife, Beatriz Naranjo, are based in New York City, but Layfield was born in Delaware. Bruce, another executive producer, is a UD grad. 

Bruce said the film was shot almost entirely in Delaware, with locations such as Wilmington's Hotel du Pont and The Grand, Delaware Tire Center in Newark, plus the Precious Paws in Elsmere. ""We transformed that into 'Bark Ruffalo,' which has a tie to [actor] Mark Ruffalo.""  

The Havre de Grace Decoy Museum in Maryland is the only location in the film that's not in the First State. 

The Siegel JCC in Talleyville is where Con Con is held. The producer said it was incredible creating a fictitious convention with movie magic. 

The film producer is stoked about the idea of having a world premiere at The Grand and streaming on big platforms like Amazon and Verizon Fios. From there, he said the plan is to hopefully crank out more films and bring more attention to the state as a film destination.   

""At the end of the day, we just hope people laugh. We hope people have fun with us and get lost in this world of 'The Conspiracists' that we've created,"" Bruce said. ""You know, celebrate a movie that was made in Delaware, which is super fun."" 

In addition to introducing fans to a fictitious conspiracy con, the producer mentioned they've kicked around the idea of officially launching Con Con in the state, before the end of this year.  

""We hope that maybe we can bring Con Con to life for real,"" he said, ""and we want to show the world that Delaware has a lot to offer from a film making standpoint."" 

The Grand (818 N. Market St., Wilmington) at 8 p.m. Jan. 8. Tickets are $25. Visit thegrandwilmington.org or call (302) 652-5577. 

(This story has been updated to fix an inaccuracy. Chris Bruce is an executive producer of 'The Conspiracists.')

An international project investigating the form, content and consequences of online conspiracy theories has found that in German-speaking countries, such theories often originate locally and have come to form a complex ecosystem of alternative news websites, print media and parts of the political spectrum.

This is one of the key conclusions of the Researching Europe, Digitalization and Conspiracy Theories project (REDACT), which wound up in October 2025 after a three-year collaboration between researchers across the continent. The part of the study covering Germany, Austria, and Switzerland was led by Professor Michael Butter from the English Department at the University of Tübingen. King's College London coordinated the project, which involved regional teams in the United Kingdom, the Baltic States, the Balkans, and central Europe.

The Tübingen research team found that not all conspiracy theories are equally dangerous. ""However, the German-language debate on conspiracy theories is often alarmist and one-sided. This sometimes has a negative impact on the many projects aimed at combating conspiracy theories,"" says Butter.

A conspiracy theory is an attempt to explain a fact or event as a conspiracy, in other words, as the actions of a person or persons pursuing goals that are contrary to the interests of the general public. Conspiracy theories have a long history in German-speaking countries, but had been pushed to the margins of society by the mid-20th century, only gaining mass exposure once large numbers of people began using the internet. The REDACT project took a close look at one of today's most widespread theories, the Great Replacement theory, which claims the existing population is being replaced by mass immigration.

""Conspiracy theories shouldn't be lumped together with disinformation and fake news,"" says Butter. ""They aren't simply misinformation that can be corrected by facts. Conspiracy theories have an identity-forming effect on those who believe them, giving them a sense of belonging."" As a result, followers of conspiracy theories are very attached to them.

Researchers in the REDACT project first identified keywords which led them to posts on common conspiracy theories. They then collected six million relevant posts from the social media platforms Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, and Telegram from the years 2019 to 2024.

""We initially analyzed these using quantitative methods, then qualitative ones, including methods from literary studies that capture the meaning of the text in all its nuances,"" says Mara Precoma, a doctoral student on the project.

In their home countries, the regional teams also conducted interviews with members of various organizations dedicated to combating conspiracy theories and disinformation. These included government institutions, such as the Federal Agency for Civic Education in Germany, as well as initiatives and associations advising and supporting family members and friends of people who subscribe to conspiracy theories. The interviews sought to analyze the scope of the work and the measures these organizations implemented.

Butter says there is no single model to fully explain conspiracy theories; nor is there a universal recipe for containing the damage they cause in society.

""Our analysis of the issue in German-speaking countries showed that some improvement is needed in the framework of institutions working to counter conspiracy theories and in their efforts. Some projects are based on outdated assumptions, but most importantly, they receive funding that is too short-term and inflexible, and they have to spend too much time on reports and bureaucracy,"" he says.

Butter and Precoma have set out recommendations for tackling conspiracy theories, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches: models or solutions from other countries should not be adopted uncritically, the researchers say, ""It is also important that the adoption of a conspiracy theory should be seen as a symptom of a complex social situation, not as its cause.""

""If we want to combat conspiracy theories, we have to identify and address the underlying causes,"" says Precoma, adding: ""In Germany, many projects against conspiracy theories target high school students. Similar programs should now be developed for other types of schools and for older people, as they are particularly susceptible to conspiracy theories.""

""The University of Tübingen sees it as its mission to examine socially relevant topics. Research such as that conducted in the REDACT project makes an important contribution to understanding the mechanisms behind social phenomena and developing effective strategies for open, fact-based communication,"" says University of Tübingen president, Professor Karla Pollmann.

If You Call Them, They Will Come: Three True CE-5 Cases with Humanoids



      by Preston Dennett
    


      Have you ever called down a UFO? There are many different kinds of UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, onboard experiences, telepathic communication and more. Cases can be broken down into various categories such as close encounters of the first, second, third and fourth kind. And then there are close encounters of the fifth kind, or human-initiated encounters. This unique and profound category can contain all the other types of encounters, but is differentiated from them because these encounters themselves are the result of humans reaching out to ETs. Cases like these are important because they show that we can have an interactive relationship with the UFO phenomenon and the ETs. This video presents three extensive true cases of CE-5 contact that went beyond simple sightings and resulted in actual face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials.
    


      SOMETHING NOT OF THIS EARTH. In June of 1996, Jeneva had a fight with her boyfriend and drove up to a remote location in the mountains of Santa Clarita, California to meditate and seek answers about the many issues in her life. Depressed, she screamed out to the skies, “Why is life so crappy?! Why am I here?!” At that moment, a brilliant light appeared behind a distant mountain and moved towards her. After several minutes, it was close enough that she could see it wasn't a helicopter, plane or conventional object. In fact, it was almost totally silent. Then it hovered directly overhead and beamed her with light. Thinking she was going to be abducted, Jeneva collapsed to the ground and trembled with fear. The beam retracted, but the strange, brilliant light remained overhead, making a soft buzzing noise. Was it a UFO? An angel? A spirit? She wasn't sure. But it wasn't going away. Jeneva had never been so scared in her life, but when the object stayed there, her fear began to pass. And when the object moved closer, Jeneva began to speak to it. Before long, her fear left completely and she realized that the UFO was not going to hurt her. In fact, the whole experience became deeply moving and spiritually transformative. The object remained there all night long, communing with Jeneva for several hours, and totally lifting her out of her depression. When sunrise finally arrived, the object accelerated away in a split second. Jeneva, however, was forever changed. She became deeply interested in UFOs and searched for answers about her encounter. She began learning about such subjects as remote viewing and spirituality. She also began having very vivid dreams of being onboard a UFO. She went back to the same spot, hoping to have a repeat experience, but the UFO never returned. She was shocked to see that someone had painted three grays at that spot! And, years later, the UFO came back. But only after Jeneva asked. Her experiences are a poignant example of a human-initiated UFO encounter. 
    


      A LOVE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. Hector Sawiak (a bank manager, professor, and pilot) had never seen a UFO. He had always wondered if they were real and what kind of technology they had, but he was only slightly interested in them. But in March 2015, he heard that there had been recent sightings near his home in San Juan, Argentina. So he decided to go out hiking outside the city and try to have an encounter. Unfortunately, nothing showed up. But that night, after going to sleep, something very strange happened: he woke up to hear his name being called telepathically, in his head. He jumped up and went to the window just in time to see a brilliant UFO streak across the sky. He was amazed, particularly because he had been woken up by someone calling his name. Could it have been the UFO occupants? A few months later, Hector was sleeping in bed when the room filled with brilliant light. Waking up, he was terrified to see two tall extraterrestrial beings standing in the doorway. They were slender, with dark eyes and large bald heads, and wore olive-green jumpsuits with red cuffs, collars, and belts. “Don't be afraid,” the ETs said. “We are not going to hurt you.” Hector's fear evaporated and instead, he felt “a love like never before.” One of the beings approached his bedside, cradled his head in his arms and said, “I have come to heal you.” Hector cried with intense joy and gratitude as the ETs gave him a strange pill and instructed him to swallow it, which he did. He said it was very bitter. The next thing he knew, it was morning and he was waking up. But he could still feel his tears on his cheeks. He was also nauseous from the pill. The experience hadn't been a dream. The ETs had come into his room. And his life would never be the same.
    


      IN THE COMPANY OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS. It was April 2015 when 14-year-old Abdiel sat in his living room and stumbled on the TV show, Hangar One, all about UFOs. The subject immediately intrigued him. UFOs were real? He could hardly believe it. If they were real, he thought, he wanted to see one. He couldn't stop thinking about it. Then, one week later, Abdiel was in his backyard playing around with a soccer ball when a bright light caught his eye. He looked up and watched a golden-yellow object move across the sky. It was a UFO! As it disappeared, a black helicopter appeared in the sky, apparently chasing the UFO. Abdiel was amazed. He had just expressed a desire to see a UFO one week earlier, and then one had appeared. That couldn't be a coincidence. He now found himself suddenly interested in psychic abilities and other similar subjects. After studying them for a few years, his interest in making contact increased. Shortly later he had another sighting. This was followed by strange knocks on the window of his home and a mysteriously blinking kitchen light. Shortly later, going out into his backyard, he was amazed to see a strange circle in the grass. It looked just as if a UFO had landed there. This was followed by another strange mark in the grass that looked very much like the portrait of an ET head. Could the ETs be trying to contact with him? A few days later, Abdiel got his answer. Going into his backyard to inspect the strange marks on his lawn, he saw movement and was shocked to observe a strange humanoid run across his yard. It was short, brown in color, with a large triangular-shaped bald head and big, dark, round eyes. It moved with incredible speed. Hector was amazed. It was an ET. And soon, more sightings would follow, and this time, his camera was ready and was able to get some amazing photographic evidence. Now he knew UFOs and ETs were real. He had reached out to them, and they answered.
    


      These three cases all qualify as close encounters of the fifth kind. In each case, people reached out to the ETs and received a dramatic unmistakable response. These cases show just how closely extraterrestrials are watching over all of us, and that if a person asks for contact, they can initiate their own encounter and experience the UFO phenomenon firsthand.
    


If You Call Them, They Will Come: Three True CE-5 Cases with Humanoids



      The question of the most convincing UFO sighting ever recorded is complex and often depends on individual belief and the nature of the evidence. However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples:
    


      Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail.
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature.
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting."" - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee.
    


      Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling.
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



Corroboration: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



Triangular Craft Sighting: [""I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/

            They went from the palace to the big house.
    


            Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, can reasonably expect two things to happen as they get accustomed to their new day-to-day life at the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York: They will be uncomfortable and kept out of harm's way.
    


            “It truly is hell,” federal prison consultant Sam Mangel told CNN. “There is very little HVAC. There is very little heating. Every inmate gets one wool blanket. They're on a very thin 2-inch mattress pillow combination on a metal slab.”
    


            The ousted Venezuelan president and first lady are the latest high-profile detainees to be held in the federal jail known as MDC, with a documented history of power outages, staffing shortages and detainee complaints.
    


            CNN could not determine precisely how the couple is being treated. Neither prison officials nor lawyers representing the couple responded to requests for comment.
    


            Mangel as well as a former federal prisons official and a defense attorney with clients housed at MDC told CNN of the prison's challenging conditions and how high-profile detainees are typically handled in such an environment.
    


What it's like inside the infamous jail where Venezuela's former president Nicolás Maduro is being held



            The federal Bureau of Prisons doesn't comment on current inmates, but Mangel said Maduro and Flores are likely housed in a segregated area, not with the general population — in separate cells and alone.
    


            “His case, he is a security risk in general population,” Mangel said. “No one knows what other inmates might think of him, other gang members, other cartel members, so putting him in general population at any time … I think would be tremendous security risk for the facility.”
    


            Before their US military capture on Saturday, the couple had lived at Miraflores Palace, a sprawling presidential residence known for its neoclassical architecture, large windows, grand halls and manicured courtyards.
    


            They are now among detainees who include a mix of suspects and defendants, including people accused of serious crimes, high-profile cases, and others awaiting sentencing or transfer.
    


            In their first court appearance in New York Monday, Maduro and Flores pleaded not guilty to drug and weapons charges and chose, at least for now, not to fight their detention.
    


            The judge informed the couple that “as citizens of the state of Venezuela, you have a right to consult with consular officials of that state.” The prosecutor said he would look into that, and the judge said to get back to him on “when and where it will happen.”
    


            Maduro and his wife probably have no regular contact with each other, unless both have scheduled their meetings with their attorneys at the same time, said Hugh Hurwitz, who ran the Bureau of Prisons from May 2018 to August 2019.
    


            In the meantime, Maduro could possibly spend his time in a small recreational area within the jail, an area that would be much smaller than it would be in a larger facility, Hurwitz said.
    


            Hurwitz made his assessments based on his experience as acting director of the federal prison system.
    


            The life of inmates segregated from the general population includes a 6 a.m. wake-up call, with time scheduled to meet their attorneys daily, outdoor exercise five hours a week, and daily visits by health personnel, according to the Bureau of Prisons handbook.
    


            Inmates in the jail's Special Housing Unit, known as the SHU, where it's likely Maduro is being housed, are kept in solitary confinement under restrictive conditions, Daniel McGuinness, a criminal defense and civil rights litigation attorney who represents several clients housed at MDC, told CNN.
    


            Inmates spend up to 23 hours locked down inside their cells with restrictive escort protocols in place when they do move outside of them, and have limited access to legal phone calls, according to a Justice Department report.
    


            “I don't know whether they're locking him in his cell 23 hours a day …  but no doubt he's in a secure unit where nobody can access him,”  Hurwitz said. “I'm sure they're keeping him separated from other inmates. If they are putting him with anybody, it's somebody that they've vetted and know is not going to be a problem.”
    


            Indeed, MDC, described by attorneys and inmates alike as “disgusting” with “horrifying” conditions, is a dangerous place, where in 2024 two inmates were killed by fellow inmates using makeshift weapons, according to federal prosecutors.
    


            Hurwitz expects that the security protocols in place are with the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein top of mind.
    


Epstein died by suicide in 2019 at another pretrial detention center in Manhattan that has since closed.
    


            “They can't afford to have another Epstein incident,” Hurwitz said.

US President Donald Trump has sparked a controversy by claiming that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought his help to facilitate faster deliveries of dozens of Apache helicopters that India ordered from the US. Speaking at the House GOP Member Retreat on Tuesday, Trump claimed that India had ordered 68 Apache attack helicopters and faced a delay in delivery. “I had India coming to me and [saying] “we have been waiting for five years. We are changing it. India ordered 68 Apaches, and Prime Minister Modi came to me and said ‘Sir, can I please see you please?” Trump said. While Indian politicians and commenters found Trump's “condescending tone” for Modi as “demeaning,” Indian media was quick to fact-check the statement, noting that India had only ordered 28 Apaches in several tranches. 

pic.twitter.com/7K5XMIwmxo“India ordered Apache helicopters and didn't get them for 5 years. PM Modi came to me and said ‘Sir can I please see you?' His condescending tone for India's PM is demeaning. The GoI's silence to all his insulting statements is bizarre because it reflects…

“It takes too long to get them... I had India come up to me saying they've been waiting 5 years. India ordered 68 Apache helicopters. PM Modi came to see me,” claimed Donald Trump. As per reports, India has ordered a total of 28 Apache helicopters in total, and they have all… pic.twitter.com/FUya7txLGU

The Times of India, citing a review of official contracts, delivery records, and deployment details, reported that New Delhi has acquired only 28 Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters through multiple deals. 

The first contract, worth around $2.2 billion, was signed in September 2015, in the final months of the Obama administration, for 22 Apaches for the Indian Air Force (IAF). Deliveries were completed by 2020, during Trump's first term.

A separate deal covered six helicopters for the Indian Army Aviation Corps. This contract experienced significant delivery delays. According to the report, the final three helicopters were delivered in December of last year. Meanwhile, speaking on Tuesday, Trump also claimed that he has good relationship with Modi, although the Indian prime minister was “not happy” with him over the 50% tariff imposed by the US on the South Asian nation over its purchases of Russian oil. “I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi, but he is not happy with me as India is paying high tariffs. But now they have reduced it very substantially, buying oil from Russia,” he added. India was slapped with unprecedented tariffs as it has so far been unable to reach a trade deal with Washington. Negotiations are still ongoing. On Monday, Trump threatened to further raise tariffs if India continued to buy oil from Russia. 

Trump previously stated on several occasions that he had brokered the ceasefire between India and Pakistan following the two countries' military stand-off last year. New Delhi has denied the US role in stopping the hostilities.

            Fossils unearthed in Morocco from a little-understood period of human evolution may help scientists resolve a long-standing mystery: Who came before us?
    


            Three jawbones, including one from a child, teeth, vertebrae and a femur were unearthed from a cave known as Grotte à Hominidés in Thomas Quarry in Casablanca, Morocco, dating back 773,000 years. They are intriguing to scientists because they are the first hominin fossils from this period to have been discovered in Africa.
    


            “There are a lot of fossil hominins in Africa until about a million years ago, but then after that there is a jump to around 500,000 years ago, and in this gap we have almost nothing,” said Jean-Jacques Hublin, an author of the study that published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature.



            “It is extremely exciting to have fossils right in the middle of this gap,” added Hublin, a paleoanthropologist at Collège de France and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.
    


            CT scans and analysis of the fossils' features revealed an ancestor who had a “mosaic” of primitive and more evolved features. For example, it didn't have a defined chin, unlike Homo sapiens, but the teeth and other dental features were quite similar to those of our own species and Neanderthals.
    


            Most of the fossils were unearthed in 2008 and 2009, but they were definitively dated much more recently, Hublin noted, using a technique known as paleomagnetism, which detects the geological signature of a reversal of the Earth's magnetic field in certain minerals with magnetic properties.
    


            The strength of Earth's magnetic field fluctuates, and, at times, the magnetic north and south poles have flipped. The research team found that the layer where the fossils were found coincided with the Matuyama-Brunhes transition, a well-known chronological marker that dates to 773,000 years ago and was the most recent major polar reversal.
    


            Study coauthor Serena Perini, a geologist and paleomagnetist at Italy's University of Milan, said in a statement the technique allowed the team to “anchor the presence of these hominins within an exceptionally precise chronological framework.”
    


            The world's earliest known Homo sapiens remains have also been found in Morocco at a site known as Jebel Irhoud, and they date to 400,000 years ago. However, Hublin said it would be incorrect to regard this region as the exact place our species emerged. More likely, it was a result of geological conditions in the region that allow fossils to be preserved particularly well.
    


            Hublin noted that the cave these individuals called home would have been a dangerous place. The leg bone was covered in bite marks from a predator, most likely a hyena, and there was much evidence that carnivores occupied the cave.
    


            The newly described fossils are important because they shed light on the ancestral species of the three types of human that lived most recently: Neanderthals, Denisovans and, of course, Homo sapiens, the only surviving human species.
    


            Neanderthals and Denisovans are thought to have gone extinct around 40,000 years ago, although the timing is less clear for Denisovans, a shadowy population first identified in 2010.
    


            The last common ancestor of the three human groups — sometimes dubbed ancestor x — is an “elusive figure,” according to Antonio Rosas, a researcher in the department of paleobiology at the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid.
    


            “Debate over which fossils might represent this crucial evolutionary node persists, and correctly identifying this ancestor is essential for understanding the directions of subsequent evolutionary change,” Rosas, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a commentary published alongside the new research.
    


Genetic evidence suggested that this ancestor lived around 550,000 to 765,000 years ago before splitting into three separate sister species, the study noted, but it's not clear what the ancestral species was or where it lived.
    


            Candidates include Homo antecessor, a group of fossils found in a cave in Atapuerca, Spain, that dates to roughly the same time as the Moroccan fossils, and a species known as Homo heidelbergensis, fossils of which have been found in Africa and Eurasia.
    


Historical mysteries solved by science in 2025



            While the researchers stopped short of assigning the Moroccan fossils a formal scientific name, Hublin said the remains resembled another species called Homo erectus but also appeared to be close ancestors of modern humans.
    


            “The question, then, becomes whether populations of Homo erectus directly gave rise to everything, including humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans, or whether there is a traceable lineage with observable changes along the way,” said Ryan McRae, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, who wasn't involved in the research, via email.
    


            Carrie Mongle, an assistant professor in the department of anthropology at Stony Brook University, said the new research emphasized the importance of Africa for understanding the emergence of modern humans.
    


            “Any hominin fossil from this critical time period makes for an exciting new window into human evolution,” said Mongle, who also wasn't a study author, via email.

            Nick Reiner made no plea Wednesday in a Los Angeles courtroom, where he was expected to be arraigned on murder charges in connection with the fatal stabbing of his parents, Hollywood director Rob Reiner and photographer Michele Singer Reiner. Instead, Reiner's high-profile attorney, Alan Jackson, asked the judge's permission to withdraw as counsel and a public defender took over, asking for a later arraignment date.
    


            Asked whether he agreed, Reiner said, “Yeah, I agree with your honor on that.” Jackson was seen earlier introducing the public defender to Reiner in the courtroom.
    


            The 32-year-old's arraignment is now set for February 23.
    


            Reiner is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in connection with the fatal stabbing of his parents last month after he was arrested December 14. He also faces a special allegation that he used a knife, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.
    


            The charges carry a penalty of life in prison without parole or the death penalty, though prosecutors have not decided whether to seek the death penalty in the case.
    


            In court, Reiner was wearing brown prison overalls over a white T-shirt, his hair closely cropped. He chatted calmly with his lawyers before proceedings began, from the window-lined box reserved for defendants in the courtroom. He cracked a slight smile while talking with a court employee.
    


            Judge Theresa McGonigle allowed a camera in court, but with orders not to film Reiner at the request of Reiner's legal team.
    


            Outside the courthouse Wednesday, Jackson said circumstances beyond his or Reiner's control “made it impossible for us to continue our representation of Nick.” He added he is legally and ethically prohibited from explaining the decision further.
    


            Jackson said his team is still committed to Reiner and his best interests.
    


            “We've investigated this matter top to bottom, back to front. What we've learned, and you can take this to the bank, is that, pursuant to the laws of this state, pursuant to the law in California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder,” he said.
    


            The Los Angeles County Public Defender's team said they learned Tuesday the case would be turned over to them. Kimberly Greene, the deputy public defender assigned to the case, said she spoke to Reiner for about 30 seconds Wednesday morning.
    


            “We've had no contact with the family. I don't think they were aware that this was going on,” Greene said, adding it's not uncommon for private counsel to turn cases over to her office.
    


            The Reiner family has “the utmost trust in the legal process and will not comment further on matters related to the legal proceedings,” a family spokesperson told CNN Wednesday.
    


            Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman also spoke outside the courthouse, saying, “We are fully confident that a jury will convict Nick Reiner beyond a reasonable doubt of the brutal murders of his parents, Rob Reiner and Michelle Singer Reiner, and do so unanimously.”
    


            Prosecutors say Reiner stabbed his parents to death in the early hours of Sunday, December 14, in the master bedroom area of the family home in Brentwood, California. He was arrested without a struggle near Downtown Los Angeles that night, about 15 miles from the scene.
    


            A family member had told detectives about Nick's history of addiction, that he'd been living in the guest house at the Reiner home, and that he had argued with his father at Conan O'Brien's holiday party the night before.
    


            Reiner has struggled with addiction since his teens; he spent multiple stints in rehab, explaining to a podcaster he would sometimes stay clean long enough to get out so he could go back to using drugs. He bounced between rehab, some sustained recovery, and relapse for years. Reiner co-wrote a 2015 film about a family struggling with a child's addiction, which his father directed.
    


            He first appeared in court after his arrest during a brief hearing, where he was ordered to be held in custody without bail and did not enter a plea.
    


            Rob and Michele Reiner had three children together – Jake, Romy and Nick. Rob Reiner was also the father of daughter Tracy, 61, whom he adopted during a previous marriage to the celebrated director Penny Marshall.
    


            Jake and Romy Reiner last month wrote in a statement that “words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day.”
    


            “The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends,” the statement read. “We now ask for respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity, and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave.”
    


            Rob Reiner was a beloved figure in Hollywood who was an actor and director throughout his esteemed, decades-long career. His body of work included everything from cult comedies such as “The Princess Bride” to classic rom-coms like “When Harry Met Sally” and the Oscar-nominated legal drama “A Few Good Men.”
    


            His breakout role as an actor came in 1971 when he starred as Mike Stivic, the son-in-law of Archie and Edith Bunker on TV's “All in the Family,” a role for which he earned two Emmy Awards.
    


CNN's Nick Watt and Alli Rosenbloom reported and wrote from Los Angeles, and Lauren Mascarenhas wrote from New York.

Mayor Jacob Frey called the Department of Homeland Security's justification for the killing of a woman during an immigration operation ‘bullshit'

Minnesota woman fatally shot by ICE agent during raid, video shows

At the press conference Frey said he did not yet have the identification of the ICE agent who shot and killed a woman during an enforcement operation today.

At a press conference today, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey characterized the reason by the Department of Homeland Security for killing a woman during a large scale immigration operation as “bullshit”.

“To the family, I'm so deeply sorry,” Frey added. “There's nothing that I can say right now that's going to make you or your relatives, friends of the victim feel any better.”

He went on to issue a sharp message to federal immigration agents in the city.

“Get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here,” he added. “People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart … and now somebody is dead.”

The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, emerged from the closed-door meeting with top administration officials and his lower chamber colleagues about the capture of Nicolás Maduro convinced that there would be “no boots on the ground”.

“We don't anticipate that's going to be necessary,” the speaker said. “We went to apprehend a criminal. We did it with precision. It was justified, and that job has been done. We now hope that the people in Venezuela can govern themselves.”

On the topic of Republican response to any military operation in Greenland, former Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has issued a sharp rebuke of the administration's rhetoric around using force to acquire the territory.

“Threats and intimidation by US officials over American ownership of Greenland are as unseemly as they are counterproductive,” the Kentucky lawmaker said in a statement. “The use of force to seize the sovereign democratic territory of one of America's most loyal and capable allies would be an especially catastrophic act of strategic self-harm to America and its global influence.”

If there's one question that Donald Trump's Republican allies in Congress are struggling to answer these days, it's how to respond to a potential US incursion aimed at taking control of the Danish territory of Greenland.

Consider how North Dakota senator Kevin Cramer responded when pressed by a reporter at the Capitol to answer whether such a military operation would require congressional approval.

“Well, it depends on what they would be doing there, but at this point, there's no intention to do that,” he said.

And yet the White House just days ago issued a statement that sure made it sound like they were contemplating doing whatever was necessary to seize Greeland.

“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it's vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region. The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said.

Further pressed by reporters to weigh in on what seems to be an important question before Congress, Cramer demurred. “I'm not going to take that bait,” he said.

“I'm not going to speak to that hypothetical that's very unlikely to ever come before us.”

When asked about the president's comments that he'd be open to an operation in Colombia, and whether the country's president, Gustavo Petro, “should be expecting Delta Force anytime”, Leavitt didn't offer an answer.

“That would be a very unwise question for me to answer, to weigh into,” she said.

And asked whether Trump is still committed to Nato and the article 5 provision of the alliance's members coming to each other's defense, Leavitt points to Trump's earlier comments on Nato in which he said that “we will always be there for Nato even if they are not there for us”.

(What she didn't say was that Trump also said that Nato was dependent on the US to survive).

Asked again if there are concerns of increased tensions with Russia because of the tanker seizure, and with China over the Venezuela operation, Leavitt says:

The president has very good, open relationships with both President Putin and President Xi. He has spoken with them numerous times … and I believe those personal relationships are going to continue.

But as for the president and the United States, he's going to enforce our policy that's best for the US, and in respect to these ship seizures, that's enforcing the embargo on all dark-fleet vessels that are illegally transporting oil.

Pressed on what the US stands to gain if it were to take control of Greenland, given it already has access to military bases there and can station personnel on the territory and place assets, Leavitt replies:

More control over the Arctic region and ensuring that China and Russia and our adversaries cannot continue their aggression in this very important and strategic region.

Leavitt says: “It's too premature and too early to dictate a timetable for elections in Venezuela right now.”

Leavitt says the US Coast Guard is “escorting” the Sophia vessel – the second oil tanker that was seized in the Caribbean – to the US.

The US is “selectively rolling back sanctions to enable the transport and sale of Venezuelan crude and oil products to the global market”, Leavitt says.

Asked why the US hasn't ruled out military force to acquire Greenland, Leavitt says Greenland is “being actively discussed” by Trump and his national security team and they're talking about what a potential purchase could look like.

Trump, she says, has been clear that the US acquisition of Greenland “would deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region”.

Trump's first option, again, is diplomacy, she adds.

Asked whether the seizure of the Russian-flagged, Venezuelan-linked Bella-1/Marinera oil tanker risked a larger conflict with Russia, Leavitt doesn't answer the question.

She says the vessel was transporting sanctioned oil, and that the US “will enforce all sanctions”.

“The vessel had a judicial seizure order ... so that means the crew is now subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution, if necessary,” she says.

The Kremlin has already responded angrily to the US seizure, saying “no state has the right to use force against ships properly registered in the jurisdictions of other states”. The tanker had received a temporary permit to sail under the Russian flag on 24 December, it said in a statement.

Leavitt is going on about yesterday's report in the New Yorker on JD Vance's “notable absence” from the operation in Venezuela, which asked whether his “exclusion” was down to his “anti-interventionist ideology” or whether it was a political calculation.

Leavitt attacks the report as fake and says the vice-president “has been involved in all policy … including Venezuela policy”. She says he was “read in and deeply involved” in the operation from the beginning.

Asked how the US would ensure oil worker security in Venezuela and whether that could involve troops, Leavitt says that Trump “reserves the right to use the US military if necessary”.

Diplomacy is always the first option, she says, adding that Trump tried that with Nicolás Maduro “but unfortunately he was an illegitimate dictator and unserious person”.

“There is a long-term plan here,” Leavitt adds.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Arson attack that left parts of German capital in darkness for days stirs outrage over infrastructure insecurity

Europe live – latest updates

When Silke Peters bought a crank radio and a camping stove just after the start of Russia's full invasion of Ukraine, her husband thought she was “a little crazy”. “He put me down, only half-jokingly, as a prepper,” she said, referring to the kind of person who stockpiles in case of catastrophe.

For almost four years, the items gathered dust in the cellar of the Peters' two-room flat in Zehlendorf, a well-to-do district of Berlin. But in recent days the windup radio – with its inbuilt torch and charge point – has come into its own during Germany's longest power cut since the second world war.

Leftwing anarchist militants have claimed responsibility for an arson attack on Saturday that cut the electricity to about 45,000 households, almost 2,000 businesses, four hospitals, 74 care homes, 20 schools and a considerable chunk of the public transport network in south-west Berlin.

Federal state prosecutors have taken over the criminal investigation into the saboteurs, Vulkangruppe (Volcano Group), who said their aim was to “turn off the juice of those in power” and to highlight Germany's overdependence on fossil fuels. Aside from some footprints left in the snow, investigators admit they have little to go on so far.

On Wednesday morning the remaining 20,000 households and 850 businesses still without heating or hot water were finally reconnected. But many Germans still feel they are without answers to three vital questions: who was responsible, how could the infrastructure of Europe's largest economy prove so vulnerable, and how can authorities prevent such an attack from happening again?

“What is wrong with this city?” an anguished middle-aged man was heard asking on camera as Berlin's mayor, Kai Wegner, dropped in on a sports hall housing residents on army camp beds. The man's mother, who had been moved out of her nursing home, was lying on one of the beds.

“How is it possible that the power grid is so insecure?” asked Anar, a cleaner in her 60s who was stuck on a train on the outskirts of Berlin on Saturday night, fearing she would be unable to get to her workplace – or be paid. “This has made a lot of people very angry.”

The Red Cross, which came to the aid of thousands this week, has led urgent calls for more investment to be made in domestic civil protection and disaster relief.

This week its members were among those handing out thermal flasks and muesli bars to residents. The army was brought in to distribute diesel to clinics running emergency generators and to help with repairs.

When Berlin's energy and economy senator, Franziska Giffey, turned up on Monday to see the fallout for herself, she could hardly hide her embarrassment. She said the attack was a “serious blow to critical infrastructure”, describing how the perpetrators had set fire to a bridge carrying high-voltage cables and had probably used public maps to select their location.

“You can find a lot of information on the internet,” Giffey admitted in an interview with the broadcaster DLF, saying policymakers needed to prioritise security over transparency in future.

Manuel Atug, a founder of AG Kritis, an independent working group of experts on critical infrastructure, said his organisation had repeatedly warned of shortfalls in the system, of a lack of planning to ensure that networks – be they electricity, water or cyber – were backed up so that they could not fail due to one event such as an arson attack. Glaring also is the failure of lawmakers to put pressure on utility companies and network operators.

“Resilience costs money,” Atug said. “Companies only do what they're legally required to do.” Politicians were keener to do things that were visibly striking, such as “building drone defence centres”, rather than implementing more mundane measures such as protecting energy networks or fixing dilapidated bridges or school buildings, he told Der Spiegel.

The far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland has been keen to exploit the situation, accusing the country's leadership of failing to keep its citizens warm and safe, and turning out this week to give away blankets. In a statement, the party's deputy federal spokesperson, Kay Gottschalk, said the government had failed to develop “any sort of consistent political and security-related response” to sabotage or arson attacks. “It's no longer an abstract warning we face, but a bitter reality,” he said.

Across Berlin there has been an outpouring of goodwill towards those who lost power. Hotels and private individuals, as well as libraries, swimming pools, cinemas and museums, have opened their doors.

Zehlendorf is known as a well-heeled part of Berlin, home to ambassadors, pop stars and business leaders, as well as ordinary Germans. Vulkangruppe apologised to people such as the Peters – a retired nurse and caretaker in their 70s – who have had to stay with friends for days. But Silke gave this short shrift, saying: “Tell that to the elderly who were stuck in their lifts when the black out happened, or our neighbour whose cat ran away and has yet to return.”

The Peters hope to be able to return to their flat on Wednesday. When they do, Silke will be in on a secret her husband had kept.

“It turns out he'd been doing his own prepping,” she said, referring to supplies of tinned fish and a large canister of drinking water he had put in the cellar, unbeknown to her. “Everyone in Germany is doing it these days. And why wouldn't you? The difference to just a short while ago is that most readily admit it now without fear of ridicule.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: The story has been updated with the latest details.

U.S. authorities had seized the tanker formerly known as Bella 1 in the North Atlantic over sanctions violations after a weeks-long pursuit, the U.S. military announced on Jan. 7.

The announcement follows reporting that U.S. forces boarded the empty oil tanker, which was renamed Marinera and adopted a Russian flag after evading a U.S. blockade near Venezuela in December.

The unprecedented incident risks further inflaming tensions between Russia and the U.S., sharpened by Washington's military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of dictator Nicolas Maduro, Moscow's ally, and Russia's refusal to cease hostilities in Ukraine.

The move was part of what U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called a ""back-to-back meticulously coordinated boarding of two 'ghost fleet' tanker ships,"" with another Venezuela-linked ship captured in the Caribbean.

The boarding of Marinera was carried out in coordination with the U.S. Justice Department, the Homeland Security Department, and the Defense Department, according to the U.S. European Command.

""This seizure supports @POTUS Proclamation targeting sanctioned vessels that threaten the security and stability of the Western Hemisphere,"" the command said on X.

Russia appealed to the U.S. to halt the pursuit and reportedly dispatched a submarine and other vessels to escort the tanker before it was boarded by U.S. forces.

Undisclosed officials told Reuters that the operation was carried out by the U.S. Coast Guard and the military. 

Russian military vessels, including a submarine, were in the general vicinity of the operation, though there was no sign of a confrontation, according to the news agency.

The New York Times seemingly disputed this claim, writing that, according to its sources, no Russian warships were near the tanker. The U.S. military dispatched a Navy P-8 submarine-hunting aircraft and AC-130 gunships to assist with the capture, with several planes taking off from U.K. bases on the morning of Jan. 7, the newspaper reported.

The British Defense Ministry confirmed it has provided operational support to U.S. forces at Washington's request.

Russian state news outlet RT published footage of what is claimed to be a U.S. helicopter approaching the vessel.

""Today, at approximately 3:00 p.m. Moscow time, in the high seas outside the territorial waters of any state, U.S. naval forces boarded the vessel, and communication with the ship was lost,"" Russia's Transport Ministry said.

The ministry noted that the tanker was granted ""temporary authorization"" to sail under the Russian flag on Dec. 24, 2025, adding that ""no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states.""

The Russian Foreign Ministry, in turn, said Moscow ""demands that the U.S. ensure humane and dignified treatment of Russian citizens on the ship"" and ""not to hinder... (their) prompt return to their homeland.""

However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the crew could be brought to the U.S. to face trial over potential federal law violations ""if necessary,"" without mentioning Russian crew members specifically.

She also referred to the ship as a ""Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel,"" in line with other U.S. officials who have avoided mentioning Russia in connection to the case.

According to Leavitt, the vessel was deemed ""stateless"" after flying a false flag. The spokesperson deflected a question on a possible confrontation with Russian warships.

The U.S. Coast Guard initially intercepted Bella 1 in the Caribbean in December as it sailed from Iran to load oil in Venezuela. U.S. authorities said they were acting on a seizure warrant because the ship was flying a false flag.

The ship's crew refused to be boarded at the time, after which the vessel was renamed and re-registered under a Russian flag.

The tanker has been sanctioned by the U.S. for purportedly transporting black-market Iranian oil on behalf of organizations designated by Washington as terrorists.

Ukraine presented the apprehension of the ship as evidence of ""President Trump's resolute leadership.""

""We welcome such (an) approach to dealing with Russia: act, not fear,"" Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.

Separately, U.S. forces also intercepted another Venezuela-linked tanker in Latin American waters. The vessel, M/T Sophia, ""was operating in international waters and conducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea,"" the U.S. Southern Command said.

""The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.

""Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce — as determined by the U.S. — will be permitted.""

The news comes as the U.S. intensifies its crackdown on the shadow fleet, a group of aging tankers Moscow uses to evade international sanctions.

Dan Hamilton, a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says U.S. President Donald Trump is demonstrating that ""the U.S. will determine what energy flows out of Venezuela.""

Referring to the U.S. military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3, the expert noted that ""while Russia has criticized U.S. actions publicly,"" it sees Washington's interventions in Venezuela as a sign that ""big powers can intervene in the affairs of small powers.""

In December, the U.S. seized the tanker The Skipper off the Venezuelan coast after Guyana said the ship was falsely flying its flag — a common method employed by the shadow fleet.

While this marks the first case in recent memory of the U.S. seizing a Russian-flagged vessel, European countries have previously detained several ships from the shadow fleet, suspected of engaging in illicit activities.

Martin has been invited to speak on Times Radio, France 24, Czech Television, and Radio Free Europe. He speaks English, Czech, and Ukrainian. 



The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) on Jan. 7 launched an online portal for applicants to submit projects to a U.S.-Ukraine reconstruction fund, saying the first investments could be made in the months ahead.

Russia appealed to the U.S. to halt the pursuit and reportedly dispatched a submarine and other vessels to escort the tanker before it was boarded by U.S. forces.

President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Cyprus to meet his Cypriot counterpart, Nikos Christodoulides, and top EU officials, presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said on Jan. 7.

Rustem Umerov said the talks centered on the peace framework and ""further contacts at the leaders' level involving Ukraine, European partners, and the United States.""

Authorities in Russia's Kamchatka Krai announced on Jan. 7 that they had restricted mobile internet access, citing the threat of Ukrainian drone attacks — despite the region being located over 9,000 kilometers from Ukraine's border.

 The Kyiv Independent's Jared Goyette speaks with foreign policy analyst Ivan Fechko about Venezuela's political crisis following the U.S. attack and kidnapping of dictator Nicolás Maduro — and why it marks a major strategic setback for Russia in Latin America and globally.





U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Jan. 5 derided Russia-supplied air defenses that failed to stop the American raid and subsequent arrest of Venezuela's longtime dictator Nicolas Maduro.

A fire broke out at the Stary Oskol oil depot in Russia's Belgorod Oblast after it was hit by Ukrainian drones, Governor Vyacheslov Gladkov said. ""As a result of the detonation, several tanks caught fire on the site,"" he claimed.

The French president nevertheless stressed that ""in the short term, we must continue to support Ukraine in its defense efforts.""

The interceptor features advanced hit-to-kill technology, enabling it to destroy high-speed missiles, such as Russia's Kinzhal and Zircon, with precision.

In a private message sent late December, Leonid Volkov welcomed the news of the apparent death of Denis Kapustin, the commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps, a right-wing militia made up of ethnic Russians fighting on Ukraine's side. It was later revealed that Kapustin was alive and his death was faked by Ukraine.

Despite leading several of Ukraine's most consequential operations against Russia, Maliuk's tenure has been marked by controversy, particularly over his involvement in actions targeting anti-corruption bodies.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The UK Ministry of Defense said that it gave operational support to the seizure of the Russian tanker.

In another dire escalation, the U.S. has reported the seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the northern Atlantic Ocean that the military has been pursuing for weeks, citing ties to Venezuela and the Trump administration's illegal blockade of that country.

The Pentagon's European Command announced the operation on Wednesday morning, and Russian media also reported that the vessel had been boarded by U.S. forces. European Command said that the vessel was violating the U.S.'s sanctions on Venezuela's oil exports, which legal experts have repeatedly said are illegal under international law.

The tanker, originally known as the Bella-1 and renamed to the Marinera, was sailing under the Russian flag and was being escorted by at least one Russian naval vessel. For weeks, it had evaded capture, and had reportedly never landed in Venezuela. The vessel was reportedly empty when the U.S. seized it.

U.S. European Command said that the operation was carried out by the Department of Defense in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. “This seizure supports [Trump's] Proclamation targeting sanctioned vessels that threaten the security and stability of the Western Hemisphere,” the command said on X.

The seizure is an escalation of tensions against Russia on top of a continuation of the U.S.'s operations to seize Venezuela's oil. 

Russian officials have condemned the seizure. Russia's transportation ministry said in a statement that “no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states.” Reuters reports a Russian lawmaker from the ruling party has described it as piracy, and lawmakers have denounced the action.

The U.K. Ministry of Defense said it supported the seizure, including with surveillance from the air.

“U.K. Armed Forces provided pre-planned operational support, including basing, to U.S. military assets interdicting the Bella 1 in the UK-Iceland-Greenland gap following a U.S. request for assistance,” the agency said in a statement. “The U.K. and U.S. defence and security relationship is the deepest in the world and the U.K. provided enabling support in full compliance with international law.”

U.S. Southern Command also reported that the Coast Guard intercepted another tanker, this one flagged to Panama, with links to Venezuela in Latin American waters on Wednesday, known as the M Sophia. The Coast Guard is escorting the tanker to the U.S. “for final disposition,” said Southern Command in a post on X.

“The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT,” wrote Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.

The two seizures mark the third and fourth publicly announced tanker seizures in recent months. They are the first to be captured since the U.S.'s abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday. Trump administration officials are demanding that the U.S. control all oil assets in the Western Hemisphere.

Location, location, location: Greenland's position above the Arctic Circle makes the world's largest island a key part of security strategy. But for whom? (Produced by Elaine Carroll)

Location, location, location: Greenland's position above the Arctic Circle makes the world's largest island a key part of security strategy.

Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put Greenland at the heart of the debate over global trade and security, and U.S. President Donald Trump wants to make sure his country controls the mineral-rich island that guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America.

Greenland is a self-governing territory of Denmark, a longtime U.S. ally that has rejected Trump's overtures. Greenland's own government also opposes U.S. designs on the island, saying the people of Greenland will decide their own future. 

The island, 80% of which lies above the Arctic Circle, is home to about 56,000 mostly Inuit people who until now have been largely ignored by the rest of the world.

Here's why Greenland is strategically important to Arctic security:








Greenland sits off the northeastern coast of Canada, with more than two-thirds of its territory lying within the Arctic Circle. That has made it crucial to the defense of North America since World War II, when the U.S. occupied Greenland to ensure it didn't fall into the hands of Nazi Germany and to protect crucial North Atlantic shipping lanes.

Following the Cold War, the Arctic was largely an area of international cooperation. But climate change is thinning the Arctic ice, promising to create a northwest passage for international trade and reigniting competition with Russia, China and other countries over access to the region's mineral resources.





In 2018, China declared itself a “near-Arctic state” in an effort to gain more influence in the region. China has also announced plans to build a “Polar Silk Road” as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative, which has created economic links with countries around the world.

Then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected China's move, saying: “Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?”

Meanwhile, Russia has sought to assert its influence over wide areas of the Arctic in competition with the U.S., Canada, Denmark and Norway. Moscow has also sought to boost its military presence in the polar region, home to its Northern Fleet and a site where the Soviet Union tested nuclear weapons. Russian military officials have said that the site is ready for resuming the tests, if necessary.

Russia's military has been restoring old Soviet infrastructure in the Arctic and building new facilities. Since 2014, the Russian military has opened several military bases in the Arctic and worked on reconstructing airfields.

European leaders' concerns have been heightened since Russia launched a war in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. 

Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that Moscow is worried about NATO's activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening the capability of its armed forces there. But he said that Moscow was holding the door open to broader international cooperation in the region.





The U.S. Department of Defense operates the remote Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, which was built after the U.S. and Denmark signed the Defense of Greenland Treaty in 1951. It supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.

Greenland also guards part of what is known as the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom) Gap, where NATO monitors Russian naval movements in the North Atlantic.

Thomas Crosbie, an associate professor of military operations at the Royal Danish Defense College, said that an American takeover wouldn't improve upon Washington's current security strategy. 

“The United States will gain no advantage if its flag is flying in Nuuk (Greenland's capital) versus the Greenlandic flag,” he told The Associated Press. “There's no benefits to them because they already enjoy all of the advantages they want.

“If there's any specific security access that they want to improve American security, they'll be given it as a matter of course, as a trusted ally. So this has nothing to do with improving national security for the United States.”

Denmark's parliament approved a bill last June to allow U.S. military bases on Danish soil. It widened a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration, where U.S. troops had broad access to Danish air bases in the Scandinavian country.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, in a response to lawmakers' questions, wrote over the summer that Denmark would be able to terminate the agreement if the U.S. tries to annex all or part of Greenland.



Denmark is moving to strengthen its military presence around Greenland and in the wider North Atlantic. Last year, the government announced a roughly 14.6 billion-kroner ($2.3 billion) agreement with parties including the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands, another self-governing territory of Denmark, to “improve capabilities for surveillance and maintaining sovereignty in the region.” 

The plan includes three new Arctic naval vessels, two additional long-range surveillance drones and satellite capacity.

Denmark's Joint Arctic Command is headquartered in Nuuk, and tasked with the “surveillance, assertion of sovereignty and military defense of Greenland and the Faroe Islands,” according to its website. It has smaller satellite stations across the island.

The Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, an elite Danish naval unit that conducts long-range reconnaissance and enforces Danish sovereignty in the Arctic wilderness, is also stationed in Greenland.



Greenland is also a rich source of the so-called rare earth minerals that are a key component of cellphones, computers, batteries and other high-tech gadgets that are expected to power the world's economy in the coming decades.

FILE -Danish military forces participate in an exercise with hundreds of troops from several European NATO members in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, Sept. 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi, File)



That has attracted the interest of the U.S. and other Western powers as they try to ease China's dominance of the market for these critical minerals.

Development of Greenland's mineral resources is challenging because of the island's harsh climate, while strict environmental controls have proved an additional hurdle for potential investors.

SCHIPHOL, Netherlands (AP) — More than 1,000 stranded passengers spent the night at Amsterdam's international airport as snow and ice that is pummeling parts of Europe grounded hundreds of flights and choked highways and railroads Wednesday.

In Paris, a skier slid along the snowy bank of the Seine river and roads and parks around the Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum were blanketed in snow, which also snarled traffic in parts of France.

There was good news for some Berlin residents during the cold snap as power was being restored to thousands of households in the German capital that had been without electricity in freezing temperatures for four days following a suspected far-left attack on high-voltage lines, authorities said.

Schiphol Airport, on the outskirts of Amsterdam, set up hundreds of field beds overnight and served breakfast to weary travelers as staff worked to clear snow from runways and deice airplanes. At least 800 flights were canceled Wednesday at the airport, one of Europe's busiest aviation hubs.

Sonja Wurmlingel, trying to make her way home to Argentina, had to endure repeated disappointments and still was not sure how she would get back. She originally was supposed to fly via the German city of Düsseldorf, but that flight was canceled. Then she was rerouted through Paris, but that was canceled, too. The next option was taking a train to Düsseldorf.

“I've come from the train and they told me there's no train,” she said, adding, after a long pause: “I don't know.”




National airline KLM said that lines at the airport were decreasing, in part because passengers were warned on time that their flights were canceled, so they didn't head to the airport.

The Dutch rail and road networks were also hard hit by fresh snowfall during the morning rush hour and more squalls later in the day.

Rail operator NS urged travelers to “delay your journey if possible.” It warned of fewer trains operating as problems caused by the snow and icy temperatures in the Netherlands hit train travel harder than expected. Both domestic and international trains were affected, NS said.

Drivers braving the snowy conditions didn't fare much better, with more than 700 kilometers (435 miles) of traffic jams clogging the country's roads as trucks slid across highways and slow-moving snow plows cleared the roads.

France's national weather service, Meteo France, said large parts of northern and western France, including the Paris region, were on alert for snow and black ice. French authorities advised people to work from home and avoid using their cars in the snow-hit regions. Trucks and school buses were banned from using the roads. Bus traffic was suspended in Paris on Wednesday morning.

Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said that more than 100 flights were canceled Wednesday at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport and about 40 others at Paris Orly airport.

French railway company SNCF warned passengers about disruptions and delays because of weather conditions, saying that “snow on the tracks is forcing us to limit train speed and cancel trains or adjust traffic.” Eurostar trains between Paris, London and Brussels were also being delayed.

Even countries more accustomed to harsh winter weather reported problems as the snowy snap endured over large parts of Europe.

There was heavy snow in western Sweden, and authorities in Göteborg took all the city's trams out of service Wednesday morning because of the weather, broadcaster SVT reported. Snow banks churned up by passing trams posed a risk to other traffic.

In Finland, difficulties starting diesel buses that had been standing in the cold over the holidays and poor driving conditions led to bus cancellations and delays in the Helsinki area, Finnish broadcaster Yle reported.

All-Star panelists discuss how scammers allegedly used money intended to feed the hungry on luxuries on Special Report.

Aimee Bock, the alleged mastermind behind Minnesota's $250 million Feeding Our Future fraud scandal tied to the Somali community, is facing forfeiture of a Porsche, property, designer handbags and millions of dollars after a federal judge approved a preliminary order.

A judge signed off on the preliminary forfeiture order last week, clearing the way for the government to seize assets that prosecutors say were purchased with ill-gotten taxpayer funds, according to MPR News, a Minnesota-based news outlet.

The assets include about $3.7 million in bank accounts and cash, a 2013 Porsche and luxury items taken from her home, according to MPR News. The U.S. attorney's office listed the total forfeiture judgment at $5.2 million. Federal agents seized the assets in 2022, and the judge has now approved their forfeiture on a preliminary basis following Bock's conviction.

A federal jury in March found Bock guilty on all counts she faced, including wire fraud, conspiracy and bribery. She is currently awaiting sentencing.

Bock founded the Feeding Our Future nonprofit in 2016, and, for years, it operated modestly, handling roughly $3 million to $4 million annually in federal child nutrition reimbursements, according to prosecutors.

That trajectory changed abruptly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when emergency rule changes loosened oversight and allowed sponsors to submit claims without normal verification.

As executive director of Feeding Our Future, Bock approved meal sites, some of which were fake, and then certified the claims, signing off on the reimbursements from the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE).

She would soon preside over a network that claimed to have served 91 million meals, for which prosecutors say the scammers fraudulently received nearly $250 million in federal funds, a scale of growth that far outpaced the nonprofit's pre-pandemic size and internal capacity.

Later filings and sentencing releases described the total impact as closer to $300 million. Attorney General Pam Bondi has suggested it may reach $400 million.

Prosecutors described Bock as the scheme's gatekeeper who wielded near-total control over approvals and reimbursements that allowed the fraud to expand at a staggering pace.

She was also involved in a kickback scheme by accepting cash payments from meal site operators in exchange for site approvals and reimbursements, prosecutors said.

In 2021, when the MDE grew suspicious and tried to stop the flow of funds, Feeding Our Future sued, alleging racial discrimination. 

Of the 78 defendants charged to date, 57 have been convicted, according to Bondi, who said that 72 of the defendants are of Somalian descent, while five defendants are ""currently fugitives in Africa.""

President Donald Trump dedicated a speech to Republican lawmakers to Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026.

The death of Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., has shrunk the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to the minimum of 218 seats, presenting fresh challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson as the party heads into an election year.

LaMalfa, 65, died suddenly on Tuesday during an emergency surgery. He was a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and a reliable vote for Johnson's priorities. His death means Johnson can only lose two Republican votes and still pass legislation along party lines.

Trump rallied behind Johnson during a retreat for House GOP lawmakers at the Trump-Kennedy Center on Tuesday.

""A lot of times they'll say, ‘I wish Mike were tougher,'"" Trump told assembled Republicans. ""He's tough. He's tough as anybody in the room, actually. But can't be tough when you have a majority of three, and now sadly, a little bit less than that.""

LaMalfa's death landed on the same day that Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation went into effect. The now-former Georgia congresswoman's seat won't be filled until a March 10 special election. Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is required by state law to hold an election for LaMalfa's seat within the next two weeks.

Democrats are also poised to refill their ranks in the coming weeks, however. Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Texas, died in March and an election to fill his seat is scheduled for the end of January. Likewise, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., was elected governor of her state in November. Her seat is set to be filled in a special election in April.

Trump dedicated his Tuesday address to LaMalfa, saying he had considered canceling the speech to Republican lawmakers.

""I spoke to Doug, but I didn't speak to him, you know? I mean, we never had a problem. I was really saddened by his passing and was thinking about not even doing the speech in his honor,"" Trump said. ""But then I decided that I have to do it in his honor. I'll do it in his honor because he would've wanted it that way.""

""He would've said, 'Do that speech! Are you kidding me? Do the speech,'"" he continued. ""He was a fantastic person. Man, that was a quick one. I don't know quite yet what happened, but boy is that a tough one. He was just with us. He was our friend. All of us, every one of us.""

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here.

For years, elite universities have avoided the real source of the campus free speech crisis. Administrators blamed polarization. Faculty blamed fragile students. Everyone blamed social media, donors, or outside politics. What almost no one in power was willing to say was the obvious truth: Faculty activism has played a central role in chilling speech and narrowing debate.

Last week, Harvard University President Alan Garber finally broke with years of institutional evasion and said it. In a candid interview on the Shalom Hartman Institute's Identity/Crisis podcast, Garber acknowledged that the university “went wrong” by allowing professors to inject their personal views into the classroom, arguing that faculty activism has chilled free speech and debate at Harvard.

“How many students would actually be willing to go toe-to-toe against a professor who's expressed a firm view about a controversial issue?” he asked. 

That wasn't boilerplate. It wasn't hedged. It was an admission of responsibility, and it was of enormous consequence. 

To be clear, this does not absolve student-facing administrators. I have written for years about the role of sprawling bureaucracies devoted to “belonging,” “safety,” and “dialogue” in narrowing acceptable speech, enforcing ideological conformity, and treating disagreement as harm. Those structures remain deeply implicated, and Garber's remarks do not erase that record. But what his admission finally does is break a long-standing taboo: it acknowledges that faculty are not innocent bystanders. They are not merely victims of administrative excess or student hypersensitivity. They are powerful actors, and they have used that power.

This is not a call for faculty silence. Professors are entitled to their views and to express them as citizens and scholars. But classroom neutrality is a professional norm, not a restriction on speech. When professors use the grading relationship and their authority over students to signal which views are morally acceptable and which are suspect, they do not need censorship to silence dissent. Students read the room. They self-edit. They learn quickly that disagreement carries a cost. The professional norm of the professoriate has never been advocacy; it has been inquiry conducted under conditions of trust, power imbalance, and restraint.

Tenured professors grade students, design curricula, control classrooms, and shape professional norms. Students experiment with ideas; faculty set the rules of the experiment and the tone of inquiry, which is why their activism carries far greater consequences than that of their students.

The data confirm what Garber described. According to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression's 2026 College Free Speech Rankings, roughly a quarter of college students say they self-censor “fairly often” or “very often” during classroom discussions, and a majority report discomfort expressing their views on controversial political topics. The source of that discomfort is not punishment, but fear of negative reactions from peers and professors — a climate created and sustained by those with institutional authority.

Students did not invent this culture on their own. They absorbed it from the environment around them and from the adults who model behavior and enforce boundaries. When faculty activism is rewarded, tolerated, or excused as “engagement,” students internalize the lesson that silence is safer than dissent.

This is why workshops and dialogue initiatives fail. They focus on tone while ignoring power. You cannot workshop your way out of a culture in which professors use institutional authority to advance political causes. You cannot train students to speak freely when they know the person grading them has already taken sides.

The consequences of this culture extend beyond the classroom. At Harvard, faculty activists did not merely express opinions. They disrupted Widener Library, staging protests in what should be the most sacred and neutral space on campus — a place devoted to study, inquiry, and intellectual refuge.

This matters beyond the specific controversy that prompted it. Libraries exist precisely so ideas can be encountered without intimidation or mobilization. They are not protest sites. They are sanctuaries for concentration, reflection, and the slow, patient work of learning. When faculty turn them into stages for political theater, whether framed as protest or pedagogy, they collapse the distinction between scholarship and advocacy. Universities cannot function if every space becomes ideological territory. When professors model disruption rather than restraint, students learn that activism outranks inquiry and that neutrality itself is suspect.

What makes Garber's admission so consequential is that it collapses a convenient fiction in higher education: that faculty radicalism is somehow external to institutional responsibility. Tenure, prestige, and moral authority are not incidental features of the modern university; they are its governing architecture. When that authority is used to advance political causes rather than disciplined inquiry, it reshapes norms, incentives, and silence itself. Universities cannot defend free expression while tolerating, let alone celebrating, those distortions.

Garber deserves credit for finally saying the quiet part out loud. He acknowledged what students have long known and what administrators have long avoided: faculty activism has distorted the academic environment and chilled debate. But honesty creates obligation. If faculty are indeed part of the problem, as Garber now admits, then universities must be willing to reassert professional norms: the classroom is not an organizing space, the library is not a protest site, and authority is not a license to enforce ideological conformity.

GLENN YOUNGKIN: THE GREAT VIRGINIA RENAISSANCE

Other university administrations should follow Garber's lead. A university cannot operate as a political actor and a neutral intellectual commons at the same time. Acknowledging that tension and choosing inquiry over activism is the first step toward restoring what higher education claims to value.

Student-facing administrators built the machinery of speech control. Faculty gave it moral authority. Garber finally admitted it. Now, higher education must act on that admission or own its complicity and the consequences in the silence that follows.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the United States plans to sell Venezuelan oil in the market “indefinitely,” while controlling the proceeds and directing the revenue back to Venezuela.

“Instead of the oil being blockaded, as it is right now, we're gonna let the oil flow … to United States refineries and around the world to bring better oil supplies, but have those sales done by the U.S. government,” Wright said on Wednesday at Goldman Sachs's Energy, CleanTech & Utilities Conference.

He said proceeds from those sales would be deposited into U.S. government-controlled accounts, flowing back to the country to “benefit the Venezuelan people.”

“We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,” he said.

Wright's comments come shortly after the U.S. seized sanctioned oil tankers on Wednesday morning, which it had been pursuing since last month.

Venezuela's oil reserves played a significant role in President Donald Trump's decision to capture former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. Trump has said he would seek to revitalize the oil industry in Venezuela. Wright's comments are the most detailed from the administration on how the U.S. plans to approach the oil industry in Venezuela.

Previously, the administration only hinted at plans for oil that Venezuela has already pumped and placed in storage or in transit. Trump said on Truth Social on Tuesday that Venezuela would turn over “30 and 50 million” barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S. that it would then sell. That oil is estimated to be worth up to $2.5 billion.

Wright said he is working directly with the Venezuelans.

“We're going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela, first this backed up, stored oil, and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace,” he said.

Over the long term, he said, the administration hopes to create conditions in Venezuela that will lead U.S. oil companies to invest in the country, noting that Venezuela's resources are “immense.”

When asked for further detail, a White House spokesperson said, “This was a deal made with the Venezuelan interim authorities that benefits both the American people and the Venezuelan people. Secretary Wright and the Energy Department are working with the interim authorities and private oil industry to execute this historic energy deal that will restore prosperity, safety, and security in the United States and Venezuela.”

During an interview with NBC News on Tuesday, Trump said the U.S. oil industry could expand its operations in less than 18 months, but it would cost “a lot of money.”

OIL INDUSTRY WINNERS FROM MADURO CAPTURE

“A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they'll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,” he said.

Still, Trump faces an uphill battle, as the oil industry in Venezuela has seen a decline in production over the last few decades.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The ceremony will feature roadkill hors d'oeuvres, goblets of beef tallow, and a sewage plunge.

For his tireless work promoting the cause of children's diseases, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is being inducted into the Virus Hall of Fame today. The ceremony will feature light roadkill hors d'oeuvres, goblets of beef tallow, and a sewage plunge, and will include a memorial tribute to the parasitic worm that perished after eating a portion of his brain, but whose influence continues to be deeply felt.

In announcing the honor, the viruses praised Kennedy for being the first to buck the long-standing family tradition of fighting to better children's lives: “Where other Kennedys mindlessly rushed to broaden access to health care, advocate peace, or improve children's circumstances, only RFK Jr. had the courage to take a step back and say, ‘Let's hear the other side.'”

“It's easy to love children and want what's best for them,” a representative from the virus league explained. “It's hard to look deeper and say, What about the virus in that child's lung? Who's looking out for it?”

“He's been our guardian angel,” a weeping respiratory syncytial virus added. “We were on the brink of destruction, and—he spared us.”

The disease-spreaders commended the secretary's work altering the schedule of childhood vaccines, noting that, although technically these are just guidelines, and states and families can still make their own decisions to vaccinate, anything that makes vaccination more confusing and difficult is a big win for viruses.

“For offering a gracious home to a parasitic brain worm, even for a time, and for his indefatigable efforts to reintroduce the noble measle back into the wild, we here at the Childhood Diseases Consortium (CDC) are proud to claim Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as one of our own,” a plaque reads. “For his work making the lives of those scientists still trying to do their jobs at the Other CDC a living nightmare, and for the many ways, large and small, that he advances the cause of viral disease, we offer this small tribute to our most ferocious advocate and strongest defender. Whether he is repeating the words gold-standard science until they lose all meaning, traveling the world with a personal holster of sauerkraut, or doing something we think is intended to be a pull-up, the secretary will always know that we're honored to have him in our corner. Wherever we go, whomever we touch, we feel we're carrying on his legacy.”

The evening was to feature a performance by a children's choir, but too many of them are reportedly under the weather.

President Donald Trump said the U.S. should bar large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans.

""For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post Wednesday.

""It is for that reason, and much more, that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,"" he added.

Private equity giants, real estate investment trusts and other large institutional investors have amassed sizable portfolios of single-family rental homes over the past decade. Many have argued that these investments have reduced housing supply for would-be homeowners and helped drive up prices. 

Invitation Homes, which is the largest renter of single-family homes in the country, tumbled 7%. Shares of Blackstone, an investing firm that owns and rents single-family homes, dropped 4%. Shares of other big institutional investors involved in real estate also declined, including Apollo Global Management and BlackRock.

Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. Trump said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio said Wednesday he will introduce a bill to make it harder for larger investors to buy single family homes.

The national median existing single-family home price was $426,800 in the third quarter of 2025 after hitting a record high of $435,300 in the summer, according to the National Association of Realtors. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is currently at 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily.

Blackstone was the largest private-equity owner of apartments in the U.S. with more than 230,000 units, according to data from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project released last year. Blackstone in recent years has spent billions acquiring real estate companies such as Tricon Residential, American Campus Communities and AIR Communities.

President Donald Trump's allies on Capitol Hill are downplaying his threats to take over Greenland by force. To them it's just the art of the deal -- hinting back to his popular 1987 book.

Republicans largely fell in line after Trump over the weekend ordered a strike that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro without congressional approval. Now, as Trump refuses to rule out military action to annex Greenland, some members of the GOP say his aggressive posturing is a bluff to secure a deal that gives the U.S. more influence over the Arctic island.

""He's from New York, he's one of the best negotiators and how he negotiates sometimes is everything is on the table,"" Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who was Trump's Secretary of the Interior in his first term, said in an interview with CNBC. 

""I think [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio is correct in that he's downplaying that we're gonna land the Marines on Greenland,"" Zinke said. ""I'd be supportive of negotiating a deal with Denmark to make sure that it stays influenced in the West.""

Trump has long coveted Greenland, a self-governing island territory of NATO ally Denmark. He has argued U.S. influence over the island is critical to national security for deterring Russian and Chinese aggression. The president has doubled down on his efforts to make the island part of the U.S. after the Venezuela raid that captured Maduro and hauled him to New York to face criminal drug charges. 

""The President and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. Military is always an option at the Commander in Chief's disposal,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNBC on Tuesday of the Greenland plan. 

The effort has rattled European leaders and enraged Denmark, which, along with Greenland, has repeatedly denied Trump's overtures. 

""Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,"" wrote Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as well as the leaders of Italy, Spain and Poland in a joint statement earlier this week.

Moderate Republicans have taken solace in the idea that Trump is only negotiating, as Zinke argued. Maintaining the NATO alliance remains paramount on Capitol Hill. 

""Obviously there is strategic national security importance to it with respect to the Arctic, with respect to NATO, with respect to combating Russia,"" said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.

""If you can enter into negotiations with Denmark, with Greenland, great. The idea of taking it by force, no … there is strong bipartisan opposition to any use of force with respect to Greenland,"" Lawler said. 

Rep. Nick LaLota, another New York Republican, agreed: ""To Trump, everything is a deal, everything is a negotiation, a lot of things come down to leverage and I think his administration is comfortable with the term about not taking any options off the table, I hope we don't read too much into that.""

Democrats have erupted at the prospect that Trump could invade Greenland with the military, warning it would shatter the NATO alliance that has propped up U.S. and European security since World War II. 

Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz, on Tuesday said he plans to introduce a resolution known as a War Powers Resolution to block Trump from ordering military action. 

And Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said in an interview with CNBC that he's working on a new War Powers Resolution in the House. 

""The people around him need to stage an intervention,"" McGovern said. ""He wants to destroy and blow up our NATO alliances … he's just not well, the stuff that he's saying is so damaging to our country."" 

Some Republicans agree with Democrats. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., called Trump's actions in Greenland ""appalling.""

""It's creating a lot of long-term anger and hurt with our friends in Europe,"" Bacon said. ""I feel like we have a bunch of high school kids playing Risk.""

And Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., issued a joint statement with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., arguing that ""Any suggestion that our nation would subject a fellow NATO ally to coercion or external pressure undermines the very principles of self-determination that our Alliance exists to defend.""

Even Trump's allies generally agree that any military action would require congressional approval. They have argued the action that captured Maduro did not, since the U.S. was carrying out a law enforcement function. 

""This would require congressional authorization,"" Zinke said. ""It doesn't meet the litmus test on Venezuela or some of the other ones that he's talked about.""

Trump, in a Truth Social post on Wednesday, said, ""RUSSIA AND CHINA HAVE ZERO FEAR OF NATO WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AND I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM.""

""We will always be there for NATO, even if they won't be there for us,"" he said. 

Powerful House Republicans on Capitol Hill, for now, are sticking by Trump as he pursues Greenland -- continuing to insist the threats are all part of his negotiation strategy. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., said the ""post World War 2 order is not over in any way whatsoever.""

""There's not a goal to break up NATO right now, there's looking to say, is there a good deal that can be made for what is a very strategic location, not just for the United States of America, but for others,"" he said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Minneapolis fatally shot a woman in her car on Wednesday, federal officials said.

""Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking  ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism,"" said Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a post on X.

Video purportedly from the scene posted on social media shows ICE officers pulling up to a group of cars parked on a suburban street.

""Get the f--- out of our neighborhood,"" a woman is heard saying on the video, apparently from behind the camera.

ICE agents then quickly exited their truck and walked up to a vehicle blocking the road, saying, ""Ma'am, get out of the car, out of the car, get out of the f---ing car,"" the video shows.

The car then backs up slightly and begins pulling away, at which point at least three shots are fired. Less than three seconds pass between the car reversing and moving forward, and the beginning of the gunfire.

""Oh f---ing, God!"" a woman screams on the video.

The vehicle that was shot at quickly crashes down the street into another car.

""Dude, you did a murder, for what?"" a man yells on the video.

Multiple elected officials from Minnesota demanded that ICE leave Minneapolis after the shooting.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, during a press conference, blasted ICE and called the allegation that the dead woman was trying to kill agents ""bulls---.""

""I have a message for ICE, to ICE: Get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" Frey said.

""What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They're ripping families apart,"" Frey said.

""They're sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people, so they are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,"" the mayor said. 

""Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is bulls---. This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed,"" Frey said.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, who spoke at the same press conference, said, ""I myself saw a video of the shots being fired as the car was driving away.""

Bitcoin has been struggling lately to move higher, even after the MSCI has made its decision on digital assets treasury (DATs) companies to remain in MSCI-related global indexes.

While this eased fears of firms like Strategy forcefully selling Bitcoin. 

Yet Bitcoin's price did not move higher, leaving many investors confused about why the market stayed quiet even after such positive news.

Here's Why BTC Failed To Pump?

According to MSCI regulatory updates, it confirmed that Bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy will remain part of its indexes. 

But BTC failed to rally on this bullish news.

This is because of how MSCI previously handled share issuance. Before the rule change, companies like Strategy issued new shares, for example, 100 million, included in MSCI indexes, index funds tracking MSCI typically owned about 10% of those shares.

When Strategy issued 10 million new shares to raise money, MSCI automatically added those shares to its index. This forced index funds to buy 10% of the new shares, equal to 1 million shares. 

At a share price of $300, that meant $300 million in automatic buying. Strategy could then use this capital to buy more Bitcoin, indirectly supporting BTC's price.

New MSCI Rule Changes Everything

However, under the new MSCI rule, this automatic adjustment no longer happens. Even if Strategy issues the same 10 million new shares, MSCI will not increase the share count in its index.

As a result, index funds are no longer required to purchase additional shares. This removes a steady source of automatic demand that previously helped channel large amounts of capital into Strategy and, indirectly, into Bitcoin

This means Strategy must now rely on private buyers, often at lower prices, making less money available to buy Bitcoin.

Institution Quietly Accumulating Bitcoin 

At the same time, institutional interest remains strong. Morgan Stanley has filed for registration to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, adding to the growing list of Wall Street firms entering the space. 

Bitcoin ETFs also started 2026 on a positive note, pulling in nearly $1 billion in new inflows during the first week of the year. 

According to market data, more than $100 billion is already invested across U.S. Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust alone manages about $67 billion.

Wyoming's Frontier Stable Token (FRNT) is now available to the public, marking the first state-issued stablecoin in the United States. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selected Franklin Templeton to manage the token's reserves, with affiliate Fiduciary Trust Company International serving as custodian.

Franklin Templeton, which manages over $1.6 trillion in assets, brings expertise in both traditional finance and digital assets to the partnership. While the firm has significant blockchain experience, having launched the first tokenized money market fund issued by an incumbent asset manager and operating nodes on multiple blockchain networks, its role for FRNT focuses on conventional reserves management. The firm's fixed income division oversees reserves invested in US dollars and short duration US Treasuries.

While the commission originally announced FRNT would launch across seven blockchain networks – Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and Solana – the token is initially accessible only through two intermediary platforms. Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken offers FRNT on the Solana blockchain, while Rain, which provides a Visa powered card platform, supports the token on Avalanche.

RFK, Jr., Upsets Food Pyramid, Urging Americans to Eat More Meat

Nutritional guidelines released on Wednesday by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and the USDA emphasize “real food” that is high in saturated fat, departing from decades of evidence on healthful diets

On Wednesday Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and the U.S. Department of Agriculture released new official guidance that effectively overturns the food pyramid. The recommendations encourage Americans to eat “real food” and to consume more saturated-fat-rich foods such as red meat and whole-fat dairy.

The dietary guidelines inform U.S. nutrition policy, shaping dozens of federal feeding programs, including meals for the military and school lunches. In a statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics hailed the guidance as focused on whole foods for kids. “We commend the [guidelines'] inclusion of the Academy's evidence-based policy related to breastfeeding, introduction of solid foods, caffeine avoidance and limits on added sugars,” said AAP president Andrew Racine.

Yet the new guidelines' inclusion of red meat and animal fats contradict decades' worth of past recommendations and scientific evidence that had directed people to eat less saturated fats and more unsaturated fats, such as those found in olive oil. In one section, however, the guidance recommends that no more than 10 percent of a person's calories should come from saturated fats and states that “significantly limiting highly processed foods will help meet this goal.”

The changes reflects Kennedy's avowed aversion to ultraprocessed foods, which play an increasingly large part in the average American's diet. He has focused much of his ire on seed oils in particular, arguing that they should be swapped out for animal fats. But experts say that seed oils are generally safe when they are used properly and that encouraging Americans to eat more saturated, animal-derived fats likely poses a graver risk to heart health.

“I know of no evidence to indicate that there would be an advantage to increasing the saturated fat content of the diet,” says Alice Lichtenstein, senior scientist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University.

It's unclear what evidence the new guidelines are based on. Kennedy and Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins are expected to hold a press briefing about the guidelines on Thursday. Scientific American has reached out to both the HHS and USDA for comment.

Humans need fat for basic cellular and biological functions in the body—fats, or lipids, are essential for creating cellular membranes, absorbing hormones and vitamins and regulating body temperature. “People shouldn't be scared of fat, but they should keep in mind that it's better to get it from plants than animals,” Lichtenstein says. “That's what the bulk of the current evidence suggests.” The fat we eat generally falls into the two main categories of saturated and unsaturated. The primary difference is their arrangement of fatty acids—chains of hydrogen and carbon molecules.

In saturated fats, which are commonly found in meat, cheese and butter, the carbon molecules in the chain are linked with single carbon bonds and contain so many hydrogen atoms that the chain lies flat. This structure allows chains to align and pack tightly together, which is why saturated fats—such as those in butter and tallow (rendered animal fat)—generally stay solid at room temperature.

Unsaturated fatty acid chains, on the other hand, have double carbon bonds that cause them to curl and kink, so these fats mostly stay liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated fats (such as those in avocado and olive oils), polyunsaturated fats (such as sunflower oil) and trans fats (such as chemically processed vegetable oils that are often used in processed foods).

The arrangement and length of fatty acid chains also influence how our body processes fats . Unsaturated fatty acid chains tend to be incorporated into various parts of cells, such as cell membranes, to help them function properly. Saturated fatty acid chains generally get stored in fat tissue.

“Biology is not black or white, but the type of fatty acid pretty much tells you where it's going to go and how your body is going to use it,” says Martha Belury, a food science researcher and professor at the Ohio State University.

Most foods naturally contain both saturated and unsaturated fats. It's the overall amount consumed that matters for health, Lichtenstein says. In general, animal fats, including meat and dairy fat, have a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids.

Numerous studies and randomized clinical trials that compared diets high in saturated fat with those high in unsaturated fat have shown that the former increase levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), a type of cholesterol that, at high levels, can lead to strokes or heart attacks. More recent research also suggests that saturated fats are linked to an increased risk of insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes and obesity-associated heart disease, Belury says.

Leading medical societies offer their own guidance on dietary fat intake. The American Heart Association recommends that less than 6 percent of total calories should come from saturated fat. In a 2,000-calorie diet, that's about 13 grams or less of saturated fat per day—roughly equivalent to two tablespoons of salted butter or a single quarter-pound fast-food cheeseburger.

Experts have historically reevaluated and changed nutrition recommendations based on new, high-quality evidence. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration previously tweaked guidance around trans fats after research found that these fats increase LDL cholesterol at a comparable level to saturated fats while simultaneously reducing “good” cholesterol. Recommendations are not made without a comprehensive review of the literature, Lichtenstein says. “It's the cumulating evidence that is what's really important,” she adds. On Wednesday Kennedy did not present any strong new evidence along with the new dietary guidance.

Primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have long axons and a high demand for mitochondria, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in peripheral neuropathy after diabetes and chemotherapy1,2. However, the mechanisms by which primary sensory neurons maintain their mitochondrial supply remain unclear. Satellite glial cells (SGCs) in DRG encircle sensory neurons and regulate neuronal activity and pain3. Here we show that SGCs are capable of transferring mitochondria to DRG sensory neurons in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo by the formation of tunnelling nanotubes with SGC-derived myosin 10 (MYO10). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed tunnelling nanotube-like ultrastructures between SGCs and sensory neurons in mouse and human DRG. Blockade of mitochondrial transfer in naive mice leads to nerve degeneration and neuropathic pain. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and in situ hybridization revealed that MYO10 is highly expressed in human SGCs. Furthermore, SGCs from DRG of people with diabetes exhibit reduced MYO10 expression and mitochondrial transfer to neurons. Adoptive transfer of human SGCs into the mouse DRG provides MYO10-dependent protection against peripheral neuropathy. This study uncovers a previously unrecognized role of peripheral glia and provides insights into small fibre neuropathy in diabetes, offering new therapeutic strategies for the management of neuropathic pain.

Primary sensory neurons within the DRG are pseudounipolar, with long peripheral branches that innervate target organs such as the skin4. These neurons detect sensory inputs—including pain, touch, temperature and proprioception—and transmit them to the central nervous system via action potentials5. Neuronal activity, including rapid action potential firing, relies on tightly regulated mitochondrial function6. The peripheral axons of human DRG sensory neurons can extend up to 100 cm in the sciatic nerve. However, these long axons and their terminal branches in the skin face exceptional challenges in mitochondrial transport and delivery7. This raises the key question of how a single DRG neuron generates and maintains sufficient mitochondria to support its activity and axonal regeneration. SGCs exhibit a unique morphology, tightly enveloping the cell bodies of sensory neurons in the DRG3. However, the structural connections between SGCs and sensory neurons under both physiological and neuropathic conditions remain poorly understood. Mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell owing to their role in energy production8, were traditionally thought to be generated and maintained solely within individual cells. However, accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondria can be transferred between cells. For example, specialized structures called tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs) have been observed connecting different cell types in vitro9,10, and have recently been implicated in mitochondrial transfer between microglia11, from stem cells to endothelial cells12, and from stem cells to T cells13. Although these findings highlight the dynamic interplay between different cell types and the roles of mitochondrial transfer in diverse physiological and pathological processes, the cell-specific mechanisms of mitochondrial transfer remain unclear, and in vivo evidence is still limited.

To investigate mitochondrial transfer from SGCs to sensory neurons in vitro, we first prepared primary cultures of SGCs and neurons separately. Mouse primary SGC cultures were immunostained with established SGC markers, including FABP7, Kir4.1, AQP4, connexin 43 and glutamine synthetase. At 5 days in vitro (DIV5), 94.9–97.1% of cultured SGCs were positive for these markers (Extended Data Fig. 1a), validating the identity and purity of our SGC cultures. Next, we labelled SGCs with MitoTracker deep red dye14, co-cultured these cells with primary sensory neurons (without MitoTracker dye labelling) from DRG of Trpv1:Ai9 reporter mice, and captured images of the co-cultures after 24 h (Fig. 1a). Remarkably, we observed mitochondrial fluorescence not only in SGCs but also in Trpv1:Ai9+ neurons, indicating that mitochondria were transferred from SGCs to sensory neurons. Notably, we detected TNTs of more than 30 μm in length connecting SGCs and neurons, with mitochondria present inside these structures (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Quantitative analysis revealed that 83.3% of DRG neurons received mitochondria from SGCs, whereas only 31.3% of neurons exhibited visible TNTs (Fig. 1c). Live imaging of the co-cultures (Extended Data Fig. 1c) revealed that TNTs were formed transiently and could disassemble within tens of minutes (Extended Data Fig. 1d), which may explain the relatively low percentage of TNT-positive neurons. To determine whether mitochondrial transfer requires intrinsic neuronal activity, we treated co-cultures with tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block sodium channels. TTX reduced mitochondrial transfer (Extended Data Fig. 1e–g) without affecting the overall rate of TNT formation between SGCs and neurons (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Together, these results indicate that SGCs can transfer mitochondria to DRG neurons in an activity-dependent manner.

Previous studies have proposed three primary mechanisms for mitochondrial transfer: (1) formation of TNTs11, which can be disrupted by cytochalasin B (CytoB)15; (2) endocytosis and internalization of mitochondria by recipient cells16; and (3) transfer via gap junctions, which can be blocked by carbenoxolone17 (CBX). We investigated these mechanisms using pharmacological approaches. Treatment with CytoB effectively blocked mitochondrial transfer from SGCs to neurons in co-cultures. A similar blockade was observed with Y-27632, which is known to suppress uropod and TNT formation18 (Extended Data Fig. 1i–k). Moreover, mitochondrial transfer was suppressed by the endocytosis inhibitor Pitstop219 and the gap junction blocker CBX (Extended Data Fig. 1j). CytoB, Y-27632 and CBX further suppressed TNT formation (Extended Data Fig. 1k). Together, our in vitro results support a model in which mitochondrial transfer from SGCs to sensory neurons is mediated by TNTs, endocytosis and gap junctions. To examine mitochondrial transfer ex vivo, whole-mount DRG tissue was co-cultured with SGCs pre-labelled with MitoTracker (Extended Data Fig. 2a). We observed extensive TNTs formed between MitoTracker-labelled SGCs and DRG cells, including neurons and SGCs (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Moreover, treatment of SGC-whole-mount DRG co-cultures with CytoB (Extended Data Fig. 2d) caused marked inhibition in SGC mitochondrial transfer to whole-mount DRG (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). Macrophage-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer in mouse DRG contributes to the resolution of acute inflammatory pain20. We conducted a macrophage–whole-mount DRG co-culture experiment and confirmed that macrophages can also transfer mitochondria to DRG neurons (Extended Data Fig. 2e–g). Together, these experiments provide strong evidence for mitochondria transfer from SGCs to sensory neurons both in vitro and ex vivo.

To obtain three-dimensional ultrastructures of TNTs in the DRG, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Fig. 1d). We found abundant extracellular matrix-like structures (ECM-LS) on the surface of SGCs, which may provide additional structural support for neurons. Notably, we observed TNT-like structures (TNT-LS) connecting adjacent cells, with large vesicle-like bulges present within the TNT-LS in mouse DRG (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1). To further visualize the detailed contacts between SGCs and neurons, we performed SEM imaging on horizontally half-sectioned DRG (Fig. 1f). This cryostat-based sectioning method provided improved visualization of both SGCs and neurons within the DRG architecture (Fig. 1g). TNT-LS between SGC and neuron were observed in mouse DRG, and often contained bulges consistent in size with mitochondria (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2). As expected from a previous study21, the tube structures were largely disrupted by trypsin treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Notably, the formation of TNT-LS between SGCs and neurons was impaired in mice with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), as evidenced by enlarged intercellular gaps and a reduced number of TNT-LS after paclitaxel (PTX) treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3c–f). These results indicate that mitochondria-transferring TNTs are present between SGCs and sensory neurons in the peripheral DRG and are susceptible to neurodegenerative conditions such as CIPN. We further utilized structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to resolve individual mitochondria in mouse SGC. Quantification of mitochondrial length revealed an increase in the number of mitochondria shorter than 2 μm following PTX treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3g–i). This increase in short mitochondria is associated with cell stress22, suggesting that the PTX treatment directly induced mitochondrial dysfunction in SGCs. To validate the presence of mitochondria within TNTs of the DRG, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on 70-nm sections of mouse DRG (Fig. 1h). Smooth TNT-LS were observed between SGCs and neurons (Fig. 1i–l and Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Both mitochondria and vesicles were present within TNT-LS connecting SGCs and neurons (Fig. 1l, Extended Data Fig. 4a–c and Supplementary Fig. 3). Together with the SEM findings, these results provide ultrastructural evidence for the presence of TNT-LS containing mitochondria and vesicular cargo between SGCs and neurons in the DRG.

To investigate mitochondrial transfer from SGCs to sensory neurons in vivo, we crossed MitoTag mice, which express eGFP on the mitochondrial outer membrane23, with Aldh1l1-creERT2 mice to drive SGC-specific expression of MitoTag24 (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Tamoxifen (Tam) was administered daily for five days to temporally induce Cre-recombinase activity (Fig. 2a). DRG were collected five and ten days after the Tam treatment. No MitoTag fluorescence signal was detected in mice without Tam treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5c), whereas MitoTag signal was present in SGCs, marked by the SGC marker FABP7, at both day 5 and day 10 post-Tam injection (Fig. 2b). Of note, we observed a substantial increase in MitoTag signal over time, with 23.0% of DRG neurons producing a signal on day 10 compared with only 2.9% on day 5 (Fig. 2b,c). Colocalization of MitoTag with the mitochondrial marker TOM20 further confirmed the mitochondrial identity (Extended Data Fig. 5d), supporting a time-dependent mitochondrial transfer from SGCs to sensory neurons. To explore the subcellular mechanism of this transfer, we administrated CytoB intrathecally and observed a decrease in MitoTag signal in DRG neurons (Fig. 2c), whereas MitoTag expression in SGCs remained detectable (Fig. 2b). We also performed intrathecal injection of Pitstop2 to block endocytosis in the DRG (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f), which partially decreased mitochondrial transfer from SGCs to neurons (Fig. 2c). Thus, both TNT and endocytosis mechanisms are involved in mitochondrial transfer in vivo. Next, we examined whether mitochondrial transfer is altered under pathological conditions. In a diabetic neuropathic pain model, induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ; Extended Data Fig. 5e,f), we found that STZ pretreatment but not post-treatment could block SGC-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer (Fig. 2c). Intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) is known to elicit inflammatory pain. However, CFA did not alter the percentage of neurons receiving mitochondrial transfer (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5g,h).

Neuronal activation and action potential firing critically depend on mitochondrial function6, and abnormal neuronal activity after nerve injury drives neuropathic pain25. To investigate the relationship between neuronal activity and mitochondrial transfer, we performed spared nerve injury (SNI) surgery at the time of the first Tam injection and analysed DRG tissue 5 days later (Fig. 2d). Remarkably, the percentage of MitoTag+ neurons was increased in the ipsilateral L4–L5 DRG compared with the contralateral side 5 days post-SNI (Fig. 2e,f). Additionally, eGFP+ mitochondrial signals were observed in axons, suggesting further mitochondrial transport from neuronal cell bodies to axonal processes (Fig. 2e). To further determine the dependence of mitochondrial transfer on neuronal hyperactivity, we implemented a sustained nerve blockade using bupivacaine-containing PEU (poly(ester urea)) films26 wrapped around the sciatic nerve during SNI surgery (Fig. 2g). This blockade could increase the mechanical pain threshold above pre-injury baseline levels in SNI mice (Extended Data Fig. 5i,j). Notably, the percentage of MitoTag+ neurons was not different between the ipsilateral and contralateral DRG (Fig. 2g–i), suggesting that neuronal activity is required for mitochondrial transfer. Mitochondria remained present in SGCs after the nerve blockade (Fig. 2h), suggesting that the blockade impaired transfer rather than biogenesis of mitochondria. Together, these results suggest that SGC-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer is regulated by neuronal activity and specific pathological conditions.

Given the role of spinal cord astrocytes in regulating physiological and pathological pain, we next investigated whether mitochondrial transfer occurs between astrocytes and neurons in the spinal cord using the same Aldh1l1-creERT2 system. No MitoTag signal was detected in Tam-untreated animals (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We did not observe any mitochondrial transfer from astrocytes to spinal neurons at either five or ten days post-Tam induction, but MitoTag labelling clearly delineated individual astrocyte territories (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). SEM imaging of the spinal cord revealed cilia-like structures, but no tube-like connections between astrocytes and neurons or between astrocytes themselves (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). To evaluate the directionality of mitochondrial transfer, we crossed MitoTag mice with Advillin-cre mice to drive sensory neuron-specific expression. This resulted in strong MitoTag labelling in DRG neurons but only minimal signal in SGCs (labelled with FABP7), indicating predominantly one-way transfer from SGCs to neurons. Similarly, mitochondrial transfer from neurons to macrophages (labelled with IBA1 (also known as AIF1)) in the DRG was minimal (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). Finally, enabling MitoTag expression in macrophages using Cx3cr1-creERT2 mice did not result in detectable mitochondrial transfer from macrophages to sensory neurons in the DRG (Extended Data Fig. 7d–f). Together, these in vivo findings strongly support specific and unidirectional mitochondrial transfer from SGCs to sensory neurons under the experimental conditions tested.

To investigate SGC-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer in relation to neuronal hyperactivity after SNI, we used ex vivo calcium imaging in DRG using jRGECO1a, a sensitive calcium indicator with red fluorescence27. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding jRGECO1a (AAV-MaCPNS2-Syn-jRGECO1a) were injected intraperitoneally into Aldh1l1:MitoTag mice at postnatal day 0 (P0; Fig. 2j). Four weeks later, mice underwent SNI surgery followed by five Tam injections, and L4–L5 DRG were collected for ex vivo calcium imaging (Fig. 2j–n). jRGECO1a fluorescence was detected in many small-sized DRG neurons (Fig. 2k), predominantly in MitoTag-negative neurons (Fig. 2k–m). Among 334 neurons in the SNI group, only 3 (less than 1%) were positive for both MitoTag and jRGECO1a (Fig. 2n). In non-SNI controls, both MitoTag and jRGECO1a signals were greatly reduced, with no colocalization (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d). Cell size analysis showed MitoTag+ signals in medium-to-large neurons, whereas jRGECO1a+ signals appeared mainly in small-to-medium neurons (Extended Data Fig. 8e). As a positive control, KCl depolarization evoked jRGECO1a responses in neurons of all sizes, confirming that there was no size-selective labelling (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g).

Together, these findings indicate that: (1) SNI induces neuronal hyperactivity primarily in small-sized neurons; and (2) mitochondrial transfer from SGCs may preferentially protect medium-to-large neurons from becoming hyperactive after nerve injury. This protective mechanism may have implications for the pathogenesis of small fibre neuropathy in neuropathic pain28.

TNTs contain F-actin but lack microtubules9, contributing to their high elasticity. Ultrastructural analysis by SEM and cryo-electron microscopy has revealed the presence of MYO10 in TNTs29. Analysis of a published mouse DRG single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset30 revealed Myo10 enrichment in SGCs (Fig. 3a). Immunostaining confirmed MYO10 expression in mouse SGCs, co-localizing with the SGC marker FABP7. (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). To evaluate the role of MYO10 in TNT formation, we knocked down Myo10 in cultured SGCs with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and co-cultured them with DRG neurons (Fig. 3c). Immunocytochemistry revealed MYO10 expression in SGCs and TNTs connecting to neurons (Fig. 3d). MYO10 knockdown reduced the MYO10 signal (Fig. 3e), markedly decreased TNTs (Fig. 3f), and impaired mitochondrial transfer to neurons (Fig. 3g). We validated these results in vivo by microinjecting siRNA targeting Myo10 (siMyo10) or control siRNA into DRG of Aldh1l1:MitoTag mice (Fig. 3h). siMyo10 decreased SGC-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer (Fig. 3i,j), lowered paw withdrawal threshold at day 3 (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c), and disrupted TNT-LS in the DRG (Extended Data Fig. 9d–f and Supplementary Fig. 4). To further assess MYO10 in TNT formation and pain, we analysed Myo10-knockout (tm1d) mice, which we generated in an earlier study31. Since homozygous deletion is semi-lethal with frequent exencephaly31, we used heterozygous (Myo10+/−) mice for behavioural and anatomical analyses. Compared with wild-type controls, Myo10+/− mice exhibited heightened mechanical and thermal sensitivity (Fig. 3k,l and Extended Data Fig. 9g–i). SEM revealed wider gaps between SGCs and neurons and reduced TNT-LS following Myo10 knockdown (Fig. 3m–p). Together, these findings demonstrate that MYO10 is essential for TNT formation, mitochondrial transfer and SGC–neuron contact, and even partial loss disrupts TNT formation and promotes pain hypersensitivity.

To test the role of TNTs in vivo, we microinjected MitoTracker into the DRG. MitoTracker signal was observed in both neurons and SGCs, but application of CytoB decreased signal intensity and the percentage of labelled neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c), underscoring the crucial role of TNTs in mitochondrial transfer in vivo. To assess mitochondrial health, we treated SGCs with PTX and co-cultured these cells with healthy neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10d). JC-1 aggregate signals were reduced in both SGCs and neurons, suggesting transfer of dysfunctional mitochondria from SGCs to neurons. CytoB blocked this PTX-induced loss (Extended Data Fig. 10d,e). Seahorse analysis further showed that CytoB reduced oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in SGC–neuron co-cultures (Extended Data Fig. 10f). Sensory neurons damaged by nerve injury or chemotherapy exhibit abnormal hyperactivity that drives pain sensitivity32. PTX pretreatment enhanced calcium responses to capsaicin in primary cultured DRG neurons (Extended Data Fig. 11a–c). Notably, co-culture with SGCs suppressed this effect, but CytoB abolished this protection, implicating TNTs in SGCs-mediated neuroprotection (Extended Data Fig. 11a–c). Similarly, SGCs prevented PTX-induced increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an effect that is lost with CytoB (Extended Data Fig. 11d). Capsazepine (CPZ) blocked capsaicin responses under all conditions, confirming TRPV1 specificity (Extended Data Fig. 11e,f). Together, these findings suggest that PTX increases neuronal ROS, driving hyperactivity, whereas SGCs counteract these effects by transferring mitochondria to neurons via TNTs to reduce ROS and suppress hyperexcitability.

Given the long axons of DRG neurons, impaired mitochondrial trafficking has been strongly implicated in neuropathic pain conditions including CIPN and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). To test the role of SGC-derived mitochondria in neuropathic pain, we adoptively transferred MitoTracker-labelled SGCs (treated with vehicle or PTX) into mouse DRG. Mitochondrial signals appeared in both neurons and GFAP+ SGCs and extended into spinal nerve axons, indicating anterograde transport (Extended Data Fig. 12a–e). PTX-treated SGCs exhibited impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics (Extended Data Fig. 12c), and their transfer did not support axonal mitochondrial transport (Extended Data Fig. 12d,e), indicating that dysfunctional SGC mitochondria cannot sustain long-range neuronal delivery. To determine whether dysfunctional SGC mitochondria affect axonal growth, we performed SGC–neuron co-cultures. PTX-treated SGCs impaired axonal growth, an effect that was reversed by CytoB, implicating TNT-mediated transfer (Extended Data Fig. 12f,g). In vivo, intra-DRG CytoB induced dose-dependent mechanical hypersensitivity (days 1–5), similar to the mitochondrial toxin antimycin A (Extended Data Fig. 12h,i). Both treatments also reduced intraepidermal nerve fibre (IENF) density (Extended Data Fig. 12j). Similarly, low-dose PTX reduced IENFs two weeks after treatment (Extended Data Fig. 12k,l). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that chemotherapy damages SGCs, and impaired SGC-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer contributes to IENF loss and CIPN.

Mouse and human SGCs exhibit distinct transcriptomes, which may hinder translation of pain therapeutics33. To examine whether TNT-LS exist in human DRG, we performed SEM on DRG tissues provided by National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) from healthy donors and those with diabetes (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 13a–h and Supplementary Table 1). Immunostaining confirmed SGC-specific expression of FABP7 (Fig. 4b), with inner SGCs closely enwrapping neurons and others positioned 10–20 μm away as outer SGCs. High-resolution SEM imaging revealed TNT-LS connecting SGCs to neurons and to each other, often containing vesicle-like bulges (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 13d,e). To profile human SGCs, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on DRG from two donors. Clustering of 11,576 human DRG nuclei identified 17 clusters and 6 major cell types (Fig. 4d,e, Extended Data Fig. 14a–f and Supplementary Table 2). SGCs represent the largest cell population in the human DRG, comprising 31.1% of total cells (Fig. 4f) and separated into two clusters, cluster 1 and cluster 2, on the basis of gene expression profiles (enriched genes listed in Supplementary Table 3). Consistent with a prior report34, human SGCs were identified by the expression of FABP7 and EDNRB (Extended Data Fig. 14a). MYO10 was highly enriched in SGCs (Fig. 4g), with a violin plot showing much higher expression in SGCs than neurons (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4h). RNAscope in situ hybridization confirmed MYO10 colocalization with FABP7 in SGCs (Fig. 4i). Notably, MYO10 expression in SGCs was downregulated in DRG from donors with diabetes compared with those without (Fig. 4i, j).

We next examined morphological changes of SGCs and TNTs in human DRG from donors with or without diabetes. DRG from individuals with diabetes showed enlarged neuron–SGC gaps (0.1 μm in control versus 1–4 μm in diabetes), irregular and unsmooth TNTs, and multilayered SGCs (Extended Data Fig. 13g,h). Consistently, SEM of CIPN mice two weeks after PTX revealed enlarged gaps compared with naive and recovered mice, with TNTs appearing more visible owing to gap expansion (Extended Data Fig. 3c–f). Whereas less than 8% of neurons displayed clear gaps under normal conditions, around 50% did so after PTX (Extended Data Fig. 3d–f). These results imply that neuron–SGC separation, enlarged gaps and disrupted TNTs after chemotherapy impair neuro–glial interactions and contribute to peripheral neuropathy. We tested mitochondrial transfer between SGCs and neurons from human DRG donors with and without diabetes. MitoTracker-labelled SGCs transferred mitochondria to neurons via TNTs in non-diabetic cultures, but this transfer was reduced in diabetic DRG (Fig. 4k–m). Directionality assays showed that transfer was more efficient from SGCs to neurons than the reverse (Extended Data Fig. 15a–d). Notably, 83.3% of neurons received mitochondria, with 35.3% being associated with TNT structures (Extended Data Fig. 15e). These findings suggest that neurons preferentially acquire mitochondria from SGCs, probably reflecting their high energy demands.

To investigate whether adoptive transfer of healthy SGCs alleviates neuropathic pain via mitochondrial transfer, we injected human SGCs from healthy donors into the lumbar DRG of diabetic db/db mice. Pretreatment of SGCs with siRNA targeting MYO10 (siMYO10) abolished the analgesic effect observed with control siRNA-treated SGCs, which reduced mechanical hypersensitivity and enhanced mitochondrial function (Fig. 5a–c). To further evaluate the role of MYO10, we transferred SGCs from wild-type or Myo10+/− mice into PTX-treated mice, followed by behavioural testing (Fig. 5d). Wild-type SGCs reduced mechanical hypersensitivity within 1–2 days, whereas Myo10+/− SGCs did not do so (Fig. 5e). These results indicate that adoptively transferred SGCs can alleviate neuropathic pain in the CIPN model and that MYO10 is critical for SGC-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer via TNTs. We next explored direct mitochondrial transfer as a strategy for managing neuropathic pain. MitoTracker-labelled mitochondria isolated from cultured SGCs were injected into the DRG (Extended Data Fig. 16a), where they localized to both neurons and SGCs without TNT formation (Extended Data Fig. 16b,c). CytoB had no effect on mitochondrial uptake; however, Pitstop2 reduced MitoTracker signals (Extended Data Fig. 16d–f), indicating that endocytosis mediates internalization of adoptively transferred mitochondria.

Source Data

We isolated mitochondria from primary mouse cultures of SGCs, treated them with vehicle or the mitochondrial complex III inhibitor myxothiazol20, and injected them into the DRG of PTX-injected mice (Extended Data Fig. 16g). Transfer of healthy mitochondria mitigated mechanical pain, whereas transfer of myxothiazol-treated mitochondria abolished this effect (Extended Data Fig. 16h). We also performed conditioned place preference (CPP) to measure ongoing pain35 and found increased CPP scores in the mitochondria-treated group (Extended Data Fig. 16i,j). Furthermore, we conducted a cross-species mitochondrial transfer by administration of human mitochondria, isolated from human SGCs of non-diabetic and diabetic donors, into the lumbar DRG of PTX-treated mice (Fig. 5f). Seahorse measurement showed reduced basal OCR in diabetic SGCs compared with non-diabetic controls (Extended Data Fig. 16k). Mitochondria from healthy SGCs reduced mechanical pain for two days, whereas those from diabetic SGCs produced only transient relief (6 h; Fig. 5g). In db/db mice, transfer of mitochondrial from non-diabetic but not diabetic SGCs reduced neuropathic pain (Fig. 5h,i) and increased IENF density in hindpaw skin (Fig. 5j). Taken together, these in vivo results support our in vitro findings and highlight the therapeutic potential of SGC-derived mitochondria in treating nerve degeneration and neuropathic pain.

Our study provides comprehensive in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo evidence that SGCs transfer mitochondria to adjacent sensory neurons in the DRG, thus revealing a protective role against peripheral neuropathy. Although TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer was first identified two decades ago9, in vivo evidence has been elusive. Our scanning and TEM imaging revealed TNT-like tubes containing mitochondria in mouse and human DRG. We also identified MYO10 as a key regulator of TNT formation between SGCs and neurons in the DRG (Supplementary Fig. 5). MYO10 is highly enriched in SGCs, as demonstrated by in situ hybridization and snRNA-seq. Our knockdown experiments demonstrate that MYO10-mediated TNT formation is essential for SGC-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer in vitro and in vivo. In addition, endocytosis and connexin 43-mediated gap junction communication are also critically involved. Moreover, connexin 43-containing gap junctions not only regulate pain3 but also stabilize TNTs and facilitate mitochondrial transfer10.

Mitochondrial transfer has been implicated in diverse diseases, including obesity36, stroke14, inflammatory pain20 and cancer37,38. Our study demonstrates that SGC-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer occurs under physiological conditions, and its dysregulation drives neuropathic pain in animal models of nerve injury, CIPN and DPN. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a hallmark of CIPN2 and DPN1, is associated with pain, tingling and paraesthesia39, along with IENF loss40. Our findings provide direct evidence that impaired mitochondrial transfer from SGCs to DRG neuronal cell bodies is sufficient to trigger IENF degeneration and neuropathic pain behaviours. Small fibre neuropathy is common in chronic pain conditions, including CIPN, DPN and fibromyalgia41, We found that SGC-derived mitochondrial transfer preferentially targets medium- and large-sized neurons, but not small nociceptors, providing mechanistic insights into small fibre neuropathy.

Mitochondria represent important drug targets in neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic diseases42. Our gain-of-function approaches propose multiple strategies for mitochondrial therapy in peripheral neuropathy, including adoptive transfer of SGCs to the DRG and direct delivery of SGC-derived mitochondria (Fig. 5k and Extended Data Fig. 17). Cross-species transfer of human mitochondria transfer to mouse DRG also confers protection, consistent with reports of rapid and efficient interspecies mitochondrial fusion43. A limitation of this study is that Aldh1l1 is expressed in other glia, such as astrocytes; future work will use lines with greater SGC specificity. Further studies are needed to validate TNT-like structures using higher-resolution and more specific electron microscopy approaches. In summary, SGCs regulate pain via multiple neuro–glial pathways involving ATP, cytokines, potassium channels and gap junctions3,33. We identified a previously unrecognized mechanism in which SGCs transfer mitochondria to sensory neurons, protecting against neuropathic pain. We demonstrated TNT-like ultrastructures in mouse and human DRG and established that MYO10-mediated mitochondrial transfer is a key protective pathway. These findings offer mechanistic insight into small fibre neuropathy and highlight mitochondrial transfer as a potential therapeutic strategy.

Transgenic male and female mice (8 to 12 weeks of age) were used for behavioural and biochemical experiments. Trpv1-Cre mice (JAX: 017769), Aldh1l1-creERT2 mice (JAX: 031008), Advillin-Cre mice (JAX: 032536), Cx3cr1-creERT2 mice (JAX: 020940), Ai9 mice (JAX: 007909), GCaMP6f mice (JAX: 024105), MitoTag mice (JAX: 032675), and BKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ Leprdb/J mice (JAX: 000642) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Male and female CD1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Generation of Myo10 knockout mice (tm1d) and mouse genotyping were described previously31. Mice were maintained at the Duke animal facility. db/db mice aged 12–16 weeks were used. All mouse experiments were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were housed in an AAALAC-accredited animal facility under a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle, with food and water provided ad libitum. All animals were housed at 22 ± 1 °C and 30–70 % humidity.

A total of 16 human DRG samples were obtained from donors with and without diabetes (Supplementary Table 1) through the NDRI, under exemption approval from the Duke Institutional Review Board (IRB, Pro00051508). Diabetes was identified on the basis of medical history provided in the NDRI reports.

PTX (T7402), Tam (T5648), oligomycin (O4876), carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (C2920), rotenone (R8875), antimycin A (A8674), myxothiazol (T5580), CBX (C4790), CytoB (C2743) and Y-27632 (688001) were obtained from Sigma. Pitstop2 (ab120687) was obtained from Abcam. CPZ was obtained from MCE (HY-15640). TTX (1078) was obtained from Tocris. siMyo10 (siRNA ID: 157002), siMYO10 (siRNA ID: 118391) and negative control siRNA (4459405) were obtained from Ambion Life Technology.

Mouse primary DRG neuron cultures were prepared as described44. In brief, DRG were digested with collagenase (0.2 mg ml−1, Sigma, 10103578001) and Dispase-II (3 mg ml−1, Sigma, D4693) for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were then mechanically dissociated with a pipette, filtered through a 70-µm nylon mesh, and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. The cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with 0.1 mg ml−1 poly-d-lysine (Thermo, A3890401) and cultured in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2% B27 supplement, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Neurobasal-supplemented medium) at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Mouse DRG SGCs were prepared as previously described15. DRG were enzymatically digested with collagenase and Dispase-II for 90 min at 37 °C. The tissue was then mechanically dissociated using a pipette, filtered through a 70-μm nylon mesh, and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. Cells were seeded onto 35-mm cell culture dishes (VWR, 10861-656) without poly-d-lysine coating and maintained in Neurobasal-supplemented medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2. On day 3 in vitro (DIV3), non-SGCs—including neurons—were removed by vigorously shaking the culture dishes by hand for 15–20 s, leaving behind a purified adherent layer of SGCs.

For in vitro mitochondrial transfer experiments, DIV5 SGCs were labelled with 20 nM MitoTracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher, M22426) in culture medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with PBS. MitoTracker-labelled SGCs were collected using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, 25200-056) and seeded onto coverslips pre-seeded with cultured DRG neurons. Mitochondrial transfer inhibitors, including the TNT formation inhibitor CytoB (3.5 μM) and Y-27632 (10 μM), the endocytosis inhibitor Pitstop 2 (20 μM) or the gap junction blocker CBX (20 μM), were added to the SGC–neuron co-cultures. After 24 h of incubation, cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 inverted confocal microscope.

Primary cultured SGCs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies: GFAP (mouse, 1:400, Millipore Sigma, G3893), FABP7 (mouse, 1:1,000, Neuromics, MO22188), Kir4.1 (rabbit, 1:500, Alomone, APC-035), AQP4 (rabbit, 1:500, Proteintech, 16473-1-AP), connexin 43 (CX43; rabbit, 1:500, Zymed, 71-0700), glutamine synthetase (GS; rabbit, 1:500, Novus, NB110-41404), and MYO10 (rabbit, 1:500, Sigma, HPA024223). After PBS washes, cells were incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope.

Primary mouse DRG neurons were co-cultured with SGCs for 72 h and subsequently fixed with 4% PFA. Fixed cells were subjected to immunocytochemistry using a βIII-tubulin antibody (1:1,000, Abcam, ab18207) overnight at 4 °C. Immunofluorescence images were acquired with a Nikon fluorescence microscope, and neurite length was quantified using the SNT plugin in ImageJ.

Postmortem L2–L5 DRG were collected from diabetic and healthy donors and delivered in an ice-cold cell culture medium to the laboratory at Duke University within 24–48 h postmortem. Human DRG cultures were prepared as described45. DRG were digested with collagenase and Dispase-II for 120 to 150 min at 37 °C. Cells were then mechanically dissociated using pipettes and centrifuged (300g for 5 min). Cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips for neuron culture and into uncoated dishes for SGC culture, and grown in Neurobasal-supplemented medium. On DIV2, non-SGCs were removed by vigorously shaking the culture dishes by hand for 15–20 s. Human SGCs were incubated with 20 nM MitoTracker Deep Red in culture medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 30 min, then co-cultured with human DRG neurons for 24 h.

Bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared as described20. In brief, L-929 cells (CCL-1) were obtained from ATCC and authenticated by ATCC. Bone marrow was collected from mice and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 20% L-929 cell-conditioned medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Macrophages or SGCs were seeded on coverslips and labelled with 20 nM MitoTracker Deep Red then co-culture with the whole-mount DRG. CytoB, (3.5 μM) or vehicle was added to medium. Images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 880 inverted confocal microscope.

Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher, 11668027). In brief, siRNA targeting Myo10, MYO10 and control siRNA was diluted in 100 μl Opti-MEM, and 0.4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was diluted in a separate 100 μl Opti-MEM solution. Two solutions were combined and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before being added to the culture dish to make a 15 nM siRNA concentration. The culture medium was replaced 6 h after transfection. siRNA sequences are included as follows: siMyo10: sense, CCUACAAGCAGAGUACAAUtt; antisense, AUUGUACUCUGCUUGUAGGtg; siMYO10: sense: GGUAUUCACUUACAAGCAGtt; antisense: CUGCUUGUAAGUGAAUACCtg.

Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the JC-1 dye (Invitrogen, T3168), a commonly used indicator of mitochondrial health46. Mouse primary SGCs were incubated with JC-1 (2 μg ml−1) for 30 min at 37 °C. JC-1 accumulates in mitochondria in a membrane potential-dependent manner: monomeric forms emit green fluorescence (excitation 485 nm/emission 516 nm), while aggregated forms emit red fluorescence (excitation 579 nm/emission 599 nm), with higher red signal indicating healthier mitochondria. JC-1 fluorescence was monitored in real time using a VivaView FL Incubator Fluorescence Microscope (Olympus) over 24 h. Differential interference contrast images were automatically captured every 30 min at multiple positions.

Mitochondria of SGCs were labelled with 20 nM MitoTracker Green (Thermo, M7514). SIM imaging was performed using an inverted Zeiss Elyra 7 microscope equipped with a 63× oil-immersion objective. SIM2 image processing was conducted using Zeiss Zen Black software. Mitochondrial length was quantified using the Mitochondria Analyzer plugin in ImageJ (v.1.53q).

OCR was measured using an XFe96 Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent) as described11. In brief, primary DRG neurons and SGCs were seeded in XFe96 cell culture microplates (Agilent, 101085-004) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 before measurement. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed and placed in Seahorse XF base medium (Agilent, 103575-100) containing 10 mM glucose (Agilent, 103577-100), 1 mM pyruvate (Agilent, 103578-100) and 2 mM glutamine (Agilent, 103579-100). Each assay cycle consisted of 3 min of mixing, 1 min of waiting, and 3 min of OCR measurements. Following three baseline OCR measurements, oligomycin (0.5 μM), FCCP (2 μM), and rotenone/antimycin A (0.5 μM each) were sequentially added. OCR values were normalized to the cell number. Fresh tissue mitochondrial bioenergetics were also measured with the XFe96 Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer as described47. In brief, sciatic nerves or whole-mount DRG were freshly isolated and placed into XFe96 spheroid microplates (Agilent, 102978-100) containing Seahorse XF base medium supplemented with 5.5 mM glucose, 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate and 1 mM glutamine. OCR was normalized to protein content. Oligomycin (12 μM), FCCP (20 μM), and rotenone/antimycin A (20 μM each) were sequentially injected during the assay. An assay cycle of 3 min mixing, 3 min waiting, and 4 min measurement was repeated 3 times for baseline rates and after each port injection.

DRG primary neurons were cultured from Advillin:GCaMP6f mice. Cells were plated on coverslips precoated with poly-D-lysine (Corning, 354087) and grown in a Neurobasal- supplemented medium. Neurons were co-cultured with SGCs following the previously described procedures. The calcium imaging buffer composition was as follows: 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose. The buffer solution was perfused through the culture during baseline acquisition, followed by the addition of 100 nM capsaicin, and 60 mM KCl. The calcium indicator Fura2-AM was used for calcium imaging for the TRPV1 antagonist experiment. Dissociated mouse DRG neurons were loaded with 5 μM Fura2-AM (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, F1221) for 45 min and then replaced with calcium imaging buffer. Cells were pretreated with CPZ (100 μM)48 for 3 min prior to capsaicin perfusion. This perfusion procedure was applied uniformly across all four experimental groups. Calcium signals were captured and expressed as F values, representing fluorescence intensity49.

ROS levels were measured using the ROS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher, 88-5930-74) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primary DRG neuron cultures were assigned to four experimental groups with overnight treatment: (1) vehicle control; (2) PTX (1 μg ml−1) (3) PTX with SGC co-culture; and (4) PTX with SGC co-culture plus CytoB (3.5 μM).

For whole-mount mouse DRG and spinal cord imaging, fresh L4–L5 DRG and lumber spinal cord were collected and cut with Vannas spring scissors (FST, 15019-10) to create a flat surface. DRG and spinal cord were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in PBS buffer for 1 h at room temperature after tissue collection. After dehydration with 100% ethanol overnight at 4 °C, the samples were ready for the next preparation step. To examine whether trypsin affects the structure of DRG (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), DRG tissues were treated with 0.25% trypsin for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by hydrolysis with 8 N HCl at room temperature for 20 min, and then fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, according to a previously described SEM protocol for DRG21. To improve the visualization of TNTs, mice were transcardially perfused with PBS and followed by 4% PFA, and then L4–L5 DRG were collected and immersed in 30% sucrose for over 3 nights at 4 °C. Subsequently, DRG were sectioned by a cryostat (Leica CM 1950). Alternatively, DRG were directly placed in 3% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature for fixation, followed by dehydration with 100% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. Sample preparation by the critical point drying (Ladd CPD3), then the DRG and spinal cord samples were sputter-coated with gold for 300 s at 12 mA (Denton Desk V). Imaging was performed using an Apreo 2 scanning electron microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific) with a 2.00 kV accelerating voltage and 25 pA emission current at Duke University Shared Materials Instrumentation Facility. Multiple detectors (ETD, T1, T2 and T3) were utilized, and immersion mode with T1, T2 and T3 detectors was used to capture high-magnification images.

Fresh human DRG (L2–L5) were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde upon delivery, and then immersed in 30% sucrose for at least 3 nights at 4 °C. Free-floating sections (30 μm) were cut using a cryostat. Some sections were processed for SEM, while adjacent sections were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). For SEM, imaging was performed using an Apreo 2 scanning electron microscope. Multiple detectors (ETD, T1, T2, and T3) were used. For immunohistochemistry, adjacent sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-FABP7 antibody (rabbit, 1:100). The next day, sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:400) and Nissl/NeuroTrace-640 for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were mounted using DAPI Fluoromount-G and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope.

Dissected DRG tissue was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for at least 1 h at room temperature, then stored at 4 °C. Samples were washed with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, followed by post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h at room temperature. After three additional rinses in buffer, tissues were dehydrated through a graded acetone series and embedded in epoxy resin. Semi-thin sections (500 nm) and ultrathin sections (70–80 nm) were cut using a LEICA EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica). Ultrathin sections were collected on copper grids, post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and imaged using a JEOL 2100 Transmission Electron Microscope (Duke Center for Electron Microscopy and Nanoscale Technology) at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV.

CIPN was induced by intraperitoneal injections of PTX at 2 mg kg−1 every other day for 4 doses. Type 2 DPN was modelled using db/db mice (JAX: 000642). Type 1 diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal administration of STZ (150 mg kg−1; Sigma-Aldrich, S0130)50. SNI surgery was performed as previously described51. In brief, the common peroneal and tibial nerves were ligated and transected, while the sural nerve was left intact. Inflammatory pain was induced by intraplantar injection of 20 μl CFA into the hindpaw52.

We previously utilized bio-resorbable PEU films for the controlled release of local anaesthetics in pain management26,53. Bupivacaine-loaded films (40% w/w, ~0.3 mg bupivacaine per film) and blank control films were prepared in the laboratory of M.L.B. Bupivacaine-containing films were wrapped around the ipsilateral sciatic nerve during SNI surgery.

MitoTag mice were crossed with Aldh1l1-creERT2, Advillin-cre and Cx3cr1-creERT2 lines. In inducible Cre lines, recombination was induced by Tam administration54. Tam was prepared in a solution of 10% ethanol and 90% corn oil (Sigma, C8267). Mice received intraperitoneal injections of Tam at 100 mg kg−1 once daily for 5 consecutive days. DRG and spinal cord tissues were collected for mitochondrial imaging analysis.

Mitochondria were isolated from fresh dissected DRG tissue as described23. In brief, fresh DRG were dissected from Aldh1l1-MitoTag mice. The samples were then subjected to nitrogen cavitation, and after depressurization, nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtered through a pre-separation filter (130-041-407; Miltenyi Biotec) to obtain the crude mitochondrial fraction. For immunocapture of mitochondria against eGFP, the crude mitochondrial fraction was incubated with GFP beads for 1 h. LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) were then used to separate GFP microbead-coated mitochondria (immunoprecipitate) and mitochondria without GFP (supernatant) from the solution. For western blot analysis, GFP antibodies (goat, 1:1,000, Abcam, ab5450) were used to examine the eGFP, and anti-COX4 (rabbit, 1:1,000, Abcam, ab16056) was used as a mitochondrial loading control.

AAV production was performed using the following plasmids: pAdDeltaF6 (Addgene #112867), pUCmini-iCAP-AAV.MaCPNS2 (Addgene #185137), and pAAV.Syn.NES-jRGECO1a.WPRE.SV40 (Addgene #100854). HEK293T cells (CRL-3216) obtained from ATCC, and authentication was performed by ATCC through morphological and STR profiling. HEK293T cells were not tested for mycoplasma contamination. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium for transfection. Cells were transfected with 30 μg pAdDeltaF6, 15 μg pUCmini-iCAP-AAV.MaCPNS2, and 15 μg jRGECO1a plasmids using PEI MAX (Polysciences, 24765). After 72 h, cells were collected and lysed in 4 ml lysis buffer (15 mM NaCl, 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) through three freeze-thaw cycles. Lysates were incubated with benzonase (50 U ml−1; Millipore, 70664) for 30 min at 37 °C and then centrifuged at 4,500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was layered onto a stepwise iodixanol gradient (15%, 25%, 40% and 60%) and centrifuged at 67,000 rpm for 1.5 h at 18 °C using a Beckman Ti-70 rotor. The viral fraction was collected from the 40%–60% interface, and concentrated using a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff filter (Millipore, UFC910008). Purified viral aliquots were stored at –80 °C until use.

AAV-MaCPNS2-Syn-jRGECO1a (3 × 1011 viral genomes per mouse) was administered intraperitoneally to MitoTag mice at postnatal day 0. Four weeks post-injection, mice underwent SNI surgery and received Tam (100 mg kg−1, intraperitoneal injection) once daily for 5 consecutive days. Ex vivo calcium imaging was performed 3–7 days after surgery. L4–L6 DRG were dissected and incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Live imaging was conducted using a Zeiss LSM 780 upright confocal microscope equipped with a 20× water-immersion objective. Images were acquired with 50 cycles over a 15 min time-lapse session for each DRG. Data were analysed using FIJI (ImageJ) software.

siMyo10 and siCtrl were mixed with RVG-9R peptide in 5% glucose at a peptide/siRNA molar ratio of 2:1 before use, following a previously described protocol55. Intra-DRG injection was performed as described previously56. In brief, a partial laminectomy was performed to expose the left L4 and L5 DRG. A total volume of 1 μl containing 4 μg of siRNA was delivered to each DRG using a gelatin sponge as the delivery matrix.

For intrathecal drug delivery, antimycin A (110 ng), CytoB (70 ng and 350 ng), or Pitstop2 (120 ng) was diluted in 10 μl of PBS and administered via lumbar puncture using a 30-gauge needle between the L5–L6 vertebral levels. Successful intrathecal delivery was confirmed by observing a characteristic tail-flick response57.

Mitochondrial labelling in the DRG was performed based on a previously described protocol with minor modifications58. A total volume of 0.6 μl Mitotracker Deep Red FM (2 μM; Thermo, M22426), with or without CytoB, was injected into the L4–L5 DRG using a Hamilton syringe connected to a glass micropipette. Injected DRG were collected 24 h post-injection, embedded in OCT medium, and sectioned at 20 μm thickness using a cryostat. Immunohistochemistry was then performed on these sections using antibodies against GFAP, along with Nissl staining.

SGCs were collected from primary cell cultures, and 8,000 cells suspended in 1 μl PBS were injected intra-ganglionically into the L4 and L5 DRG using a Hamilton syringe connected to a glass micropipette. In select experiments, SGCs were pre-labelled with 20 nM MitoTracker Deep Red FM in culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by three PBS washes prior to injection.

Mitochondria were isolated from SGCs following a previously described protocol59 with minor modifications. In brief, SGCs were detached from culture dishes, pelleted, and resuspended in MIB buffer (210 mM D-mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.5% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA, pH 7.2) at 4 °C. Cells were homogenized with 25 strokes and centrifuged at 600g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 7,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria isolated from 10,000 SGCs in 1 μl of PBS were injected intra-ganglionically into the L4 and L5 DRG using a Hamilton syringe and glass micropipette. In select experiments, to inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, SGCs were pretreated with 1 mM myxothiazol (Sigma, T5580) for 10 min prior to mitochondrial isolation.

For von Frey testing, mechanical sensitivity was assessed with a set of von Frey filaments (Stoelting) with logarithmically increasing stiffness ranging from 0.02 g to 2.56 g, which were applied to the hindpaw plantar surface, and a quick withdrawal or licking response to the stimulus was considered a positive response. PWT was calculated using the up-down method. For assessing mechanical allodynia, paw withdrawal frequency (PWF) to a 0.16 g von Frey filament was measured by observing reflexive withdrawal responses within 10 stimulations, and a quick withdrawal or licking response to the stimulus was considered a positive response. Hargreaves test was used to assess heat sensitivity. Paw withdrawal latency was measured with a Hargreaves radiant heat apparatus (IITC Life Science). CPP assay was used to measure ongoing pain in mice44. Mice were habituated for 3 days with 30 min of preconditioning in a two-compartment CPP chamber consisting of white and dark chambers. The baseline behaviour of the mice was recorded on the fourth day using a camera and automatically tracked for 15 min with ANY-Maze software (Stoelting). On the fifth day (conditioning day), mice underwent a 30 min pairing session without intra-DRG injection in the preferred CPP chamber in the morning session, followed by a 30 min pairing session with intra-DRG injection in the non-preferred CPP chamber in the afternoon session. Twenty-four hours later, mice were placed in the CPP test box with access to both chambers, and their behaviour was recorded for 15 min. The time spent in both chambers was analysed using ANY-Maze software. The CPP score, measured in seconds, was calculated as the inverse of the time spent in the preferred chamber, using the formula: post-preference time minus pre-preference time.

Following terminal anaesthesia with isoflurane, mice were transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 20 ml of 4% PFA in PBS. The DRG, spinal nerves and hindpaw skins were collected, fixed in 4% PFA and immersed in 30% sucrose at 4 °C for at least 3 nights. Tissues were then embedded in OCT medium (Tissue-Tek), and sections were prepared using a cryostat at the following thicknesses: DRG (20 μm), spinal cord (30 μm), spinal nerve (20 μm), and skin tissue (25 μm). Tissue sections were then blocked in a solution containing 5% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Next, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-FABP7 (mouse, 1:1,000, Neuromics, MO22188), anti-Iba1 (rabbit, 1:800, Wako, 019-19741), anti-GFAP (mouse, 1:400, Sigma, G3893), anti-MYO10 (rabbit, 1:500, Sigma, HPA024223), anti-TOM20 (rabbit, 1:600, Proteintech, 11802-1-AP) and anti-PGP9.5 (rabbit, 1:200, Thermo, PA5-29012). Following several washes with PBS, the sections were incubated with species-specific secondary antibodies and Nissl/NeuroTracer-640 (1:100, Thermo, N21483). Finally, the sections were mounted with coverslips using DAPI Fluoromount-G mounting medium (Southern Biotech, 0100-20). Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. For quantification of immunofluorescence staining, the same acquisition settings were applied to images requiring comparison under different conditions. Three sections were randomly selected from each mouse, and the integrated density of the fluorescence signal per section was measured using ImageJ software (v.1.53q). For intraepidermal nerve IENF analysis in mouse hindpaw skins, all ascending nerve fibre branches crossing into the epidermis were counted. Three randomly selected skin sections were analysed for each mouse.

Fresh human DRG were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C upon delivery. Free-floating sections (30 µm) were then cut using a cryostat. For MYO10 in situ hybridization, a human MYO10 RNAscope probe (RNAscope Probe Hs-MYO10, 440691), designed by Advanced Cell Diagnostics was used. The RNAscope protocol was followed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following the RNAscope steps, immunohistochemistry was performed as described below. The sections were blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with anti-FABP7 antibody (rabbit, 1:100, Thermo, PA5-24949) overnight at 4 °C. Images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with consistent acquisition settings across different samples. The integrated density of the fluorescence signal per section was measured using Image J (v.1.53q).

Human DRG tissues were snap-frozen and stored at –80 °C. Nuclei isolation was performed as previously described60. Single-nucleus capture was performed using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ system (v.3.1). Libraries from individual nuclei samples were pooled and sequenced on an MGISEQ-2000 platform. snRNA-seq reads were processed using Cell Ranger v.4.0.061, and alignment to the Human GRCh38 (GENCODE v.32/Ensembl98) reference genome performed using default parameters. Downstream analysis was conducted with Seurat v.4.3.062 using R v.4.3.0. Cells were filtered out if they expressed fewer than 200 genes or had more than 10% mitochondrial reads. Gene expression was then normalized and scaled using the NormalizeData and ScaleData functions from Seurat, respectively, with default settings, as well as the FindVariableFeatures function to identify the highly variable genes. Principal component analysis was carried out, and downstream analyses were based on the top 20 principal components. To address batch effects, datasets were integrated, re-normalized, scaled, and batch-corrected using Harmony v.0.1.163. Unsupervised clustering was done using the FindClusters function from Seurat with a resolution of 0.8. UMAP was applied to reduce the data to two dimensions. FindMarkers with default settings to get gene markers, and cell types within each cluster were annotated based on known marker genes and genes that were differentially expressed within each cluster.

Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical analyses were completed with Prism GraphPad 8.4. The sample sizes were based on our previous studies44,45. Each data point corresponds to an individual animal. All data were included in the analyses (no outliers removed). Data were analysed using unpaired t-test (two-sided) or Mann–Whitney test (two-sided) for comparison between two groups, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test, and two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's multiple comparisons test for two groups and Tukey's multiple comparisons test for more than two groups. A significance level of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Additional statistical details are included in Supplementary Table 4.

Palaeogenetic evidence suggests that the last common ancestor of present-day humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans lived around 765–550 thousand years ago (ka)1. However, both the geographical distribution and the morphology of these ancestral humans remain uncertain. The Homo antecessor fossils from the TD6 layer of Gran Dolina at Atapuerca, Spain, dated between 950 ka and 770 ka (ref. 2), have been proposed as potential candidates for this ancestral population3. However, all securely dated Homo sapiens fossils before 90 ka were found either in Africa or at the gateway to Asia, strongly suggesting an African rather than a Eurasian origin of our species. Here we describe new hominin fossils from the Grotte à Hominidés at Thomas Quarry I (ThI-GH) in Casablanca, Morocco, dated to around 773 ka. These fossils are similar in age to H. antecessor, yet are morphologically distinct, displaying a combination of primitive traits and of derived features reminiscent of later H. sapiens and Eurasian archaic hominins. The ThI-GH hominins provide insights into African populations predating the earliest H. sapiens individuals discovered at Jebel Irhoud in Morocco4 and provide strong evidence for an African lineage ancestral to our species. These fossils offer clues about the last common ancestor shared with Neanderthals and Denisovans.

Our understanding of the evolutionary history of both Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) and H. sapiens is firmly grounded in morphological, genetic and archaeological analyses of extensive fossil hypodigms and numerous prehistoric sites across Europe and Africa. However, identifying the last common ancestor of these two species remains challenging. At times, Homo heidelbergensis was proposed as this ancestor5. Yet, anatomical and chronological evidence suggests that fossils assigned to H. heidelbergensis may not represent a coherent species6. Most of the Eurasian specimens assigned to this species probably belong to the common ancestral form of the Neanderthals and their Asian sister group, the Denisovans, or belong to them, but are not ancestral to H. sapiens6. Some have considered a Eurasian origin of H. sapiens7, but the morphological evidence for this is limited. By contrast, recent fossil evidence has pushed back the presence of H. sapiens in Africa to over 300 ka (ref. 4), highlighting the need to understand hominin diversity in Africa during the late Early Pleistocene (EP) and the first half of the Middle Pleistocene (MP). MP African fossils—such as those from Kabwe (Zambia), Bodo (Ethiopia) and Saldanha (South Africa)—are generally considered close African relatives of H. heidelbergensis (or Homo rhodesiensis). Among MP African specimens, those from Ndutu (Tanzania) and Salé (Morocco) have been more closely associated with the ancestry of H. sapiens8.

Thomas Quarry I (ThI), located in the southwest part of the city of Casablanca, Morocco (Fig. 1a), represents a key archaeological locality in northwest Africa. ThI is excavated in the Oulad Hamida Formation (OHF)9,10 and comprises two primary sites (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2a).

a, Location map of ThI, modified according to ref. 13. b, Magnetostratigraphy of members OH3A, OH3B, OH4, GH-CCC and OH5 of ref. 13 and this study. The black bars represent normal polarity, and the white bars represent reverse polarity. Further details are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2. Magnetochron ages are from ref. 22. c, Photograph of the outcrop stratigraphy with indication of magnetic polarity from this study and a previous study13 and lithologic members. Here we focused on sections A–E, of which only section A is reported here. d, Magnetostratigraphy of sections A–E comprised stratigraphic units OH4 SU6–5 and GH-CCC SU4–3. Context and details for lithostratigraphic units are provided in Extended Data Fig. 2. The red stars with labels represent hominin remains (the larger stars indicate mandibles) (Extended Data Table 1): ThI-GH-UA28-7 (femur, a); ThI-GH-OA23-24 (tooth, b); ThI-GH-SA26-88 (tooth, c); ThI-GH-SA26-90 (tooth, d); ThI-GH-PA24-107 (tooth, e); ThI-GH-10717 (mandible) and ThI-GH-10717/1-5 (vertebrae, f); ThI-GH-10725 and ThI-GH-10725/1 (vertebrae, g); ThI-GH-10726 (vertebra, h); and ThI-GH-10978 (mandible, i). Note that ThI-GH-UA28-7 (a) is located outside the section on the right. Close to the bottom wall of the cavity, its insertion into the stratigraphy is imprecise (SU4/5).

In the oldest member of the OHF, the ThI-L site has yielded one of the most extensive early Acheulean lithic assemblages in Africa, dating back to around 1.3 million years ago11,12,13. The second site is a cave opened in the northeastern wall of the quarry named in 1994 Grotte à Hominidés (hereafter, ThI-GH) by the research team. In 1969, Philippe Beriro, an amateur collector, found a partial hominin mandible (ThI-GH-1) (Fig. 2) on a slope below the northwestern part of this cave, along with other mammal fossils and lithics. This material probably originated from the filling of the ThI-GH cave, which had been partially disturbed by quarrying activities14,15. ThI-GH-1 was initially described as Atlanthropus mauritanicus16. Subsequent systematic investigations at ThI-GH, carried out between 1994 and 2015, yielded an Acheulean industry, a diverse faunal assemblage and several additional hominin fossils in an undisputable stratigraphic context thanks to modern controlled excavations17,18,19.

ThI-GH is a cave that was carved during a marine high-stand into the older marine-aeolian OH1 and OH3 deposits of the OHF. It was filled by marine (OH4 stratigraphic unit 6, SU6) then supratidal (SU5) deposits and, without any discontinuity, by continental deposits (GH-CCC SU4 and SU3). Then, aeolian deposits (OH5) separated the latter from upper continental deposits (SU2 and SU1)10,18 (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). A rich palaeontological assemblage has been recovered from OH4 SU5 and GH-CCC SU4, with hominin remains and lithic artifacts17,18,19,20 (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Notes 2 and 3). The abundance of carnivores, numerous coprolites and carnivore-modified bone remains lacking evidence of cut or chop marks, combined with the scarcity of lithic artifacts, point to the presence of a carnivore den21 (Supplementary Note 2). The most representative hominin specimens have been found in SU5, including an adult mandible (ThI-GH-10717), eight associated vertebrae (ThI-GH-10717/1 to 5, ThI-GH-10725, ThI-GH-10726 and ThI-GH-10725/1) and a fragmentary mandible (ThI-GH-10978) of a child who died aged at most 1.5 years (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note 7). A portion of a hominin femoral shaft (ThI-GH-UA28-7) scavenged by a large carnivore, probably a hyena21, was found at the back of the cavity in a layer belonging to SU4 or SU5. Although the precise stratigraphic origin of the ThI-GH-1 hemimandible remains uncertain, sedimentological analysis of the embedding sediment suggests that it also probably derives from either SU4 or SU5 (ref. 18).

We proposed a chronostratigraphic and depositional model for the OHF within a sequence stratigraphy framework shaped by Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations and moderate regional uplift9,10,13. Sea-level transgressive phases mark calcarenite onlap and the carving of cliff and erosional notch at the base of previously lithified aeolian dunes, whereas regressive phases involve seaward progradation and the buildup of new dunes. Early cementation in semiarid, bioclastic-rich coastal settings allows rapid lithification9, enabling successive transgressive erosion and cliff formation (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). A previous study13 placed the Matuyama–Brunhes transition (MBT, 773 ka)22 close to the base of SU4 and recognized the Jaramillo subchron (1,070–990 ka) in member OH3. This interpretation excludes hiatus long enough to imply older subchrons like the Olduvai in place of the Jaramillo, which would also contradict the Acheulean lithics found at ThI-L. However, the preliminary sampling within the GH-CCC SU4 and OH4 SU5 deposits containing the human remains (five samples in section A) did not allow precise placement of the MBT in relation to these remains. We refined this model by adding 119 new magnetostratigraphic samples (Methods and Supplementary Note 5) from OH3, OH4 and GH-CCC to the 62 from ref. 13, improving the resolution of the Jaramillo and the MBT22 (Fig. 1b,c).

Characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) component directions of samples from two different sections yielded virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) latitudes indicating that the Jaramillo subchron lies within member OH3. Most of the samples from SU6 to SU3 (Fig. 1c,d (sections A–E)) provided VGP latitudes of reverse magnetic polarity or ChRM directions showing a tendency towards reverse polarity (Supplementary Note 5). This post-Jaramillo interval of dominant reverse polarity is punctuated by a thin normal polarity excursion in SU5. Above, a reverse-to-normal polarity transition occurs in GH-CCC close to the SU4–SU3 contact, with stable normal (Brunhes) polarity extending into GH-CCC-SU3 (Fig. 1d) and continuing into younger OH5 deposits (Fig. 1c).

These results reveal a detailed recording of the MBT occurring throughout SU6 to SU3. In records of high sediment accumulation rate (>15 cm per thousand years), the MBT is characterized by brief VGP excursions occurring between stable reverse (Matuyama) and stable normal (Brunhes) polarity23,24, with a mid-point at 773 ka and a transition duration of around 8 or 10.8 thousand years23,24. Our sampling probably captured one such excursion in OH4-SU5 (Fig. 1b,d and Extended Data Fig. 4). The intertidal biocalcarenites of SU6 and the littoral sands of SU5 are interpreted as representing the marine isotope stage (MIS) 20–MIS19 transgression of sea-level (starting at around 795 ka)25 and the subsequent maximum flooding surface, respectively. The continental deposits of SU4–SU3 are interpreted as part of the ensuing regressive system tract associated with the MIS19 highstand (around 780 ka). This is consistent with a sedimentation rate of around 20 cm per thousand years, largely sufficient to capture the MBT variability. As in the Gran Dolina TD6 layer (Sierra de Atapuerca)2, our analysis indicates hominin ages younger than 990 ka (top of Jaramillo) and close to the MBT at a nominal age of 773 ± 4 ka (ref. 23) (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 4).

Biochronological data closely agree with the magnetostratigraphic ones (Supplementary Note 2). The fauna includes 37 species of mammals; it shares many species with that of Tighennif in Algeria, at least 1 million years old26. It documents the last known occurrences of the hare Trischizolagus and of the rhino Ceratotherium mauritanicum; Theropithecus oswaldi and Kolpochoerus are also indicative of an early age. Comparisons with other African sites are in good agreement with an age close to the EP–MP boundary20,27. Resemblances with East and South African faunas attest to easy latitudinal exchanges, demonstrating that the Sahara was not a permanent barrier in EP times owing to the recurrent expansion of savanna landscapes across North Africa in response to short-lived, astronomically driven periods of enhanced monsoon rainfall28,29.

Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, performed in unit SU4 on cemented sands provided age estimates of 420 ± 34 ka and 391 ± 32 ka (refs. 17,19), of the same order as the ages obtained from OH2 to OH5 (ref. 30). OSL ages appear to be inconsistent with the evidence that these formations belong to at least three glacioeustatic cycles9,10 and, for this reason, can be disputed. Combined electron-spin resonance (ESR) and U-series dating methods applied directly to an isolated hominin tooth from SU4 resulted in an estimated age of 501 ka +94 ka/−76 ka (refs. 17,18,19,31). The same method yielded ages ranging from 591 ± 103 ka to 538 ± 52 ka on three well-preserved herbivore teeth from SU4 (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Note 4). However, the ThI-GH ESR samples have high uranium content in the dental tissues and particularly in enamel. In this case, the internal dose rate is probably too high to efficiently generate ESR signals in hydroxyapatite, leading to varying degrees of equivalent dose underestimation. Thus, combined ESR and U-series results obtained at ThI-GH are considered to be minimum ages (Supplementary Note 4).

While the femoral shaft of ThI-GH-UA28-7 has already been analysed in detail21, most of the hominin fossils of the ThI-GH have not been described, including two partial mandibles, a large number of teeth and several vertebrae, which provide invaluable phylogenetic information.

ThI-GH-10717 is a gracile and nearly complete adult mandible preserving a full (although worn) dentition (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Note 6). Its corpus is long, low and narrow, with a slight pre-angular notch. In the lateral view, its symphysis is receding—an orientation similar to Homo erectus sensu lato. There is a small mentum osseum, conforming to category 2 (ref. 32). Its superior portion forms a faint incurvatio mandibulae. This morphology is also present in Homo sp. ATE9-1 from Sima del Elefante, as well as several early Homo individuals33 (such as Olduvai, Dmanisi, Malawi, Koobi Fora and Sangiran 9). Like ATE9-1, ThI-GH-10717 displays an archaic marked submental incisura. The anterior marginal tubercle is weak and located below the fourth mandibular premolar (P4), in a similar position to that observed on the EP mandibles from Tighennif, Algeria. The internal morphology of the symphysis is relatively smooth in its topography. It lacks both a superior and inferior transverse torus and expresses a shallow genioglossal fossa. The planum alveolare is nearly vertically oriented and has slight alveolar prominence. These features are similar in H. antecessor and considered derived relative to H. erectus33. The mental foramen is located below P4, intermediate between the archaic position at P3–4, found in Homo habilis, Homo ergaster, H. erectus and H. antecessor and the mandibles from Tighennif, and the derived position below the first mandibular molar (M1), which is found in some MP hominins and Neanderthals34. The lateral prominence of the corpus is weak, with the maximum expression at the level of M2. The M3 is partially covered by the ramus in lateral view. In contrast to the common condition in EP and MP hominins35, the masseteric fossa is shallow as in Neanderthals and H. sapiens36. The flat pterygoid fossa and the symmetrical mandibular notch are reminiscent of H. sapiens37 and diverge from the Neanderthal pattern36,37,38.

ThI-GH-1 is a more robust, but less complete, left adult hemimandible missing both the coronoid process and the mandibular condyle and preserving P4–M3 in situ. Like ThI-GH-10717, the corpus is low but with a more pronounced pre-angular notch that is also found in some European MP hominins33,39. It differs from ThI-GH-10717 in having a more pronounced and posterior lateral prominence at the level of M2–M3, an M3 that is not covered by the ramus in lateral view and an intermediate (between parallel and oblique) trajectory of the mylohyoid line in relation to the alveolar margin. These three features align it with some European MP hominins and Neanderthals34,37,40,41. It also has a deeper relief of the masseteric fossa than ThI-GH-10717, a frequent condition in EP and MP hominins35. However, like ThI-GH-10717, Tighennif and TD6 hominins, and unlike the archaic condition found in H. erectus42, the internal corpus shows moderate hollowing of the subalveolar fossa.

In three-dimensional (3D) landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis, the size of ThI-GH-10717 is modest, with a centroid size at the low end of the H. erectus sensu lato range. In shape analyses, it plots within the H. erectus sensu lato range of variation, along with African EP and MP hominins. Its shape differs from both Neanderthals and H. sapiens by having a broad ramus, narrow mandibular breadth, long and low corpus, and receding symphysis. Compared with all three groups, it has a smaller coronoid process, a more-expanded gonial profile and a lower anterior corpus. ThI-GH-1 is considerably larger than ThI-GH-10717, and falls within the H. erectus range. It also plots closer than ThI-GH-10717 to the European MP and Neanderthal range of variation in shape space.

The fossils of ThI-GH include a sizable series of well-preserved permanent and deciduous teeth (comprehensive descriptions are provided in Supplementary Note 8 and Supplementary Tables 20–22). The postcanine teeth of ThI-GH-1 are consistently larger than the corresponding teeth of ThI-GH-10717. In both individuals, the molar size pattern is M1 < M2 > M3 (Extended Data Fig. 6), with a strong reduction in M3 contrasting with the conditions usually observed in H. erectus. Molar size patterns are variable, especially in H. sapiens43; however, this pattern is more common in H. antecessor, H. sapiens and Neanderthals. The crown outlines are similar to those of other EP hominins but, for the deciduous molars, they are closer to those of early H. sapiens than to those of H. antecessor (Supplementary Note 9).

The shape of the enamel–dentine junction (EDJ) can be studied on four permanent and two deciduous post-canine tooth positions using 3D landmark-based geometric morphometrics (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 7). In the deciduous dentition, the EDJ ridge shape of the ThI-GH-10978 first lower deciduous molar (dm1) falls outside H. sapiens and Neanderthals. This is also the case for the ThI-GH-10978 dm2, which also falls close to the fossil H. sapiens specimen Skhul 10. The H. antecessor TD6-112 dm2 is more similar in EDJ ridge shape to H. sapiens and Neanderthals, falling broadly between these two species. The P4 EDJ ridge and cervix shape of ThI-GH-1 place it close to the H. sapiens and Neanderthal samples, while the same features of ATD6-4 H. antecessor place it closer to H. erectus. The P4 EDJ ridge and cervix shape of ThI-GH-OA23-24 place it close to H. sapiens and Neanderthals, while ATD6-9 is close to Neanderthals. The EDJ ridge shape of the ThI-GH-10978 M1 (the cervix is not preserved) falls close to Sidi Abderrahmane, H. erectus, and relatively close to OH 22 and H. antecessor specimens ATD6-94 and ATD6-112. Like the dm2, H. antecessor M1 specimens ATD6-94 and ATD6-112 are more similar in shape to Neanderthals and H. sapiens. Finally, the EDJ ridge and cervix shape of the ThI-GH-10717 M3 fall just outside the H. sapiens sample and adjacent to the H. erectus sample, while the ThI-GH-1 M3 falls close to both H. sapiens and Neanderthal samples. In the molar roots, there is a decreasing overlap between H. sapiens and Neanderthals from M1 to M3, with H. erectus clustering on its own (Extended Data Fig. 8). The ThI-GH-1 M1 roots fall on the margin of recent H. sapiens and close to early H. sapiens from North Africa. The M1 roots of ThI-GH-10717 are more derived in their small size, towards recent H. sapiens. ThI-GH-1 M2 and M3 roots fall close to early H. sapiens specimens and near H. erectus, but ThI-GH-10717 M2 and M3 roots are well within the recent H. sapiens cluster.

Principal component (PC) analyses of EDJ shape variation for the first (top left) and second (top right) deciduous molars, the mandibular fourth premolar (middle left), the maxillary fourth premolar (middle right), the first mandibular molar (bottom left) and the third mandibular molar (bottom right). Shape is captured using 3D landmarks on the primary cusps and marginal ridge of the EDJ and, in the case of the the fourth premolars and third mandibular molar, also the cervix (partial EDJ ridge means that only the unworn portion of the marginal ridge was analysed). For each tooth position, the ThI-GH teeth fall outside and adjacent to our samples of Neanderthals and H. sapiens. Fossil H. sapiens (H. sap), MP hominins and H. antecessor specimens are identified individually by accession number. H. erectus is identified by H. ere and H. neanderthalensis by H. nea.

The anterior dentition of ThI-GH-10717 is heavily worn (right canine) or broken (left canine and all incisors), but the roots are preserved although fragmented. The right canine is gracile (crown and root), similar to modern humans, and much smaller than in other EP and MP hominins such as Tighennif, Irhoud and Neanderthal individuals (Supplementary Note 10). The incisor ThI-GH-SA26-88 has a relatively small crown that is within the early and recent H. sapiens variations. By contrast, its root length falls in the upper end of the H. sapiens variation, in the lower range of Neanderthals, and is smaller than that of H. erectus (KNM-WT 15000).

From a non-metrical dental trait perspective (Supplementary Table 20), the mandibular molars from ThI-GH are comparable to other EP and MP teeth from North Africa (for example, Sidi Abderrahmane and Tighennif) and are similar to the TD6 H. antecessor molars in their variable expression of trigonid crests, cusp 7 and lack of cusp 6. However, in both deciduous and permanent postcanine teeth, the cusps of the TD6 specimens are more closely spaced than they are in the North African specimens. In this way, the TD6 H. antecessor specimens appear more derived towards Neanderthals. Moreover, ThI-GH-1 M2 and M3 (as well as Tighennif 1) differ from the TD6 material in the way they taper distally, which is an archaic feature seen in African H. erectus. Furthermore, neither the crown of the Tighennif nor the ThI-GH teeth show any lingual relief, especially shovel-shaped morphology for incisors.

Directly underneath ThI-GH-10717, a series of eight vertebrae (six cervical and two thoracic) was discovered (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 9). Their small size and very close spatial proximity to the mandible suggest that they belonged to the same small-bodied adult. Although the fossil record allows limited comparisons, morphologically, the most complete vertebrae (C7, T1 and T2) are more similar to H. erectus than to recent Homo species. In particular, C7 displays a more lateral (ventral–lateral) orientation of the lower articular facets relative to the condition observed in H. sapiens and Neanderthals. The immature H. antecessor C7 (ATD6-75) is more H. sapiens-like in the orientation of the lower articular facets44. Moreover, the orientation of the transverse processes in the ThI-GH both T1 and T2 vertebrae is slightly more dorsal than in recent H. sapiens, while it is notably more dorsal in KNM-WT 15000 (Supplementary Table 23). The vertebral canal section area in the ThI-GH specimens is similar to the Dmanisi C3 and to the H. antecessor C7 vertebrae, and similar (T1) or larger than those of KNM-WT 15000 (C7, T2). These areas are below the mean but not significantly different from a recent H. sapiens sample (Supplementary Table 24). When standardized relative to the geometric mean of vertebral body linear dimensions, all of the values fall within the H. sapiens variation, except for the T2, where both KNM-WT 15000 and ThI-GH specimens show very low values (Extended Data Fig. 9).

In North Africa, the ThI-GH hominins are the only specimens unearthed within an indisputable stratigraphic context and securely dated to the MBT at a nominal age of 773 ± 4 ka. These hominins cannot be directly compared with later specimens, such as the Kabwe or Bodo skulls, which have been tentatively assigned to H. heidelbergensis. Not only do these specimens differ substantially in age, but they also lack preservation of comparable anatomical parts. Our analysis suggests that the ThI-GH hominins probably belong to an evolved form of H. erectus sensu lato in North Africa, much as H. antecessor does in Europe. However, the ThI-GH hominins offer an interesting contrast to both the Spanish fossils and the considerably older fossils from Tighennif (Algeria), which are likely to date to at least 1,000 ka (refs. 45,46,47,48). The fossil mandibles from Tighennif appear more primitive, larger and more robust than both the European H. antecessor and the northwest African ThI-GH fossils. The Spanish and Moroccan fossils share several features in their teeth and mandibles. Both groups display a combination of archaic and derived features reminiscent of later hominins (Supplementary Table 25). These similarities revive the question of possible exchanges across the Strait of Gibraltar during the EP. Nevertheless, the ThI-GH hominins are different from the TD6 hominins. The pattern of these differences suggests that regional differentiation between Europe and North Africa was already present by the late EP. Apparent Neanderthal-like features on the larger ThI-GH-1 mandible could reflect primitive retentions, allometric effects or convergent evolution but, when more phylogenetically informative dental characters are considered, the Spanish specimens appear more derived towards the Neanderthal morphology that later emerged in western Eurasia (see also refs. 49,50).

The origin of H. sapiens, and the precise timing of the divergence of its ancestral populations from the Neanderthal–Denisovan clade, remain subjects of debate. Anatomical evidence has at times been used to argue for a split predating 800 ka (ref. 51) and even for an alternative Asian ancestry of our species52. In this context, the Maghreb fossils are key to understanding the diversification of MP hominins. The morphology of the ThI-GH hominins places them close to the split between the African and Eurasian lineages. Our findings not only align with the phylogenetic structure inferred from palaeogenetic data but also highlight the Maghreb as a pivotal region for understanding the emergence of our species, reinforcing the case for an African rather than a Eurasian ancestry of H. sapiens.

ThI-GH SU4 and SU5 have been systematically excavated since 1994. A 0.5/1-m-deep sequence of an area of 48 m2 was excavated (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Excavation was performed according to the stratigraphic sediment deposition, and stratigraphic units were subsequently numbered from 1 to 7 from top to bottom. We established an arbitrary excavation 1 m × 1 m grid, and spatial data (x, y, z) of all finds (worked and unworked lithics, as well as faunal and human remains) were recorded (Extended Data Table 1). From 1994 to 2005, single finds were assigned unique IDs consisting of the quarry acronym (ThI), the site acronym (GH), the name of the square and a progressive number (for example, ThI-GH-SA26-88). From 2006 onwards, spatial data measurement was carried out with the total station. The code for each find consists of the quarry acronym, the site acronym and a number from 10000 (for example, ThI-GH-10634). We documented layers, special features and profiles in 3D models using total station measurements, digital photographs and drawings. The 3D models were referenced with control points recorded with the total station to align them to the excavation grid. Sediments have been collected for every m2, dissociated with diluted formic acid and wet-screened to recover lithic and faunal small fragments.

The chronostratigraphic framework of the OHF exposed at ThI is based on the direct observations of sedimentary formations, stratigraphic boundaries and facies. The successions and associations of facies have been used to characterize the depositional environments, their evolution and to infer sea level changes. According to the sequence stratigraphy concept, an allostratigraphic unit is defined by a sedimentary sequence characterized by a succession of deposits attributed to intertidal, supratidal and aeolian/continental environments, bounded at its base and top by unconformities. This sequence is essentially deposited during phases of marine transgression and sea-level high stands. According to the international stratigraphic guide, the allostratigraphic units were formalized as members of the OHF. Microfacies analysis was carried out on large thin sections prepared from blocks of oriented sediments vacuum-impregnated with polyester resin. These analyses provided specific information about diagenetic processes occurring during and after deposition.

Stratigraphic units SU5 to SU3 were studied using a geoarchaeological approach, integrating field observations (sedimentary structure, colour, discontinuities and so on), micromorphology and analyses (particle size distribution, magnetic susceptibility measurements and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) analyses). Micromorphology was based on the observation of large thin sections taken continuously in stratigraphic order. Particle size analyses were performed on bulk samples after decarbonatation. Volume magnetic susceptibility was measured along the section using a Bartington MS2K sensor, with a vertical resolution of 2 cm. Air-dried and crushed bulk samples (<2 mm) were analysed by ED-XRF using a calibrated portable spectrometer (SPECTRO X-SORT) (Supplementary Note 1).

Magnetostratigraphic data were obtained from a population of 119 oriented core-samples retrieved from members OH3, OH4 and GHCCC in 2022 and 2023 and integrated with 62 samples previously analysed in 2018–201913 from the same members plus member OH5. The sampling of ThI-GH infilling (from SU6 to SU3) was conducted along 5 sections, A and B (68 samples), C (14 samples), D (6 samples) and composite section E (19 samples) (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2b), yielding a total of 107 oriented core-samples taken to better anchor the hominin bearing site ThI-GH to the MBT. Furthermore, 13 samples were retrieved from member OH3 to refine the record of the Jaramillo subchron previously observed13.

Magnetostratigraphic samples were thermally demagnetized from room temperature up to a maximum of 690 °C with a TD48 ASC furnace. Alternating-field (AF) demagnetization up to 200 mT performed on two test samples with an LDA5 AF demagnetizer resulted inadequate to resolve the magnetic remanence of the samples. After each thermal demagnetization step, the initial magnetic susceptibility was measured using a Bartington susceptibility bridge. The natural remanent magnetization was measured on a 2G DC-SQUID cryogenic magnetometer located in a magnetically shielded room. Standard least-squares analysis was used to calculate ChRM component directions from vector end-point demagnetization diagrams, from which VGP latitudes were derived (positive VGP values for normal polarity, negative values for reverse polarity). Great circles were used to assess qualitatively the ChRM orientation in absence of stable end points. The magnetic mineralogy was investigated using hysteresis experiments from −1.5 T to +1.5 T, low-resolution first-order reversal curves (FORCs, n = 76) interpreted with FORCinel53, stepwise acquisition of an isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) up to 1.5 T, AF decay of a 1 T IRM in AF peak fields from 50 mT to 1.5 T and thermomagnetic decay of a 1 T magnetization performed in Ar atmosphere from room temperature to 680 °C. These experiments were performed using a MicroSense EZ7 Vibrating Sample Magnetometer with heating ability. Additional samples were also subjected to thermal demagnetization of a three-component IRM using orthogonal fields of 1.5 T, 0.4 T and 0.12 T imparted with an ASC pulse magnetizer. Details are provided in the main text and Supplementary Note 5.

The fossil sample (Supplementary Table 17) comprises Early, Middle and Late Pleistocene hominins from Africa, Europe and Asia, including specimens attributed to H. erectus, Homo floresiensis, Homo naledi, H. neanderthalensis, H. sapiens and Denisovan (Xiahe mandible). As the taxonomy of the European MP hominins is contested, we have refrained from assigning specimens from this period to a taxon but refer to them as European MP hominins. Moreover, there are several EP fossils from Africa with ambiguous taxonomic attribution (that is, from Baringo Kapthurin, Kenya and Tighennif, Algeria) that we refer to as African EP hominins. We used the term early H. sapiens to refer to the oldest members of our species from around 300 to 100 ka found at sites in Africa and the Near East (such as Jebel Irhoud, Klasies River Mouth, Border Cave, Skhul and Qafzeh). All of the specimens are adults based on dental eruption and spheno-occipital fusion, except for KNM-WT 15000.

Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans of ThI-GH-1 and ThI-GH-10717 were made with Diondo d3 at the Department of Anthropology, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany, with a scan resolution of 30 µm. 3D surface models were reconstructed from these CT scans using Avizo v.7.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 3D surface models of the comparative sample were created from either CT scans using Avizo v.7.1 or photogrammetry. For the latter, between 40 and 90 2D photographs were taken using the Nikon D600 (4,512 × 3,008 pixels) and processed with Agisoft PhotoScan Professional v.1.2.0 (Agisoft)53. Error tests evaluating differences in imaging techniques are within the acceptable range of error in osteometry54. For most fossils, surface models were generated from the original specimen; however, when surface models from the original specimen were not available research quality casts were used54,55,56,57,58.

Minor virtual reconstruction was needed for most specimens in the comparative sample and was performed in either Geomagic Studio 2014 v.3.0 (3D Systems) or Avizo v.7.1. The type of reconstruction varied considerably depending on the specimen, but generally included the filling of cracks or holes, removal of sediments, smoothing of abraded areas and refitting of fragments. For some fossils in which one side was missing or deformed, bilateral symmetry was exploited by mirror-imaging. Specific details regarding the reconstruction techniques and error tests have been published previously54,55,56,57,58,59.

Geometric morphometric methods were used to analyse the shape and size of the ThI-GH fossils in a comparative context. Separate landmark datasets (Supplementary Figs. 32 and 33) were created according to the preserved anatomical elements of the ThI-GH mandibles: (1) a mandibular dataset, consisting of 301 (semi)landmarks, based on the preserved morphology of ThI-GH-10717; (2) a left mandibular dataset consisting of 87 (semi)landmarks, based on the preserved morphology of ThI-GH-1; and (3) and an anterior corpus dataset, consisting of 153 (semi)landmarks, which allowed for an expanded comparative sample. Three-dimensional coordinates of anatomical landmarks and curve semilandmarks were digitized on the surface models using Landmark Editor (v.3.0.0.6)60. Landmark and semilandmark data were processed and analysed previously61 using the packages Morpho (v.2.9)62 and geomorph (v.4.0.2)63,64. For each dataset, missing bilateral landmarks and semilandmarks were estimated by mirroring the preserved side. Missing landmarks and semilandmarks lacking a bilateral counterpart were estimated by deforming the sample average onto the deficient configuration using thin-plate spline interpolation56,57,58,65. Curve and surface semilandmarks were slid by minimizing the bending energy of a thin-plate spline deformation between each specimen and the sample mean shape66,67. After sliding, all landmarks and semilandmarks datasets were symmetrized and converted to shape variables using a generalized Procrustes analysis68.

For each dataset, the Procrustes coordinates were analysed using principal component analyses (PCA) in shape space, and nearest neighbours were calculated according to interindividual Procrustes distances. The ThI-GH fossils were projected into this PCA space. Shape changes were visualized along PC 1 and PC 2 by warping the sample mean shape along the positive and negative ends of PC 1 and PC 2, ±2 s.d. from the sample mean. To evaluate the size of the ThI-GH mandibles, the natural logarithm of centroid size was calculated for each specimen and compared across groups.

Mandibular metric data are shown in Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8. Linear measurements were taken by I.B. on 3D surface models generated from micro-CT scans in Avizo and were complemented by measurements of the original specimens taken by E. Trinkaus and by comparative data taken from the literature4,14,34,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116.

The shape of the EDJ was examined for multiple tooth positions represented in the ThI-GH sample and compared to a sample of fossil hominins as well as early and recent modern humans. Details of the comparative sample are listed in Supplementary Table 22. TIFF stacks were filtered using only a mean of least variance filter (kernel size one), or a 3D median filter (kernel size of three) followed by a mean of least variance filter (kernel size of three) using MIA open source software117. Enamel and dentine tissues of each tooth were then segmented using the watershed module in Avizo 6.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After segmentation, the EDJ was reconstructed as a triangle-based surface model. We then used Avizo 6.3 to digitize 3D landmarks and curve-semilandmarks on these EDJ surfaces. Anatomical landmarks were placed on the tip of the dentine horn of the protocone/protoconid and metacone/metaconid (premolars), as well as the entoconid and hypoconid (molars). A sequence of landmarks was also placed along the marginal ridge connecting the dentine horns beginning at the top of the protocone/protoconid moving in the lingual direction. In R61, a smooth curve was fit through this set using a cubic spline function, before dividing the curve into sections using the dentine horn landmarks (four sections for molars, two for premolars). A fixed number of equidistant semilandmarks were then placed along each section of the curve (landmark numbers reflect the relative length of these sections; in premolars the sections have 20 and 25 landmarks, respectively; and, in molars, they have 18, 15, 22 and 12 landmarks). Likewise, we digitized and resampled a curve along the cemento–enamel junction (cervix) as a closed curve starting either on the mid-face of the base of the protocone/protoconid (premolars) or on the mesiobuccal corner below the protoconid (molars). Homologous landmarks were then derived in R using the packages Morpho62 and princurve118 using a freely available R-based software routine119. Anatomical landmarks were fixed while the resampled points along the curves were treated as semilandmarks and allowed to slide along their curves so as to reduce the bending energy of the thin-plate spline interpolation function calculated between each specimen and the Procrustes average for the sample66,67. Sliding was performed twice, with landmarks projected back onto the curve after each step, before landmarks were considered geometrically homologous. Slid landmarks were then converted into shape coordinates using generalized least squares Procrustes superimposition, which removes scale, location and orientation information from the coordinates68,120. PCA was used to summarize shape variation in the comparative sample and assess morphological affinities of the ThI-GH teeth.

Tooth size was analysed for two sets of mandibular teeth: dm1/dm2/M1 and P3/P4/M1/M2/M3. The size of each tooth was represented by its centroid size, calculated using the cervix or EDJ landmark set used in the EDJ GM analysis (see above). Centroid size was calculated as the square root of the sum of squared distances of each landmark to the centroid of all landmarks. Associated teeth are represented in plots by lines between points of adjacent teeth. The sample used for the tooth size analysis is listed in Supplementary Table 22.

Wear categories were scored according to Molnar121.

The outer enamel surface (OES) and EDJ of the ThI-GH specimens were scored using a combination of visual inspection of the originals, photographs (OES) and virtual 3D models (OES and EDJ).

Descriptions of the pulp cavity configurations of the ThI-GH specimens were based on virtual 3D models. Measurements of the buccolingual and mesiodistal lengths of the ThI-GH specimens were taken from virtual 3D models. No corrections were made for interproximal wear and teeth that were too damaged to measure were omitted. With a few exceptions (for example, Atapuerca material) morphological assessment and crown measurements of the comparative material were taken from the original specimens using Mitutoyo digital callipers.

Scores for most non-metric traits were obtained using a combination of written descriptions and (where applicable) reference plaques of the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System (ASUDAS122). Traits that are not part of the ASUDAS, or those that have been reassessed since its publication were scored using different methods. We scored shovelling for incisors and canine; labial convexity for incisors; Tomes' root for lower third premolar, anterior fovea, deflecting wrinkle, fissure pattern, cusp 6; and protostylid and enamel extension for lower molars as described previously122. We scored lower molar cusp 7 variation according to ref. 123. Trigonid cresting patterns and variation on the lower molars were assessed as described previously124. Premolar asymmetry and transverse crest on the lower fourth premolar were assessed based on ref. 125. We referred to ref. 126 to make assessments of maxillary premolar accessory ridges or MxPAR on the upper premolars.

The 3D digital models of the teeth were aligned with the cervical plane parallel to the x–y plane of the Cartesian coordinate system and rotated around the z axis with the lingual side parallel to the x axis. For the ThI-GH specimens, the right dm1 and dm2 were first mirrored in Geomagic Design X (3D Systems Software) to be compared with the left-side comparative sample. The crown outlines of the digital models were then extracted as a .igs file and imported into Rhinoceros v.5 (Robert McNeel & Associates). The centroid of the crown outlines was calculated based on the area of the outlines. A total of 24 equiangularly spaced radial vectors (with the first radius directed buccally and parallel to the y axis of the Cartesian coordinate system) from the centroid determined 24 pseudolandmarks of the crown outlines. The crown outlines were centred by their centroid and scaled to unit centroid size, transforming them into Procrustes shape coordinates, which were then used for computing PCA127,128,129.

ThI-GH specimens were projected in the shape-space PCA computed on Neanderthals and H. sapiens from the published comparative sample of dm1 and dm2128,130,131, updated with unpublished specimens (Supplementary Table 22). The differences in crown outlines among Neanderthals, H. sapiens (combined recent and Upper Palaeolithic) and early H. sapiens were investigated using permutation tests on the first three PCs (n = 10,000). A leave-one-out cross-validation quadratic discriminant analysis was performed, as the assumption of normality of variance was violated, on the minimum number of PCs accounting for 70% to 90% of the total variation131,132, to discriminate Neanderthal and H. sapiens groups and to estimate the taxonomic attribution of ThI-GH specimens to one of these groups with posterior probabilities (Ppost). Statistical analyses were performed using R (v.4.2.3)61.

From the micro-CT scans, the tooth tissues of the anterior teeth were segmented (that is, enamel, dentine, pulp cavity). Linear, surface and volume variables were measured on the anterior tooth roots after the protocol described previously133. Comparative samples involve Neanderthals, early and recent H. sapiens, as well as early and lower Pleistocene hominins, some from Northern Africa. Details are provided in Supplementary Note 10.

Based on 2D virtual sections generated from the micro-CT scans, the calcification stage of the ThI-GH-10978 deciduous and forming permanent teeth was scored. These scores were compared with other juvenile fossil hominins (details are provided in Supplementary Note 7).

ThI-GH infilling starts with OH4 marine deposits: calcirudites (SU7) preserved in a notch and plurimetric collapsed blocks of calcarenites and calcirudite with blunt-surfaced onlapped by fine, grey, planar-bedded intertidal biocalcarenites (SU6), and then well-sorted bioclastic and quartzose sands derived from reworked loose littoral deposits (SU5). Without any apparent disconformity, the sequence transitions into continental well-sorted bioclastic and quartzose reddish sands (GH-CCC-SU4 and 3). The upper continental deposits lie in discontinuity on SU3. SU2 consists of multilayer dripstone interbedded with loose red sands, and SU1 comprises massively bedded, rubified sands. At the entrance of the cavity (see A), cross-bedded grey aeolianite sandstones (OH5) are interposed between SU3 and the upper continental deposits SU2-SU1.

Comparison of magnetostratigraphic (VGP) data across the MBT in Members OH4 and GH-CCC of Thomas Quarry I and in North Atlantic IODP deep-sea cores24, correlated to the δ18O [‰] stack of 8 centred on Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 19. Considering that the MBT (773 ± 4 ka) occurs during MIS 19c to MIS 18e24 and that the sea-level transgression of MIS20/MIS19 began at ~795 ka26, we interpreted the intertidal biocalcarenites of OH4-SU6 and the littoral sands of OH4-SU5 as part of this transgressive phase culminating whit a maximum flooding surface corresponding to the top of OH4-SU5. The following continental deposits of GH-CCC-SU4-3 are interpreted as the ensuing regressive phase associated to the MIS 19 high-stand beginning approximately at 780 ka. The transition between marine and continental sedimentation is gradual and substantially in stratigraphic continuity, implying a continuous and high-resolution recording of the MBT that is characterized by VGP swings between stable reverse (Matuyama) and stable normal (Brunhes) polarity. According to this interpretation, we attribute the thin normal magnetic polarity interval recorded in OH4-SU5 to the VGP variability of the MBT and exclude an attribution to the MB precursor dated to 794 ka23 as this geomagnetic event occurred during MIS 20 and may have been recorded at or below the base of the sampled section.

A) Principal Component Analysis Plots of the ThI-GH mandibular shape. Shape changes along PC 1 relate to the height and breadth of the corpus, PC 2 (left) the breadth of the ramus and the gonial profile, and PC 3 (right) the breadth of the ramus and shape of the anterior ramus. Both ThI-GH mandibles have a corpus height and breadth intermediate between H. sapiens and Neanderthals; whereas ThI-GH-10717 has a wider ramus and more everted gonial profile ploting with H. sapiens variation and near to the H. erectus hull and ThI-GH-1 has a taller and narrower ramus ploting within Neanderthal variation. (B) Box plot of mandibular size, measured as log centroid size (CS); ER n = 4, AEP n = 4, EMP n = 7, EHS n = 9, NEA n = 15, LP/EH n = 32. ThI-GH-10717 is considerably smaller than Th1-GH-1, and most fossils in the sample. Horizontal lines represent the median of each group. Boxes show the interquartile range (IQR, 25th to 75th percentile). Whiskers extend to 1.5 times IQR. Outliers are represented by circles.

Plots of tooth size measured as centroid size comparing the three ThI-GH specimens (black solid lines) to H. erectus/H. antecessor (left), H. neanderthalensis (middle), and H. sapiens(right). The top row compares the first deciduous molar, second deciduous molar, and first permanent molar, and the bottom row the third mandibular premolar to the third mandibular molar. Shaded areas represent the range for H. erectus (red), H. neanderthalensis (blue) and H. sapiens (green). Fossil H. sapiens are marked separately and individually identfied by accession number. Continuous lines connect the measurements corresponding to different teeth of the same individual. The teeth of the ThI-GH-10978 immature mandible are larger than those of each comparative sample, whereas the permanent postcanine dentition of adult individuals displays smaller third premolars and third molars than H. erectus, and shows a similar pattern of relative tooth size to H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens.

Principal component plots of enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) shape of the first deciduous molar (top left), second deciduous molar (top right), and first permanent molar (bottom) from the ThI-GH-10978 mandible. The EDJ shape of all molars is different, and approximately equidistant from H. neanderthalensis and modern H. sapiens. Note that the H. antecessor second deciduous and first permanent molar are more derived in shape and sit closer to these two taxa.

Principal component analyses of four molar root variables: root length, square root of cervix plane area, cube root of root cervix volume, and cube root of root branch volume. There is decreasing overlap between H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis from the first to the third mandibular molar. ThI-GH-10717 falls within the variation of both taxa for the first and second molar, but with H. sapiens for the third molar. Thl-GH-1 falls on the edge of the H. sapiens distribution for each molar position and towards the H. erectus samples.

A) Articular pillar morphology and lower facet orientation. Comparison in dorsal and caudal views of the seventh cervical vertebra from ThI-GH-10717/3 compared to KNM-WT 15000 and to a recent Homo sapiens (figures not to scale). The arrow indicates the presence of a marked notch in the articular pillars between the upper and the lower articular facets. The black lines indicate the approximate orientation of the lower articular facets, which are slightly convex and display a ventral-lateral orientation in ThI-GH and KNM-WT 15000, while they are flatter with a ventral to ventral-medial orientation in recent Homo sapiens. B) Box plots of vertebral canal area relative to vertebral body geometric mean (following and modified from134). All the Casablanca specimens fall close to the H. sapiens mean, except for the T2, where both KNM-WT 15000 and ThI-GH specimens show very low value. In the boxplots, the whiskers represent the 1.5 times the interquartile range, the box represents the interquartile range, and the centre represents the median. The Pan troglodytes sample was compared to the Homo sapiens sample using a two-tailed Student's T-tests. The different fossil specimens (Dmanisi, Sima de los Huesos, ThI-GH, KNM WT-15000 and Gran Dolina-TD6 and MH1) were compared to the Homo sapiens sample using a z-score analysis. * = significantly different from Homo sapiens (p < 0.05); ** = significantly different from Homo sapiens (p < 0.01). Comparative sample sizes: Pan troglodytes (C3: n = 18; C7: n = 13; T1: n = 10; T2: n = 19); Homo sapiens (C3: n = 62; C7: n = 37; T1: n = 25; T2: n = 52)134.

Yakut communities from northeastern Siberia inhabit some of the coldest environments on Earth, preserving an extraordinary archaeological record. Their history was profoundly reshaped by the Russian conquest, which introduced cereals, pathogens and Christianity beginning in 1632 (refs. 1,2,3,4,5). However, the biological impact of these transformations remains unknown. Here we generated extensive ancient DNA data to elucidate contemporary changes in Yakut genomic diversity and oral microbiomes. We found Yakut origins tracing back to local populations that admixed with Trans-Baikal groups migrating as the Great Mongol Empire spread. Despite the Russian conquest, the Yakut gene pool and oral microbiomes appeared largely stable, although smallpox strains distinct from those documented in Europe by approximately 1650 circulated. Marital practices generally maintained low consanguinity, with the exception of one female bearing the latest markers of traditional shamanism, who was the daughter of second-degree relatives.

The Yakuts are the largest Indigenous group in Yakutia, northeastern Siberia, with a population of approximately half a million (Supplementary Information section 1.1). They inhabit one of the coldest regions on the planet, where annual thermal fluctuations exceed 100 °C, and winter temperatures can drop below −60 °C. Genetic and historical evidence suggest that the Yakuts descend from an ancestral population that migrated from the Lake Baikal area, possibly following the Great Mongol Empire expansion in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries6,7. To survive in this extreme environment, they developed specific cultural adaptations, with subsistence strategies centred on horse and cattle breeding, which provided transportation, clothing, meat and milk8. This contrasts with the reindeer-based economies of neighbouring Indigenous groups1 (for discussion of ethnonyms terminology, see Supplementary Information section 1.1.3). Furthermore, the Yakuts, along with other northeastern Siberian peoples, traditionally practiced shamanism, wherein practitioners intermediate with the spirit realms to guide and protect their communities8. The traditional lifeways of the Yakuts were dramatically disrupted beginning in 1632, when the Russian Empire initiated its conquest, primarily to expand its fur-hunting territories9.

The Russian conquest, followed by the development of Chinese trade by the late seventeenth century, introduced tobacco, vodka and carbohydrate-rich cereals into the region10,11. New exchanges brought infectious diseases, including smallpox, tuberculosis and pertussis, exposing immunologically naive Indigenous populations to devastating outbreaks2,12,13. Beyond its impact on diet and health, the Russian conquest altered the power dynamics among patrilocal clans, with one of them gaining control over hunting grounds and becoming key in the lucrative fur trade, accumulating substantial economic wealth3. Alongside traders, Christian proselytes increasingly reached the region, ultimately converting predominantly animist and shamanic Indigenous populations to Christianity3.

The upheavals of this period, combined with an archaeological record exceptionally well preserved within permafrost14,15,16, provide a unique opportunity to obtain fine-grained resolution into the biological, medical and societal consequences of a major lifestyle transition. Here we analyse an extensive collection of human skeletal remains and dental calculus from individuals living in Yakutia over the last 2,000 years, with a primary focus on approximately 1500–1922. Using extensive ancient DNA sequencing, we first reconstruct the historical origins of Yakut communities and assess the impact of the Russian conquest on their gene pool. We then examine whether associated dietary, lifestyle and social transformations influenced oral microbiota, pathogen exposure, marital practices and methylomes as potential markers of social and economic status.

Excavations by the Mission Archéologique Française en Sibérie Orientale (MAFSO) between 2002 and 2018 (ref. 5) teaming together Russian and French archaeologists, uncovered an outstanding archaeological record across four key regions of Yakutia: Central Yakutia and the river basins of the western Vilyuy, northern Verkhoyansk (Yana) and eastern Indigirka (Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Information sections 1.2 and 1.3 and Supplementary Fig. 1_2). The MAFSO expeditions aimed to investigate traditional Yakut societies and assess potential transformations following the Russian conquest3. To focus on Indigenous burial practices, excavations avoided Christian cemeteries, although funerary assemblages featuring Christian stellae, or yielding Christian crosses once unearthed, were included14,16 (Supplementary Information section 1.2). The Siberian climate preserved nearly intact human remains, textiles16,17 and a whole array of cultural artefacts, including ritual tripod or monopod wooden cups called chorons, which were owned by Yakut elites and used for drinking fermented horse milk (Fig. 1c,d).

The rich funerary assemblage provided exceptional insights into the social status, religious practices and presence of shamanism, among the buried individuals, spanning approximately 1500–1922 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1c). This period is divided into four archaeological stages, reflecting increasing Russian influence (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information section 1.2). Stage 1 (approximately 1500–1689) represents the traditional Yakut society before and during the early Russian conquest. Stage 2 (1689–1750) marks the Yakut ‘Golden Age', when the Bozekov clan from AtDaban gained control over the prosperous fur trade, dealing in sables, martens and squirrels3,15. This period saw unprecedented economic, spatial and demographic expansion, with the Yakut language emerging as the lingua franca of northeastern Siberia. In stage 3 (1750–1800), demographic growth continued, whereas Russian influence over belief systems intensified, including legal measures against Indigenous spiritual traditions in favour of Orthodox Christian religion3. This process culminated in stage 4 (1800–1922), with widespread religious conversion campaigns.

Source Data

To investigate Yakut history and assess the impact of the Russian conquest on population structure, marital practices, diet and health, we analysed a comprehensive collection of 122 individuals spanning stages 1–4. The dataset included 70 petrous bones, 17 long bone fragments, 54 teeth and 78 dental calculi, three lung biopsies and one muscle tissue sample (Supplementary Table 1a,b). Shotgun sequencing of 44.77 billion DNA templates from 612 libraries yielded genome-scale data suitable for downstream analyses in 59 males and 46 females, with a median depth of coverage of 2.13-fold (range of 0.017–69.85) and nuclear contamination estimates 0.5% or less for males (Supplementary Information sections 2.1–2.6 and Supplementary Figs. 2_1 and 2_2). Additionally, 74 oral microbiomes were reconstructed (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1a,b).

To further contextualize our findings, we characterized two more human genomes from a tooth of a seventeenth-century male from Buryatia (Fig. 1b) and a petrous bone of an Iron Age male from Central Yakutia (Mokp; Fig. 1a). The sequence data enabled the characterization of 16 methylomes and the imputation of 78.4 million genotypes in 90 individuals (Supplementary Information section 2.7 and Supplementary Table 1a). Population genetic analyses were conducted on pseudo-haploid data for 1.24 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Allen Ancient DNA Resource v.5 (ref. 18) and genotypes imputed from the 1000 Genomes Project catalogue19.

To contextualize Yakut genetic diversity within a broader human population framework, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA), projecting all ancient genomes (Supplementary Table 1d) onto the variation observed in modern Eurasian and American genomes (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 1e). The first principal component separated European from Asian and American populations, with both ancient and modern Yakuts clustering with Asian populations. The second principal component further refined genetic affinities across Asia and the Americas, positioning modern and historical (stages 1–4) Yakuts near other Siberian groups, including the Evenk and Ulchi from the Russian Far East, as well as the Buryat from the Trans-Baikal region (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a).

Source Data

The genetic makeup of historical Yakuts was remarkably homogeneous and closely resembled that of modern Yakuts. This was evident in their PCA placement (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3b, Supplementary Information section 2.10 and Supplementary Figs. 2_5 and 2_6), ADMIXTURE20 ancestry profiles (Fig. 2b) and fineSTRUCTURE21 clustering (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3c). By contrast, the Iron Age Mokp individual exhibited distinct genetic affinities, clustering with modern Nganasans and Neolithic-to-Iron-Age individuals from Yakutia22. The genetic ancestry component maximized in Mokp was also predominant in all these individuals but was diluted in most historical and modern Yakuts through admixture with other genetic ancestries, shared with a subset of historical populations from the Baikal region (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Information section 2.11 and Supplementary Figs. 2_7 and 2_8). These ADMIXTURE patterns align with the fineSTRUCTURE results, indicating a greater genetic contribution from eastern and northern Asia in Mokp than in all but one historical Yakut (Omouk1; Fig. 2c). Combined, these analyses suggest that Yakuts from approximately 1500 ce onwards were not genetically continuous with the populations inhabiting Yakutia until approximately 280 bce (the radiocarbon age of Mokp).

The stage 4 Omouk1 female was a clear genetic outlier relative to the historical and modern Yakuts in the PCA (Fig. 2a). She also exhibited increased Asian haplotype sharing (Fig. 2c) and an ADMIXTURE profile resembling that of the modern Trans-Baikal Evenk (Fig. 2b). Notably, the Yakut word ‘omuk' means ‘Tungus' or stranger, and the associated archaeological material reflects Tungus (Evenk) reindeer herding traditions16. These findings suggest that Omouk1, while buried in Yakutia, originated from a different genetic and cultural background than other historical and modern Yakuts.

The stage 4 Yakut Omouk3 female also displayed a slightly atypical genetic profile, including increased European haplotype sharing (Fig. 2c). A similar pattern was observed in another stage 4 female (Khoumakhtaakh), a stage 2 female (Haras) and a stage 1 male showing cranial deformation characteristic of Tungus groups (Byljasyk3)16. Using qpAdm23, their genetic makeup was best modelled with a three-way admixture, incorporating an extra western Eurasian source, distinct from the two common to all other Yakuts post-1500 (Supplementary Table 1f,g). This extra ancestry could have represented European genetic input during Russian conquest. However, the estimated admixture date for Haras (718–1373; Supplementary Table 1h) pre-dates Russian expansion, suggesting earlier contact with an already admixed population, possibly from the Trans-Baikal region. The European-like admixture in Khoumakhtaakh and Omouk3 was dated to 1454–1790 (Supplementary Table 1h), aligning with both pre-conquest contacts and the Russian conquest.

Except for rare outliers (Supplementary Table 1f), the genetic makeup of all other stages 1–4 Yakuts could be modelled as a two-way admixture between populations inhabiting Yakutia in the Iron Age and the Baikal region from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries (Baikal_his, 16–38% with Yakutia_IA (62–84%) and Baikal_sib, 40–79% with Yakutia_IA (21–60%); Supplementary Information section 2.12, Supplementary Fig. 2_9 and Supplementary Table 1f). Two-way admixture models involving a Western Russian source (Vologda Administrative Region) and a Baikal source (Baikal_his or Baikal_sib) were infeasible and/or rejected (P ≤ 0.01 and/or admixture proportion estimates ± 2 s.e. fell outside the (0, 1) interval; Supplementary Table 1f). Three-way models including Yakutia_IA, Baikal_his/Baikal_sib and European sources from 11 populations representing four language families, including from Western Russia, proved infeasible or returned negligeable admixture proportions and did not improve statistical fit relative to two-way nested models (Supplementary Table 1f,g).

To further explore the genetic impact of the Russian conquest, we calculated D-statistics23 of the form D(Mbuti, European; Yakut_X, Yakut_Y), where Yakut_X and Yakut_Y represent various combinations of Yakut groups, excluding the previously identified genetic outliers (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Compared with stage 1, neither the groups forming each subsequent stage nor modern Yakuts showed a statistically significant excess of genetic sharedness with Europeans, including Western Russians (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Furthermore, no enrichment was detected in any given archaeological stage relative to earlier stages (Z scores < 3; Extended Data Fig. 3d). Only one of the 100 tested combinations showed a slightly higher Western Russian genetic contribution to modern Yakuts than to stage 2 individuals. Collectively, these analyses indicate a marginal genetic impact of the Russian conquest on the Yakut groups analysed.

The stable and homogeneous genetic composition of historical and modern Yakuts helped refine existing models of their origins. DATES24 estimated the admixture time between the two primary ancestry sources between approximately 1100 and 1250 (using Yakutia_IA + Nganasan and Baikal_sib; see Supplementary Information section 2.12 for the rationale; Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 1h). ASCEND analyses25 (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Information section 2.13, Supplementary Fig. 2_10 and Supplementary Table 1i) further suggested that the Yakut population emerged shortly after this admixture (approximately 1210–1400), following a founder event of relatively mild intensity. The associated demographic bottleneck, quantified as the ratio between the bottleneck duration and twice the effective size, was estimated to 3.0–6.4%. Because HAPROH-based26 estimates indicated an already limited effective size throughout stages 1–4 (Ne of approximately 532–721; Supplementary Table 1j), our analyses support a brief bottleneck underlying the foundation of the Yakut population. These findings align with oral tradition and historical sources that depict the origin of the Yakut people in the aftermaths of the Great Mongol Empire expansion from the early thirteenth century6,7.

The arrival of Russian settlers introduced new food items, including barley, rye and various beverages10,27, into a diet traditionally dominated by meat and fish. To assess the potential impact of these dietary changes on the oral microbiome, we analysed the taxonomic and functional composition of 78 dental calculi and 55 teeth belonging to 85 Yakuts (Supplementary Table 1a,k). A subset of 74 individuals, spanning stages 1–4, exhibited typical oral microbial profiles with limited environmental contamination (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The most abundant bacterial species identified was Actinomyces dentalis, followed by other species, such as Desulfomicrobium orale, Desulfobulbus oralis and Olsenella sp. oral taxon 80, all known to be prevalent in past oral environments and to contribute to dental biofilms and plaque28 (Supplementary Fig. 2_11).

Taxonomic abundance profiles, determined using MetaPhlAn4 (ref. 29), as well as species-level alpha diversity, did not show significant shifts over the course of the Russian conquest (two-sided Wilcoxon test; P ≥ 0.66; Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Similarly, the diversity of functional pathways, assessed through HUMAnN 3.0 (ref. 30), UniRef90 (ref. 31) and ChocoPhlAn32, remained stable throughout the entire period (Fig. 3b). Both principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) and PCA, along with network-based clustering (Supplementary Information section 2.14 and Supplementary Fig. 2_14), revealed global overlap in taxonomic and functional diversity across archaeological stages. This stability was further supported by statistical tests, including analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) (Supplementary Table 1v) and multivariate analysis of variance (adonis2; Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1v), both rejecting greater similarity within archaeological stages than between them (0.55 ≤ P ≤ 0.89). Shifting focus to metabolic pathways to improve resolution, no statistically significant changes were observed in the abundance profiles of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic pathways (Kruskal–Wallis test; P ≥ 0.067; Fig. 3c, Supplementary Information section 2.16 and Supplementary Fig. 2_18). Restricting all the above analyses on the subset of 66 dental calculi did not alter the conclusions (Supplementary Information sections 2.14 and 2.16, Supplementary Figs. 2_13 and 2_19 and Supplementary Table 1m). Combined, these results depict a striking stability in oral microbiomes between approximately 1500 and 1900, despite the dietary changes introduced by the Russian conquest10.

Source Data

A previous study reported a shift in carbohydrate consumption during the Russian conquest33, from pine sapwood flour (dendrophagy) to barley and rye, alongside increased risks of dental infection linked to smoking, particularly in stage 4 (ref. 10). We investigated whether these changes affected oral health by analysing the abundance of five bacterial complexes involved in biofilm formation and periodontal disease34 and eight oral pathogens (Supplementary Information section 2.14). Our analyses revealed no significant increase in abundance levels from stages 1 to 4 (Kruskal–Wallis test; P ≥ 0.053; Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 2_12). Additionally, strain-level analysis of six oral pathogens or abundant oral species, which offer improved resolution into the oral health of ancient individuals relative to bacterial complexes35, indicated different strains circulating in Yakutia and the rest of the world, as well as no shifts during the Russian conquest (Supplementary Information section 2.15 and Supplementary Figs. 2_15–2_17). These findings indicate that oral health remained largely unchanged during this period, consistent with the low prevalence of dental cavities observed archaeologically27.

However, our data revealed the presence of smallpox in three stage 2 individuals from Central Yakutia (AC1S2, AC1S3 and Rassoloda; Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 2b, Supplementary Information section 2.17 and Supplementary Fig. 2_20), one of whom previously reported polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for smallpox12. Sequence data were derived from permafrost-preserved lung and bone tissues, as well as teeth and dental calculi (Supplementary Table 1p), although only limited portions of the smallpox genome could be characterized (average depths of coverage of 0.12-fold and 0.15-fold for AC1S2 and Rassoloda, respectively). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that the virus belonged to a strain distinct from those previously identified in Scandinavian and western Russian individuals from the seventh to tenth centuries36 and the two main clusters responsible for the twentieth-century outbreaks worldwide (VARV-PI and VARV P-II; Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 1q). Topological tests rejected clustering with the VD21 strain previously detected in a seventeenth-century female from Lithuania37, supporting a deeper phylogenetic placement (Supplementary Information section 2.18 and Supplementary Figs. 2_21 and 2_22). This suggests that different smallpox strains existed in Eurasia during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

Historical and ethnographic sources describe Yakut communities as structured around patrilineal and patrilocal clans, with strict exogamy38. Mitochondrial diversity was high across stages 1–4, whereas the number of Y-chromosomal haplotypes remained markedly limited (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the proportion of long identity-by-descent (IBD) segments (greater than 12 cM) in pairs of same-sex adults buried in different regions was significantly greater among males than females (Wilcoxon test; P < 0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 5a). These findings are consistent with the expectations of patrilocal clans practicing exogamy, although we caution that the predominance of males in the sampled assemblages may enhance the detection of genetic relatedness among males.

Kinship analyses identified 61 individuals genetically related up to the third degree, including four cases of first-degree and second-degree relatives buried at the same site (AtDaban, Oktiom, Oulakh and Arbre Chamanique, which translates to ‘shamanic tree' in English; Fig. 4a, Supplementary Information section 2.8 and Supplementary Table 1r–t). At Oulakh, three adult males, all first-degree relatives, were buried within a few metres of one another, and at AtDaban, a father and his adult son were buried together (Extended Data Fig. 5b), consistent with patrilocal practices. However, a grandmother was buried with her daughter and two grandchildren at Arbre Chamanique (Extended Data Fig. 5b), whereas at Oktiom, a juvenile male was buried alongside his sister's children and their father (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Although these findings suggest non-strict patrilocal practices, the funerary context of the latter two sites is unique across Yakutia16. It shows individuals deposited simultaneously, which is indicative of a catastrophic event, such as the smallpox outbreak that decimated people buried at Arbre Chamanique (AC1S2 and AC1S3). Further research, incorporating genetic analyses of large-scale funerary sites that represent entire communities, alongside denser sampling across broader geographic regions, is needed to assess the prevalence of patrilocal residence patterns.

In the present dataset, exogamy was primarily restricted to individuals within the same geographic region because no first-degree or second-degree relatives were identified across different regions (Fig. 4a). Accordingly, IBD segment sharing was stronger within pairs of individuals buried in the same region compared with those buried in different regions (t-test; P < 0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 5c). The number of inter-regional third-degree relationships was also markedly lower than expected under panmixia (χ2 test; P < 2.2 × 10−16). Furthermore, analysis of allele-sharing dissimilarity (ASD), microbiome composition and DNA methylation profiles, although from a limited subset of samples, revealed significant regional clustering (adonis2 non-parametric permutational multivariate analyses of variance; P = 0.0002, 0.0045 and 0.0037, respectively; Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1v). Combined, these results indicate that unions, interactions and microbial exchanges occurred primarily within regional boundaries. Although the current sample size and geographic range are limited relative to the vast expanse of Yakutia, this pattern contrasts with the prevailing archaeological interpretation, which proposed, on the basis of the same assemblages, that extensive migration between regions was responsible for the striking similarities in the material culture15.

Changes in ASD, pairwise distances on the basis of microbial communities and functional pathways, and DNA methylation (Supplementary Information section 2.19 and Supplementary Figs. 2_23–2_27) showed no statistical association with archaeological stages, which aligns with the observed stability of the Yakut gene pool and microbiome profiles over time. Although material culture linked to males and females was clearly distinct (adonis2; P = 0.0001; Fig. 4b, Supplementary Information section 2.20, Supplementary Fig. 2_28 and Supplementary Table 1v), sex did not significantly influence the similarity measured between genomes, methylomes or microbiomes (adonis2; P ≥ 0.15; Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1v). The latter aligns with stable isotope analyses, which reflect no dietary differences between males and females4. Furthermore, no associations were found between economic wealth, leadership, Christianity or shamanism and biological distances, whether estimated by genetic proximity, inbreeding or microbiomes (adonis2; P ≥ 0.14; Fig. 4b). This suggests that individuals with similar social and spiritual statuses were not necessarily biologically closer than those with different statuses. The lack of association between methylomes and socio-economic factors, such as wealth and leadership, further suggests that current approaches for reconstructing ancient methylomes provide limited resolution into past socio-economic status. Finally, the significant association between genetic distances and regional affiliation, but not with indicators of leadership, suggests that political power was not concentrated in a single clan.

Archaeological evidence of shamanic practices was found within close kin groups (AC1S2 and ACS3; Fig. 4a). However, shamanism was not associated with pairs of individuals close genetically (Pearson's χ2 test; P = 0.33; Fig. 4b), indicating that the practice was not confined to a single genetic familial clan. Although historical inbreeding levels were low (Supplementary Information section 2.9), the most inbred Yakut (UsSergue1; Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 2_4) also happened to be the last individual excavated with clear markers of traditional shamanism14,16 (Fig. 4d). She was genetically identified as the great-granddaughter of AtDaban6, who was married to Bozekov, the most prominent clan leader from the late seventeenth/early eighteenth centuries39. Her high inbreeding level suggests mating between second-degree relatives. However, it seems unlikely that UsSergue1 had access to shamanism because she was the offspring of exceptionally close kins, whereas the female buried with the most extensive collection of shamanic artefacts (KyysOunouoga)16 showed no evidence of consanguinity (Fig. 4c).

Our study clarifies the genetic origins of the Yakut people; the complex interplay between their marital, funerary and spiritual practices; and the extent to which these aspects were altered by the Russian conquest.

First, we found that the Yakut gene pool emerged through an admixture between a local population with roots in the Iron Age and another group probably from the Trans-Baikal region, which entered the area during the expansion of the Great Mongol Empire in the early thirteenth century6,7. This timeline, along with the broad connection with the Baikal region, concurs with oral traditions about their origins3. However, the persistence of a substantial local genetic component contrasts with cultural and linguistic evidence pointing to a predominant central Asian Turkic–Mongol influence7. We note, however, that the estimated contribution from the local population varies depending on the Baikal source considered, underscoring the need for denser sampling across the region and time period. Current models rely on population sources defined by a limited number of genetically characterized individuals, which probably do not capture the full extent of genetic diversity across the vast territory of Yakutia at the time of admixture. Despite these limitations, our results indicate that the Yakut history represents a fusion of a local population with a migrating group, both genetically and culturally.

Our analyses also improved previous studies on the basis of uniparental markers indicative of a founder event40,41 by showing that the demographic bottleneck preceding the Yakut expansion was rapid, occurring shortly after admixture, by no later than 1400. The earliest Yakut sequenced in our study (Atlasovka), buried by the late fifteenth/early sixteenth century, appeared to be a key ancestor in the reconstructed kinship networks, further supporting her foundational role42. Additionally, kinship analysis revealed that although first-degree and second-degree relatives could be buried at the same archaeological site, they were primarily found in geographically close locations, within a maximum of 159 km from one another (median distance of 45 m). This strong genetic proximity among burials from the same area remained evident even when close kins were excluded. Combined, these findings emphasize the deep-rooted connection between the Yakuts and the land of their fathers and grandfathers.

Furthermore, our genetic data revealed exceptions to patrilocality, and, despite the small effective population size, consanguinity remained limited. Although further research is required to assess how common such practices were, social norms allowed for close-kin unions, as shown by the UsSergue1 female, identified as the daughter of second-degree relatives. Crucially, she was buried with some funerary objects atypical of the late eighteenth century, reminiscent of the earliest Yakut material culture16,43. This female was the most recent bearer of traditional shamanic artefacts excavated. She was buried in one of the richest tombs identified and descended from the wealthiest clan documented39. Because she died right when Christian belief began to gain influence in Yakut society, she may be seen as an embodiment of a clan's attempts to preserve its cultural and spiritual traditions.

Finally, the Russian conquest was found to have had marginal genetic impact on the Yakut population, at least within the time periods and regions investigated in this study. Because the Yakuts traditionally deposited their dead on open platforms rather than burying them, the extent of Russian admixture within the broader population not represented archaeologically remains unknown. However, we note that the individuals buried span a wide range of economic and social statuses, from small group leaders, shamans and suicides to major clan leaders, suggesting minimal sampling bias. Although the extent of Russian admixture in Christian cemeteries is also uncharacterized, the Yakut genetic pool appears stable throughout all archaeological stages and into the present day, indicating limited admixture during Russian conquest. Therefore, our study portrays Yakutia as a middle ground44, where Yakuts and Russians engaged in an economic partnership rather than a site of military or demographic conquest. Historical sources highlight Yakut peoples as pivotal to the success of the then-expanding fur trade11, which not only motivated Russian conquest1,9 but also provided prominent Yakut clans with opportunities for considerable wealth and power39. Additionally, the harsh environment, often lethal to European settlers and unsuitable for large-scale cereal agriculture, prevented the establishment of large Russian settlements (Supplementary Information section 1.1 and Supplementary Fig. 1_1). Consequently, the Russian expansion in Yakutia relied heavily on local populations, representing a form of colonialism distinct from the settler colonialism of the Americas, which proceeded through Indigenous displacement and eradication45. It also diverged from the indirect rule characteristic of colonial India, where colonial authority was maintained through local leaders without administrating the territory. By contrast, Russian authorities imposed their tax systems on Yakut communities and co-opted Yakut elites by granting them citizenship and incorporating them into the imperial structure, fundamentally altering traditional Yakut political and social organization while making them subjects of a foreign empire.

Despite the absence of significant genetic impact, Russian conquest profoundly affected Yakut livelihoods and demographics. Russian contact introduced numerous infectious agents, including the smallpox identified here and Mycobacterium tuberculosis13, with devastating demographic effects on immunologically naive Indigenous populations. The severe outbreaks documented in historical sources were not detected in hapROH, indicating limited but stable and effective population sizes. This probably reflects the extremely rapid progression of these outbreaks or other factors limiting detection power. Although dietary shifts are well-documented10,27, our study failed to identify changes in the taxonomic and functional diversity of the Yakut oral microbiome. This contrasts with earlier studies that reported major changes in Neolithic Europe, alongside a dramatic increase in carbohydrate consumption46. Our findings also conflict with oral microbiome shifts documented in Great Britain (2200 bce–1853 ce), which have been linked to lifestyle, hygiene and dietary changes, including increased dairy and carbohydrate consumption47. The consistency of the Yakut oral microbiome over the short microevolutionary timescale investigated here (approximately 1500–1922) may reflect a shift in the carbohydrate types consumed (from wood-based flour to cereal flour)33 rather than a drastically increased intake. Moreover, our findings are in agreement with other studies reporting stable oral microbiomes over deep phylogenetic scales, including between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans48, and during the Neolithic transition from hunting and foraging to farming49. Future research is needed to understand the drivers of oral microbiome composition and function; the true capacity of dental calculus to capture these dynamics; and the broader response of the digestive microbiome to lifestyle, diet and health.

The exceptional archaeological record preserved in the Yakut permafrost provided a unique opportunity to reconcile evidence from material culture with the full spectrum of ancient DNA analysis, shedding light on population origins, social practices, health and individual status. In doing so, it contributed to the growing body of ancient DNA research aimed at capturing the multigenerational life of ancient communities.

Radiocarbon dating of the Mokp individual (UCIAMS210906: 2205 ± 20 BP, 364–197 International Radiocarbon Calibration Curve (2020 version, IntCal20) calibrated years bce) was carried out at the Keck Laboratory, University of California, Irvine, following the methodology described by Librado et al.50.

Age-at-death determination methods rely on a variety of skeletal indicators, including stages of auricular surface for adults51,52, stages of iliac crest or sternal end of the clavicle fusion, measurement of long bones for immature individuals53,54 and dental eruption sequences55,56. Biological sex is on the basis of genetic data, especially the so-called Ry ratio (Y to Y + X sequence coverage)57 (Supplementary Table 1a).

Samples were processed in the clean laboratory facilities at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse (CAGT), University of Toulouse, or at the Centre for GeoGenetics (CGG), University of Copenhagen, following ancient DNA procedures (Supplementary Information section 2.2).

After gentle surface abrasion, a portion of the dense part of the bone samples was collected using a diamond wheel (PROXXON or ARGOFILE instruments). For tooth samples, the cementum was isolated as recommended by Damgaard et al.58. The samples were either crushed into smaller fragments using a manual mortar or cutting pliers, or pulverized using a Retsch MM200 instrument and then placed in 5-ml Eppendorf LoBind tubes. DNA was extracted following a silica-column-based method, as described by Librado et al.59, without bleach pretreatment (Supplementary Information section 2.2).

Calculus samples were isolated, as described by Sabin and Yates60. Samples labelled as ‘Name_C' in Extended Data Fig. 4a (for example, Eletchei3_C_C_P4) were extracted for DNA following a protocol similar to that used for bones and cementum, except that no 1-h predigestion was performed and the digestion volume was limited to 1 ml. Samples labelled as ‘Name_CE' (for example, Eletchei3_CE_C_P4) were subjected to an overnight digestion at 50 °C in 555 µl of a buffer consisting of 0.45 M EDTA, 1.8 mg ml−1 of proteinase K and 9 mM dithiothreitol. The supernatant was further purified on a QIAGEN MinElute column and eluted in 40-µl sterile water.

Fragments of soft tissues (lung and muscle) were digested in 1.11 ml of a buffer containing 0.45 M EDTA, 1.8 mg ml−1 of proteinase K and 9 mM dithiothreitol, following an overnight incubation at 50 °C with agitation. After 12 min of centrifugation at 8,000 rpm, the supernatant was collected and purified on a silica column (MinElute; QIAGEN; 40-µl sterile water elution).

An aliquot of 22.8 µl of each DNA extract was incubated with 7-µl USER Enzyme mix (New England Biolabs) for 3 h at 37 °C to limit the impact of post-mortem cytosine deamination in downstream analyses by removing uracil residues. For a few samples, another DNA extract aliquot was also directly converted into a sequencing library.

Sequencing libraries were constructed from double-stranded DNA molecules by ligation of universal (method by Gamba et al.61, adapted from Meyer and Kircher62) or indexed63 blunt-end adaptors. To determine the optimal number of PCR cycles for amplifying DNA libraries and obtaining sufficient material for Illumina sequencing, quantitative real-time PCR was performed on 20X dilution aliquots of most of the libraries. The libraries were amplified for 5–15 cycles using AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with 3.5–6.5 µl of unamplified DNA library and 0.2 mM of each PCR primer in a total reaction volume of 50 µl. One primer of each pair contained an external 6-bp index, read during the Illumina Indexing Read. To limit the proportion of PCR duplicates, up to six independent amplifications were carried out for most DNA libraries. The PCR products were subsequently purified using either MinElute columns (QIAGEN) or AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), eluted in 20 µl or 25 µl of elution buffer (EB) supplemented with 0.05% Tween and quantified on TapeStation 2100/4200 or Bioanalyzer instruments (Agilent Technologies) and Qubit HS Assay (Invitrogen).

DNA library pools were sequenced at CAGT on the Illumina MiniSeq instrument; at CGG on Illumina NextSeq, HiSeq2000, HiSeq2500 and HiSeq4000 instruments; or at Centre National de Recherche en Génomique Humaine on the Illumina HiSeq X instrument. The vast majority of the sequencing data consisted of paired-end reads.

The demultiplexed FASTQ paired reads were processed using PALEOMIX64 bam_pipeline (v.1.2). Sequencing adaptors were trimmed (-mm 5) as well as poor-quality end, and paired-end reads were collapsed using AdapterRemoval 2 (v.2.3.1; ref. 65). All the resulting reads and those remaining paired were mapped against the hs37d5 reference genome using Bowtie 2 (ref. 66) with local sensitive mapping parameters. The binary alignment/map (BAM) alignment file was further filtered for alignment size superior or equal to 25 bp and mapping quality superior to 30. PCR duplicates were removed using Picard MarkDuplicates (http://picard.sourceforge.net), and realignment around indels was performed using GATK67. Sequencing statistics, as numbers of sequencing reads, endogenous DNA content and coverage are provided in Supplementary Table 1a,b.

All resulting alignments were merged into a single BAM file before pseudo-haploidization, with one read randomly sampled at positions characterized by one or more alignments. Pseudo-haploid genotypes were called using ANGSD (v.0.930; ref. 68) (htslib: 1.9), skipping positions and/or reads showing base and/or mapping Phred quality scores strictly lower than 30 (--doHaploCall 1 -doCounts 1 -minMapQ 30 -minQ 30 -remove_bads 1 -uniqueOnly 1) and restricting calls for those 1,233,013 SNP positions forming the 1240K panel18.

DNA fragmentation and nucleotide misincorporation patterns were visualized using mapDamage2 (v.2.0.8; ref. 69), with default parameters on a subset of 100,000 random reads. All damage profiles and base compositions were aligned with expected profiles, with or without USER treatment of DNA extracts70.

Error rates were calculated using ANGSD68 and the methodology used in a previous study71 (Supplementary Information section 2.4). Overall, the global error rates of each individual genome characterized in this study ranged between 0.000262 and 0.002819 substitutions per base on average, mostly inflated through transition misincorporations (Supplementary Table 1b).

A total of 46 women and 61 men were identified on the basis of Ry ratio (Supplementary Table 1a). Mitochondrial haplotypes were called using Haplogrep (v.2.266; ref. 72) after aligning reads against the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence reference mitogenome (GenBank accession no. NC_120920.1) and discarding those shorter than 25 bp, with mapping and base qualities below 30 (Supplementary Information section 2.5). The resulting variant call format file was then processed through Haplogrep72, calculating the best 100 hits. Contamination rates on the basis of mitochondrial data were estimated using schmutzi73 and the same base quality threshold as above. Nuclear contamination rates were estimated for male individuals, following the methodology by Rasmussen et al.74 and implemented in ANGSD68. Transition substitutions and sites covered once or more than 200 times were discarded.

Mitochondrial contamination estimates were assessed within a 0–5% confidence range for all individuals but three (Supplementary Information section 2.5 and Supplementary Table 1a), which were conservatively excluded from those analyses conditioned on archaeological stages. Nuclear contamination estimates were found to be limited (median of 0.24%) and inferior to 0.4% (Supplementary Table 1a). Y-chromosome haplotypes were called using the Yleaf statistical package75 (Supplementary Information section 2.5). The ploidy levels of each individual were checked following the methodology described by Sehnert et al.76 (Supplementary Information section 2.6 and Supplementary Fig. 2_3).

We imputed a subset of genomes using GLIMPSE2 (ref. 77) and the 1000G19 panel as reference dataset, following the instructions provided by the developers on the software website. To test for the minimal coverage needed to obtain accurate imputation, we downsampled the data of four high-coverage individuals, imputed the resulting genotypes and then assessed imputation accuracy by measuring the squared Pearson correlation between original and imputed genotypes (Supplementary Information section 2.7). We found that a minimal coverage of 0.35-fold was necessary for imputing genotypes represented at MAF of 5% or higher. A total of 90 Yakut individuals (coverage of 0.35-fold or higher) were then imputed and filtered for MAF of 5% or higher and genotype probability of 0.99 or higher for all downstream analyses. The imputed individuals were combined with the phased 1000G dataset for all downstream analyses, except for those on the basis of fineSTRUCTURE21, which required a liftover to the hg38 positions to include the matrix of phased genotypes released by Bergström et al.78, which included 20 modern Yakut individuals.

Relatedness between historical Yakuts was assessed on the basis of the pseudo-haploid data using a combination of three complementary methodologies: READ2 (refs. 79,80), lcMLkin81 and TKGWV2 (ref. 82) (Supplementary Information section 2.8 and Supplementary Table 1r–t). For READ2 (refs. 80,81) and TKGWV2 (ref. 82), the autosomal positions overlapping the 1240K dataset were used, restricting the former to MAF of 1% or higher. We disregarded first-degree and second-degree relationships if estimated from less than 1,000 and 2,000 SNPs, respectively, whereas the default filter of READ2 (refs. 79,80) was used for assessing third-degree relationships. Precise genealogies were reconstructed using the READ2 (refs. 79,80) results, age-at-death estimations, uniparental markers and estimated period of burial of each individual (Extended Data Fig. 5b and Supplementary Information section 2.8).

Identity-by-descent (IBD) contents were calculated using ancIBD83 on the direct output of GLIMPSE2 without MAF and genotype probability filters. As recommended, the Yakut dataset was downsampled to 1,240,000 SNPs, for which ancIBD was optimized, and IBD sharing was screened for every pair of imputed individuals (coverage of 0.35-fold or higher), with default settings83. For population analyses, individuals with the least SNPs covered in each pair of first-degree or second-degree relatives were removed.

The effective population sizes for each stage and region were estimated on the 1240K SNP pseudo-haploid panel, restricted to individuals with at least 400,000 SNPs covered, using hapROH26 with default parameters and 5,008 haplotypes from the 1000G project as a reference panel (Supplementary Table 1j). For each archaeological stage, PCA individual outliers were removed.

ROH were identified on the imputed dataset using plink84 (--homozyg) on set of 1000G biallelic transversions with MAF higher than 5%, removing any positions not fully covered (--geno 0). Inbreeding scores were calculated with plink84 (--het) using transversions only and MAF of 5% or higher (Supplementary Information section 2.9 and Supplementary Table 1a). To further confirm our results, we performed ROH detection using hapROH26 on the pseudo-haploid data for individuals with at least 400,000 SNPs covered on the 1240K panel (Supplementary Information section 2.9 and Supplementary Fig. 2_4).

PCA was carried out using the Human Origins reference panel for 597,573 autosomal genotypes. Genotypes were downloaded from the Allen Ancient DNA Resource (v.5) website18. We also included the genotypes from those Central Asian individuals with relevant genetic ancestry profiles reported by Zhang et al.85. PCA was on the basis of pseudo-haploid genotype calls for all the individuals presented in this study and carried out using smartPCA from EIGENSOFT (v.7.2.170; ref. 86), projecting 913 ancient Eurasian and American individuals and 106 ancient Yakut individuals (coverage of higher than 0.02-fold) onto the principal components obtained from in 2,761 Eurasian modern individuals (lsqproject, YES; shrinkmode, YES; Supplementary Information section 2.10 and Supplementary Fig. 2_5, where a non-projected PCA is shown). Projections on the first two principal components are provided in Fig. 2a, whereas PC2 and PC3 are provided in Extended Data Fig. 3b. A second PCA was carried out to validate our imputation pipeline by confirming similar projections for imputed genotype data and pseudo-haploid data (Supplementary Information section 2.10 and Supplementary Fig. 2_6).

Unsupervised ADMIXTURE (v.1.3.0; ref. 20) analyses were carried out to estimate the proportions of genetic ancestries present in Yakuts (coverage of 0.03-fold or higher; pseudo-haploid) using autosomal positions as part of the 1240K Human Origins panel and a total of 3,639 Eurasian and American individuals. Sites were thinned for linkage disequilibrium with plink84 (--indep-pairwise 200 25 0.4), resulting in a total of 327,582 SNPs. Confidence intervals were estimated from 100 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. Analyses were repeated ten times using ten random seeds to assess convergence (Supplementary Information section 2.11 and Supplementary Fig. 2_7). Full ancestry profiles are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2_8 for the entire dataset.

A fineSTRUCTURE (v.2; ref. 21) analysis was performed on the imputed data to explore patterns of haplotype sharedness. Imputed transversion genotypes were converted to hg38 positions with the tool LiftoverVcf from the Picard Toolkit 2019 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard), and related individuals were removed before merging with the phased genotypes from Bergström et al.78. The genotype positions showing missingness in at least one individual were removed, and MAF of 1% or higher was required, resulting in 1,059,615 autosomal sites. The merged dataset was split by chromosome, rephased using SHAPEIT (v.2; ref. 87) and transformed into ChromoPainter (v.2; ref. 21) format using ‘impute2chromopainter.pl' and a chromosome-based recombination map generated through the ‘makeuniformrecfile.pl' script. ChromoPainter (v.2; ref. 21) analyses were on the basis of 20 expectation–maximization iterations (-s1emits 20 -in -iM), with a starting switch rate of 250 (-n 250) and a global mutation rate of 0.0005 (-M 0.0005). The fineSTRUCTURE Markov chain Monte Carlo model was run on the ChromoPainter (v.2) output for 3,000,000 burn-in iterations and 2,000,0000 sampling iterations with no thinning (-s3iters 5000000 -s3iterssample 2000000 -s3itersburnin 3000000). The resulting co-ancestry matrix is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3c.

Different combinations of D-statistics were calculated using qpDstat in ADMIXTOOLS (v.5.056; ref. 23) to detect gene flow by testing whether pairs of modern and ancient Yakuts from each archaeological stage were symmetrically related to modern Eurasian populations. Calculations were carried out on the pseudo-haploid 1240K dataset using Mbuti (N = 10; ref. 78) as outgroup. The topologies investigated were in the form of (outgroup, Eurasian modern populations; StageX, StageY/modern Yakut). The results of the different D-statistics calculations, with Z scores corrected for multiple testing (Benjamini–Hochberg), are provided in Extended Data Fig. 3d, permuting StageX and StageY among the four archaeological stages and modern Yakuts. Positive values indicate closer genetic proximity between the modern Eurasian population and StageY (or modern Yakuts), relative to StageX.

Admixture models for ancient Yakut individuals (coverage of 0.1-fold or higher) were assessed using the pseudo-haploid 1240K dataset and qpAdm from ADMIXTOOLS (v.5.056; ref. 23), applying the feasibility criteria recommended by Flegontova et al.88, that is, coefficient ± 2 s.e. within the [0, 1] interval (P ≥ 0.01). The qpAdm models were aimed at testing whether the Yakut genomic makeup was compatible with a two-way admixture from a local Siberian background (Yakutia_IA, N = 2, comprising Mokp and yak03041 because they showed similar genetic profiles and PCA placements) and another source, potentially from the Baikal region (Baikal_his (N = 4) or Baikal_sib (N = 11)) or Russia (Russian78) (Supplementary Table 1f). Baikal sources were defined as Baikal_sib (N = 11) and Baikal_his (N = 4). The former included Mongolia_Khuvsgul_LateMedieval89 (N = 2), Mongolia_Dornod_LateMedieval89 (N = 7) and Mongolia_Khentii_LateMedieval89 individuals (N = 2), whereas the latter comprised Russia_AngaraRiver_Medieval.SG22 (N = 1), Mongolia_Sukhbaatar_Xiongnu (N = 1) and Mongolia_Khuvsgul_MLBALateMedieval89 individuals (N = 2). A full range of qpAdm admixture models were tested to identify the best sources for Baikal_his and the best western Russian source, including Yakutia_IA, Russia_AngaraRiver_Medieval.SG22 (N = 1), Mongolia_Sukhbaatar_Xiongnu (N = 1), Mongolia_Khuvsgul_MLBALateMedieval89 individuals (N = 2) and Buryat.SG90,91 (N = 4), and extending western sources to Polish, Bulgarian, Czech in addition to Russian (accounting for Slavic-speaking populations), Adygei, Abkhasian, Chechen, Lezgin and North Ossetian groups (accounting for the North Caucasus), Mansi (to represent Uralian-speaking populations) and Altaian (Turko–Mongolic-speaking populations) (Supplementary Information section 2.12 and Supplementary Table 1g). This resulted in the exclusion of Buryat.SG from the Baikal_his group because almost all of its models failed, whereas the other groups tested yielded consistent results. No other western sources outperformed the Russian group; therefore, we kept it as a proxy for the western source for the final models (Supplementary Information section 2.12 and Supplementary Table 1g). The Baikal_sib populations were selected because they exhibited the closest ADMIXTURE20 ancestry profiles (Supplementary Information section 2.11). Each ancient and modern individual from Yakutia was tested for every combination of two or three populations, putting the non-used population in the right group92 (Supplementary Table 1f).

We further applied DATES24, using both the pseudo-haploid and imputed datasets, to two-way models to estimate the time of the admixture event between the local ancestry source (Yakutia_IA + Nganasan) and Baikal populations (Supplementary Information section 2.12 and Supplementary Table 1h). Because the confidence intervals using the Baikal_sib source were more restrained (Supplementary Table 1h) and Baikal_sib covered more individuals, analyses incorporating the Baikal_sib source were preferred (Fig. 3d). The time of admixture between a Russian source78 and either a historical Yakut ancestry source (Yakut_his, comprising all newly sequenced Yakut individuals from the four stages, excluding related individuals and genetic outliers; N = 92) or the local ancestry source (Nganasan + Yakut_IA; N = 37) was also estimated for the imputed genomes of the PCA genetic outliers (Supplementary Table 1h). The corresponding weighted linkage disequilibrium decay curves are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2_9 and discussed in Supplementary Information section 2.12).

We used ASCEND25 to assess the intensity and estimate the time for the bottleneck underlying the foundation of the Yakut gene pool. These analyses were first run without specifying an outgroup and then repeated by choosing an outgroup (N = 15) randomly from the populations present in our dataset. Analyses were carried out by considering archaeological stages individually or the entire group of ancient Yakuts, both for the pseudo-haploid and imputed datasets, with the following parameters: binsize, 0.001; mindis, 0.001; maxdis, 0.3; maxpropsharingmissing, 1; minmaf, 0; usefft, YES; qbins, 100 (Supplementary Information section 2.13 and Supplementary Table 1i). The allele-sharing correlation decay curve together with the fitted exponential model from our outgroup tests are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2_10 and discussed in Supplementary Information section 2.13).

Microbial taxonomic profiles were determined for each individual DNA sample, restricting analyses to the fraction of collapsed reads. Reads aligned to the human genome (hg37) and the human mitochondrial genome were filtered out (Supplementary Information section 2.14). Microbial read counts were obtained using MetaPhlAn4 (ref. 29) (Supplementary Table 1l), discarding unclassified and too short reads. We applied a minimal read length filter set to the most frequent read length value (visually checked) minus ten, with strict boundaries set at less than 30 bp and greater than 70 bp (Supplementary Information section 2.14). This procedure was repeated on a panel of known sources (Supplementary Information section 2.14 and Supplementary Table 1k (for details and references)) that were used to assess the proportion of oral microbes contributing to each ancient DNA library, using SourceTracker2 (ref. 93), conditioning analyses on species level (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Samples showing more than 25% of oral sources were retained for further analyses because such proportions were observed in oral samples previously analysed and identified as authentic48. In cases where both tooth and calculus samples from the same individual passed filters, the profile maximizing oral microbial sources was kept, resulting in a final dataset of 74 individual oral microbiomes.

Bacterial taxa showing abundances lower than 1% were disregarded before carrying out composition visualization (Supplementary Fig. 2_11) and PCoA on the basis of Bray–Curtis distances (Fig. 3a). Species abundances of microbes belonging to different bacterial complexes (red, orange, yellow, green and purple), together with eight known oral pathogens, were measured and tested for potential shifts across archaeological stages (Kruskal–Wallis test; Fig. 3d, Supplementary Information section 2.14 and Supplementary Fig. 2_12). These analyses were repeated on a dataset restricted to calculus samples (Supplementary Information section 2.14 and Supplementary Fig. 2_13).

We also performed two complementary analyses to reveal subtle commonalities in the microbial compositions of the different samples that may have remained undetected in PCoA (Supplementary Information section 2.14). The first analysis followed Quagliariello et al.46 and their network and clustering methodology. No association was found in the distribution of individuals among clusters and archaeological stages (Pearson's χ2 test; P = 0.92; Supplementary Information section 2.14 and Supplementary Fig. 2_14). The second analysis investigated strain-level variation in the oral pathogens detected using StrainPhlAn4 (refs. 29,94), considering the most abundant bacterial species of the red complex and eight pathogens. Metagenomic data from dental calculus of several individuals, including Neanderthal outgroups and Eurasian individuals who lived within the past 500 years (Supplementary Table 1n), were accessed through the AncientMetagenomeDir (v.24.09; ref. 95) repository. These data were processed similarly to Yakut data before running StrainPhlAn4 with default parameters to extract species-specific MetaPhlAn markers. We prepared multi-FASTA alignments combining those markers together across all individuals and reconstructed maximum likelihood phylogenies in IQ-TREE (v.1.6.12; ref. 96) to assess whether or not new strains arrived in Yakutia at a specific archaeological stage (Supplementary Information section 2.15 and Supplementary Figs. 2_15–2_17). The best substitution model was estimated using the Akaike information criterion (-m MFP), and node support was assessed from 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap97 pseudo-replicates (UFBoot) (each bootstrap tree optimized using a hill-climbing nearest-neighbour interchange search; -bb 1000 -bnni). When the number of Neanderthal hits was found too limited to use them to root, the trees were rooted at midpoint.

The sequence data passing the SourceTracker2 filters described above were also subjected to functional analyses using the methodology implemented in HUMAnN 3.0 (ref. 30), with default parameters (Supplementary Table 1o). This step generated per-individual functional profiles on the basis of the UniRef90 (ref. 31) and ChocoPhlAn (January 2023; ref. 32) databases, which were further joined by pathways, normalized by counts per millions and centred log-ratio transformed to deal with compositional values that may arise from specific normalization in sequencing data, before conducting PCA (Fig. 3b). Selected pathways associated with carbohydrate or amino acid metabolism were scrutinized for their relative abundances across individuals and compared by archaeological stages using a Kruskal–Wallis test (P ≥ 0.067; Fig. 3c, Supplementary Information section 2.16 and Supplementary Fig. 2_18). These analyses were repeated on a dataset restricted to calculus samples (Supplementary Information section 2.16 and Supplementary Fig. 2_19).

Reads aligned to the human genome (hg37) and the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence mitochondrial genome were filtered out (Supplementary Information section 2.17). The resulting filtered FASTQ files were used for mapping against a selection of reference genomes from candidate pathogens (N = 26; Supplementary Information section 2.17 and Supplementary Fig. 2_20a). This alignment step was carried out using PALEOMIX64 bam_pipeline (v.1.2) and bwa-0.6 (ref. 98) (backtrack; MinQuality, 30; no seed; -n, 0.1), which produced high-quality BAM alignments that were removed for PCR duplicates. The number of aligned reads against each reference genome was counted per sample, together with average read-to-reference edit distances. We considered a sample positive for the presence of any given pathogen as long as a minimal number of 100 high-quality alignments were identified, and the average edit distance was equal to or below 0.01. This conservative approach resulted in the identification of three individuals positive for Variola major, the aetiologic agent of smallpox (AC1S2, AC1S3 and Rassoloda; Supplementary Information section 2.17 and Supplementary Fig. 2_20b).

All the sequence data generated for the three smallpox-positive individuals were realigned against the variola virus (VARV) smallpox reference genome (accession no. NC_001611.1), using the same procedure as above, except that the minimum alignment size was restricted to 30 bp instead of 25 bp to maximize potential sequence coverage. Although positive, AC1S3 did not provide a sufficient number of reads (N = 199) to proceed further with the rest of the analyses (Supplementary Table 1p). We next used mapDamage2 (v.2.0.8; ref. 69) with default parameters, and genotypes were called using bcftools (v.1.17; ref. 99) mpileup and call modules, requiring a maximum depth corresponding to the 99.5th percentile of the depth distribution, minimal base and mapping Phred qualities of 30 and considering the genome haploid. Low-quality genotypes (Phred quality score lower than 30), indels and polymorphisms within two base pairs of an indel were removed using the bcftools (v.1.17; ref. 99) filter.

To place the smallpox strains identified in the smallpox phylogenetic tree, we applied the same procedure as above to the raw reads previously published for five ancient samples36,37. Additionally, the FASTA sequence data corresponding to 45 smallpox genomes from the twentieth century previously characterized were downloaded100,101 (Supplementary Table 1q). The multi-FASTA sequence data, corresponding to the 45 modern viral genome, including the reference genome, were further aligned using MAFFT102 and manually corrected wherever appropriate. Gaps were added to the six ancient samples according to the gaps in the reference genome after the alignment procedure, and all FASTA were merged to form a multi-FASTA sequence of 52 viral genomes. Positions in which at least 50% of the sequences were covered were retained for maximum likelihood reconstruction in IQ-TREE (v.1.6.12; ref. 96) (-m MFP). Node support was estimated from 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap97 pseudo-replicates (-bb 1000 -bnni). A tree was also generated using the same procedure as described above, removing the manual correction of the modern genome alignment (Supplementary Information section 2.18 and Supplementary Fig. 2_21). The position of our sample in the tree obtained was then tested against seven alternative tree conformations by running an approximately unbiased topology test103 (Supplementary Information section 2.18 and Supplementary Fig. 2_22).

We used DamMet104 to evaluate DNA methylation levels in the genomes of 21 individuals with coverage greater than 9-fold, as a previous study established that relatively high coverage thresholds were needed to obtain reliable estimates. Overall, we followed the procedure previously described by Liu et al.105 to identify the best combination of parameters for DamMet104 DNA methylation inference (Supplementary Information section 2.19). The average cellular methylation fraction (M) was found to have no impact on correlation levels (Supplementary Information section 2.19, Supplementary Fig. 2_23 and Supplementary Table 1u); hence, a value of 75% was retained. Maximal correlation levels (0.38–0.8) were otherwise obtained for a maximum window size of 1 kb, windows of 25 CpGs and a minimum depth of 400 reads per window. Four individuals presented low correlation scores (Spearman correlation; R2 < 0.55) and were thus disregarded.

Despite encouraging correlation levels, two DNA methylation categories associated with scores of 0 and 1 were under-represented in the remaining samples (Supplementary Information section 2.19 and Supplementary Fig. 2_24a), in line with the work from Liu et al.105. We therefore followed the mitigation procedure developed by those authors to improve ancient DNA methylation inference using approximately 27.2 million CpGs in two modern bones published by Gokhman et al.106 (Supplementary Information section 2.19 and Supplementary Fig. 2_24b).

The validity of the resulting DNA methylation inference was also assessed by checking for the presence of well-established patterns along the genome (CpG islands, exons and introns and CTCF binding site regions), following the method by Hanghøj et al.107 (Supplementary Information section 2.19 and Supplementary Figs. 2_25–2_27). The DNA methylation profile observed for the Otchugoui individual did not align with expectations for CpG islands, exons and introns and CTCF binding regions, and it was therefore disregarded.

We generated a presence–absence matrix summarizing the characteristics of each burial (Supplementary Information section 2.20 and Supplementary Table 1a) and calculated pairwise Bray–Curtis between individuals (Supplementary Information section 2.20 and Supplementary Fig. 2_28). To test whether the distribution of distances calculated between pairs of individuals within categories (sex, region and archaeological stages) was significantly different from random permutations of individuals across categories, we used ANOSIM (anosim from the vegan package108 in R109) and a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (adonis2 from the vegan package108 in R109) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1v).

Moreover, we binned individuals into four extra categories defining wealth, leadership, Christianity and shamanism on the basis of the collection of cultural goods found in their burials (Supplementary Information section 2.20). To test whether the similarity of the oral microbiome between groups in these categories was lower than the similarity within each group, we used ANOSIM and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1v). These analyses were repeated for taxonomic and functional distances, genetic distances (ASD) and DNA methylation distances (Bray–Curtis; Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1v).

This study builds upon more than 15 years of archaeological research conducted in Yakutia, Sakha Republic, an autonomous region of the Russian Federation located in northeastern Siberia (Supplementary Information section 1.3). The fieldwork was conducted under the MAFSO programme (French Archeological Mission in Eastern Siberia), a collaboration between French researchers and local Yakut experts, including scholars from North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk. The programme was approved in June 2012 by the Local Committee for Biomedical Ethics of the Federal State Budgetary Institution, known as the Yakut Scientific Center of Complex Medical Problems of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. Throughout the programme, local experts were fully engaged as equal partners, contributing to research design, archaeological excavations, material selection for analysis, community outreach, permit acquisition and critical feedback on analyses and manuscripts. Their contributions are reflected in their co-authorships in this study and 21 scientific articles and reviews published between 2004 and 2021. The research team also implemented a wide array of activities to engage with local communities, including fieldwork and student training, and played an active role in public outreach through documentaries, press interviews, television programs and exhibitions. The programme was supported by several inter-university collaborative research agreements, notably between Université Paul Sabatier, Krasnoyarsk State Medical University and North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk. It also received endorsement from the Institute of Ecology and Evolution at CNRS through the International Associated Laboratory ‘Coevolution Human–Environment in Eastern Siberia'. The programme facilitated extensive community engagement, highlighted by the 2019 exhibition at the Historical Park Rossiya-Moya Istoriya in Yakutsk, which showcased the main archaeological discoveries made under MAFSO.

Cellular lipid metabolism is subject to strong homeostatic regulation, but the players involved in and mechanisms underlying these pathways remain largely uncharacterized. Here we develop a ‘feeding–fishing' approach coupling membrane editing using optogenetic lipid-modifying enzymes (feeding) with organelle membrane proteomics through proximity labeling (fishing) to elucidate molecular players and pathways involved in the homeostasis of phosphatidic acid (PA), a multifunctional lipid central to glycerolipid metabolism. This approach identified several PA-metabolizing enzymes and lipid transfer proteins enriched in and depleted from PA-fed membranes. Mechanistic analysis revealed that PA homeostasis in the cytosolic leaflets of the plasma membrane and lysosomes is mediated by both local PA metabolism and the action of lipid transfer proteins that carry out interorganelle lipid transport before subsequent metabolism. More broadly, the interfacing of membrane editing to controllably modify membrane lipid composition with organelle membrane proteomics using proximity labeling represents a strategy for revealing mechanisms governing lipid homeostasis.

Membranes are complex and dynamic assemblies that regulate myriad cellular processes. The lipid composition of membranes, crucial to membrane biophysical properties and the functions of the membrane-associated proteome, is determined by a balance of activities of lipid-metabolizing enzymes and lipid transfer proteins (LTPs). Efforts to decode these lipid–protein networks are complicated by the rapid diffusion, trafficking and, in many cases, short metabolic half-lives of lipids.

One type of lipid emblematic of these challenges is phosphatidic acid (PA)1. A central player in lipid metabolism, PA is produced by at least four different biosynthetic routes and metabolized into phospholipids, triglycerides or fatty acids by three pathways2,3. Despite representing only 1% of the lipidome, PA is present in most organelle membranes, and its levels transiently rise downstream of signaling from numerous cell-surface receptors and soluble signaling enzymes4,5. Because such PA bursts induce potent signaling events, PA is subject to strong homeostatic regulation, with its levels tightly controlled in space and time by modulation of both biosynthetic flux and regulated interorganelle transport by LTPs4,5,6,7. Although several PA-metabolizing enzymes and PA-specific LTPs have been characterized, it is not well understood how cells sense changes to levels of PA to regulate the activities of these enzymes and transporters to ultimately restore PA levels and achieve homeostasis.

Here, we develop and exploit a ‘feeding–fishing' strategy to map proteins involved in such homeostatic processes and identify mechanisms of how cells respond to changes in the lipid composition of their organelle membranes. In this approach, we combined membrane editing using an optogenetic superactive phospholipase D (superPLD) with proximity-dependent biotinylation using a membrane-tethered TurboID, followed by tandem mass tagging (TMT)-based mass spectrometry (MS) to enable protein identification and quantification. In this manner, feeding PA to a membrane and fishing out proteins associated with that membrane would identify proteins that accumulate on or are depleted from a target membrane in response to changes in PA levels within that membrane.

Our studies reveal changes to the membrane recruitment of several PA-metabolizing enzymes and LTPs in PA-fed membranes that collectively facilitate removal of excess PA. Analysis of lipid-metabolizing enzymes points to roles for certain PA metabolic pathways in clearing PA pools from the plasma membrane and lysosomes. Mechanistic investigations using confocal microscopy to visualize PA pools and lipidomics to track changes to the phospholipidome revealed divergent roles for several LTPs recruited to PA-fed membranes in affecting PA metabolism. In particular, we found that Nir2, an LTP known to transport PA between the plasma membrane and ER, impacted PA homeostasis not only at the plasma membrane but also at other organelles, and SCP2, a broad-spectrum LTP implicated in sterol and fatty acid transport, can also mediate PA clearance. We additionally point to unexpected roles for members of the SMP and ORD domain-containing LTP families in PA homeostasis, including PDZD8, TEX2 and ORP1L. Collectively, membrane editing with superPLD coupled to proximity labeling enables identification of regulators of PA homeostasis, revealing cellular mechanisms underlying rapid PA metabolism and interorganelle transport.

Membrane editing is an emerging strategy to precisely manipulate the lipid composition of organelle membranes within living cells to study the physiological functions of individual lipids8,9. We previously devoted substantial efforts toward development of membrane editors for PA. First, we designed an optogenetic PLD (optoPLD) to acutely produce PA on target organelle membranes10. PLDs produce PA through the hydrolysis of abundant phospholipids, and optoPLD uses a blue-light-inducible heterodimerization system to recruit PLD onto desired membranes. Moreover, the ability of PLDs to additionally catalyze transphosphatidylation with exogenously supplied primary alcohols to produce a variety of natural and unnatural phospholipids underscores the versatility of optoPLD for editing the phospholipidome11.

To overcome the relatively modest activity of the first-generation optoPLD, we greatly improved its performance by using directed evolution in mammalian cells12. The resultant superPLDs, which acquired several mutations that optimized performance of this disulfide-containing, secreted protein from Streptomyces sp. PMF in the mammalian intracellular environment, exhibited up to 100-fold higher activity in cells compared to the original editor (wild-type optoPLD). SuperPLDs were demonstrated as potent membrane editors for spatiotemporally defined editing of phospholipids with organelle-level precision in live cells.

Our feeding–fishing strategy to identify proteins associated with PA-fed membranes involves superPLD-enabled membrane editing coupled to proximity proteomics (Fig. 1a). Currently, there are two widely used types of proximity labeling enzymes with distinct labeling mechanisms: promiscuous biotin ligase (for example, TurboID13) and engineered peroxidase (for example, APEX2 (ref. 14)). Promiscuous biotin ligase releases a biotin-AMP intermediate that reacts with lysine residues on proximal proteins, whereas proximity labeling with engineered ascorbate peroxidase is mediated by biotin-phenoxyl radicals that react with tyrosine residues15. These enzymes are generally expressed in intracellular compartments, where the reactive intermediates are highly confined, and their cross-membrane diffusion is rare.

a, Feeding–fishing strategy couples membrane editing and proximity labeling for elucidation of regulators of PA homeostasis on different organelle membranes. An optogenetic superPLD is targeted to a membrane of interest to feed it with PA, and a proximity labeling enzyme is anchored to the same membrane to enable biotinylation to fish out proteins recruited to the lipid-edited membrane.

Because there are limited examples of tethering these enzymes to membranes to map membrane-proximal proteomes, we first explored the feasibility of using these two types of proximity labeling systems in this application, that is, to selectively label proteins that reside on the same membrane they are tagged to. We expressed APEX2 or TurboID fused to a plasma membrane targeting sequence, Lyn10, to localize the enzyme to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. In the same cells, we coexpressed the wild-type optoPLD (from a bicistronic expression vector, CRY2–mCherry–PLD–P2A–CIBN–Tag where Tag is an organelle-targeting sequence) targeted to the cytosolic leaflet of either the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Surprisingly, plasma membrane-tagged APEX2 showed no difference in the labeling of optoPLD on the same (plasma membrane) versus different (ER) membrane, whereas TurboID preferentially labeled optoPLD on the same membrane (Fig. 1b,c). Consistent with this result, TurboID, when targeted to specific membranes, exhibited better colocalization with biotinylated proteins than APEX2 (Fig. 1d,e). From these results, we concluded that TurboID would be an optimal enzyme for mapping proteins associated with membranes of interest.

Among various membranes that could be targeted by superPLD and TurboID, we selected the cytoplasmic leaflets of the plasma membrane and lysosomal membrane because of the proposed localization and physiological functions of mammalian PLD1/2, which can initiate PA-based signaling on these membranes16,17,18. We previously showed that CIBN fused to the CAAX domain of KRAS19 (CIBN–CAAX) and the lysosome-targeting sequence of p18/LAMTOR1 (ref. 20) (p18–CIBN) can mediate effective superPLD recruitment and consequent PA enrichment on plasma membrane and lysosomes, respectively12. Using the same sequences for targeting TurboID to these membranes, we confirmed that these membrane-tethered TurboIDs showed equally high and promiscuous labeling activity to the originally reported ER membrane-tethered TurboID13 (Fig. 1f).

The feeding–fishing strategy requires coexpression of both TurboID and superPLD in cells at high efficiency. To avoid potential long-term effects of chronic expression, we performed transient expression by one-shot, lentivirus-based transduction. Although optoPLD or superPLD is typically expressed using a P2A self-cleavable peptide to ensure equimolar expression of CRY2–mCherry–PLD and CIBN–Tag, we found that for this application, separating these two components enabled more efficient transduction because of the limited size of DNA inserts that each lentivirus can encapsulate21. Therefore, our optimized protocol involved a triple lentivirus transduction system with one lentivirus each harboring TurboID–Tag, CRY2–mCherry–PLD or CIBN–Tag (Fig. 1g). To facilitate the incorporation of lentivirus into cells, we used spinfection, which is a method to apply mild centrifugation force during transduction22. The ratio of three lentivirus strains was optimized, on the basis of their titers, to achieve the highest coexpression efficiency while keeping cell viability unaffected. With these modifications, we achieved high efficiency (>75%) for transient cotransduction of HEK 293T cells with TurboID and superPLD targeted to either the plasma membrane or lysosomes (Fig. 1h,i).

We next performed proximity proteomics to identify the effects of local PA production on the proteomes of different membranes. We treated HEK 293T cells coexpressing TurboID and superPLD, targeted to either the plasma membrane or lysosomes, for 30 min with intermittent blue light (470 nm, 5 s per 1 min) to activate superPLD, followed by a 3-min labeling with 150 μM biotin (Fig. 1g). As a negative control, we used cells transduced with TurboID and a catalytically dead superPLD (H167A;H440A, deadPLD) that does not produce PA. Catalytically dead control samples were subjected to the same 470-nm blue-light irradiation protocol to account for any potential membrane environmental changes because of foreign protein recruitment or light-induced side effects23. Biotinylated proteins from two conditions (superPLD versus deadPLD) and three replicates were combined for TMT 16-plex proteomics analysis to identify proteins that were selectively enriched on or depleted from PA-fed membranes (Fig. 2a).

In these feeding–fishing proteomics experiments, we detected 4,401 and 4,260 biotinylated proteins from the plasma membrane and lysosomes, respectively, with high correlations between replicates (Fig. 2). To identify proteins that were enriched on or depleted from PA-fed membranes, we calculated protein enrichment in the superPLD samples relative to deadPLD controls and plotted abundance ratios and associated P values (Fig. 2b,c). Among the hits that showed a significant enrichment on PA-fed membranes (based on the abundance ratio P value) were two known PA-metabolizing enzymes, Lipins 1 and 2 (LPIN1/2), which degrade PA into diacylglycerol (DAG). Correspondingly, DAG kinase δ (DGKD), which produces PA from DAG, was found to be depleted from PA-fed membranes. Furthermore, the best-characterized mammalian PA transfer protein, Nir2 (PITPNM1), was also enriched on both plasma membranes and lysosomes upon PA production, supporting the validity of the feeding–fishing proteomics. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis of representative target proteins revealed that the enrichment was because of differences in their labeling and localization patterns rather than their global expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 1).

We used the Gene Ontology biological process annotation to comprehensively highlight proteins associated with lipid biology: lipid localization (which includes lipid transport), lipid metabolic process, regulation of lipid localization, regulation of lipid metabolism and response to lipids. For the plasma membrane feeding–fishing studies, 42 proteins associated with these terms were enriched on this membrane and 18 were depleted; similarly, for lysosomal feeding–fishing experiments, 40 such proteins were enriched and 25 were depleted from lysosomal membranes (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 1).

Beyond proteins related to lipid transport and metabolism, interactome analysis using the STRING network revealed additional insights, including notable changes in mitochondrial proteins, which were enriched on PA-fed plasma membranes and depleted from lysosome-depleted membranes (Extended Data Fig. 2). An examination of mitochondrial morphology found alterations in cells expressing superPLD, where mitochondria appeared as round, fragmented structures (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Interestingly, a similar phenotype was recently reported upon induction of acute DAG synthesis at the outer mitochondrial membrane, whose lipid composition was found to regulate membrane-shaping proteins that alter mitochondrial morphology24. Consistent with this finding, our data showed that the tendency and kinetics of mitochondrial fragmentation were strongly influenced by the site of PA production, with PA generated on membranes more closely associated with mitochondria (for example, ER) being more effective than PA produced on more distal membranes (for example, plasma membrane) (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c).

Nir2 is a well-characterized PA transfer protein that translocates to ER–plasma membrane contact sites upon PA production (for example, following PLC activation) and facilitates PA transfer from the plasma membrane to the ER6. Because our feeding–fishing proteomics detected Nir2 to be enriched not only at the plasma membrane but also on lysosomes upon PA feeding, we overexpressed an miRFP-tagged Nir2 construct to monitor its localization in mammalian cells. miRFP–Nir2 exhibited mostly cytosolic but weakly ER-associated localization under basal conditions, in agreement with a previous study using GFP–Nir2 (ref. 6). Upon light-induced superPLD recruitment to the plasma membrane or to lysosomes, miRFP–Nir2 relocalized to these membranes, strongly colocalizing with superPLD (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b).

Three independent experiments were performed with similar results. Scale bars, 10 μm. NS, not significant.

We then tested whether Nir2 could exert its PA transfer function on these PA-fed membranes. To minimize any potential interference on its function caused by the fluorescent protein fusion, we replaced miRFP with a V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) and used lentiviral transduction to generate HEK 293T cells stably expressing V5–Nir2 (Extended Data Fig. 4c). To monitor PA localization in these cells, we coexpressed superPLD with the PA reporter GFP–Spo20 (ref. 25). GFP–Spo20 was chosen over GFP–PASS, a version designed with a nuclear export signal for improved sensitivity24, because the predominantly nuclear localization and lack of cytosolic signal of GFP–Spo20 simplified the quantitative colocalization analysis (Fig. 3c). In control wild-type cells, superPLD targeted either to the plasma membrane or to lysosomes triggered PA enrichment on these membranes, as illustrated by accumulation of GFP–Spo20 at the membranes where superPLD was localized (Fig. 3d,e). By contrast, in cells stably expressing V5–Nir2, this PA enrichment did not occur. Quantification of the overlap between GFP–Spo20 and superPLD fluorescence upon superPLD activation revealed little colocalization in V5–Nir2-expressing cells but increasing colocalization over time in cells expressing either the T59A lipid transfer mutant of Nir2 or empty vector, as continuous superPLD activation would be expected to elevate PA levels (Fig. 3f,g).

We then set out to discover new PA transport proteins from among the feeding–fishing proteomics hits. We selected three additional LTPs—SCP2, PDZD8 and OSBPL1A/ORP1L—that were significantly enriched on PA-fed membranes. As with Nir2, we produced HEK 293T cells stably expressing V5-tagged versions of each LTP (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Consistent with previous reports, PDZD8–V5 localized to the ER and lysosomes26, and V5–ORP1L localized to lysosomes27. V5–SCP2 localized exclusively to punctate structures that partially colocalized with lysosomes (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Expression of the SCP2 gene leads to two protein isoforms, a full-length 58-kDa SCP2 (also known as SCP-x) and a precursor 15-kDa polypeptide, proSCP2; both of these proteins undergo post-translational cleavage to produce a 13-kDa C-terminal fragment known as mature SCP2 (mSCP2)28. The N-terminal remnant of full-length SCP2/SCP-x, after proteolytic cleavage in the peroxisomes, becomes a functional peroxisomal thiolase29, which explains the punctate localization of our V5–SCP2 construct. In line with previous studies30, a V5 fusion to mSCP2 showed increased cytosolic localization with much weaker association with peroxisomes (Extended Data Fig. 4e).

We then assessed the effects of these LTPs on local PA enrichment. Whereas stable cell lines expressing the respective LTP did not show any noticeable difference in superPLD expression or activity levels (Extended Data Fig. 4f–h), HEK 293T cells stably expressing SCP2/SCP-x or proSCP2 showed a significant delay in the colocalization between GFP–Spo20 and superPLD to either membrane, indicating reduced PA enrichment on these membranes (Fig. 3h–k). The PA reduction effect with proSCP2 was stronger than with SCP2/SCP-x, which aligns with differences in their maturation efficiencies, as cleavage of SCP-x is partial, whereas proSCP2 undergoes complete cleavage28,31. To directly assess the capacity of SCP2 in mediating PA clearance through its lipid transfer activity, we reconstituted its activity in vitro using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer dequenching assay with tethered donor and acceptor liposomes32. In these studies, purified mSCP2 was anchored to donor liposomes to increase its effective local concentration, and fluorescence dequenching was used to assess lipid transport from donor to acceptor liposomes. We found that mSCP2 exhibited lipid transfer activity in a manner dependent on both PA and mSCP2 concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 5). These studies suggest that SCP2, characterized as a transporter of fatty acids and several other types of phospholipids, may also function as a PA transfer protein in cells.

In contrast to SCP2, expression of two other LTPs tested, PDZD8 and ORP1L, did not induce a decrease in PA enrichment from PA-fed membranes (Fig. 4a–d). Because both PDZD8 and ORP1L can bind to PA in vitro33,34, we examined whether superPLD-induced PA enrichment caused any changes in their subcellular localization using GFP fusions to these proteins. PDZD8–GFP was found mostly at the ER, similar to PDZD8–V5 immunofluorescence, and GFP–ORP1L showed some lysosomal association along with a cytosolic pool (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). It is noteworthy that the lysosomal pool of GFP–ORP1L exhibited limited colocalization with lysosome-targeted superPLD, suggesting that ORP1L and the p18/LAMTOR-targeted superPLD may reside in different microdomains. In addition to PDZD8, another SMP domain-containing LTP35, TEX2, was also enriched on PA-fed lysosomes in feeding–fishing proteomics. Both PDZD8 and TEX2 showed relatively high association with lysosome-targeted superPLD (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). We found that acute PA production on lysosomes led to increased association between ER and lysosomes, and knockdown of PDZD8 mitigated this effect (Fig. 4g,h). Because both PDZD8 and TEX2 have been reported to localize to and mediate lipid transfer at ER–lysosome contact sites36, their detection in the feeding–fishing proteomics may reflect increased ER–lysosome association mediated by PA, rather than direct interactions with PA.

Source data

In our feeding–fishing proteomics studies, several enzymes that degrade or produce PA were, respectively, either enriched on or depleted from PA-fed membranes. Notably, these enzymes displayed differential abundances between PA-fed plasma membranes and lysosomes (Extended Data Fig. 7a). For example, all three isoforms of the lipin PA phosphatases (LPIN1/2/3) were enriched on PA-fed plasma membranes, whereas only LPIN1 was detected on PA-fed lysosomes and at lower abundance levels (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 1d). To understand the potential impact of these differences on PA metabolism and overall phospholipid homeostasis, we investigated the global changes to the phospholipidome by liquid chromatography (LC)–MS-based lipidomics after superPLD-mediated membrane editing to feed PA to either the plasma membrane or lysosomes (Fig. 5a,b).

a, Schematic depiction of PA feeding coupled to lipidomics to examine changes to cellular phospholipid levels. Lentiviral spinfection was used to express superPLD or deadPLD targeted to the plasma membrane or lysosomes. Then, 48 h after spinfection, cells were illuminated with or without intermittent blue light (470 nm, 5 s per 1 min) for 60 min to induce PLD recruitment to the plasma membrane or lysosomes.

Fold changes were calculated on the basis of phospholipid levels in control HEK 293T cells expressing empty V5 vector and otherwise treated identically.

We found that HEK 293T cells expressing plasma membrane or lysosome-targeted superPLD exhibited light-dependent increases in PA levels after blue-light-induced superPLD recruitment to the target organelle membrane (Fig. 5c). Such increases in PA required superPLD activity, as they were not observed upon recruitment of deadPLD to these membranes (Fig. 5c). A more pronounced PA increase was observed at the plasma membrane compared to lysosomes upon PA feeding, indicating a slower net turnover of PA molecules at the plasma membrane. This finding is interesting considering the higher abundance of lipins at PA-fed plasma membranes (Extended Data Fig. 7a), which suggests an increased conversion of plasma membrane PA pools to DAG.

The conversion of PA to DAG is bidirectional in cells (where the reverse reaction is catalyzed by DAG kinases), and the rapid turnover of DAG molecules has been observed with an estimated half-life of one to several minutes37,38,39. By contrast, the conversion of PA to cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-DAG (and subsequently to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)) is unidirectional. It is possible that the sustained buildup of PA at the plasma membrane results from increased PA flux within the bidirectional PA–DAG pathway, eventually leading to slower net PA turnover, and the increased abundance of lipins and DAG kinase η (DGKH) on PA-fed plasma membrane could be involved in this event (Extended Data Fig. 7). Moreover, despite superPLD consuming phosphatidylcholine (PC; with a preference for abundant species with 34:1 and 36:1 acyl chains10) for PA production, the levels of these lipid species did not change, suggesting that a substantial portion of PA produced on this timescale is routed to the Kennedy pathway as well to replenish these phospholipids (Fig. 5b). Concomitantly, the increased levels of PtdIns in PA-fed lysosomes may be accounted for by PA flux into the PA–CDP-DAG pathway.

SuperPLD expression results in moderate background PA production activity even in the dark12, which we addressed by using a next-generation, ultralow-background membrane editor for PA production termed LOVPLD40; thus, we hypothesized that superPLD-expressing cells would exhibit chronically elevated PA levels. However, in contrast to the robust PA increase observed during acute PA production (Fig. 5c), the overall difference resulting from chronic background PA production, analyzed by comparing deadPLD-expressing versus superPLD-expressing cells, was modest or even absent (Fig. 5d). Instead, a striking increase was observed in PG levels, suggesting that cells maintain PA homeostasis by removing excess PA molecules through the CDP-DAG pathway. Interestingly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of a mitochondrial CDP-DAG synthase (CDS), TAMM41 (refs. 41,42), attenuated this PG increase in superPLD-expressing cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Because PG synthesis occurs in mitochondria and TAMM41 is responsible for the CDS activity localized there41, our lipidomics analysis and the observed changes in mitochondrial morphology upon acute PA production (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c) suggest that PA trafficking to and metabolism on mitochondria may serve as a mechanism to remove excess PA.

Beyond these changes in recruitment of PA-metabolizing enzymes, the feeding–fishing experiments also revealed recruitment of several LTPs that could potentially be involved in restoring PA homeostasis (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Indeed, our confocal microscopy analysis in cells coexpressing superPLD and the PA-binding probe demonstrated that forced expression of two such LTPs, Nir2 and SCP2, can diminish local enrichment of PA at the plasma membrane and lysosomal membranes (Fig. 3). To directly investigate the roles of these lipid transporters in the global regulation of PA metabolism, we performed lipidomics analysis on cells subjected to PA feeding of either the plasma membrane or lysosomes that also overexpressed one of these LTPs. We found that forced expression of either Nir2 or SCP2 caused a significant attenuation in the global increase of PA levels that occurs upon PA feeding of either organelle membrane (Fig. 5e,f). These two LTPs had a stronger effect in decreasing excess PA at the plasma membrane compared to at lysosomes, a finding that aligns with our lipidomics analysis indicating slower baseline levels of PA turnover at the plasma membrane (Fig. 5c). Combined with the imaging analysis, these lipidomics results suggest that Nir2 and SCP2 can facilitate PA clearance at both local and global levels.

Overexpression of PDZD8 also led to a modest but significant decrease in cellular PA levels (Fig. 5e,f). Taken together with the increased ER–lysosome association observed upon PA production (Fig. 4g,h), it is plausible that PDZD8 and TEX2 contribute indirectly to PA clearance either by mediating lipid transfer at or facilitating formation of ER–lysosome contact sites, rather than by directly binding to PA or PA-fed membranes. Lastly, in cells overexpressing ORP1L, we observed an unexpected elevation in PA levels upon PA feeding, particularly at lysosomes (Fig. 5f). This PA enrichment persisted when full-length ORP1L was replaced with ORP1L variants bearing amino acid substitutions in either the PtdIns4P-binding site (H651A;H652A)27, in a well-conserved lipid-binding motif, EQVSHHPP, located within the ORD domain43, or its FFAT motif (F476A;Y477A)27, which mediates ER targeting through interactions with VAPA/B. However, the PA enrichment was antagonized by expression of an ORP1L mutant in its ORD domain that is deficient in cholesterol binding (Y583A)44 (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d).

Our proteomics and lipidomics analyses suggest that cells maintain PA homeostasis by harnessing two pathways for PA consumption, the Kennedy pathway and CDP-DAG pathway, and multiple LTPs including Nir2 and SCP2 facilitate PA trafficking and ultimate clearance in cells. To further explore how the native forms of these LTPs may regulate PA distribution and signaling as a complement to overexpression studies, we depleted the endogenous pools of these LTPs by siRNA-mediated knockdown (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). We found that, in SCP2-depleted cells, stable expression of superPLD resulted in substantial cell death, potentially because of exacerbation of lipid metabolic defects upon SCP2 depletion by chronic levels of excess PA production that occur upon superPLD expression, even in the dark45. Therefore, we switched from superPLD to LOVPLD to reduce the effect of chronic background PA production. Whereas SCP2-depleted cells showed drastically reduced the expression levels of all transfected plasmids (~25% and ~50% lower levels of LOVPLD and PA probe expression level, respectively, than in control cells; Extended Data Fig. 9c,d), the patterns of PA enrichment were largely consistent with those in control cells (Fig. 6a,b; quantification shown in Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). Interestingly, in cells depleted of Nir2, PA distribution was markedly different but nonoverlapping with the site of PA production. Instead, in Nir2-depleted cells, PA production by LOVPLD either at the plasma membrane or on lysosomes led to PA accumulation in a perinuclear compartment that corresponded to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 6a–c).

a,b, Confocal microscopy images of HEK 293T cells, with or without depletion of Nir2 (siNir2) or SCP2 (siSCP2), coexpressing a PA-binding probe (GFP–PASS) and LOVPLD (containing mCherry) localized on either plasma membrane (a) or lysosomes (b).

LOVPLD was localized to the plasma membrane, lysosomes or ER, and 30-min incubation with intermittent blue-light illumination (470 nm, 500 ms per 5 s) was used to activate PA production by LOVPLD. DsiRNA targeted to a respective LTP was used to deplete Nir2 (siNir2), SCP2 (siSCP2) or PDZD8 (siPDZD8) (n = 4 biological replicates, except for siPDZD8, where n = 2 biological replicates). Black horizontal bars indicate the mean and vertical error bars indicate the s.d. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey HSD test (**P = 0.008, **P = 0.001 and P = 0.16 for plasma membrane LOVPLD control versus siRNA samples; *P = 0.01, **P = 0.009 and P = 0.9 for lysosome LOVPLD control versus siRNA samples; P = 0.21, 0.14 and 0.9 for ER LOVPLD control versus siRNA samples).

Lastly, we asked whether changes in PA trafficking and metabolism caused by knockdown of these LTPs led to functional consequences. We focused on mTOR signaling, which is known to be activated by PA produced by PLDs46. In cells stably expressing LOVPLDs at the plasma membrane, lysosome or ER, we observed light-dependent increases in the activity of mTOR signaling, measured by the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K) (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 9g). The depletion of Nir2 or SCP2 but not PDZD8 further increased the mTOR activity, correlating with the abilities of these proteins to clear excess PA produced by membrane editing. Notably, a similar degree of increase was observed in LTP-depleted cells without PA overproduction (Extended Data Fig. 9h,i), potentially reflecting changes in their baseline PA metabolism. Collectively, these knockdown studies support that endogenous pools of Nir2 and SCP2 can affect PA localization and cellular signaling pathways.

In this study, we introduced feeding–fishing as a general strategy to identify regulators of lipid homeostasis at the organelle level. In this approach, membrane editing is used to feed lipids of interest to designated organelle membranes and proximity labeling is used to fish out proteins recruited to those same membranes. We implemented this concept to reveal proteins and potential mechanisms associated with PA metabolism and transport on the cytosolic leaflets of two distinct organelle membranes: the plasma membrane and the lysosomal membrane. We subsequently analyzed the consequences of the observed enrichment of several protein hits identified in the feeding–fishing proteomics using a combination of confocal microscopy to visualize the subcellular localization of PA using a PA-binding probe and LC–MS-based lipidomics to assess changes to the phospholipidome. A constant challenge in these studies is that local elevations in PA induced by membrane editing with optogenetic superPLDs is opposed by homeostatic mechanisms, that is, local PA metabolism and PA transport to distal membranes followed by subsequent metabolism. Our ability to produce transient elevations in PA on target membranes relies on the high activities of superPLDs to achieve such acute increases to PA levels12.

Our studies revealed that, following membrane editing to locally elevate PA on the plasma membrane and lysosomes, certain metabolic enzymes are recruited to deplete the excess PA. Among the several metabolic fates of PA, the enzymes involved in PA–DAG interconversion were dynamically regulated on PA-fed membranes, whereas minor changes in recruitment were observed for enzymes that mediate metabolism to lysophosphatidic acid. The synthases that convert PA to CDP-DAG (CDS1/2) were not reliably detected in our proteomics experiments, likely because these are multipass transmembrane proteins localized in ER membranes. It would be interesting to expand the feeding–fishing approach to additional organelle membranes involved in PA metabolism (for example, ER, Golgi complex and mitochondria).

A limitation of our study design is the moderate background activity of superPLD that is present even without light stimulation. Light-independent PG accumulation was observed in cells expressing superPLD, indicating that this background superPLD activity altered lipid metabolism even in this relatively short-term period (that is, 48 h after lentiviral transduction). Thus, future implementations of feeding–fishing proteomics would benefit from using LOVPLD, a next-generation, ultralow-background optogenetic membrane editor, for PA feeding40.

In addition to insights related to the contributions of different PA-metabolizing enzymes to PA homeostasis on the plasma membrane and lysosomal membrane, the feeding–fishing studies revealed the translocation of several LTPs to PA-fed plasma membranes and lysosomes that could return excess PA and its metabolites to the ER and/or other organelles for further metabolism. Notably, both a PA-specific LTP, Nir2, and a more broad-spectrum LTP, SCP2, could reduce local PA enrichment and global PA levels under the conditions when PA was supplied to plasma membrane or lysosomes. The finding that SCP2 can reduce local PA enrichment suggests that this soluble LTP can mediate intracellular transport of PA, in addition to cholesterol and several other lipids that it has previously been found to transport28,47,48,49. SCP2 contains an N-terminal amphipathic helix that preferentially binds to membranes enriched in negatively charged lipids such as PtdIns(4,5)P2 (refs. 50,51) and its expression was reported to selectively alter the distribution of phospholipids at the plasma membrane52. Whereas our in vitro lipid transfer assay used SCP2 tethered to donor liposomes to approximate its physiological local concentration (870 nM to micromolar range53), it remains undetermined whether such tethering would occur or be required for SCP2 function in cells. Identifying additional factors, beyond PA itself, that could accelerate SCP2-mediated activity or localization would be an interesting direction for future study.

Interestingly, depletion of endogenous Nir2 resulted in striking redistribution of PA produced at either the plasma membrane or lysosomal membrane to the Golgi apparatus. A previous study reported that depletion of Nir2 causes a reduction in the DAG level in the Golgi apparatus and leads to a substantial inhibition of protein transport from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane54. Consistent with those findings, our results indicate that Nir2 depletion can affect PA distribution and negatively affect the PA-to-DAG conversion. Notably, the same study suggested that Nir2 RNA interference increased the levels of PC at the Golgi apparatus by ~20% through upregulation of PC synthesis from DAG and CDP-choline (Fig. 5b), whereas total cellular PC levels remained the same54. In mammalian cells, synthesis of PC from DAG is mainly catalyzed by CEPT1 and CPT1, which localize on the ER and Golgi complex, respectively55,56. Because Nir2 supports PA transport to the ER6, where PA can be metabolized into DAG and, subsequently, PC, it is plausible that Nir2-depleted cells provide compensatory PC synthesis through pathways from PA to DAG and then to PC that at least in part involves Golgi-localized enzymes. Identification of alternative LTPs responsible for PA trafficking to the Golgi complex requires further investigation.

In contrast to Nir2, SCP2, PDZD8 and TEX2, whose overexpression antagonized the PA accumulation elicited by membrane editing, ORP1L forced expression led to an unexpected further increase in PA levels. ORP1L binds to PA34, but the functional relevance of such binding and whether it is accompanied by PA extraction and interorganelle transport remain unknown. Our structure–function studies revealed that the PA increase induced by ORP1L required the cholesterol-binding site in its ORD domain but not the EQVSHHPP signature motif found in all ORP-family proteins43,57, which is consistent with the lack of enrichment of other members of the ORP family in our feeding–fishing proteomics results. In other ORP-family proteins, the ORD domain mediates lipid transfer by extracting the lipid from one membrane and depositing it into another58,59,60. It can have differential affinities for two different lipids whose binding sites partially overlap, and such dual affinities are critical for vectorial transport when coupled to other metabolic steps on the origin and destination membranes. The implication of the ORD domain from ORP1L in the paradoxical increase in PA seen upon ORP1L forced expression on PA-fed membranes suggests that mechanisms more complex than simple transport to the ER and subsequent metabolism, as would be predicted by analogy with other ORP proteins, might be involved. Therefore, the roles of ORP1L in PA metabolism warrant further detailed study.

Intriguingly, several other proteins related to cholesterol biosynthesis and trafficking were identified in the feeding–fishing proteomics. For example, SOAT1, which catalyzes the formation of fatty acid–cholesterol esters on the ER, and LIPA, which catalyzes the reverse reaction, were both enriched on PA-fed membranes. By contrast, STARD3, an LTP that mediates ER-to-lysosome cholesterol transport61, was depleted from PA-fed membranes. Investigation of these proteins might shed light on new and unexpected regulatory mechanisms between PA and cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis. Lastly, the enrichment of select members of the bridge-like LTP family to PA-fed membranes (VPS13B to the plasma membrane and VPS13C to the lysosome) suggests that increased bulk phospholipid flow between these organelles may occur as a result of changes to PA metabolism induced by superPLD-mediated membrane editing.

Beyond elucidating mechanisms that implicate select PA-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in mediating PA homeostasis at the organelle and cellular levels, our study is notable for the introduction of the feeding–fishing strategy. This approach combining membrane editing with proximity labeling is geared to reveal how targeted modifications to the lipid composition of individual organelle membranes impacts the proteomes of such membranes, information that can point to new ways that cells can sense and correct imbalances in lipid metabolism. By exploiting organelle-specific PC hydrolysis by optogenetic PLDs, we focused here on regulators of PA metabolism at the plasma membrane and lysosomes. Yet, our optogenetic PLDs can use exogenously supplied primary alcohols in transphosphatidylation reactions to produce other phospholipids10,12,40,62 (Extended Data Fig. 10), and a growing collection of membrane editors targeting diverse types of lipids (for example, phosphoinositides, DAGs and sterols) is emerging19,62,63,64. The interfacing of such tools with organelle membrane proteomics using proximity labeling in feeding–fishing (or, conversely, fasting–fishing) experiments represents a powerful and generalizable strategy for elucidating mechanisms governing lipid homeostasis.

References and/or sequences of plasmids and primers used for this study are provided (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Membrane-targeted TurboID and optoPLD were cloned into pCDNA5/FRT/TO for transient transfection and pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1α-Puro for lentiviral transduction. For plasma membrane targeting, the CAAX domain of KRAS19 (GKKKKKKSKTKCVIM) was fused to the C terminus of the constructs after a linker sequence (GGSGSLYK). For lysosomal membrane targeting, the p18 domain20 (MGCCYSSENEDSDQDREERKLLLDPSSPPTKALNGAEPNY) followed by a linker sequence (GGRGSGSGSGSGSGSGSGSGSG) was fused to the N terminus of the constructs. PM-iLID-LOVPLD40 was cloned into pSBtet-Pur (Addgene, 60507) for stable expression.

Plasmids encoding PITPNM1 (Nir2), SCP2, PDZD8, TEX2 or OSBPL1A (ORP1L) were purchased from the DNASU plasmid repository, and their open reading frames were cloned into pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1α-Puro with an optional V5 tag to generate stable cell lines overexpressing these proteins. V5–Nir2, SCP2, proSCP2 (residues 405–547 of SCP2), V5–ORP1L, PDZD8–V5 and TEX2–V5 were used for analyzing their functions in PA trafficking and metabolism in live cells (note that the V5 tag was omitted from SCP2 and proSCP2 to avoid potential interference with their post-translational cleavage). PITPNM1, PDZD8, TEX2 and OSBPL1A were also cloned into pCDNA3.1 along with EGFP or miRFP fluorescent proteins for localization studies in live cells.

For visualization of PA localization in live cells, a Spo20 PA-binding domain25 (MDNCSGSRRRDRLHVKLKSLRNKIHKQLHPNCRFDDATKTS) or PASS domain67 (Addgene, 193970) fused to EGFP was cloned into pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1α-Puro.

Cells were grown in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS (Corning), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Corning) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For poly(l-lysine) pretreatment, cell plates were treated with 0.1 mg ml−1 poly(l-lysine) (Sigma Aldrich, P2636) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by triple rinses with autoclaved deionized water. For fibronectin coating, cell plates were treated with 20 μg ml−1 human plasma fibronectin (Millipore Sigma, FC010) in PBS for 5–15 min at 37 °C.

For transient transfection, HEK 293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668019) or PEI MAX (Polysciences, 24765). Cells were incubated in regular DMEM containing plasmids premixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (1–1.5 µg of total plasmids and 3 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 or PEI MAX for cells in 35-mm dish) and the cells were incubated for 20–24 h before experiments.

For transient gene knockdown, HEK 293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, 13778075). Cells were incubated in regular medium containing DsiRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) premixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (5 pmol of DsiRNA and 1.5 µl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX for cells in a 24-well plate) and the cells were incubated for 40–48 h before experiments. A list of DsiRNA sequences is provided in Supplementary Table 3.

HEK 293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 or PEI MAX for lentivirus production. HEK 293T cells seeded on a six-well plate were incubated in Transfectagro (Corning) or Opti-MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS containing plasmids premixed with Lipofectamine 2000 or PEI MAX (0.5 µg of envelope plasmid, 1 µg of packaging plasmid, 1.5 µg of transfer plasmid and 6 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 or PEI MAX per well for a six-well plate). Then, 12–16 h after transfection, the transfection medium was replaced with regular DMEM and media were collected 40–48 h and 60–72 h after transfection to obtain virus-containing media. For multivirus transduction (for example, to introduce all feeding–fishing components), the collected virus media were concentrated by centrifugation at 100,000g (24,000 rpm in an SW 41 Ti swinging-bucket rotor) for 90 min at 4 °C. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was carefully decanted and the virus concentrate was resuspended in fresh DMEM. The ratio of lentivirus packaging cells and transduced cells used for this study was 1.5:1 for pCDH-CRY2-mCherry-PLD constructs and 0.16:1 for all the other constructs, optimized on the basis of the lentivirus titer of each construct.

For spinfection, HEK 293T cells seeded on a six-well plate (pretreated with poly(l-lysine) or fibronectin) were incubated in virus-resuspended medium supplemented with 0.4 µg ml−1 polybrene (Millipore Sigma). The plate was centrifuged at 931 or 1,000g for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by the replacement of virus-containing medium with fresh DMEM (as well as DsiRNA precomplexed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX for knockdown study). The six-well plate was covered with aluminum foil to keep cells in the dark and the cells were incubated for 40–48 h before experiments.

A homemade light box was built by attaching four strips of dimmable, 12-V blue light-emitting diode (LED) tape light (1000Bulbs.com, 2835-60-IP65-B1203) on the inside of a Styrofoam box. For optogenetics experiments, the light box was placed inside the CO2 incubator using an AC outlet power bank (Omars, 24,000 mAh, 80 W) as a power supply. An outlet timer (BN-LINK) was used to switch the light on and off automatically to enable 3-s intervals of 470-nm light per 1 min.

For imaging and mTOR signaling experiments using LOVPLD (Figs. 4g,h and 6, and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4a,b), an AMUZA system consisting of a blue LED array (470 nm), an LED array driver and a pulse generator with 10% duty cycle (500 ms on, 5 s off) was used. Light power was typically around 10 mW cm−2 (measured by Thorlabs PM100D).

Cells expressing optoPLD and TurboID were illuminated for 30 min with intermittent blue light (470 nm, 5-s pulses every 1 min), followed by 3-min treatment with 500 µM biotin. The cells were then washed five times with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA and 1× cOmplete protease inhibitor). For proteomics, the cells from all six wells in a six-well plate (~2 × 107 cells total) were combined to prepare each sample. After sonication and centrifugation, the lysate supernatant was incubated with Pierce high-capacity streptavidin–agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 20359) overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. A 10-µl volume of bead solution was used for cells per well in 6-well plate.

After overnight incubation, the streptavidin beads were washed twice with RIPA buffer, once with 1 M KCl, once with 0.1 M Na2CO3, once with 2 M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl and twice with RIPA buffer. For western blot analysis, the washed beads were boiled for 10 min in 3× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 25 mM biotin to elute biotinylated proteins off the beads. For proteomics, the beads were further washed twice with HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl) and once with sample elution buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 25 mM biotin, pH 8). The washed beads were boiled for 5 min in sample elution buffer for protein elution. The elution process was repeated for three times, each time replacing the elution buffer, to increase the protein yield. The samples were then quantified by BCA assay and submitted to Proteomics and Metabolomics Facility at Cornell University for TMT labeling and proteomics analysis. Four samples in triplicate were grouped for the labeling and analysis. Detailed workflows of the proteomics analyses are described in Supplementary Information.

Antibody and dilutions used for validation experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1c–e) were the following: anti-LPIN1 polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, 27026-1-AP; 1:1,000), anti-LPIN2 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-514353; 1:100), anti-Nir2 polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, 26983-1-AP; 1:1,000), anti-PDZD8 polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, 25512-1-AP; 1:1,000), anti-SCP-x polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, 14397-1-AP; 1:1,000), anti-SCP-2 polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, 23006-1-AP; 1:1,000), anti-DGKD polyclonal antibody (Abcepta, AP8126b; 1:1,000), anti-DGKH polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, 13873-1-AP; 1:1,000) and anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 86298). Detection was conducted using chemiluminescence with the SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34580) or SuperSignal West Atto ultimate-sensitivity substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A38556) and acquisition on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP system.

Cells were seeded on 35-mm glass-bottom imaging dishes (Matsunami Glass) coated with poly(l-lysine) or fibronectin. Unless otherwise noted, images were acquired every 1 min for 1 h at 37 °C using Zeiss Zen Blue 2.3 on a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with Plan Apochromat objectives (×40, numerical aperture: 1.4) and two GaAsP photomultiplier tube detectors. Solid-state lasers (488, 561 and 640 nm) were used to excite GFP, mCherry and miRFP, respectively, and the 488-nm laser irradiation also served as a stimulus for activating optoPLD recruitment to the plasma membrane, ER or lysosomes.

Imaging experiments with LOVPLD (Figs. 4g,h and 6, and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4a,b) were acquired using a Zeiss AxioObserver inverted microscope equipped with a Yokogawa spinning-disk confocal head, Cascade II:512 camera and four-color laser launch (405-nm diode, 491-nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSS), 561-nm DPSS and 640-nm diode, all at 50 mW). Images were acquired using Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) through a ×100 oil-immersion objective. Emission filters were 528/38 nm for GFP and MitoTracker, 617/73 nm for mCherry and 700/75 nm for AlexaFluor 647. Mitochondrial morphology was observed by staining cells with 100 nM MitoTracker Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, M7514) for 5 min before experiments.

HEK 293T cells coexpressing a PA-binding probe (EGFP–Spo20), superPLD (CRY2–mCherry–superPLDmed, derived from superPLD clone 1-12 (ref. 12)) targeted to different organelle membranes and the indicated LTP were imaged as described above. Colocalization analysis between PA-binding probe and superPLD was carried out on ImageJ/FIJI as follows. Firstly, a region of interest (ROI) was drawn around each cell expressing both constructs. Secondly, for each ROI, the mCherry signal of the superPLD was used to generate a binary mask. Thirdly, the ratio of the EGFP signal from the PA-binding probe found in the mask, as compared to the total signal, was calculated to obtain the colocalization ratio. Lastly, the fold change in this colocalization ratio was tracked over the course of the time series and plotted with the use of matplotlib in Python. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and blocked with 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS (PBS-T; blocking buffer) for 30 min. The cells were then treated with primary antibody solution in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature and rinsed three times with PBS-T. Afterward, the cells were treated with secondary antibody solution in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature and rinsed three times with PBS-T. After the final rinse, the cells were incubated in PBS-T for 5 min and stored in PBS supplemented with 1 µg ml−1 DAPI. Image acquisition by laser-scanning confocal microscopy was performed as described above using solid-state lasers (405, 488, 561 and 640 nm) to excite DAPI, AlexaFluor 488, mCherry and AlexaFluor 647, respectively. Pearson colocalization analysis was performed using the Coloc 2 plugin in ImageJ/FIJI.

Antibodies, affinity reagents and dilutions used for immunofluorescence staining were as follows: streptavidin–AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen, S11223; 1:50), anti-V5 antibody (Bio-Rad, MCA1360GA; 1:100), anti-calnexin antibody as an ER marker (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PA534754; 1:100), anti-LAMP2 antibody as a lysosomal marker (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-18822; 1:100), anti-GRASP65 antibody as a Golgi marker (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-374423; 1:100), anti-LPIN1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 14906; 1:100), anti-mouse–AlexaFluor 488 antibody conjugate (Invitrogen, A21202; 1:500) and anti-mouse–AlexaFluor 647 (Invitrogen, A31571; 1:500).

mSCP2 fused with an N-terminal 6×His tag was cloned into a pET28a vector and the construct was transformed into BL21 Rosetta2 Escherichia coli cells for purification. Cells were cultured in Terrific Broth medium at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 (approximately 2 h), and then expression was induced by addition of 0.2 mM IPTG followed by overnight incubation at 18 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF and 50 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.4. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000g for 30 min, followed by incubation with TALON beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed four times with lysis buffer, followed by elution with lysis buffer supplemented with 150 mM imidazole. The tether-only construct was produced as previously described68 and was purified similarly to mSCP2.

Liposomes were prepared as previously described32. Briefly, lipids were dissolved in chloroform and mixed in glass tubes in the indicated ratio for donor and acceptor liposomes separately. The mixture was dried under a stream of nitrogen to a thin film, followed by further drying in vacuo for 2 h. The lipid film was hydrated with buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TCEP at pH 8.0 to a total lipid concentration of 2.5 mM. Liposomes were formed by ten freeze–thaw cycles in liquid N2 and 37 °C water bath, followed by extrusion 21 times through polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 100 nm.

Lipid transfer assays were set up at 25 °C in black flat-bottom 96-well plates, with 100-µl total volume containing 50 µM donor liposomes, 150 µM acceptor liposomes, 62.5 nM 6×His–PH domain tether (used to link donor and acceptor liposomes and, therefore, minimize spurious lipid exchange between donor–donor and acceptor–acceptor liposomes) and 187.5 nM 6×His–mSCP2 (His tag used to anchor mSCP2 to donor liposomes to increase local concentration), for a 1:800 protein-to-lipid ratio and a 1:3 tether-to-LTP ratio. For specific reactions, different compositions of liposomes or concentrations of LTP were used as indicated. The reaction was initiated by addition of proteins and was then monitored for 2 h, using an excitation wavelength of 465 nm and emission wavelength of 540 nm every 10 s, using a BioTek Synergy H1 microplate reader.

The following lipids were purchased: DOPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, 850375), PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Avanti Polar Lipids, 840046), DGS-NTA(Ni) (Avanti Polar Lipids, 790404), POPA (Avanti Polar Lipids, 840857), NBD-PA (Avanti Polar Lipids, 810176), NBD-PE (Avanti Polar Lipids, 810144), Rhod-PE (Avanti Polar Lipids, 810150), DOPE (Cayman, 15091) and DOPC (Echelon, L-1182).

HEK 293T cells expressing the indicated constructs were illuminated for 30 min with intermittent blue light (470 nm, 5-s pulses every min) and rinsed once in PBS; the cellular lipids were extracted using the Bligh–Dyer method10. Then, 250 μl of methanol was added to cells in a 35-mm dish on ice. Followed by the addition of 125 µl of 20 mM acetic acid and 100 µl of PBS, the cells were scraped off and transferred into a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube. After addition of 500 µl of chloroform, the tube was shaken vigorously for 3 min and centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000g. The bottom organic layer was transferred into a new tube and dried under a stream of N2 gas. The resulting lipid film was dissolved in 150 µl of chloroform and subjected to high-resolution LC–MS analysis.

LC–MS measurement was performed on an Agilent 6230 electrospray ionization time-of-flight MS instrument coupled to an Agilent 1260 high-performance LC instrument equipped with a Luna 3-µm silica LC column (Phenomenex; 50 × 2 mm) using a binary gradient elution system where solvent A was chloroform, methanol and ammonium hydroxide (85:15:0.5) and solvent B was chloroform, methanol, water and ammonium hydroxide (60:34:5:0.5). Separation was achieved using a linear gradient from 100% A to 100% B over 10 min. Phospholipid species were detected using an Agilent Jet Stream source operating in positive or negative mode, acquiring in an extended dynamic range of m/z 100–1,700 at one spectrum per second (gas temperature, 325 °C; drying gas, 12 L min−1; nebulizer, 35 psi; fragmentor, 300 V (for positive mode) and 250 V (for negative mode); sheath gas flow, 12 L min−1; Vcap, 3,000 V; nozzle voltage, 500 V.

The LC–MS data were analyzed on MassHunter quantitative analysis software using the ‘find compounds by formula' tool. The search parameters were set as follows: source of formulas to confirm, database/library provided in Supplementary Table 4; matches per formula, 1 (automatically increase for isomeric compounds); Values to match, mass and retention time (retention time required); match tolerance, masses ± 20 ppm and retention times ± 0.200 min; expansion of values for chromatogram extraction, m/z ± 20 ppm and retention time 0.500 + 1.00 min; positive ion charge carriers, +H; negative ion charge carriers, −H.

HEK 293T cells stably expressing doxycycline-inducible PM-iLID-LOVPLD were seeded in 12-well plates with 2.5 µg ml−1 doxycycline and incubated in the dark for 48 h. Each alcohol was first prepared as a 100× concentrated solution in PBS and then added to cells stably expressing PM-iLID-LOVPLD. The cells were immediately transferred to the light chamber and illuminated for 15 min with intermittent blue light (470 nm, 5-s pulses every 1 min). Bligh–Dyer extraction followed by LC–MS analysis was performed as described above.

HEK 293T cells were transduced with LOVPLD using lentivirus and spinfection as described above. The cells were incubated with 10 μM dorsomorphin (AMPK inhibitor) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by a 30-min stimulation with intermittent blue-light illumination (470 nm, 500-ms pulses every 5 s). The cells were then lysed with RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78439 and 78420). After sonication and centrifugation, the lysate supernatants were mixed with 6× Laemmli sample buffer to prepare the sample for western blot. The membrane was blotted with 1:1,000 dilutions of antibodies for phospho-S6K (T389; Cell Signaling Technology, #9205) or β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, #5125), with detection by chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34580) and acquisition on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP system.

In all domains of life, tRNAs mediate the transfer of genetic information from mRNAs to proteins. As their depletion suppresses translation and, consequently, viral replication, tRNAs represent long-standing and increasingly recognized targets of innate immunity1,2,3,4,5. Here we report Cas12a3 effector nucleases from type V CRISPR–Cas adaptive immune systems in bacteria that preferentially cleave tRNAs after recognition of target RNA. Cas12a3 orthologues belong to one of two previously unreported nuclease clades that exhibit RNA-mediated cleavage of non-target RNA, and are distinct from all other known type V systems. Through cell-based and biochemical assays and direct RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that recognition of a complementary target RNA by the CRISPR RNA triggers Cas12a3 to cleave the conserved 5′-CCA-3′ tail of diverse tRNAs to drive growth arrest and anti-phage defence. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures further revealed a distinct tRNA-loading domain that positions the tRNA tail in the RuvC active site of the nuclease. By designing synthetic reporters that mimic the tRNA acceptor stem and tail, we expanded the capacity of current CRISPR-based diagnostics for multiplexed RNA detection. Overall, these findings reveal widespread tRNA inactivation as a previously unrecognized CRISPR-based immune strategy that broadens the application space of the existing CRISPR toolbox.

Immune defences across all domains of life counteract viral infections by clearing the invader or disabling host processes that are essential for viral replication. One growing theme associated with innate immune systems is the inactivation of tRNAs1,2,3,4,5. tRNAs have a critical role in translation, serving as the bridge between mRNAs and nascent proteins. Accordingly, inactivating a portion of the tRNA pool can impair the synthesis of viral proteins or drive systematic cellular shutdown to block viral replication1,2,4,6,7. Representative bacterial defences such as PrrC, VapC, colicin E5 and PARIS cleave the anticodon loop of specific tRNAs5,8,9,10,11. In animals, the type I interferons SLFN11 and SAMD9 cleave the acceptor stem and anticodon loop, respectively, of tRNAs to suppress codon-specific production of viral particles4,7,12,13.

Conspicuously absent from the set of immune defences that specifically use tRNA inactivation are CRISPR–Cas systems, the only known source of adaptive immunity in bacteria and archaea14. These widespread systems immunize against future infection by acquiring snippets of viral sequences expressed as CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that pair with CRISPR-associated (Cas) effector nucleases. The complex then searches for complementary target RNA or DNA that match the originating virus and, after target recognition, cleaves the bound nucleic acid targets to clear viral genomes or transcripts15,16,17. Some activated Cas nucleases also collaterally cleave non-target RNA or DNA with little sequence preference to halt cellular processes that are essential for viral replication and to drive growth arrest18,19,20,21. One such effector, the RNA-triggered Cas13 nuclease from Leptotrichia shahii (LshCas13a), was recently shown to cleave U-rich anticodon loops associated with a subset of tRNAs when activated in Escherichia coli22. However, LshCas13a also efficiently cleaves its target RNA at U-rich sequences to drive targeted silencing23,24,25,26. Thus, it remains unknown whether any CRISPR–Cas systems have evolved to preferentially cleave tRNAs over other RNA species, including their target RNA, as part of an immune response.

Here we report a previously uncharacterized clade of Cas nucleases, which we term Cas12a3. After target RNA recognition, these nucleases preferentially cleave the conserved 3′ CCA tails of tRNAs to drive growth arrest and block phage dissemination. Activated Cas12a3 engages the tRNA tail, acceptor stem and T-arm to load tRNA substrates into its RuvC nuclease domain for cleavage. Harnessing the distinct properties of Cas12a3, we expanded the multiplexing capacity of current CRISPR-based RNA detection approaches to illustrate one of the many applications of programmable RNA-mediated tRNA cleavage.

The phylogenetic proximity of the functionally diverse Cas12a nucleases (which target and cleave complementary DNA)17 and Cas12a2 nucleases (which target RNA and then indiscriminately shred RNA and DNA)27,28 indicated that other functionalities might exist in the adjacent phylogenetic space. To explore this possibility, we searched public databases for sequences closely related to Cas12a2. We identified 61 orthologues primarily from environmental metagenomic assemblies that resolved into two clades distinct from Cas12a2, Cas12a and each other (Fig. 1a,b, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). Most of these were associated with CRISPR arrays and the spacer-acquisition genes cas1, cas2 and cas4 (Supplementary Table 1). We tentatively designate members of these clades Cas12a3 and Cas12a4, as further variants of Cas12a. These two clades retain the three motifs that form the canonical RuvC endonuclease domain and the domains and conserved residues involved in the processing of crRNA, the recognition of the protospacer-flanking sequence (PFS) and the zinc ribbon (ZR) (Fig. 1b). However, orthologues from the identified clades showed limited conservation of the aromatic clamp residues in Cas12a2, which are crucial for broad DNA collateral cleavage28, with Cas12a3 lacking these regions entirely (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1).

To investigate the possibility that Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 have distinct activities compared with Cas12a2, we first characterized representative Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 nucleases using our previously established plasmid interference assays in E. coli27. The nucleases were treated with a library of potential PFS sequences encoded in a target plasmid under antibiotic selection (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2a). This assay identified a preference for a purine-rich PFS, a finding in line with the known preferences of Cas12a2 nucleases and the high amino-acid similarity in the PFS-interacting region across the orthologues (Fig. 1b). Using a consensus PFS, the Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 nucleases reduced the number of transformants even without antibiotic selection for the target plasmid, similar to a representative Cas12a2 from the microbial community of Microcerotermes parvus (MpCas12a2) (Fig. 1d). We obtained comparable results for different target sequences (Supplementary Fig. 2b) and observed impaired growth in liquid culture without antibiotic selection (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Cas12a2 and Cas12a3 nucleases further provided defence against T4 phage infection (Supplementary Fig. 2d). However, unlike Cas12a2, the Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 nucleases did not induce a measurable SOS DNA damage response, as indicated by a transcriptional reporter driven from the recA promoter27 (Fig. 1e). Thus, although Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 nucleases arrest growth after activation in a manner similar to Cas12a2, both nucleases induce a distinct mechanism of immunity.

We next examined whether Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 orthologues accept DNA and RNA targets and cleavage substrates (Fig. 1f). Given that the Cas nucleases could have sequence preferences for specific substrates27,29,30, we used a randomized library of RNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrates and a mixed-nucleotide sequence for the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) substrate. As expected, MpCas12a (as a representative Cas12a nuclease) primarily cleaved the ssDNA substrate library and, to a limited extent, the dsDNA substrate in response to the ssDNA and dsDNA targets, respectively29,31. Moreover, MpCas12a2 cleaved all three substrates in response to the RNA target27,28 (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2e). Similar to MpCas12a2, Cas12a3 from an unknown Bacteroidetes bacterium (Ba1Cas12a3) and Cas12a4 from a microbial community of the Alvinella pompejana hydrothermal vents worm (ApCas12a4) were also activated by the RNA target. However, they exclusively cleaved the RNA substrate library. When presented with additional individual ssRNA, ssDNA or dsDNA substrates in vitro, similar trends were observed for these nucleases and for Cas12a3 from Smithella sp. M82 (Sm3Cas12a3) (Extended Data Fig. 2). Notably, Ba1Cas12a3 and Sm3Cas12a3 only partially cleaved their target RNA even after prolonged incubation, which was in contrast to complete cleavage by ApCas12a4 and MpCas12a2. This result suggests that the RNA target is not the preferred cleavage substrate of Cas12a3. RNA-mediated RNA cleavage by Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 is consistent with the lack of a measurable SOS response in E. coli (Fig. 1d) and the absence of the aromatic clamp amino-acid residues in the nucleases of these clades (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). These observations reveal that exclusive RNA-activated RNA cleavage also occurs in the highly diverse family of Cas12 nucleases32, similar to the cleavage activities of the phylogenetically distinct Cas13 nucleases33.

Building on the limited cleavage of target RNA by these nucleases, we noted that Ba1Cas12a3 also exhibited 3.8-fold less cleavage of the RNA substrate library compared with MpCas12a2 (Fig. 2a). By contrast, ApCas12a4 exhibited a continual increase in fluorescence over the course of the reaction without plateauing and efficiently cleaved its target RNA in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 2). We speculated that reduced cleavage of the RNA library by Ba1Cas12a3 resulted from a selective preference for specific RNA substrates.

To identify RNA substrates relevant to an immune response, we tested Ba1Cas12a3 in a cell-free transcription–translation (TXTL) system that closely mimics the bacterial cellular environment34,35. As expected, adding an activated MpCas12a2 or Ba1Cas12a3 ribonucleoprotein complex together with a GFP reporter plasmid reduced fluorescence relative to a non-target control (Fig. 2b). To distinguish whether silencing of the reporter resulted from cleavage of the gfp transcript or other essential RNA components (for example, tRNAs or rRNAs), we added activated nucleases 4 h before introducing a GFP-expressing reporter plasmid. Notably, GFP fluorescence was abolished when activated Ba1Cas12a3 was added before the reporter plasmid, whereas MpCas12a2, even when activated, had no effect relative to the non-target control (Fig. 2b). The enhanced silencing obtained only by activated Ba1Cas12a3 suggests that this nuclease selectively degrades RNA components essential for gene expression.

We aimed to identify the RNA substrates of activated Ba1Cas12a3 that underlie silencing of the reporter in TXTL assays. To that end, we directly sequenced RNA from 4-h reactions using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, which enables complete sequencing of chemically modified RNAs36 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Comparisons of read coverage between the non-target and target conditions showed that no notable cleavage of 5S, 16S or 23S rRNAs or the target RNA occurred. By contrast, many of the reads mapped to tRNAs (27 out of 47) were significantly (z score ≥ 2) truncated roughly 2–4 nucleotides upstream of their 3′ aminoacylated ends up to the discriminator base and the CCA tail conserved across all tRNAs (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3c). Cleavage of selected tRNAs was confirmed by northern blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 4). Similar cleavage patterns were observed for Sm3Cas12a3 in TXTL assays (25 out of 47) (Supplementary Figs. 3b,d and 4). This specific cleavage of tRNAs accounts for the target-dependent silencing of the reporter observed in TXTL assays, as it would disrupt the translation machinery before the reporter plasmid is added.

To further characterize the cleavage patterns in tRNA by Cas12a3 orthologues, we established a more controlled in vitro assay using purified bulk tRNAs from E. coli incubated with activated nucleases (Fig. 2d). Activated Ba1Cas12a3 led to significant 3′ cleavage (z score ≥ 2) of all but 3 out of the 49 mapped tRNAs, even though the remaining tRNAs (tRNAAsp(GUC), tRNAVal(GAC)1 and tRNAVal(GAC)2) still underwent measurable cleavage (Supplementary Fig. 5), with cleavage principally occurring three to five nucleotides upstream of each tRNA 3′ end. Similar cleavage patterns were observed with Sm3Cas12a3 and ca23Cas12a3 (identified in a wastewater microbial metagenome). However, the cleavage sites for Sm3Cas12a3 were shifted slightly upstream (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5), which indicated possible mechanistic differences within the Cas12a3 clade. Consistent with the direct RNA sequencing results, Ba1Cas12a3 trimmed the 3′ end of the entire pool of E. coli tRNAs labelled with a 5′ fluorophore (Fig. 2e, top), including specific tRNAs detected by northern blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 6). Although these tRNAs were charged with amino acids and contained extensive chemical modifications associated with E. coli37, Ba1Cas12a3 similarly cleaved the same pool of chemically modified tRNAs with the amino acid removed and replaced with a fluorophore (Fig. 2e, bottom). Ba1Cas12a3 also cleaved in vitro-transcribed tRNAs that lack both chemical modifications and charged amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 7a) and bulk tRNA isolated from yeast (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Notably, ApCas12a4 produced a different cleavage pattern of the tRNA pool (Fig. 2e), which suggests that the 3′ tRNA tail is not the preferred substrate of this nuclease. Together, these findings indicate that activated Cas12a3 nucleases preferentially cleave the 3′ tail of tRNAs while sparing the bound RNA target, thereby further differentiating Cas12a3 from Cas12a2 and Cas12a4.

Among the diverse set of Cas nucleases, LshCas13a is the only other nuclease reported to cleave tRNAs22. As LshCas13a primarily cleaves its targeted transcript30, and Cas12a3 exhibits minimal target RNA cleavage (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2a), we sought to directly compare their activities. When targeting the same site in an expressed GFP transcript in TXTL assays, both LshCas13a and Ba1Cas12a3 efficiently reduced GFP fluorescence (Extended Data Fig. 3a). However, quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) revealed that the gfp transcript underwent cleavage only by LshCas13a (Extended Data Fig. 3b). These results show that LshCas13a and Ba1Cas12a3 have different modes of action after target recognition, with LshCas13a but not Cas12a3 substantially cleaving the target RNA.

Trimming tRNA tails by Cas12a3 would prevent tRNAs from participating in translation, thereby potentially driving global translational shutdown and arresting cell growth. Alternatively, growth arrest could be mediated by tRNA cleavage products that induce systemic stress responses, such as the stringent response, which is activated through the detection of deacetylated tRNAs bound to the ribosome by the RelA protein38,39,40,41. However, deleting relA did not impair plasmid interference by any of the tested Cas12a3 orthologues in E. coli (Extended Data Fig. 4). Therefore, Cas12a3-mediated immune defence operates independently of the stringent response mediated by RelA, which indicates that Cas12a3-mediated growth arrest results from either a different stress response or the direct disruption of translation.

We confirmed that purified Ba1Cas12a3 strongly binds crRNA (dissociation constant (Kd) of about 0.2 nM), target RNA (Kd of about 5 nM) and in vitro-transcribed tRNAAla(UGC) when activated (Ba1Cas12a3, Kd of about  20 nM; catalytically dead Ba1Cas12a3 (dBa1Cas12a3), Kd of about 6 nM) (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). Therefore, we used single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the 3.1 Å quaternary structure of Ba1Cas12a3 in complex with these three RNAs (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 10). To limit tRNA cleavage, the complex was reconstituted on ice with a reduced Mg2+ concentration. The resulting quaternary structure revealed that, similar to Cas12a2 from Sulfuricurvum sp. PC08-66 (SuCas12a2)28, Ba1Cas12a3 contains a REC lobe comprising REC1 (unresolved) and REC2 domains and a NUC lobe comprising a wedge (WED), PFS-interacting (PI), RuvC, ZR and an insertion domain (Fig. 3a,b). However, a portion of the insertion domain in Ba1Cas12a3 (residues 855–960) did not have discernible homology with SuCas12a2 and had no structural homologues in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database (as determined using Foldseek and Dali)42,43. We designate this fold the tRNA-loading domain (tRLD), as it interacts directly with the tRNA in the quaternary structure and probably facilitates tRNA loading into the RuvC nuclease domain (described below).

Source data

Ba1Cas12a3 interacts with crRNA in a similar way to Cas12a and Cas12a2, with the 5′ pseudoknot of the crRNA anchored between the RuvC and WED domains28,44. The target RNA forms an A-form duplex with the crRNA guide that traverses through the centre of the protein, and the 3′ PFS sequence is gripped by the PI domain, albeit through interactions distinct from those associated with SuCas12a2 (Extended Data Fig. 5). The most notable feature of the Ba1Cas12a3 quaternary complex is the specific interaction with tRNAAla(UGC) at two contact points: (1) the phosphate backbone of the T-arm, which is recognized through hydrogen-bonding interactions by a small loop in the REC2 domain (residues 251–257) (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 6a); and (2) the acceptor stem plus the 3′ CCA tail, which are clamped between the tRLD and RuvC domain (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6b). The tRLD binds the 3′ CCA tail through interactions that position the two cytosine bases adjacent to Y922 and stack the terminal adenosine between R902 and N924. Moreover, several electrostatic interactions between basic side chains (for example, K881 and K885) and peptide backbone amines with the tRNA phosphodiester backbone help to position the scissile phosphate in the RuvC endonuclease active site (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Notably, the 3′ hydroxyl group of the terminal adenosine points towards a vacant cavity, which would accommodate the respective charged amino acid (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Finally, the region of the tRNA bound by Ba1Cas12a3 is the same as that bound by the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) alone or in complex with the ribosome (Supplementary Fig. 11). This result suggests that Ba1Cas12a3 cleaves free tRNAs that are not actively engaged in protein synthesis.

To determine the role of the identified interactions in tRNA cleavage, we assessed the impact of mutations in both the tRNA and Ba1Cas12a3. Stepwise elimination of the tRNA loops did not impair cleavage of the acceptor stem or 3′ CCA tail in vitro (Fig. 3e). A minimal substrate comprising the anticodon loop, acceptor stem and 3′ CCA (h1) was also cleaved, although it bound dBa1Cas12a3 with 62-fold lower affinity than the full-length tRNA (Extended Data Fig. 7). Using this truncated tRNA substrate, we next examined the impact of mutating the acceptor stem and the conserved 3′ CCA tail on its activity. Ba1Cas12a3 tolerated stem alterations provided the 3′ CCA was present (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Nonetheless, the catalytic efficiency was higher with a truncated tRNA than with linear RNAs, even when the CCA tail was located at the 3′ end (Extended Data Fig. 8a). In the CCA tail, Ba1Cas12a3 was sensitive to cytosine mutations, with transversions (C-to-G) impairing cleavage more strongly than transitions (C-to-U) (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 8b). By contrast, Sm3Cas12a3 did not cleave any substrates after any cytosine substitution (Fig. 3f), which suggests that these nucleases have divergent strategies for substrate recognition.

We next introduced mutations in Ba1Cas12a3 in the tRLD and the REC2 loop that interacts with the T-arm of the tRNA (Fig. 3g,h). Removing the tRLD (ΔtRLD) did not impair the overall secondary structure of the nuclease or binding of the crRNA and target RNA (Supplementary Fig. 12). However, removing this domain or mutating the residues that stack with the terminal adenosine (R902 or N924) substantially reduced both reporter silencing in TXTL assays and in vitro cleavage of different RNA substrates (Fig. 3g–i and Supplementary Fig. 13). Notably, the Y922A mutant increased cleavage activity in TXTL assays and in vitro with the truncated tRNA substrate (Fig. 3g,h), but not with non-tRNA substrates (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Fig. 13). This result suggests that Y922 has a more complex mechanistic role in Ba1Cas12a3. Mutation of the REC2 loop residues that interact with the T-arm impaired targeting in TXTL assays, whereby full-length tRNAs were cleaved, but only partially impeded cleavage of the truncated tRNA substrate lacking a T-arm (Fig. 3g,h and Supplementary Fig. 14). This finding indicates that T-arm interactions help position full-length tRNAs into the active site. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Ba1Cas12a3 preferentially cleaves free tRNAs by positioning the acceptor stem and the 3′ CCA tail of tRNAs into the RuvC active site through shape-specific and charge-specific interactions of tRNAs with the REC2 loop and tRLD.

To gain deeper insights into the dynamics of Ba1Cas12a3 nuclease activation and tRNA cleavage, we determined the following cryo-EM structures: Ba1Cas12a3 bound to a crRNA (binary complex, 3.8 Å; Supplementary Fig. 15a,c–e); Ba1Cas12a3 bound to crRNA and target RNA (ternary complex, 3.9 Å; Supplementary Fig. 15b,f–h); and Ba1Cas12a3 bound to the cleaved 3′ ACCA tail from tRNAAla(UGC) (post-cleavage complex, 3.3 Å; Supplementary Fig. 10c,g–i) (Fig. 4a–d). Together with the quaternary complex, which contains an uncleaved tRNA (Fig. 3b,c), these structures revealed a series of conformational changes that Ba1Cas12a3 undergoes to recognize a target RNA, selectively bind tRNAs and catalytically cleave the 3′ CCA tail of each tRNA (Fig. 4e–g and Supplementary Video 1).

Cryo-EM structure of the Ba1Cas12a3–crRNA–target RNA–tRNAAla(UGC) quaternary complex. d, Cryo-EM structure of the Ba1Cas12a3–crRNA–target RNA–tRNA tail quaternary complex in the post-cleaved state. e, Ba1Cas12a3 domain motion trajectories from the binary to the ternary complex. f, Ba1Cas12a3 domain motion trajectories from the ternary to the quaternary complex. g, Ba1Cas12a3 domain motion trajectories followed by release of the cleaved tRNA.

Starting from the binary structure, target RNA binding drives multiple conformational changes in Ba1Cas12a3 and the bound crRNA, with the REC2 domain shifting by 28 Å to accommodate the guide–target duplex (Fig. 4e) and the 3′ end of the crRNA shifting 22 Å from its initial position bound to the PI domain (Supplementary Fig. 16). Although similar conformational changes are sufficient to fully activate SuCas12a2 after target RNA recognition28, in Ba1Cas12a3, the tRLD remains positioned near the RuvC active site. However, it has increased flexibility, as evidenced by the decrease in local resolution (Supplementary Fig. 15b). After cleavage of the tRNA tail by the RuvC domain (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Video 1), the tRNA dissociates with the exception of four nucleotides comprising the tRNA tail (5′-ACCA-3′), which remain wedged between the RuvC and tRLD domains through contacts with R902, N924 and Y922 (Fig. 4d), consistent with the mapped cleavage sites across tRNAs (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5). With the cleavage product bound, Ba1Cas12a3 retains its activated conformation (Fig. 4g), which indicates that another tRNA could be subsequently captured and cleaved without necessitating conformational resetting. Taken together, these structural snapshots reveal an activation pathway in which, after target RNA recognition, Ba1Cas12a3 relies on its unique tRLD to direct cleavage of tRNA 3′ CCA tails.

An immediate application of the specific cleavage activity of Cas12a3 is multiplexed RNA detection45,46. Multiplexed RNA detection has been principally achieved by pairing Cas13 nucleases with orthogonal RNA substrates23,47. However, further expanding multiplexing requires new nucleases with orthogonal substrate preferences. To explore whether Ba1Cas12a3 can offer such an expansion, we adapted the minimal tRNA substrate as a reporter with a conjugated fluorophore and quencher45. A hairpin with a 3′ CCA tail and 3′ fluorophore produced the strongest signal (Fig. 5a,b). Notably, Sm3Cas12a3 and ca23Cas12a3 displayed distinct substrate preferences; however, Ba1Cas12a3 exhibited 226-fold greater activity than either orthologue (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 18a–c).

Source data

Using the optimal reporter for Ba1Cas12a3 (h25), we assessed multiplexing with Cas13a from Leptotrichia wadei (LwaCas13a) and Cas13b from Prevotella sp. MA2016 (PsmCas13b), which primarily cleave short RNAs composed only of U or A nucleotides, respectively23,48. As these linear substrates do not contain the CCA sequence and Cas13 nucleases do not efficiently cleave structured RNAs, each nuclease preferentially cleaved its cognate substrate (Fig. 5c). Leveraging this specificity, we combined the three nucleases and their cognate probes, each labelled with a distinct fluorophore, into a one-pot reaction for multiplexed RNA detection. This one-pot setup enabled the separate and combinatorial detection of RNA transcripts derived from the respiratory viruses SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A (Fig. 5d–g and Supplementary Fig. 18d–f). Notably, the presence of a large excess of human total RNA did not interfere with, but even enhanced, detection (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 18e). These findings show that Cas12a3 nucleases can be readily incorporated into multiplexed detection assays alongside widely used Cas13 platforms45.

In this work, we have reported the discovery of crRNA-guided Cas12a3 nucleases that recognize complementary RNA targets and, in response, cleave the conserved 3′ tails of tRNAs to induce growth arrest and block phage dissemination. Integrating genetic, biochemical, sequencing and structural studies, we propose a model (Extended Data Fig. 9) in which the nuclease undergoes a large conformational change that can then bind free tRNAs through multiple sequence-specific and shape-specific contacts. The unique tRLD in the nuclease positions the tRNA tail next to the RuvC active site to cleave off the tail, with extensive cleavage of cellular tRNAs leading to growth arrest. This immune response does not depend on a traditional stringent response but instead probably arises directly from translational inhibition or from a RelA-independent stress response activated by the tRNA cleavage products. Despite the high binding preference for tRNAs in vitro, it also remains possible that the nuclease targets additional RNAs not present in our TXTL system, which may further contribute to immune defence.

Cas12a3 adds to a growing set of immune defences and cellular processes that inactivate tRNAs1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,22,49,50,51,52. The anticodon loop is a common target of bacterial defences, with sequence-specific recognition of the loop beyond the anticodon required for translation. In response, some phages encode variant tRNAs that escape cleavage, thereby replenishing the tRNA pool and sustaining phage propagation53. Cleavage of the universally conserved 3′ CCA tail of tRNAs by Cas12a3 represents a distinct strategy that cannot be readily circumvented by viral tRNAs. To overcome this defence mechanism, viruses would require other, yet unknown, means of resistance. tRNA tail cleavage has been implicated with other cellular processes51,54, but so far, has not been directly linked to phage defence. Cas12a3 therefore could represent a previously unrecognized yet widely used phage defence mechanism based on preferential tRNA tail cleavage.

The discovery of RNA-mediated tRNA cleavage in CRISPR–Cas systems reflects the rich functional diversity of antiviral defences. Although numerous defence strategies remain uncharacterized55,56, our work reveals that even well-known families can have previously unknown functions. In particular, Cas12a2, Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 are phylogenetically related to DNA-targeting Cas12a nucleases27 but exhibit functions that more closely resemble those of RNA-targeting Cas13 nucleases57. Cas12a3 is particularly notable as a Cas nuclease that can specifically direct its cleavage activity towards a distinct substrate while sparing the bound target, whereas Cas12a4 also exhibits RNA-activated RNA cleavage but functionally deviates from Cas12a3. These findings warrant further investigation. Together, Cas12a2, Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 seem to be hyper-evolvable, with domain alterations dictating whether the RuvC site cleaves broadly across multiple substrates (for example, Cas12a2) or preferentially against specific targets such as tRNA tails (for example, Cas12a3). Deviations are also possible in these clades, as illustrated by the different tRNA cleavage sites and substrate requirements of Ba1Cas12a3 and Sm3Cas12a3. These findings underscore the broader diversity of Cas12 nucleases and indicate the existence of additional, yet to-be-discovered functions.

Exploring the hidden functional space of Cas nucleases has the potential to further expand the CRISPR toolbox. Cas12a3 in particular is an important addition for multiplexed RNA detection. The targeted cleavage of tRNA tails by Cas12a3 led us to the generation of a structured reporter specifically targeted by Cas12a3 but ignored by Cas13 nucleases, which enabled us to independently detect three distinct RNA biomarkers in a one-pot setup. Given the availability of other Cas12a3 and Cas13 orthologues that recognize distinct substrates58 (Fig. 5b), we anticipate that even more RNA biomarkers can be independently detected in a single reaction. Complementary advances in signal post-amplification and rendering CRISPR-based tests compatible with point-of-care settings could further enhance the diagnostic utility of Cas12a3. Beyond molecular diagnostics, the ability to inactivate most tRNAs through cleavage of their universally conserved 3′ CCA tail suggests applications in other areas, such as transcript-dependent cell arrest, viral suppression or selective cell elimination without direct DNA damage. Finally, our structural insights into PFS recognition and tRNA engagement could provide a foundation for engineering Cas12a3 with expanded target access and orthogonal substrates. Together, these advances position Cas12a3 as a versatile addition to CRISPR technologies and a prime candidate for enhancement through protein and guide RNA engineering.

We used previously identified Cas12a2 protein sequences27 as queries for tBLASTn and BLASTp searches in the NCBI databases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the JGI Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes database (https://img.jgi.doe.gov) to identify closely related orthologues. The resulting amino acid sequences, along with Cas12a orthologues used as an outgroup, were aligned using Clustal Omega59. The trimmed alignment generated using ClipKIT60 was then used to reconstruct a phylogeny using IQ-TREE (v.2.3.6) (-m MFP -T 8 -B 1000)60,61 with a maximum-likelihood approach. Assignment of putative domains and conserved amino acid residues, as shown in Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1, was performed with reference to SuCas12a2 (refs. 27,28). The amino acid sequences of the nucleases are provided in Supplementary Data 1. Information on each nuclease, including contig accession numbers, source organisms and the presence of spacer acquisition genes (cas1, cas2 and cas4), is provided in Supplementary Table 1. The presence of these genes was determined using DefenseFinder (v.2.0.1) with defense-finder-models (v.2.0.2)62. CRISPR arrays were identified using CRISPRCasFinder (v.4.2.21)63.

Strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Nuclease-encoding sequences were codon-optimized for expression in E. coli and synthesized by Twist Bioscience, unless stated otherwise. DNA oligonucleotides and FAM-labelled reporters were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies.

A PFS-containing plasmid library (CBS-6873) was constructed by incorporating a target sequence (CAO1: 5′-CAUCAAGCCUUCCUUCAGGUGUUGCUCCA-3′) followed by 1,024 combinations of five randomized nucleotides (NNNNN). Thus, the target, placed under the PJ23119 promoter (https://parts.igem.org/Promoters/Catalog/Anderson) was cloned into a low-copy sc101 plasmid (around 5 copies per cell), which was then amplified using the primers ODpr23 and ODpr24 (Supplementary Table 2), with the forward primer including a 5-nucleotide randomized overhang. After DpnI treatment to remove template DNA, the resulting PCR product was ligated and electroporated into E. coli TOP10, which produced >2 million transformants (about 2,000-fold library coverage). The PFS preferences of Cas12a, Cas12a2, Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 orthologues was assessed by targeting the CBS-6873 library with a CAO1-targeting crRNA plasmid (CBS-6875), using a non-targeting crRNA plasmid (CBS-6876) as a control. The nucleotide-encoding sequences were codon-optimized for E. coli and expressed under a T7 promoter, whereas crRNAs were driven by the PJ23119 promoter. E. coli BL21(AI) cells with the nuclease and crRNA plasmids were electroporated in three separate reactions, each using around 500 ng of library DNA in 50 µl competent cells recovered in LB with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 0.2% l-arabinose and grown overnight to produce about 2 million transformants (>2,000-fold library coverage). Plasmids were then purified using a ZymoPURE II Plasmid Midiprep kit (D4201). Reactions for each experimental condition were carried out in duplicate.

Purified plasmids from both target and non-target conditions were first PCR-amplified using the primers ODpr55 and ODpr56 (Supplementary Table 2) with KAPA HIFI HotStart polymerase (KK2601) for 20 cycles at 64.5 °C following the manufacturer's protocol. After amplification, these PCR products were purified using AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63880) and subsequently indexed for Illumina sequencing using standard indexing primers with KAPA HIFI HotStart polymerase (KK2601) for 8 cycles at 61.5 °C with 2 µM forward and reverse primers and 5 ng µl–1 DNA. The resulting indexed PCR products were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (paired-end, 150 bp reads), which ensured that at least 2 million reads per sample were sequenced. Raw FASTQ files were processed with Trimmomatic (v.0.39)64 using the following parameters: ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10, LEADING:3, TRAILING:3, and SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15. Paired-end reads were merged using BBMerge (qtrim=t, trimq=10, minlength=20)64,65. Sequences containing motifs matching “TTCCTTCAGGTGTTGCTCCA (…..) GGTGAGTTCT”, corresponding to the 20-nucleotide target-encoding sequence and the 10-nucleotide downstream sequence, were extracted, excluding any sequences with ambiguous bases (N) or Phred scores below 20. Depletion scores were then calculated using the formula: depletion = (sum(non-target)/sum(target)) × (count(target)/count(non-target)). The log2 fold change values for these scores were computed for the nucleotides at PFS positions (+1 to +5), and scatterplots visualizing the PFS preferences were generated using Matplotlib in Python.

To test plasmid clearance, we expressed E. coli codon-optimized orthologues (as in the PFS screen) from plasmids (Supplementary Table 2). Target RNA and crRNA were co-expressed from a single plasmid under separate PJ23119 promoters (plasmids CBS-6177–6182 in Supplementary Table 2 include CAO1, GAPDH and GFP targets with both target and non-target crRNAs). E. coli BL21 (AI) cells with these target–guide constructs were electroporated with 1 µl of high-purity 50 ng µl–1 nuclease plasmid. Cells were then recovered in LB with 0.2% l-arabinose and 1 mM IPTG at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking without antibiotics. Serial tenfold dilutions (up to 10–1 in 1× PBS) were then prepared, and 5 µl of each dilution was spotted onto LB agar plates containing 0.2% l-arabinose, 0.1 mM IPTG and the appropriate antibiotics, including 50 µg ml–1 kanamycin for selection of the nuclease plasmid alone (assessing growth arrest) or 50 µg ml–1 kanamycin plus 25 µg ml–1 chloramphenicol for co-selection (assessing plasmid clearance). Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Experiments were performed in four biological replicates.

Deletion of the relA gene in E. coli BL21(AI) was performed using λ Red recombineering as previously described66. To initiate recombineering, wild-type E. coli BL21(AI) cells were transformed with plasmid pKD46 (Supplementary Table 2), recovered and incubated overnight at 28 °C on LB agar containing ampicillin. The kanamycin resistance (kanR) cassette was PCR-amplified from plasmid pKD13 using the primers ODpr1652 and ODpr1653, which included 50 bp homology arms targeting sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the relA locus (positions 2,715,617–2,717,851 on GenBank accession CP047231), which encodes GTP pyrophosphokinase (NP_311671.1). The resulting PCR product was electroporated into E. coli cells with pKD46, which had been induced with 0.2% l-arabinose to express the λ-RED recombination machinery. Cells were plated on LB agar containing kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C to select for successful recombinants. To remove the inserted kanR cassette, plasmid pCP20 (Supplementary Table 2), which encodes FLP recombinase, was transformed into the strain. The cassette was excised via recombination at the flanking FRT sites, and pCP20 was subsequently cured by incubation at 37 °C. Successful deletion of relA was verified by colony PCR using the primers ODpr1655 and ODpr1654 (Extended Data Fig. 4), and by confirming the absence of growth on kanamycin-containing plates. Four independent mutants were generated and used to perform plasmid clearance (Extended Data Fig. 4), with the GAPDH T17 target under targeting and non-targeting conditions, using the plasmids CBS-6179 and CBS-6180 (Supplementary Table 2), respectively.

To quantify the recA-dependent SOS response, E. coli BL21 (AI) cells were co-transformed with the carbenicillin-resistant reporter PrecA-GFP (CBS-3611) or a noGFP control (CBS-3616) along with the nuclease and target–guide plasmids, performed as previously described27. The resulting overnight cultures were grown in LB containing 100 µg ml–1 carbenicillin, 50 µg ml–1 kanamycin, 25 µg ml–1 chloramphenicol and 0.2% glucose to repress nuclease expression. The next day, 1 ml of each culture was pelleted (5,000g, 2 min), resuspended in fresh LB without antibiotics and adjusted to an OD600 of 0.1. Then, 20 µl of each culture was added to 180 µl fresh medium to obtain a final concentration of 0.2% l-arabinose and 0.1 mM IPTG in a 96-well plate (final OD600 = 0.01). Samples were incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking in a BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader, with OD600 and GFP fluorescence (excitation of 485/20 nm, emission of 528/20 nm) recorded. Each condition was tested in four biological replicates.

Fresh E. coli BL21 (AI) cells at OD600 of 0.3 containing the respective nuclease (CBS-7169 and CBS-7171) and guide (CBS-7181-7183) plasmids (Supplementary Table 2) were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 µg ml–1 kanamycin, 25 µg ml–1 chloramphenicol, 0.2% l-arabinose and 0.1 mM IPTG to induce nuclease expression. These cultures were challenged with different multiplicities of infection of T4 phage and incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking overnight. The next day, the cultures were serially diluted in tenfold increments in SM buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl and 8 mM MgSO4, pH 7.5). For plaque assays, control E. coli BL21 (AI) cells with an empty carbenicillin-resistant plasmid were mixed with 0.75% top agar and poured onto LB agar plates containing 100 µg ml–1 carbenicillin. Serial dilutions of the overnight cultures were then spotted onto the top agar, and the plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow plaque formation. Each experimental condition was performed in three biological replicates. GFP-targeting crRNA-expression plasmid (CBS-7184) was used as a non-target control (Supplementary Table 2).

RNAs were in vitro-transcribed from linear dsDNA templates containing a T7 promoter (Supplementary Table 2). Templates for the GAPDH T17 and T19 crRNAs were generated by PCR amplification of ssDNA oligonucleotides using the primers ODpr1220 and ODpr1221, and ODpr1220 and ODpr1223, respectively. The T17 target RNA template was amplified from plasmid CBS-7159 using the primers ODpr1212 and ODpr1213. In vitro transcription was performed using a HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit (NEB, E2040) following the manufacturer's instructions. The generated target RNA along with the complementary crRNA were also used for cryo-EM.

For the in vitro experiment, recombinant nucleases were purified primarily as previously described27,28. In brief, the proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) star grown in LB medium and induced at an OD600 of about 0.6 with 0.1 mM IPTG, followed by an overnight incubation at 18 °C. Cells were then collected, lysed by sonication in lysis buffer and clarified by centrifugation at 30,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was then incubated with Ni-NTA resin (pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer) for 30 min at 6–8 °C, and the column was washed with an IMAC washing buffer supplemented with 2 M NaCl before bound proteins were eluted with imidazole-containing buffer. The eluate was diluted with low-salt buffer and further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Heparin column using a NaCl gradient. Pooled fractions were concentrated and polished by size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 200 column. The final purified fractions were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

Preference for targets and cleavage substrates was evaluated in vitro using nucleases purified as described above. Reactions contained 500 nM of the respective nuclease, an equimolar amount of T19 GAPDH non-target crRNA and T17 GAPDH target crRNA, and T17 GAPDH target at 50 nM provided either as RNA, ssDNA or dsDNA, as well as respective non-target substrates at 1 µM (Supplementary Table 2). For assays with Ba1Cas12a3 Y922A and ΔtRLD (Supplementary Fig. 13), reactions contained 100 nM nuclease, crRNA and target RNA together with 5 µM RNA substrate library. Reactions were performed in a buffer comprising 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT, with MgCl2 at 2 mM for Cas12a2, Cas12a3 and Cas12a4 nucleases and 10 mM for Cas12a. Fluorescence, indicative of reporter cleavage via separation of the fluorophore and quencher, was monitored at 29 °C on a BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader (excitation of 492 nm, emission of 520 nm). For the heatmap in Fig. 1f, initial reaction rates in the linear range were normalized for each nuclease by setting the highest rate across reporters to one. All experiments were performed in at least three biological replicates.

Activity of the purified Ba1Cas12a3 and MpCas12a2 nucleases was assessed using the TXTL system (Arbor Biosciences, 540300). Ba1Cas12a3 (25 nM) and MpCas12a2 (50 nM) were individually pre-incubated with 37.5 nM and 75 nM crRNA, respectively, for 15 min at 29 °C in 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT, with 2 mM MgCl2. After this pre-incubation step, 50 nM GAPDH T17 RNA target was added and the mixtures were further incubated for 15 min at 29 °C to allow the formation of ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) complexes. The assembled RNPs were then added to the TXTL reaction and incubated for 4 h at 29 °C. Thereafter, the deGFP plasmid supplied with the TXTL kit was added at 0.5 nM. In parallel, the RNP and the deGFP plasmid were simultaneously introduced into the TXTL mix that had already been pre-incubated for 4 h at 29 °C. GFP signal production was subsequently monitored on a BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader set to an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 528 nm. All experiments were performed in at least three biological replicates.

TXTL reactions were carried out using myTXTL (Arbor Biosciences, 540300) supplemented with the pCBS420 plasmid constitutively expressing deGFP and the pCBS11 p70-T7RNAP plasmid (Supplementary Table 2). For LshCas13a, the non-targeting plasmid CBS-3620 and the gfp targeting plasmid CBS-3622 expressing both the nuclease and crRNA were used; for Ba1Cas12a3, the non-targeting plasmid CBS-7245 and the targeting plasmid CBS-7246 were used (Supplementary Table 2). Final concentrations were 1 nM nuclease and crRNA co-encoded plasmids, 0.5 nM pCBS420, 0.33 nM p70-T7RNAP and 0.66 mM IPTG. Fluorescence was monitored over 16 h on a Synergy H1 plate reader (BioTek) at 485 nm excitation and 528 nm emission. For the monitoring of fluorescence, 3 µl volume of TXTL was used, whereas for RNA extraction, the reactions were scaled to 30 µl and sampled after 4 h, when strong GFP reduction under targeting conditions was evident. All experiments were performed in three biological replicates.

Following TXTL, reactions were treated with 10 µl proteinase K for 15 min at room temperature and RNA was purified using a RNA Clean & Concentrator-25 kit (Zymo Research, R1017) with on-column DNase I digestion. RT–qPCR was performed using an iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step kit (Bio-Rad, 172-5150) on a CFX Opus 384 Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad) with CFX Maestro (v.5.3.022.1030). Primer pair 1 (ODpr1662 and ODpr1663) and primer pair 2 (ODpr1670 and ODpr1671) were validated using a dilution series of RNA from TXTL expressing gfp from plasmid pCBS420 (Supplementary Table 2), which produced efficiencies of 94.7% and 97.4%, respectively. Each primer was used at 300 nM. Cycling conditions included a 63 °C annealing–extension step, with other parameters following the manufacturer's protocol. Melting curve analysis confirmed single amplicons for both primer pairs. No amplification was detected in no-RT controls after 30 cycles. Each condition was tested in three biological replicates, with three technical replicates per sample.

Ba1Cas12a3 and Sm3Cas12a3 nucleases (250 nM each) were pre-incubated in 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 2 mM MgCl2 for 15 min at 29 °C with equimolar amounts of GAPDH T19 non-target crRNA and GAPDH T17 target crRNA. Next, GAPDH T17 target RNA was added to a final concentration of 250 nM and the mixture was incubated for at least 15 min to form the RNP complex. The assembled RNP was then added to 30 µl TXTL reactions. After 4 h of incubation at 29 °C, 6 μl of proteinase K (NEB, P8107) was added and the reactions were incubated for 15 min. RNA was purified from the reactions using a RNA Clean & Concentrator-25 kit (R1017, Zymo Research). To remove full-length rRNAs, RNAs with lengths of ≤200 nucleotides were isolated with a miRNeasy Tissue/Cells Advanced Micro kit (217684, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, tRNAs in the purified RNA were deacylated by incubation in 90 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) at 37 °C for 30 min. The RNA was next recovered using a RNA Clean & Concentrator-25 kit with 1.3× ethanol concentration after the RNA prep buffer step. All reactions were performed in triplicate.

For the in vitro total E. coli tRNA cleavage reactions, Ba1Cas12a3, Sm3Cas12a3 and ca23Cas12a3 nucleases (750 nM each) were combined in 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 2 mM MgCl2 buffer with an equimolar amount of crRNAs and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Next, an equimolar amount of target RNA was added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min to allow RNP complex formation. Total tRNAs purified from E. coli MRE600 (10109541001, Roche) were then added to the final concentration of 1.5 µM. The reactions were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 2 h followed by proteinase K treatment and purification using a RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (R1013, Zymo Research). Finally, the recovered RNAs were deacylated as described for the TXTL samples. All reactions were performed in triplicate.

For each sample, 10 µg of total RNA was polyadenylated using E. coli poly(A) polymerase (NEB) in a 20 µl reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 U µl–1 RNasin, 1 mM ATP and 0.25 U µl–1 poly(A) polymerase for 30 min at 37 °C. Polyadenylated RNAs were purified using a RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer's instructions. Multiplexed Nanopore direct RNA sequencing was then performed following a previously described strategy67. In brief, custom barcode containing RTA adapters (bc03, bc04 and bc011; Supplementary Table 2) were annealed at a final concentration of 10 µM in 30 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) and 100 mM potassium acetate by incubation for 1 min at 95 °C followed by a slow cooling to 25 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C min–1. The annealed RTA adapters were then diluted to 0.7 µM and stored at −20 °C until use. Next, 100 ng of polyadenylated RNA was ligated to 1 µl of 0.7 µM annealed RTA in the presence of 2 µl of 5× NEBNext Quick ligation buffer (NEB), 0.5 µl of high-concentration T4 DNA Ligase (M0202M, NEB) and 0.2 µl of RNAsin (Promega) in a final volume of 10 µl by incubation at 22 °C for 15 min. To stop the ligation process, 2 µl of 0.5 M EDTA was added and samples were pooled and purified with 0.5 volumes of SPRI beads (Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS, Omega Bio-tek), washed twice with 200 µl fresh 80% ethanol and eluted in 10 µl RNase-free H2O. RT was performed by adding 8 µl of 5× Induro buffer, 2 µl of 10 mM dNTP, 2 µl of 10 µM random hexamer oligonucleotides, 2 µl Induro RT (NEB), 0.5 µl RNasin in a final volume of 40 µl and incubation 2 min at 22 °C (annealing), 15 min at 60 °C (RT) and 10 min at 70 °C (heat-inactivation). The reaction was purified with 1.4 volumes of SPRI beads, washed twice with 200 µl of fresh 80% ethanol and eluted in 10 µl RNase-free water. Sequencing adapter ligation was performed using a SQK-RNA004 library kit (ONT) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 10 µl of purified library was mixed with 6 µl 5× NEBNext Quick ligation buffer, 5 µl of RLA sequencing adapter (ONT SQK-RNA004) and 3 µl of T4 DNA Ligase high concentration in a final volume of 30 µl and incubated 15 min at 22 °C. The reaction was purified with 0.5 volumes of SPRI beads and washed twice with 100 µl RNA wash buffer (WSB, ONT SQK-RNA004). The library was then eluted in 32 µl RNA elution buffer (REB, ONT SQK-RNA004). For sequencing, the libraries were loaded onto a PromethION (FLO-PRO004RA) flow cell for RNA samples originating from the TXTL reactions or onto a MinION (FLO-MIN004RA) flow cell for RNA samples originating from the in vitro reactions. Data acquisition was performed using MinKNOW (v.24.11). Basecalling was performed with dorado (v.0.8.3) using the sup model. Barcode classification was performed using the demux command of warpdemux (v.0.4.4) with the WDX12_rna004_v0_4_4 model67. Unaligned bam files were then demultiplexed based on barcode labels using calibrated target performance scores.

Non-coding RNA sequence references for mapping the Nanopore reader were identified in the E. coli BL21(DE3) genome (CP010816) for TXTL analysis and the E. coli MRE600 genome (CP014197) for the analysis of the in vitro tRNA cleavage experiments. In silico identification were performed using covariance models from Rfam68 for tRNA (RF00005), tmRNA (RF00023), 5S rRNA (RF00001), 16S rRNA (RF00177) and 23S rRNA (RF02541) with searches executed using cmsearch69. The tRNA hits were subsequently annotated using tRNAscan-SE (v.2.0)70 to generate the final set of tRNA sequences for analysis. The resulting reference fasta files are provided in Supplementary Data 2 and 3.

The poly(A) tail sequences were trimmed and the reads subsequently mapped to the reference using BWA-MEM (v.0.7.17)71 with the minimum seed length of 19 (-k 19) and the minimum alignments score of 30 (-T 30). The -M option was enabled to mark shorter split hits as secondary alignments. The resulting SAM files were converted to BAM files, sorted and indexed using SAMtools (v.1.9)72. Reads with a mapping quality (MAPQ) below 20 were filtered out before downstream analyses.

Depletion scores were computed for each nucleotide position according to the formula: depletion = (sum(non-target)/sum(target)) × (count(target)/count(non-target)). In this equation, ‘sum' denotes the total number of reads mapped to a reference sequence (that is, the overall read count) under either non-target or target condition, whereas ‘count' refers to the per–nucleotide coverage (the number of reads overlapping that specific position). This normalization procedure produces a relative measure of depletion at each nucleotide position.

The z scores for each nucleotide position were calculated using the per-nucleotide depletion score, the overall mean and standard deviation for each sequence reference according to the formula: z = (nucleotide depletion score – reference mean)/reference standard deviation. For visualization purposes, the z scores were then constrained to a range of 0 to 2.

Total purified E. coli tRNAs (Roche, 10109541001) were labelled at the 5′ end with Cy5 using a Vector Labs kit (MB-9001) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with Cy5 maleimide monoreactive dye (GEPA15131, Sigma-Aldrich). For 3′ end labelling, total E. coli tRNAs and Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA (Life Technologies, 0000010468) were first deacylated in 90 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) at 37 °C for 30 min. Up to 400 pmol of RNA was then combined with 1 mM ATP, 100 µM pCp-Cy5 (NU-1706-CY5, Jena Bioscience), 1 µl T4 RNA ligase (M0202, NEB) and 1 µl of 100% DMSO in the reaction buffer supplied with the ligase. The reaction was incubated overnight at 16 °C. In vitro-transcribed tRNAs were labelled at the 3′ end using the same protocol.

To generate in vitro-transcribed tRNAs, DNA templates were first prepared by PCR using the following primer pairs: ODpr1343 and ODpr1344 for tRNALys(UUU); ODpr1345 and ODpr1346 for tRNAAla(UGC); ODpr1347 and ODpr1348 for tRNASer(GGA); and ODpr1349 and ODpr1350 for tRNATyr(GUA). In vitro transcription was then carried out using a HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit (NEB, E2040) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

To generate truncating tRNAAla(UGC), self-annealing PCR reactions were performed using the following primer pairs: ODpr1711 and ODpr1712 for ΔA; ODpr1715 and ODpr1716 for ΔT; ODpr1713 and ODpr17134 for ΔD; ODpr1717 and ODpr1718 for ΔTD; ODpr1719 and ODpr1720 for ΔAD; and ODpr1739 and ODpr1740 for h1 (Supplementary Table 2). In vitro transcription was performed using a HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit (NEB, E2040) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using up to 1 µg of PCR template.

For the in vitro digestion assay, the nucleases MpCas12a, Ba1Cas12a3, Sm3Cas12a3, ca23Cas12a3 and ApCas12a4 were each used at 250 nM, combined with either equimolar GAPDH T19 non-target or T17 target crRNAs. To activate the proteins, 10 nM target RNA was added, followed by the addition of Cy5-labelled tRNA substrates at 50 nM. The reactions were performed in 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 2 mM MgCl2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Reaction products were subsequently analysed by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. All reactions were performed in triplicate.

For northern blot analysis, TXTL and the in vitro tRNA cleavage reactions were performed as for Nanopore sequencing. After purification, 10 μg of each RNA sample from the TXTL reactions and 1 µg from the in vitro total purified E. coli tRNA reactions were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea at 300 V for 2 h and 25 min using a gel transfer system (Doppel-Gelsystem Twin L, PerfectBlue). Using an electroblotter with an applied voltage of 50 V for 1 h at 4 °C (Tank-Elektroblotter Web M, PerfectBlue), the RNA was transferred onto Hybond-XL membranes (Sigma-Aldrich, 15356-1EA), crosslinked with UV-light for a total of 0.12 Joules (UV-lamp T8C; 254 nm, 8 W) and hybridized overnight in 15 ml of Roti-Hybri-Quick buffer at 42 °C with 5 μl γ-[32P]-ATP end-labelled oligodeoxyribonucleotides (5 pmol μl–1). Probe ODp7 was used for tRNAAla(UGC), probe ODp17 for tRNALeu(UAG) and probe ODp6 for 5S rRNA (Supplementary Table 2). The labelled RNA was visualized with a Phosphorimager (Typhoon FLA 7000, GE Healthcare).

LwaCas13a protein was obtained from GenCRISPR (Z03486), whereas purified PsmCas13b was provided by M. Kaminski's Laboratory. Target RNA and crRNAs for Cas12a3 nucleases were prepared as described above. For PsmCas13b, PCR amplification was performed using the complementary primers ODpr1448–1449 to generate the GAPDH T17 target crRNA template, and the primers ODpr1450–1451 for the non-target (T19) crRNA template. Similarly, for LwaCas13a, the corresponding crRNA templates were generated by PCR using the primers ODpr1424–1425 for the target and the primers ODpr1426–1427 for the non-target crRNAs. The respective RNAs were in vitro-transcribed using a HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit (NEB, E2040).

Reactions were performed in 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 2 mM MgCl2 using nuclease-specific reporters as listed in Supplementary Table 2. For tests with tRNA-mimicking substrates using Cas12a3 nucleases, Ba1Cas12a3 (125 nM), Sm3Cas12a3 (500 nM) and ca23Cas12a3 (500 nM) were each combined with 500 nM of either target or non-target crRNA, 50 nM of GAPDH T17 RNA target and 1 mM of fluorescent RNA reporters. In experiments assessing orthogonality, Ba1Cas12a3 (100 nM), LwaCas13a (10 nM) and PsmCas13b (250 nM) were used with an equimolar amount of target or non-target crRNA, with target RNA added at 50 nM and fluorescent RNA reporters at 1 mM. Reactions were carried out at 29 °C in BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader with fluorescence monitored at an excitation of 492 nm and emission of 520 nm. Fluorescence production rates were determined in the initial linear range, normalized for each nuclease, and analysed as a function of nuclease concentration. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate.

For catalytic efficiency calculations with substrates S13, S14 and h25, reactions contained 50 nM Ba1Cas12a3, crRNA and target RNA, together with fluorophore–quencher reporters at 5,000, 2,500, 1,250, 625 or 312.5 nM. Reactions were performed in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 2 mM MgCl2. Fluorescence was monitored over time, and rates of fluorescence increase were background-corrected using the corresponding non-target controls. Rates were fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation to extract kinetic parameters, and catalytic efficiency was determined as kcat Km–1. Each condition was tested in at least three independent replicates.

To compare truncated tRNA substrates with mutations in the 3′ CCA tail, reactions contained 100 nM Ba1Cas12a3, crRNA and target RNA together with 1 µM reporters h25–h29 in buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 2 mM MgCl2). Fluorescence was monitored over time, with each condition tested in at least three independent replicates.

DNA templates for viral RNA targets were generated by PCR using the primers ODpr1684 and ODpr1685 for SARS-CoV-2 (N gene), ODpr1686 and ODpr1687 for influenza A (NP gene), and ODpr1690 and ODpr1691 for RSV (N gene) (Supplementary Table 2). crRNA templates were generated by PCR as follows: Ba1Cas12a3 non-targeting control (ODpr1692 and ODpr1693); Ba1Cas12a3 RSV N target (ODpr1692 and ODpr1738); LwaCas13a non-target (ODpr1424 and ODpr1696); LwaCas13a influenza A NP target (ODpr1424 and ODpr1697); PsmCas13b non-target (ODpr1701 and ODpr1702); and PsmCas13b SARS-CoV-2 N target (ODpr1709 and ODpr1710) (Supplementary Table 2). All RNAs were transcribed in vitro using a HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit (NEB, E2040).

Purified Ba1Cas12a3, LwaCas13a and PsmCas13b were each assembled with their cognate crRNAs at 100 nM and tested with target RNA ranging from 50 nM to 0.5 nM. Universal Human Reference RNA (Life Technologies, QS0639) was added at 10 or 50 nM, calculated assuming an average RNA length of 2 kb. Reporters were S11 (TEX fluorophore) for LwaCas13a, S12 (HEX) for PsmCas13b and h25 for Ba1Cas12a3. For one-pot reactions, nucleases, crRNAs and fluorescent reporters were first combined in a single mixture. Target RNAs were then added to initiate the reactions. Fluorescence was monitored over time. Initial reaction velocities were calculated in the linear range. All reactions were performed in at least four independent replicates.

Microscale thermophoresis measurements were performed as previously described73 in buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1.66% glycerol. To pre-assemble the activated ternary complex, the purified components were mixed at equimolar ratios before preparing the dilution series. For all measurements, a 16-point 2-fold serial dilution series was prepared, starting at an initial concentration of 2.5 μM of unlabelled components. Each dilution was subsequently mixed in equal volumes with a constant concentration of Cy5-labelled RNA. Samples were transferred into premium-coated capillaries (MO-K025, NanoTemper Technologies), and microscale thermophoresis measurements were conducted using a Monolith Pico instrument (NanoTemper Technologies). Data analysis, including determination of Kd values, was performed using NanoTemper Analysis software and plotted using Origin software (OriginLabs).

Carboxy-terminal His-tagged Ba1Cas12a3 (CBS-7171) was overexpressed in E. coli (DE3) star in 4 l of LB medium. The cell culture was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at an OD600 of 0.6 and further grown at 18 °C for 18 h. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM imidazole and 10% glycerol) treated with 1 tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail (11873580001, Roche). Cells were disrupted by sonication (Amplitude 58%; 1 s on and 8 s off for 30 min total). The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation and incubated with 5 ml (bed volume) nickel resin rotating for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the purification procedure was conducted in a 20-ml gravity column. Nickel resin was washed with 50 ml wash buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 M NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM imidazole and 10% glycerol) and 50 ml of wash buffer B (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM imidazole and 10% glycerol) sequentially and eluted with nickel-elution buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 300 mM imidazole and 10% glycerol). Nickel peak elution fractions were collected and diluted 10 times with low-salt buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 10% glycerol). Protein samples were then loaded onto a HiTrap SP HP cation-exchange chromatography column using low-salt buffer and eluted with a gradient of high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1.0 M NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 10% glycerol). Peak elution fractions were pooled and loaded onto Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) using SEC buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 5% glycerol). Peak fractions were then pooled and concentrated, and flash-frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen.

The tRNA for cryo-EM was produced using the T7 RNA polymerase-mediated run-off method74. In detail, the in vitro transcription reaction was performed in a 500 µl volume containing DNA template, T7 RNA polymerase and reaction buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 20 mM NTPs, RNasin and pyrophosphatase). The reaction was performed at 37 °C overnight and followed by DNase I treatment to remove DNA templates. The product was then purified using a DEAE column and heat treatment at 80 °C for 2 min and followed by the slow cooling process to room temperature for the re-annealing process. To obtain a homogenous tRNA population, the samples were subjected to a Superdex 75 Increase gel filtration column, and the tRNA-containing fractions were pooled and stored at −80 °C. For microscale thermophoresis measurements, the internally Cy5-labelled in vitro-transcribed E. coli tRNAs were produced as described above, with an additional 5% of Cy5-CTP introduced in the reaction.

To obtain the Ba1Cas12a3 quaternary complex, crRNA was pre-treated by heating at 65 °C for 3 min and slowly cooled down to room temperature. RNA was then added to Ba1Cas12a3 in a 1:1.2 molar ratio. The complex was then incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The pure Ba1Cas12a3 binary complex was purified via Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL in buffer without MgCl2 to inhibit nuclease activity (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 5% glycerol). Target RNA and tRNAAla were sequentially added to 50 μl of the Mg2+-free peak fraction of the binary complex (about 20 μM) at 1:1.2 and 1:2 molar ratios, respectively. The target RNA was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by the addition of tRNA, and the mixture was kept on ice for 30 min before vitrification.

For the binary complex dataset, the Ba1Cas12a3 binary complex was prepared as above but with 2 mM MgCl2 present (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2 and 5% glycerol). The binary complex sample was vitrified in the presence and absence of 0.02% (w/v) fluorinated octyl maltoside to obtain more particles with different orientations.

For the ternary complex dataset, target RNA was added into the Ba1Cas12a3 binary complex (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2 and 5% glycerol) in a 1:1.2 molar ratio. The ternary complex sample was vitrified in the presence of 1 mM ATPγS to obtain more views of particle distribution.

Samples were vitrified on cryo-EM grids (Quantifoil R 2/1 300 mesh, Au). In brief, 3.5 μl of the sample was applied onto glow-discharged grids. The grids were blotted for 4 s (blot force: −9; 100% humidity; 4 °C) and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI). The vitrified specimens were imaged on a Thermo Fisher Glacios Cryo-TEM operating at 200 kV and equipped with the Falcon 4i Direct Electron Detector camera, an energy filter slit width of 10 eV and a C2 aperture of 50 μm. The videos were recorded in counting mode using Thermo Fisher Scientific EPU software (v.3.7.1) with the total dose of 40 e– A–2 with a nominal magnification of 130,000-fold, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.91 Å.

Motion correction, contrast transfer function estimation, particle picking and 2D classification were carried out on-the-fly using CryoSPARC live (v.4.4.0 and v.4.6.0)28,75. The particles selected from the 2D classification of the live session were divided into small splits and the junk particles were removed again using 2D classification. The remaining particles were further classified by using heterogeneous refinement, and the best 3D classes were subjected to non-uniform refinement. Overall, gold-standard resolution Fourier shell correlation using the threshold of 0.143 and local resolution was calculated by local resolution estimation. The statistics for data collection and processing are provided in Extended Data Table 1.

All models corresponding to the Ba1Cas12a3 binary, ternary and quaternary complexes were originally generated by AlphaFold3 (ref. 76) and used as initial models for model building. Models were built in ChimeraX (v.1.7)77, and interactive refinements against cryo-EM maps were performed using ISOLDE with restraints for secondary-structure elements of the AlphaFold3-predicted structures77,78. The resulting models were further refined with real-space refinement and validated in Phenix (v.1.20.1)79. Statistics for the final models are described in Extended Data Table 1.

All structural figures were generated using Chimerax (v.1.7). For structural comparison, the structures from binary to quaternary were aligned against the Ba1Cas12a3 WED domain. The domain motions from other individual domains were shown with arrows in different domain colours, and the arrows from each two compared models were created by using the PDB-arrows script with slight modification80.

The Ba1Cas12a3 mutant constructs were generated either by Q5 PCR site-directed mutagenesis followed by KLD or by Gibson assembly, using the C-terminal 6×His-tagged WT Ba1Cas12a3 plasmid as a template (CBS-7171; Supplementary Table 2). Each plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, grown on an agar plate and selected by antibiotic resistance selection. A single colony was used to inoculate 60 ml of LB medium, grown at 37 °C at 200 rpm overnight (16–18 h). Next, 20 ml of the overnight growth was used to inoculate 1 litre of LB medium containing 100 µg ml–1 kanamycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C at 200 rpm until an OD600 of 0.5–0.6 was reached. The cells were then cold shocked on ice for 20 min before inducing with 0.1 mM IPTG, followed by 16–18 h of growth at 18 °C. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. Other nucleases were expressed using the same procedure.

For in vitro cleavage experiments shown in Fig. 3f,h,i, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 11 and 13, Ba1Cas12a3, mutants thereof, as well as ApCas12a4, MpCas12a2 and Sm3Cas12a3, were purified similarly to the method used for SuCas12a2 (refs. 27,28). In brief, the cell pellets were thawed on ice before lysis by sonication in a lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 2 mM MgCl2and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (2 μg ml−1 aprotinin, 10 μM leupeptin and 1.0 μg ml−1 pepstatin) and 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and added to 5 ml of Ni-NTA resin and batch bound at 4 °C for 30 min, and then washed with 300 ml wash buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.5, 2 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 2 mM MgCl2 and 10% glycerol). The protein was eluted with 25 ml Ni-elution buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 2 mM MgCl2 and 10% glycerol). Fractions containing Ba1Cas12a3, as determined by SDS–PAGE, were desalted using a Hiprep 26/10 desalting column into low-salt buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 10% glycerol). Ba1Cas12a3 was applied to a Hitrap Heparin HP cation-exchange column and eluted using a gradient of high-salt buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.5, 1 M NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 10% glycerol). The fractions containing Ba1Cas12a3 were concentrated using a 50 kDa MWKO concentrator to about 1 ml and loaded onto a Hiload 16/600 Superdex 200 pg size-exclusion column using SEC buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 8.5, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 5% glycerol). Fractions containing the desired proteins were concentrated and stored at −80 °C.

Reactions were made by combining 300 nM crRNA with 250 nM CRISPR-associated enzyme in DTT containing low-salt buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Next, 100 nM of FAM-labelled tRNA substrate was then added followed by 250 nM of target RNA to initiate the reaction. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1 h. Reactions were quenched with phenol and nucleic acid was purified by acid phenol–chloroform extraction. FAM-labelled nucleic acid was analysed using 12% urea–PAGE and visualized for fluorescein fluorescence.

For determining the cleavage efficiency of the Ba1Cas12a3 TRL mutants, 140 µl reactions were performed with 150 nM Ba1Cas12a3, 100 nM guide RNA, 100 nM FAM 26-nucleotide structured tRNA substrate (Supplementary Table 2) and 25 nM target RNA. Next, 20-µl aliquots were extracted and quenched at 10 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min and 10 min at 37 °C. Nucleic acid was quenched and visualized as described above.

For determining the nucleic acid targets for ApCas12a4, MpCas12a2, Sm3Cas12a3 and Ba1Cas12a3 (Extended Data Fig. 2), 250 nM crRNA and a given nuclease (250 nM) were incubated in a DTT containing low-salt buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT) at room temperature for 15 min. Then 100 nM of FAM-labelled target (RNA, ssDNA or dsDNA) was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1 h before quenching the reaction with phenol and extracting the nucleic acid using phenol–chloroform. The samples were analysed using a previously described denaturing FDF–PAGE81 and visualized for fluorescein fluorescence.

To determine whether the Ba1Cas12a3 ΔtRLD mutant could still bind target RNA, an electromobility shift assay was performed. To control the amount of binary (protein–guide) complex in the reaction mixture, 5:1 Ba1Cas12a3 to guide RNA concentration ratio was prepared. An initial protein–guide solution was prepared and serial diluted into four reaction concentrations in an EDTA-containing buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mM KCL and 100 mM EDTA). The reaction tubes ranged from 10 nM to 10 µM for Ba1Cas12a3 and 2 nM to 2 µM for the crRNA. The FAM-labelled target RNA concentration was held constant at 100 nM. The samples were run on a 6% TBE polyacrylamide gel and visualized for fluorescein fluorescence.

To determine the overall structural components of Ba1Cas12a3 ΔtRLD compared with WT Ba1Cas12a3, far-UV circular dichroism (CD) was performed using a Jasco-J1500 spectropolarimeter. In brief, 0.36 mg ml–1 of the respective protein was prepared in CD buffer (10 mM K2HOP4 and 50 mM Na2SO4 pH 8.74) and CD spectra were obtained from 260 to 190 nm using a scanning speed of 50 nm min−1 (with a 2-s response time and accumulation of three scans). The CD signal was converted to molar ellipticity using Jasco Spectra Manager software.

The phylogenetic tree was constructed using IQ-TREE with ultrafast bootstrapping (1,000 replicates). The scale bar at the bottom indicates the expected number of substitutions per site. The corresponding simplified phylogeny is shown in Fig. 1a. The alignment highlights key motifs and residues, including those involved in protospacer-flanking sequence (PFS) recognition, the aromatic clamp regions interacting with cleaved and non-cleaved strands, CRISPR RNA (crRNA) recognition, RuvC domain motifs, and zinc-ribbon sites. A subset of the amino acid alignment is shown in Fig. 1b.

(a) In vitro target cleavage using FAM-labeled dsDNA, ssDNA, or RNA resolved on a fully-denaturing formaldehyde (FDF) polyacrylamide gel. (b) In vitro cleavage of FAM-labeled non-target substrates. Gel images are representative of independent cleavage assays (n = 3). For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.

(a) GFP silencing in TXTL. Plasmids encoding the Cas nuclease, GFP-targeting or non-targeting crRNA, and deGFP are combined in a TXTL reaction, and GFP fluorescence is measured over time. Right: fluorescence time course for Ba1Cas12a3 and LshCas13a. The vertical dashed line represents the time-point when a separate TXTL reaction was stopped for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. Curves and shaded regions represent the mean ± standard deviation of separately prepared reactions (n = 3 or 4). (b) RT-qPCR analysis of the deGFP mRNA to determine the extent of mRNA cleavage. Left: location of the two primer pairs used for qPCR relative to the target sites for Ba1Cas12a3 and LshCas13a. Reverse transcription was conducted with the respective reverse primer. Fold-reduction was calculated using the non-target condition as the reference. Each dot represents an independent measurement from one TXTL reaction, while bars and error bars represent the mean ± standard deviation from separate reactions (n = 3), with each the average of triplicate technical measurements. One-tailed paired Student's t-test. Non-significant p-values (p ≥ 0.05) are in gray.

Source data

(a) Confirmation of deletion of relA in E. coli BL21(AI). Top: two-step approach to generate the complete deletion of relA using lambda-RED recombineering. Primer pairs to verify the deletion are shown at each step. Bottom: Resolved PCR products at each step of generating the ∆relA strain. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1. (b) Transformation fold-reduction as part of the plasmid interference assay using the ∆relA strain. See Fig. 1d for an overview of the assay. Each dot represents a biological replicate starting from a separate colony. Bars and error bars represent the mean ± standard deviation of biological replicates (n = 3 or 4). Kan, kanamycin; Cm, chloramphenicol.

Source data

(a) Model of the SuCas12a2-crRNA-target RNA-dsDNA quaternary complex. (b) Model of the Ba1Cas12a3-crRNA-target RNA-tRNAAla(UGC) quaternary complex. (c) The interaction between the PI domain and the PFS nucleotides in the SuCas12a2 quaternary complex. The bases of the PFS at position +2 (A22-Q681), +3 (A23-K621, A23-N625), and +4 (A24-I633) interact with the SuCas12a2 PI domain. (d) The interaction between the PI domain and the PFS nucleotides in the Ba1Cas12a3 quaternary complex. The base of adenine at position +2 (A37-S469) interacts with the Ba1Cas12a3 PI domain. (e) Ba1Cas12a3 PI domain (in plum) superimposed with SuCas12a2 PI domain (in dark grey). The PFS for Ba1Cas12a3 is colored in dark orange. The PFS for SuCas12a2 is colored in dim grey. The PFS sequences bind to each PI domain in a distinct manner. The differences between SuCas12a2 and Ba1Cas12a3 in PFS recognition pattern are well correlated with the PFS library screening in Supplementary Fig. 2a.

(a) Interactions between the REC2 loop of Ba1Cas12a3 and the T-arm of tRNA are shown with underlying EM density map. (b) Interactions between the tRLD of Ba1Cas12a3 and the 3′ CCA tail of the tRNA with underlying EM density map. (c) 2D interaction plot displaying the binding interface between Ba1Cas12a3 and tRNA. Electrostatic contacts are primarily between positively charged side chains or peptide backbone amines located at the ends of helices. Several residues (e.g., N253 and K1038) make contacts within the minor groove of RNA-duplexes, likely sensing the specific shape of the tRNA. (d) The bound tRNA is modeled with a tryptophan residue, demonstrating no steric clashes in the structure to impair binding to aminoacylated tRNAs.

Binding of the activated dBa1Cas12a3 ternary complex to the indicated fluorescent RNA substrate was quantified by MST. dBa1Cas12a3 contains the E1065A mutation in the RuvC endonuclease domain to render it catalytically inactive. Symbols and error bars represent the mean ± standard deviation of independent experiments (n = 3).

Source data

(a) Comparing cleavage of different RNA substrates containing CCCCA. An activated Ba1Cas12a3 RNP was indicated with the indicated substrate, and fluorescence through the separation of the conjugated fluorophore (green circle) and quencher (gray circle) is measured over time for a range of substrate concentrations. Circles with nucleotides are colored to represent a mutation from C to U, a pyrimidine (red), or to G, a purine (yellow). The data from independent measurements (n = 3) were used to calculate catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), with means ± standard error shown. (b) Comparing different truncated tRNA substrates with mutations to the cytosines in the 3′ CCA tail. Dotted curves and shaded regions represent the mean ± standard deviation of independently prepared and monitored reactions (n = 4).

Anthropic is gearing up to raise a fresh $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal. TechCrunch has confirmed the raise and valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Claude maker last raised a $13 billion Series F round at a $183 billion valuation three months ago, so this raise nearly doubles the AI firm's value. In March, Anthropic secured $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation. 

Coatue Management and GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, will lead the new round, per the WSJ, which cited sources familiar with the deal. Anthropic is expected to close its latest financing in the coming weeks, and the total deal amount could change. 

This round would be separate from the $15 billion Nvidia and Microsoft recently committed to invest in Anthropic, a “circular” deal that would see Anthropic buying $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft Azure running on Nvidia's chips. 

The fresh capital comes as Anthropic continues to win over developer hearts with Claude Code, its tool designed to automate coding, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. It also comes as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year alongside its main rival OpenAI. OpenAI is also in talks to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of up to $830 billion.

Anthropic declined to comment. 

This article was updated to reflect that TechCrunch separately confirmed the round.

Google has introduced a new way to grab the attention of students who are avid podcast listeners. Now available in Google Classroom, teachers can use a new Gemini-powered tool that generates podcast-style audio lessons, meant to promote deeper comprehension of educational material. 

To begin, educators simply go to the Gemini tab within Google Classroom. There, they can select different customization options, such as selecting the appropriate grade level, defining topics, and setting clear learning objectives. They can then further personalize the audio experience by choosing the number of speakers or selecting different conversational styles, such as interviews, roundtable discussions, or casual dialogues. 

This new feature is currently available to users subscribed to Google Workspace Education Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus.

By bringing this familiar format into the classroom, teachers can tap into their students' interests. Research shows that students spend significant time listening to podcasts, with an estimated 35 million Gen Z monthly listeners in the U.S. 

Plus, the popularity of podcasts as educational resources has grown rapidly; many universities now produce their own podcasts, and students increasingly seek out popular educational series on their own time. Podcast-style lessons might also encourage independent learning, since students can replay episodes whenever they need a refresher or missed a class.

However, teachers are still grappling with integrating AI tools into their teaching practices. Many teachers express concerns about students' increased reliance on generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments. 

Google urges teachers to practice responsible AI and carefully review and, if necessary, edit all AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and appropriateness for their specific classroom context and local policies. 

Gemini for Classroom first launched in 2024, and Google has continually added new features since then. Most recently, the company rolled out major updates last June, including features that help teachers brainstorm, develop lesson plans, and customize instructional materials for their students.

I'm not opposed, as protein seems to be a good target to prioritize, but claiming there's a war on protein just seems so out of touch to the point of absurdity. It's practically the only thing that people care about right now.

The normal recommended daily intake for protein is 0.8 g/kg. 1.2-1.6 is silly; that's a recommendation for athletes.¹Starches have been a dietary staple in pretty much every society forever. Sugars have not. It's silly that they treat grains as a ""sometimes"" food.There's also the weird boogeyman of ""processed food."" Almost all food is processed to some degree & always has been. We've been cooking, baking, juicing, fermenting, chopping, grinding, mashing, etc. long enough that it influenced the shape of our teeth. Certainly we haven't been making Pizza Pockets that long, but the issue there isn't processing, it's ingredients. And the reason people buy Pizza Pockets isn't that they think they're healthy—it's that Pizza Pockets only need to be microwaved, and cooking a real meal takes time that a lot of people just don't have.[1]: https://www.strongerbyscience.com/athlete-protein-intake/

It's very hard to overeat protein naturally. It's very easy to overeat starches and other carbohydrates naturally.With regard to ""processed"" food, it's not a great label. I would use this metric: could you conceivably produce this in an average kitchen with the raw materials? If you can, it's probably safe, if you can't, it's probably something you shouldn't eat. For instance, processing often means ""partially hydrogenating"" a fat, or milling grains into a fine dust and bleaching them. Sometimes chemically produced oils are deodorized, because they would otherwise smell very unpalatable. You generally should not want your food to be bleached or deodorized..

On the flip side, I firmly believe a lot of the issues that we are having societally with regards to hormone imbalance, mental health and fertility issues really comes down to insufficient intake of essential fatty acids which include some saturated fats.

Why werent those issues in the late 19th century? We certainly ate very, very little meat and didn't have any fertility issues.I'm saying that, but even nowadays, the countries with the highest fertility are those where people eat the less meat.

And I totally feel you on the taste thing. Meat tastes good, and we're used to it!I'd recommend looking at some dishes from various Asian cuisines, for example Indian food. The problem with American cuisine is that we've been conditioned to expect meat as part of every meal, three times a day. Even just reducing your meat intake by one meal a day, or even just a few meals a week, can make a massive difference collectively.I was a vegetarian in my teens, but I suffered from frequent fainting (this had been going on both before and after I was vegetarian, it was just worse during that period), sometimes at really unsettling moments like while shaving my face.  I eventually seemed to grow out of these fainting spells, but I went back to eating meat for years.And the entire time, I recognized the taste of meat as my main barrier to giving it back up. I finally made progress by removing or heavily reducing consumption of one meat at a time. First pork, then beef and other things, and then finally chicken.Even today, I am a pescatarian and occasionally eat a little fish, shellfish and dairy. I also eat a lot of eggs. Dairy farming still involves what I consider torture however and I have worked to significantly reduce my intake. I really don't mind vegan cheese or even just shredded cashews as a replacement.I don't feel bad eating mussels, oysters, etc. so I don't think I'll ever stop eating those, but I have significantly reduced the amount of fish I eat as well. I get nervous because I don't want to start fainting again, but I just track my protein and try to get it wherever I can, for example sprouted protein bread, eggs, whey, hemp and pea powders in smoothies, etc.

Not to mention processed red meats are in the same classification of carcinogen as alcohol and Tabacoo. And regular red meat is still higher up than aspartame, aka diet coke.Meat can be good for you. But it shouldn't take a genius to deduce that a diet of steaks, cheeseburgers, milkshakes, and bacon probably is not.

Thank you for exemplifying the problem so clearly - conflating protein with fat when we're really talking about a simple carbohydrates issue of high energy density with negative satiety.Excess protein is excreted renally, it's easy to overdo and can cause serious problems.

reply

Protein is actually pretty hard to overdo naturally. If you've ever tried to follow the high protein guidelines and you're a taller or broader shouldered person you'll find that getting that amount of protein requires supplementation or a lot of focus on lean meats. I'm not saying everyone needs to go ""high"" protein, I'm just saying that worrying about the amount of protein you're eating is probably not worth doing. You'll feel pretty full if you eat a lot of protein.Keto is not just ""high fat"" though. Keto is about producing ketones, and going too high fat can actually be counterproductive there, at least for weight loss. (You want to be liberating fat from your storage, not getting it from external sources)

Tangent, but it reminds me of how people consider a ""balanced"" diet to be 1/3rd protein, 1/3rd fat, 1/3rd carbs. It sounds good, until you consider the purpose of carbs. Carb's aren't inherently bad of course, but they have glucose which stimulates an insulin response, resulting in storing more food as fat. And considering how many obese people we have, the ""balanced"" diet seems to be very unbalanced. The thing with carbs is, you really only need to take them in if you're very actively doing anaerobic exercise. If you're doing that, great! Then you should eat carbs. If you're sitting at a desk 8 hours a day and not exercising at all, then you really don't need much in the way of carbs at all.Higher fiber seems, at best, to not move the needle much at all. At worst you could irritate various gut linings. Fiber in things like fruit can be good because it moderates the absorption of fructose, but I generally don't think you need to supplement fiber at all.

This new JFK Jr diet has something in common with the Paleo ""cave man"" diet, which at least makes some sense in the argument (""this is what our bodies have evolved to eat"") if not the specifics. I'm not sure where the emphasis on milk/cheese and eggs comes from since this all modern, not hunter-gatherer, and largely unhealthy, and putting red-meat at the top (more cholesterol, together with the eggs), and whole grain at the bottom makes zero sense - a recipe for heart attacks and colon cancer.https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/rfk-jr-nutrition-guidelines-...

With regards to dairy, it's more about a person's individual reaction to it. It's a similar argument with nutrient density (since milk is intended for growing offspring, obviously it's going to be very nutrient dense). The downside  is potential inflammation or not having the enzymes to process it.I would definitely not lump eggs and dairy as ""bad"" in any way though.Also, the ""cholesterol"" thing is a very bad thing to focus on. Cholesterol is not bad! You need cholesterol. (What do you think cell membranes are partially composed of?Whole grains are not as good as you think.

As far as eggs and dairy go, sure they are healthy for who is meant to be consuming them - baby chickens and baby mammals, but that doesn't mean they are good for us in excess.There have been, and continue to be, so may flip flops in dietary recommendations and what is good/bad for you, that it seems common sense is a better approach.

Just because vegetables, lentils or nuts contain protein it doesn't mean it's the same/equivalent to the protein in an animal product.Meat is actually super easy for humans to digest and it has no downsides to it. All vegetables on the other side contain plenty of anti-nutrients such as folate and oxalates.Everything in human body, skin, connective tissues, tendons, hair, nails, muscles is essentially built out of protein and collagen.

Ruminant meat is absolutely one of the best bioavailable forms of a mostly complete amino acid profile, though eggs and dairy is more complete with differing ratios depending on form/feed.As to lentils, tofu, chickpeas etc.  They're fine for most people in moderation, but they are also relatively inflammatory and plenty of people have digestive issues and allergies to legumes (I do), soy is one of the top 10 allergens that people face.  While almost nobody is allergic to ruminant meat.

Similarly, it's a ""complete"" protein, whereas most vegetables and legumes are missing necessary amino acids.The downside of beef isn't the ""density"" of nutrients: the downside is high saturated fat. Chicken breast, though, is similarly high in protein without the saturated fat downside.

So the problem with steak isn't the steak itself it's the ""steak dinner"" where the meat comes with sides such as french fries and drinks such as beer.

I usually suggest around 0.5g fat to 1g protein as a minimal, higher if keto/carnivore.

There are other downsides to beef .. such as the batshit crazy use of ecosystems and resources required to produce it at industrial scale.Got a (beef) cow roaming in your yard, somehow getting by on whatever grows out of the ground? Enjoy your steak! Generating 6x the calories via a water-intensive cover crop to feed the cow so you can eat it later? Just say no.

I am consternated at the proliferation of refined grains. Here are my USA observations:  - Grocery store or Amazon etc: Whole grain breads and flours are in the  minority, but it's possible to get them

  - Restaurants and bakeries: Impossible to find whole grains; 100% refined


IMO it's a no-brainer to eat the healthier stuff that has bran + endosperm intact instead of removing and attempting ton add back the micro-nutrients. (While still missing the fiber)

A small flour mill is not that expensive,  I wonder why more places do not grind their own flour?

I was amused to see (kilo)grams used for the weights. I'll admit that as an American, I have no idea what my weight is in kilograms. Body weight is something that I always think of in pounds. I do use grams sometimes in food prep, but I think even that makes me a bit of an abnormality around here.Not that I am complaining about their unit choice. I think American's would do well to be a bit more ""bilingual"" in our measurement systems. Also, the measurements they give are a lot easier to parse than 3/128 oz per 1lb bodyweight.

If you're overweight, your protein target should be based on your lean mass, not your excess mass.  While you can have more, you're likely better off conserving the calories.Also, personally, I tend to recommend at least 0.5g fat to 1g protein.  This seems to be pretty close to what you get from a lot of healthy protein sources and given that you actually need a certain amount of essential fatty acids for your body to function, I find this helps from digestion, glucose control, satiety and even weight loss.

6-11 servings of grains, 3-5 veges, 2-4 fruit, 2-3 dairy, 2-3 protein (all sources), minimal fat was absurd and bad. Protein is until you hit your needed macros. Fats are as needed. Processed grains are basically empty calories. a cup or two of whole grains is all you really need and thats it.

Weird branding and culture war stuff aside, this is probably the least objectionable thing this health administration has done.That said, I don't know if this would actually move the needle much. The Japanese diet includes so much more processed foods and less protein and they still live longer, healthier lives. I think the ultimate factors are still portion sizes, environment, activity, and genetics.

Eggs, aside from some of the disease issues are also a very good, nutritionally complete source of protein that are relatively inexpensive.Another issue is that people have been conditioned to eat/snack all the time... a lot of people have moved towards 2-3 meals a day which is closer to historical norms... have protein be your main source, with vegetables as a side, and maybe bread/pasta at some meals.There are also beans/legumes if you can tolerate them.

If I saw that there was a Walmart in town, I perked up. Consistent, low-priced and large number of grocery items. Likely better than  an unknown, variable, often poorly stocked local grocery (or worse, groceries at a gas station/convenience store).I also liked seeing the economic diversity of customers that I wouldn't see at home.In larger cities, I'll choose other groceries if I can for better selection, if not better prices.Of course, except for maybe Sprouts, all the places I shop emphasize ultra-processed corporte interests.

Frozen vegetables are pretty cheap and easy to warm up quickly in the microwave or an air fryer.  They may not be as good for you as fresh produce, but that can be a reasonable tradeoff based on the season and free time.Chest freezers are reasonably cheap to buy (new or used) and cheap to operate, assuming you have the physical space and an open electrical outlet.  They don't consume much electricity, mine uses about 75W for the compressor (when it's running, which is less than 50% of the time) and about 250W for the defrost heaters (which seem to turn on for about 15 minutes roughly once per day.

This is a good start.  A start.  The folks at the top, including RFK Jr. are still captured by big industry.We need to get off of corn syrup, artificial ingredients, and harmful preservatives.That said, food deserts still exist, and real whole food is expensive, especially in a time of dire economic stress.  I thought that's what subsidies were for, but apparently they are for enriching Big Food / Big Ag executives, their lobbyists, and their bought-and-paid-for congresscritters.We also need to realize we've been duped for generations into liking things that are overly sweet.  Sweet is fine, but we don't need to add stevia or sugar to everything.  One of my biggest walls of resistance that I see regularly with my own products is that people have been conditioned to expect that everything in my vertical is super sweet.  Just last week I had a parent complain at a sampling that my drink wasn't as sweet as Prime, and thus it's shit.  Prime has over an ounce of added sugar in its bottles.  I'm marketing to an entirely different set of consumer, too.  I offered her a million USD in cash if I could name 10 ingredients on a Prime bottle, and she'd tell me what the  ingredient was for, why it helped her son, and the natural origin of the ingredient.  She accepted, couldn't get past 1, and then told me that it didn't matter - her son liked what he liked and that's what she was going to buy.  We've spoiled generations of people into accepting super sweet things with no idea of why something is or isn't sweet.One thing I also do is that (i have the luxury of time to do this, which I recognize is something not everyone has) if i want something really sweet and it's not a fruit, I generally make it myself.  If I am having a birthday party, I'll make the cake myself.  If my nephew wants to leave christmas cookies out for Santa, I'll make them myself.  If I want ice cream, I have an ice cream machine and I'll make it myself.

One of the problems with the way we live and work is that it's so easy to go for the quick option. If you're working 60+ hours a week or trying to run a busy household, unhealthy food options are really attractive for you because they're so convenient. People generally know what good food is, it's just that they make the sacrifice because there's other things going on in their lives.I've said things like this before and people respond like ""well, I run my own business and raise a family and volunteer at my church and so on and on... AND cook perfectly healthy meals 3 times a day!"" That's awesome for you, you're amazing, but let's get real.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

At CES 2026, Ikea spent its first-ever time at the tech event showing off a number of new products, including a new Bluetooth speaker it calls the Kallsup. It's a teeny tiny cube that is, in every way that matters, far more of a delight than its $10 price tag lets on. It will be available in April in red, white, and green colors.

The Kallsup is lightweight yet solid-feeling, a plastic box with speaker holes on one face, a USB-C port on the back for charging, and two buttons astride a small LED status light for power, playback, and pairing. It was immediately charming, and not just because it's so dang adorable; every action you do on it prompts these whimsical human-made noises—like a boop or a whooshing sound. The speakers use Bluetooth 5.3 and up to 100 Kallsup speakers can be synchronized together by doing the proper sequence of long presses of the play button between them.

With a few paired together, the Kallsup cubes were able to quickly fill the room with better-than-you'd-expect sound—not tinny or muffled. They certainly didn't push out much bass, and neither would I expect that at this size and price.

The only real criticisms I have, at first glance, spring from Ikea's decision to only put two buttons on the box: a play button and one emblazoned with the Bluetooth logo. It's not obvious to me that you'd long press the play button, rather than the Bluetooth one, for pairing speakers together, and neither is it clear how they're turned off, or even if you can do that manually. If you wait long enough, though, the speakers time themselves out.

Many clinicians will understandably dismiss a patient's report of a vivid, frightening dream about falling ill as a byproduct of anxiety. However, a growing body of neurobiological research suggests these nocturnal narratives may be more than mere coincidence. Emerging evidence indicates that some dreams may serve as harbingers of disease, detecting physiologic changes before conventional diagnostics — or even symptoms — emerge.

Unlike typical dreams that fade upon waking, “prodromal dreams” stay with people and involve vivid, often disturbing imagery in which they discover a specific illness. Anecdotal examples from the International Association for the Study of Dreams include a woman who dreamt of her aunt, who had died of breast cancer, warning her that she too had the disease — later confirmed by mammogram.

Now, new neuroscientific models and clinical studies are beginning to provide biological plausibility for how the sleeping brain might detect early pathology.

A 2025 hypothesis and theory paper in Frontiers in Psychiatry, for example, proposes that some prodromal dreams emerge from interoceptive predictive processing during REM sleep. During REM, limbic and paralimbic regions involved in interoception compress high-dimensional visceral and autonomic inputs into low-dimensional summaries. When these summaries diverge from the brain's predictions, a “prediction error” is generated. Because REM operates in a hallucinatory, hyper-associative mode with reduced external input, the brain's attempt to explain that error is rendered as vivid, often threat-laden or metaphorical dream imagery that can foreshadow emerging pathology.

“In neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, it is possible that changes to brain networks involved in dream generation and emotional tone may cause changes to dreaming years or decades before other symptoms of the disease emerge,” Abidemi Otaiku, MD, clinical research fellow at UK Dementia Research Institute, Imperial College London, London, England, told Medscape News Europe.

Research is revealing a possible connection between dreams and neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, where dream-related symptoms can emerge years before motor dysfunction. Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) — in which people physically act out their dreams while having no overt neurologic disease — often emerges years before motor symptoms appear, according to a 2025 review in the Journal of Sleep Research. The predictive power of this phenomenon is sobering: a 2019 meta-analysis tracking nearly 4000 patients with iRBD found that about one third had developed Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies after an average of 5 years, with statistical modeling estimating this proportion would exceed 90% by 14 years. A smaller subset may develop multiple system atrophy.

These clinical observations now have a biological correlate. A 2025 Brain Communications study used advanced MRI to detect excess iron accumulation in the substantia nigra — a small but critical movement hub — in people with early Parkinson's disease. Those with dream enactment showed iron levels intermediate between healthy control individuals and patients with Parkinson's disease, and iron deposition increased measurably over 4 years. This suggests that dream enactment can coincide with subtle, yet detectable, brain changes that precede clinical diagnosis.

The genetic architecture of this subtype is equally revealing. A 2025 international genetics study comparing patients Parkinson's disease with and without RBD uncovered distinct patterns at two pivotal genes: SNCA and LRRK2. This genetic fingerprint points to an alpha-synuclein-related subtype in which dream enactment may be woven into the disease pathway from its earliest stages. A 2023 review in Cell Death and Disease additionally reports that when RBD accompanies Parkinson's disease, the disease typically follows a more aggressive trajectory, with faster progression and higher rates of cognitive decline, hallucinations, depression, and anxiety.

Otaiku's own research includes a study that found frequent and distressing dreams are associated with an increased risk for Parkinson's disease if the dreams occurred within 5 years prior to diagnosis. “My work has mostly been about nightmares as a prodromal sign in neurodegenerative diseases,” Otaiku said. “I think nightmares could be used alongside other prodromal symptoms like loss of smell, depression, and dream enactment to facilitate early detection.”

If a patient reports having prodromal dreams or aggressive nightmares, what should clinicians do? A sleep study may be warranted to differentiate prodromal dreaming from other sleep disorders. Nightmares and dream enactment are treatable, and evaluation can uncover conditions such as RBD, obstructive sleep apnea, or medication effects.

Some patients may report upsetting dreams to their physician and express a desire to stop them. “It is possible to wake yourself up from a dream, and there are those who may do so during a distressing one,” explained Anthony Bloxham, PhD, lecturer in psychology and member of the Sleep Research Group at Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, England. “Lucid dreaming is all about recognizing when you are dreaming, and then maybe taking more active control of the dream as it unfolds.”

However, in the case of a prodromal dream, waking up may be counterproductive because important details may be lost. “Confronting whatever is bothering you in the dream, understanding it, and trying to change it into something positive or more pleasant seems a more problem-solving focused approach than simply trying to escape,” Bloxham told Medscape News Europe.

If a patient expresses fear or discomfort about their dreams, reassurance is important. Ensure the patient understands that a dream is not necessarily indicative of a diagnosis, but that you would like to gather more information.

“My advice would be to keep the topic light and playful,” said Brigitte Holzinger, PhD, professor and scientific director of the postgraduate sleep coaching program at the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. “Call it an experiment — ask if the patient would be interested in participating,” she told Medscape News Europe. Ask the patient to keep a dream journal, noting details as soon as they wake up. Even an incidental part of a dream may be a valuable clue.

Finally, a full medical workup is warranted if there is enough evidence to suggest a suspected illness.

WASHINGTON — Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with wearable technology may improve the care of patients with liver disease by guiding medication adjustments and alerting clinicians to early signs of disease progression, according to Adam Buckholz, MD, gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City.

In a presentation at The Liver Meeting 2025: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and a subsequent interview with Medscape Medical News, Buckholz highlighted the promise of remote monitoring with wearable devices in hepatology.

“By leveraging the passive data collection of wearable technology, we can collect multiple data points on a second-by-second basis, providing nearly immediate biological insight,” Buckholz said.

AI applications can be instrumental in processing this overwhelming volume of information.

“The machine learning and advanced analytical tools of AI allow for processing and understanding of that data in a way that would otherwise be impossible.”

Wearable technology may help address long-standing gaps in treatment, Buckholz said in his presentation. Many patients miss discharge follow-up appointments after hospitalization, and in-person clinical encounters are often brief. In contrast, remotely collected wearable data are more accurate and convenient, less biased and sensitive to change, and unaffected by geographic distance between patients and clinicians.

More than one third of Americans (36%) already use wearable devices, according to a 2025 study in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. But most devices were not developed or validated for identifying health outcomes.

“This represents a big missed opportunity,” Buckholz said. “Early changes happening to patients outside the clinical setting are not being used by their healthcare teams to improve outcomes. Wearables can help patients take charge and be proactive with their healthcare and offer both doctors and patients a stronger sense of control.”

Wearables provide insight into standard metrics such as steps, heart rate, sleep, and oxygenation. In addition, they can track body activity/position, mobility, geographic location, falls, heart rate variability, heart arrhythmia, voice characteristics, reaction speed, swallowing pattern, gut motility, and sweat, among other things.

To serve as effective biomarkers, however, this information should be actionable, sensitive, specific, reproducible, scalable, biologically meaningful, and acceptable to patients, Buckholz said.

“By observing patients with wearable technology and then interpreting these data with AI facilitation, researchers are hoping to identify such biomarkers in liver disease.”

Potential applications in liver disease include monitoring improvement or progression in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and detecting early signs of hepatic decompensation.

“These technologies could also help patients take a more active role in their disease and improve communication in periods of both illness and wellness,” Buckholz added.

Current research into wearable technology in liver disease supports these possibilities. Studies of wrist-worn activity monitors have shown that reduced activity is associated with increased waitlist mortality among liver transplant candidates, as well as increased hospital admissions and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Other investigations with wearables have linked sleep disturbances to poorer post-liver transplant outcomes and explored skin patches and transdermal sensors for detecting blood alcohol levels and inflammatory markers predictive of outcomes in cirrhosis, Buckholz said.

A major barrier to widespread implementation in clinical practices is the so-called “wearable paradox,” whereby early adopters of wearable technology tend to be relatively healthy, whereas those at highest risk are less likely to already use such devices, Buckholz noted. Increasing access, understanding, and uptake in vulnerable populations will therefore be critical.

Additional challenges include determining how to distill massive volumes of wearable data into concise formats that can be incorporated into electronic medical records (EMRs) and easily communicated to patients.

From a research standpoint, Buckholz outlined several necessary steps. First, clinicians need a better understanding of which digital biomarkers are most predictive of gastrointestinal (GI) and liver disease outcomes. For example, although heart rate variability may change during sleep in patients with high-risk liver disease, it remains unclear whether these changes reliably precede clinical deterioration.

Second, clinical trials must demonstrate that acting on digital biomarkers translates into improved outcomes. Implementation research will then be needed to support long-term patient adherence and efficient data transfer to clinicians.

“Finally, we need to build practice models, whether through integration into EMR, useful and simple phone applications, or a combination, that allow communication of results back to patients and let doctors bill for the time spent dealing with these data,” Buckholz said. Incentivizing both patients and providers will also be key to ensuring sustained adoption.

Wearable technology has potential applications across gastroenterology, said Andres Duarte-Rojo, MD, professor of medicine and surgery at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, and medical director of Liver Transplantation and the Living Liver Donor  program.

AI can serve as an invaluable ally for sorting through the volumes of complex data generated by these devices, Duarte-Rojo told Medscape Medical News. He added that any patient can be a candidate for wearables.

“When tracking a generic feature that affects overall health, such as mobility/exercise or heart rate variability, any patient would benefit from it,” he said. “Cardiorespiratory fitness not only is the ultimate predictor of mortality [but also can] be informative to GI health since both low physical activity and low heart rate variability have been associated with poor outcomes in various chronic GI ailments.”

More targeted applications include monitoring of alcohol use via sweat sensors for alcohol use disorder and liver disease or detecting failed swallowing attempts in patients with dysphagia.

Provider Bottlenecks

Although patient adherence can be a challenge, Duarte-Rojo said the larger obstacle may lie on the provider side.

“For example, if you are tracking a change in voice or mobility to identify hepatic encephalopathy, you need the health IT [information technology] infrastructure to confirm the signal from the wearable is reliable, that signal needs to be filtered to identify the endpoint or event of interest, and that event needs to be displayed on a dashboard a provider can interpret,” he said.

That alert must then prompt timely clinician intervention, such as administering more lactulose or referring the patient to urgent care.

This feedback loop requires technical support, continuous monitoring of the provider's dashboard, EMR integration, and efficient patient communication to deal with responses ranging from false positives to potential life-threatening emergencies. Consequently, the use of wearables in GI care remains largely limited to research at the moment.

Looking ahead, Duarte-Rojo said calibration of devices for specific GI diseases and implementation trials demonstrating feasibility and cost-effectiveness will be crucial.

Ultimately, he said, “the benefits that wearables will bring to daily care should translate into a more efficient use of healthcare resources, such as decreased hospitalization, in order to convince third-party payers to support this nascent technology and novel healthcare paradigm.”

Buckholz disclosed receiving research funding from the Weill Cornell Clinical and Translational Science Center KL2 award and the AASLD Frank J. Tusa Pilot Award in Hepatic Encephalopathy but having no financial conflicts of interest. Duarte-Rojo disclosed having financial relationships with CIMA Sciences, LLC.

For foreign graduates who completed their degree abroad and want to practice medicine in Argentina, the first step is to obtain residency status (temporary or permanent) from the Argentine National Directorate of Migration (Dirección Nacional de Migraciones), followed by the issuance of a national identity document (Documento Nacional de Identidad). 

The next step is recognition or validation of the medical degree. If the professional comes from countries with a mutual recognition agreement, such as Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Spain, Mexico, Peru, and Ukraine, validation can be obtained through a free, remote process handled by the National Directorate of University Management (Dirección Nacional de Gestión Universitaria) of the Ministry of Human Capital (Ministerio de Capital Humano), which is the national ministry overseeing education, labor, and social policy.

This pathway was also opened to physicians from Venezuela and Syria for humanitarian reasons. However, it is not enough to present the diploma; other records or documents are required, such as copies of course syllabi, an official transcript detailing all passed courses, a certificate of the rotating internship with grades, and accreditation certificates for the quality of the program and the university.

The process typically takes 10-16 months, although Daniela, a young physician who graduated from the University of Santander in Bucaramanga, Colombia, “which has international accreditation,” was able to validate her degree in 8 months. “I paid a facilitator to handle everything. I don't remember exactly how much, but it was something like $2000-$3000,” she told Medscape's Spanish edition. 

For those from other countries without agreements, the degree must be revalidated through national universities that offer medical training. This commonly involves taking some equivalency exams and a comprehensive general medicine exam (in addition to submitting the other documentation required for validation). The process can take 18-36 months.

The final step to practice involves obtaining a license (matrícula), processed through the National Ministry of Health or provincial medical councils. Requirements include a validated or revalidated degree, a certificate of no criminal record in Argentina, and proof of a unique labor identification code or tax identification code assigned by the National Social Security Administration (Administración Nacional de la Seguridad Social).

For those who want to complete a medical specialty residency in the country, the requirements are the same, with the sole exception that validation or revalidation may be “in process” at the time of taking the exam. Since 2025, the exam has become more competitive for foreign graduates, because those who complete their entire degree in the country receive five additional points in the placement ranking — although this does not prevent many foreign graduates from passing. 

For foreign nationals who studied and graduated as physicians in Argentina, the legal situation for practicing in the country is practically the same as for Argentine colleagues, without requiring additional homologation.

Finally, recognition of a medical specialty obtained in another country for physicians who have validated or revalidated their degree depends on the type of training. If the specialty was granted by a recognized foreign university, it is processed through the Ministry of Health via the remote procedures platform, Trámites a Distancia. If the training was completed outside a university setting (for example, via a hospital residency), applicants must present their credentials and often take a theoretical-practical exam to certify their competencies before recognized scientific societies.

Home spirometry showed promise in diagnosing asthma, with nearly 80% of patients receiving a diagnosis within 2-4 weeks. Two days of positive diurnal variability in forced expiratory volume or peak expiratory flow significantly improved diagnosis.

""The findings of this study support the integration of home spirometry into routine diagnostic workflows in primary care as a complementary tool to enhance the accuracy of asthma diagnosis,"" the authors wrote. ""This streamlined approach has the potential to expedite the diagnostic process with use of remote home spirometry system, allowing individuals experiencing asthma symptoms to receive more timely treatment and then to later undergo in-office procedures like BDR [bronchodilator responsiveness testing] to get more detailed information on the severity of bronchial obstruction,"" they added.

This study was led by Lynnea Myers, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on December 26, 2025, in npj Primary Care Respiratory Medicine.

This study was performed in a single region in Sweden, which may have limited the generalisability of the findings. Variability in doctors' diagnostic expertise in diagnosing asthma and the lack of specialised training may have affected the diagnostic accuracy. This study did not utilise certain diagnostic tests, such as blood eosinophil counts and bronchial challenge tests, which are typically performed in secondary care settings.

This study was funded by Vinnova, ALF medicine of Region Stockholm, and the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation. Myers reported receiving funding from Forte Sweden. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

A single-institution US study in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global has reported a steady rise in emergency department (ED) visits for food-induced allergic reactions (FIR) in infants — likely reflecting current guidelines on earlier food allergen introduction. Infants had more than twice the odds of experiencing FIR in the post-guideline era.

As adoption of the new recommendations expands, families and caretakers need guidance in the event of food reactions, according to researchers from the Division of Pediatric Allergy/Immunology and Rheumatology at UCLA School of Medicine. While the early-introduction recommendations decrease the risk for food allergies later in life, the authors of the brief report, led by Aaron T. Chin, MD, stressed that a proportion of children will be already sensitized and clinically reactive at the time of the first feed.

“Based on our clinical experience, we suspected that rates of [ED] visits for infants would be increasing,” co-author Maria I. Garcia Lloret, MD, told Medscape Medical News. “As allergists, we receive regular referrals for infants experiencing food reactions, many times with an associated [ED] visit, and our study's findings were in line with our experience in the clinic.”

Though national guidelines now recommend early introduction of allergenic foods to young children, whether these have affected ED encounters was poorly understood. To fill that knowledge gap, the study compared pediatric ED encounters at UCLA for FIR, including food-induced anaphylaxis (FIA), during the pre- and post-guideline periods, 2013-2016 and 2022-2024.

The retrospective analysis of 67,059 ED visits identified 350 visits for FIR and 182 for FIA in patients age-stratified into two groups: infants 0-1 year and children 2-5 years. Overall, both FIR and FIA annual rates increased significantly over time. In infants the odds ratios (OR) of increase were 1.15 (P = .005) and 1.27 (P = .002), respectively. In multivariate analysis, post-guideline infants had an OR of 2.21 (95% CI, 1.37-3.55).

No significant change was observed in the 2- to 5-year group. Older children were more likely to have been evaluated by an allergist and prescribed epinephrine, with their caregivers educated on recognizing and managing allergic reactions, Garcia Lloret said. “These may constitute protective factors likely to avert [ED] visits.”

Compared with the pre-guideline period, annual FIR visit rates among infants aged 0-1 year rose significantly: OR, 1.111 per year (95% CI, 1.056-1.169; P < .001). FIR rates remained stable in children aged 2-5 years (OR, 1.019 per year; 95% CI, 0.974-1.065; P = .419).

For the more serious FIA, rates in infants rose from 8.5 to 38.9 per 10,000, for a 358% increase. In terms of refractory anaphylaxis, rates did not change significantly in either infants or older children.

The study also examined covariates affecting FIR, including preexisting eczema, sex, race, under-represented minority status, prior allergy visits, and prior epinephrine prescription. In study infants, FIR predicted preexisting eczema (OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 2.35-6.07).

In the older age group, FIR was associated with male sex (OR, 1.54, 95% CI, 1.01-2.34), eczema (OR, 1.87; CI, 1.19-2.95), prior allergy visits (OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 2.64-7.61), and preexisting epinephrine prescription (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.40-4.69). “Our study was not able, however, to correlate the severity of eczema with the likelihood of reaction,” Garcia Lloret said.

Her center has now implemented an educational tool to guide families on the early introduction of allergenic foods, including the recognition and management of food reactions. “These have been distributed to our primary care offices and shared with families during infant well-child checks,” she said.

Commenting on the study but not involved in it, Ruchi S. Gupta, MD, MPH, director of the Institute for Public Health and Medicine - Center for Food Allergy & Asthma and a professor of pediatrics at Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, said the findings make sense. “If families are introducing allergens earlier, then more reactions are also occurring in the first year of life, with more [ED] visits,” she said.

“Normally these reactions would have happened later when the child tried the food. We need to better identify the infants who are already allergic by understanding the true risk factors in addition to eczema,” she added.

Is it possible that early-introduction guidelines have been implemented too hastily? No, said Gupta. “The data from the 2015 LEAP study showed an 80% decrease in food allergy incidence in high-risk infants who started eating peanuts early. These data were so strong that we made recommendations for all infants.”

Added Garcia-Lloret, “Aside from children with severe eczema and/or known food allergy, for whom we recommend allergist consultation, common allergens can be introduced to infants early. However, parents should receive the proper guidance on what to expect.”

In otherwise normal infants, exposure to a food to which they are already sensitized will result in a mild urticarial rash that can be managed with antihistamines and at-home monitoring. “However, more severe reactions involving the respiratory or gastrointestinal systems can occur. This raises the concern for anaphylaxis and parents should also be educated on proper emergency care such as calling 911,” she said.

Gupta added that the development of an eight-food introduction study is currently underway to learn more about factors influencing early sensitization and allergy. “These factors include the microbiome, genetics, eczema, and the environment.”

More families are introducing egg and peanut early, but once you introduce a food you must keep it in the diet, two to three times a week ideally, Gupta said. “Also, use a barrier cream around the mouth when introducing so there's no contact dermatitis, which can be mistaken for an allergic reaction.” Finally, introduce foods you eat in your family diet.

As to unanswered questions, Gupta asked “Does increased diversity in the first year of life of other common allergens prevent those allergies as well? If we protect the skin barrier early can we prevent the atopic march?”

Future studies should evaluate guideline adoption, parental guidance, and the long-term impact of early allergen introduction and whether guidance for high-risk infants reduces ED utilization, the authors wrote. Fortunately, despite these overall rising visit rates, those for food-induced refractory anaphylactic reactions remained stable.

This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Center for Advancing Translational Science UCLA. The authors declared no conflicts of interest. Gupta reported receiving funds from Food Allergy Research and Education.

For millions living with nerve pain, even a light touch can feel unbearable. Scientists have long suspected that damaged nerve cells falter because their energy factories known as mitochondria don't function properly.

Now research published in Nature suggests a way forward: supplying healthy mitochondria to struggling nerve cells.  

Using human tissue and mouse models, researchers at Duke University School of Medicine found that replenishing mitochondria significantly reduced pain tied to diabetic neuropathy and chemotherapy-induced nerve damage. In some cases, the relief lasted up to 48 hours.  

Instead of masking symptoms, the approach could fix what the team sees as the root problem - restoring the energy flow that keeps nerve cells healthy and resilient.

By giving damaged nerves fresh mitochondria - or helping them make more of their own - we can reduce inflammation and support healing. This approach has the potential to ease pain in a completely new way.""  

Ru-Rong Ji, PhD, study's senior author, director of the Center for Translational Pain Medicine in the Department of Anesthesiology at Duke School of Medicine

Their findings build on growing evidence that cells can swap mitochondria, a process that scientists are beginning to recognize as a built-in support system that may affect many conditions including obesity, cancer, stroke, and chronic pain.

The work highlights a previously undocumented role for satellite glial cells, which appear to deliver mitochondria to sensory neurons through tiny channels called tunnelling nanotubes.

When this mitochondrial handoff is disrupted, Ji said, nerve fibers begin to degenerate - triggering pain, tingling and numbness, often in the hands and feet, the distal ends of the nerve fibers.

""By sharing energy reserves, satellite glial cells may help keep neurons out of pain,"" said Ji, a professor of anesthesiology, neurobiology and cell biology at Duke School of Medicine. 

When this energy transfer was boosted, pain behaviors in mice dropped by as much as 50%, the study showed.

Researchers also tried a more direct approach. Injecting isolated mitochondria whether from humans or mice directly into the dorsal root ganglia, a cluster of nerve cells that send messages to the brain, produced similar results, but only when the donor mitochondria were healthy; samples from people with diabetes had no effect.

The team also identified a protein, MYO10, as essential for forming the nanotubes that enable the mitochondrial transfer.

Ji, worked with lead author Jing Xu, PhD, a research scholar in the Department of Anesthesiology, along with longtime collaborator Caglu Eroglu, PhD, a Duke professor of cell biology known for her expertise in glial cell behavior.

More work is needed, including high-resolution imaging to confirm precisely how nanotubes help deliver fresh mitochondria in living nerve tissue.

Even so, the study highlights a previously overlooked communication pathway between nerve and glial cells that could treat chronic pain at its source.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Genetic study reveals how DNA repeats expand with age","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260107/Genetic-study-reveals-how-DNA-repeats-expand-with-age.aspx","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 18:18:00 GMT","

An analysis of genetic data from over 900,000 people shows that certain stretches of DNA, made up of short sequences repeated over and over, become longer and more unstable as we age. The study found that common genetic variants can speed up or slow down this process by up to fourfold, and that certain expanded sequences are linked to serious diseases including kidney failure and liver disease.

More than 60 inherited disorders are caused by expanded DNA repeats: repetitive genetic sequences that grow longer over time. These include devastating conditions like Huntington's disease, myotonic dystrophy, and certain forms of ALS. Most people carry DNA repeats that gradually expand throughout their lives, but this instability and what genetic factors control it hadn't been fully analyzed within large biobanks. This study demonstrates that DNA repeat expansion is far more widespread than previously recognized and identifies dozens of genes that regulate this process, opening new avenues for developing treatments that could slow disease progression.

Researchers from UCLA, the Broad Institute, and Harvard Medical School analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 490,416 UK Biobank participants and 414,830 All of Us Research Program participants. They developed new computational methods to detect and measure DNA repeat lengths and instability from standard sequencing data. The team examined 356,131 polymorphic repeat locations across the genome, tracking how repeat lengths changed with age in blood cells and identifying genetic variants that influenced expansion rates. They also searched for links between repeat expansions and thousands of disease outcomes to discover previously unknown disease associations.

Common DNA repeats in blood cells expand as people age. The researchers identified 29 genetic locations where inherited variants modified DNA repeat expansion rates, with effects varying up to fourfold between individuals with the highest and lowest genetic risk scores. Interestingly, the same DNA repair genes had opposite effects on different repeats: variants that stabilized some repeats destabilized others. The study also discovered that expansions in the GLS gene which have a prevalence around 0.03% were associated with 14-fold higher risk of severe kidney disease and 3-fold higher risk of liver diseases, representing a newly recognized repeat expansion disorder.

The findings establish blood-based DNA repeat measurements as potential biomarkers for testing future therapies aimed at slowing repeat expansion in diseases like Huntington's. The research team's computational tools can now be applied to other large biobank datasets to discover additional unstable repeats and disease associations. Understanding why the same genetic modifiers have opposite effects on different repeats will require detailed mechanistic studies of how DNA repair processes vary across cell types and genetic contexts. The discovery of GLS repeat-associated kidney and liver disease suggests additional unrecognized repeat expansion disorders may be lurking in biobank data, waiting to be found.

""We found that most human genomes contain repeat elements that expand as we age,"" said Margaux L. A. Hujoel, PhD, lead author of the study and assistant professor in the Departments of Human Genetics and Computational Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""The strong genetic control of this expansion, with some individuals' repeats expanding four times faster than others, points to opportunities for therapeutic intervention. These naturally occurring genetic modifiers show us which molecular pathways could be targeted to slow repeat expansion in disease.""

The Kansas City Current has announced former United States men's national team midfielder Chris Armas as its new head coach.

The appointment marks Armas' first role in professional women's soccer following a coaching career spanning nearly two decades in Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Premier League.  The 53-year-old previously spent four years as head of women's soccer at Adelphi University between 2011 and 2014.

He succeeds Vlatko Andonovski at the Current, after the club announced in November that the former USWNT coach would transition from the role of head coach and sporting director into a new position as the global sporting director.

Armas has been out of management since he departed the Colorado Rapids in November following two seasons in charge.

“From the talented group of players, the facilities and passionate fan base, this club represents a world-class environment,” Armas said in a club statement. “Above all, it's the culture and the people that impressed me most. I'm inspired by the shared vision of the ownership and staff, and I will do everything I can to help make the KC Current the best women's football club in the world.”

Armas retired in 2007 following a decorated playing career with the LA Galaxy and the Chicago Fire. He was named in the MLS Best XI five times and won the MLS Cup with the Chicago Fire. He also made 66 appearances with the USMNT between 1998 and 2005.

He began his coaching career as an assistant at Chicago Fire before taking the role at Adelphi University in 2011.

Armas won a Supporters' Shield with the New York Red Bulls in 2018, stepping up from his role as assistant during the season after Jesse Marsch left for RB Leipzig. This was followed by an 11-game spell in charge of Toronto FC in 2021.

He then went on to serve as an assistant at Manchester United under Ralf Rangnick during the 2021-22 Premier League season and with Leeds United briefly under Marsch in 2023.

“Chris brings a wealth of experience that will be invaluable for our organization,” Andonovski added. “His passion for the game is evident, as is his commitment to his players and his winning mindset.”

Armas follows Nick Cushing in moving from MLS to the NWSL, with Cushing named as expansion side Denver Summit's head coach in August following two years with New York City FC and an interim spell at Manchester City Women.

The Current finished top of the NWSL during the 2025 regular season but were beaten by the eventual champions and lowest-seeded team, Gotham FC, in the quarterfinals of the playoffs.

Analysis from soccer news writer Melanie Anzidei

Armas has lived many lives, from being one of the best defensive midfielders in U.S. men's soccer to coaching collegiate women's soccer and varying stints with six clubs over a 17-year managerial career. Now, he'll take on a very different challenge: leading the Kansas City Current after a historic 2025 season.

It's clear the Current were looking for some semblance of change in their next head coach, opting for one most recently in MLS rather than leaning in-house for Andonovski's replacement.

The Current ended 2025 as one of the best teams the NWSL has ever seen. They won the Shield in record time and closed the year with 21 more points and nine more wins than the second-best Washington Spirit. The team's season, though, ended in heartbreak, after losing in the quarterfinal to eight-seed Gotham FC — the eventual 2025 champions.

Leading the Current after such a historic year will be no easy task, with expectations high and generational players like Temwa Chawinga returning in 2026 from injury. Armas is also entering the locker room with 2025 still fresh on everyone's minds — especially with his official hiring coming on the same day as Brazilian forward Bia Zaneratto, a contender for 2025 NWSL MVP, announced her departure from the Current to re-join Palmeiras.

It's curious, too, whether Armas' extensive resume on the USMNT played even a small role in his attractiveness for the Current, at least from a marketing perspective. We are, after all, in a men's World Cup year, with Kansas City set to host six matches at nearby Arrowhead.","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

World Cup

FIFA has announced it will use artificial intelligence to improve the accuracy of semi-automated offside decisions at next summer's World Cup – one of a series of new AI features set to be introduced at the tournament.

World football's governing body's technology partner, Lenovo, will make an “AI-enabled 3D avatar” of every player participating in the finals, allowing the existing offside technology to track players in-game “during fast or obscured movements”.

In a joint-statement with Lenovo, FIFA described the move as “a significant development in semi-automated offside technology”.

“Players participating in the upcoming global showpiece will be digitally scanned to create a precise 3D model,” explained the release. “Each scan takes approximately one second and captures highly accurate body-part dimensions, allowing the system to track players reliably during fast or obstructed movements.”

FIFA claimed the move would also improve understanding of offside calls for fans in the stadiums and television viewers, saying: “The 3D models will be incorporated into the host broadcast, enabling offside decisions determined by the video assistant referee (VAR) system to be displayed more realistically and in a more engaging way to fans at stadiums and to viewers around the world.”

The technology was trialled at last year's Intercontinental Cup, where the players of Flamengo and Pyramids FC were scanned before their meeting in December.

FIFA said the test was a success, “demonstrating its capability and readiness to support the match officials at the World Cup”.

Semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) has already been used at two World Cups (Qatar 2022 and the 2023 women's tournament in Australia and New Zealand), and is a tool for the VAR that automates key elements of the offside decision-making process in a bid to speed it up.

These key elements are the “kick-point” (the exact time the ball was played) and the positioning of the relevant defender and attacker. AI builds a better picture of the decision through multiple cameras tracking different body points on each player, and with the system connecting to the match ball.

FIFA also announced that every team at the tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico will have access to Lenovo's “generative AI knowledge assistant”, which uses millions of data points to simulate “text, video, graphs and 3D visualisations”. The tool could be used, for example, to show a team's last ten corner kicks.

Nations will have access to the tool before and after games but not during matches in a bid to level the playing field between opponents at the first 48-team World Cup – where tournament debutants including Curacao and Cape Verde will be competing with traditional heavyweights such as Brazil, Germany and France.

“At the highest level of the game, access to sophisticated analysis often depends on the financial and technical resources at a team's disposal,” FIFA's statement read. “Football AI Pro seeks to address this imbalance, with all of the 48 competing teams at global football's premier event set to benefit from the same advanced pre- and post-match analytical capabilities.”

After a successful trial at last summer's Club World Cup, FIFA will also use AI to stabilise and improve the footage from referee cams at the tournament, which it said would improve transparency and the viewing experience for television audiences.

At Lenovo Tech Day 2026 during CES, Motorola unveiled its first book-style foldable, the Razr Fold, alongside the new Motorola Signature. That wasn't all, though. Here's a look at the other announcements from the event.

Motorola unveiled the Razr 60 FIFA World Cup 26 Edition, a limited-edition model for FIFA fans. The clamshell foldable features a soft textured rear panel with patterns associated with the FIFA World Cup.

It is available in a green color option, while offering the same specs as the standard Razr 60. Users will also get custom wallpapers, a FIFA theme ringtone, and a FIFA watermark for photos.

The phone will be only available in the US and Canada starting February 12. It is priced at $700.

Next, the new Moto Watch introduces Motorola's partnership with Polar for fitness and health tracking. The smartwatch comes with a 1.43-inch circular OLED display that's protected by Gorilla Glass 3. It gets a PPG sensor, Bluetooth 5.3, dual-frequency GPS, and offers an IP68 rating.

The watch is available in aluminum finishes with a stainless steel crown and Pantone-color watch bands. It is claimed to deliver up to 13 days of battery life without an always-on display. It offers continuous heart-rate tracking, sleep insights, and supports multiple workout modes.

The Moto Watch will be available in select markets across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Oceania, with stainless steel, silicone, or soft-luxe band options.

Motorola also unveiled the Sound Flow, a portable Bluetooth speaker featuring Sound by Bose. It packs a 20W woofer, a 10W tweeter, and dual passive radiators, with support for Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 5, and UWB. The speaker is IP67-rated and houses a 6,000mAh battery, claimed to offer up to 12 hours of playback.

The Sound Flow sports a twill-textured fabric finish, comes in Pantone Carbon and Pantone Warm Taupe colors, and includes capacitive touch controls.

Motorola also introduced the Moto Pen Ultra and the Moto Tag 2 at the event.

The Moto Pen Ultra features a 1.4mm tip, Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, and a 6-axis motion sensor. It comes with a USB Type-C charging case, carries an IP55 rating, weighs just 4.7g, and is claimed to deliver sub-5ms latency.

Motorola's updated Tag 2 is powered by UWB, Bluetooth channel sounding, and the Find Hub network. It carries an IP68 rating and is claimed to deliver up to 500 days of battery life with a user-replaceable battery. The Tag 2 also includes a button that can be used to locate a paired device or act as a remote camera shutter.

Lastly, the company announced Qira, a unified AI assistant jointly developed by Lenovo and Motorola, and showcased an AI Perceptive Companion proof of concept dubbed Project Maxwell.

According to Motorola, Qira is built to deliver a seamless, cross-device AI experience, making it easier for users to switch between apps, AI tools, and hardware. It brings together Motorola and Lenovo AI offerings such as moto AI, Lenovo AI Now, Creator Zone, and Learning Zone under a single platform.

Qira is positioned as a system-level, context-aware AI that can be activated using the “Hey, Qira” wake phrase, a dedicated hardware key, or a persistent on-screen pill. Motorola says Qira will roll out to select Lenovo devices in Q1 2026, followed by Motorola devices at a later date.

Meanwhile, Project Maxwell, developed by Motorola's 312 Labs, explores new ways to bring AI into everyday use. It is a wearable accessory with a camera and a mic that integrates with Qira and can continuously process visual, audio, and environmental data to deliver real-time, context-aware insights.

It is powered by Multimodal Perception Fusion and Natural Language Interaction and Intention Capture technologies.

Not a bad design but it would be very tacky to own 

I can't even view my team in the World Cup because of how late the fixtures are in my local time. I'll literally be in bed at 11pm on a working day. Just how it is, I suppose. So the excitement is literally zero.

So they release a soccer-themed phone in 2 countries that have the least people interested in soccer? Ok... 
 
Also that ""wearable AI"" thingy is beyond scary

CES 2026 is underway, and it's the best platform around for making a big announcement. Motorola took the opportunity to announce the new Motorola Razr Fold, but that's not the only new product they are bringing to the market. The company also has new products, including the FIFA World Cup 26 Edition Razr, the Moto Tag 2, the Moto Watch, and the Moto Pen Ultra.

The FIFA World Cup is being held in the US this year, and Motorola is commemorating the occasion with a special-edition Razr phone. The FIFA World Cup 26 Edition Razr features a pattern on the back based on the tournament logo. The colors used symbolize growth and renewal, and it looks pretty good with the vegan leather finish.

On the inside, the FIFA World Cup 26 Edition Razr is identical to the Razr (2025), but curiously not the more powerful Razr Plus (2025) or the Razr Ultra (2025). Motorola has added exclusive wallpapers and ringtones to set the special-edition phone apart, and you also get a FIFA watermark that can be used when clicking photos. Like other Motorola phones, this one will also benefit from the Moto AI improvements.

Truth behind €150m transfer rumours linking Blues with Real Madrid superstar revealed","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/will-chelsea-sign-vincius-jr-truth-behind-150m-transfer-rumours-real-madrid/bltf2f54c74f2b88109","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:11:52 GMT","

The truth behind a proposed €150 million (£130m/$175m) bid from Chelsea for Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior has been revealed after reports the Premier League giants were planning a mammoth offer for the Brazil star ahead of the January transfer window, amid claims he is unsettled in the Spanish capital since head coach Xabi Alonso's arrival back at his old club.

Vinicius Jr's Real Madrid future has been up in the air for the best part of a year, with contract negotiations over a new deal still at a standstill. The 25-year-old's current terms expire in 2027, with plenty of reports linking him with a big-money move to Saudi Arabia. Many eagle-eyed fans have picked up on his words and movements on social media ahead of a possible switch to the Middle East. Most recently, the winger was booed by supporters on Los Blancos' return from the winter break, only further fuelling exit rumours. Outlets in Spain have jumped on the hostility, suggesting Chelsea are ready to make a major statement of intent to Europe by bringing the 2024 Ballon d'Or runner-up to Stamford Bridge. The Blues are undergoing a huge change, sacking Enzo Maresca and replacing him with Strasbourg head coach Liam Rosenior. The reports claim one of his first major moves would be tabling a €125m-plus-€25m-in-add-ons offer for Vini Jr.

Despite the excitement of the rumours, transfer guru Fabrizio Romano has shut down the claims. Taking to YouTube, he claimed: ""Reports on Vinicius Jr and Chelsea are completely wide of the mark. No talks, no bid, no negotiations. Vini Jr remains completely focused on Real Madrid, contract situation to be assessed."" The news will come as a huge disappointment to fans of the London club, but the Blues do not have a shortage of wingers at their disposal as they embark on a new era under Rosenior.

Madrid won their first game back from the winter break in style. A 5-1 thrashing of Real Betis was a statement of intent from Los Blancos, who are chasing down Barcelona in La Liga. That win was without talisman Kylian Mbappe, although Vini Jr did not get on the scoresheet. In fact, the Brazilian was taken off after fading in the match, prompting boos and jeers from the expectant Bernabeu crowd.

However, manager Alonso came to the defence of his struggling forward, despite having a public falling out with him earlier in the campaign. Speaking after the game, he said: ""It was an important and well-deserved win to start the year at home. It's important to start like this: calmly and with good feelings heading into the Super Cup. I value the victory in terms of La Liga. Barcelona won yesterday, and we have to win a lot of games. It was the last match of the first half of the season, and we've already reached 45 points. That would put us at 90 in La Liga. The average has to be winning many games in the remaining fixtures. The pace is going to be intense for what's to come. From tomorrow onwards, we're only thinking about the Super Cup.""

Vini Jr's future is still unresolved. With the likes of Mbappe, Rodrygo and several other emerging stars claiming plenty of minutes this season, there is certainly no guarantee that the Brazil icon will remain at his current club. With his contract ticking down to its final 12 months in the summer, Madrid may be forced to take a cut-price fee for one of their most valuable assets. Of course, Vini Jr could opt to extend his contract, albeit likely on the club's terms rather than his own. However, if he doesn't, perhaps then it would make more sense for a club like Chelsea to enter the race for his signature, although they would likely face some heavy competition from others.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The honors, presented by actors union SAG-AFTRA, will air live on Netflix on March 1.

	The nominations for the 2026 SAG Awards, now known as the Actor Awards, have been revealed.


One Battle After Another leads this year's film nominations with seven nods, including one for best stunt ensemble. Sinners scored the second-most nominations of any film with five nods, again including a stunt ensemble nod, followed by three-time nominees Frankenstein, Hamnet and Marty Supreme. Frankenstein is the only one of the latter three films to land a stunt nod.




Frankenstein, Hamnet, Marty Supreme, One Battle After Another and Sinners are all nominated for the SAG Awards‘ top prize of best cast.

	On the TV side, The Studio scored the most nominations with five nods, followed by Adolescence and The White Lotus with four apiece. None of those titles were nominated for stunts.


	The best comedy series ensemble nominees are Abbott Elementary, The Bear, Hacks, Only Murders in the Building and The Studio.


	The best drama series ensemble nominees are The Diplomat, Landman, The Pitt, Severance and The White Lotus.


Heated Rivalry‘s Connor Storrie and Abbott Elementary‘s Janelle James announced the nominees for the film and TV acting awards, presented by actors union SAG-AFTRA, in a livestream that aired on Netflix's YouTube channel.


	In addition to this year's competitive awards, Harrison Ford is set to receive this year's life achievement award.


	The SAG Awards rebranded as the Actor Awards in November with showrunner Jon Brockett and JoBeth Williams, the actress and chair of SAG-AFTRA's Awards Committee calling the change, in a joint statement, “a perfect next step in the show's evolution.”

	











	In a Q&A explaining the move, Brockett and Williams elaborated on the reason for the change.


	“Since the show started over 30 years ago, our iconic statuette has always been called The Actor, and simply evolving the show's name to align with the award itself made obvious sense,” they said. “We wanted to provide clearer recognition in terms of what the show is about for our domestic and global audiences — we honor actors in film and television. Laser-focusing the name on those two things became the clearest and most straightforward path for this new chapter of the show.”


	James also quipped of the new moniker ahead of Wednesday's announcement, “Like thousands of actors, they've changed the name.”


	Wednesday's nominations were announced a year after the Palisades and Eaton fires began raging through Los Angeles. 


	Speaking of the anniversary ahead of the announcement, SAG-AFTRA president Sean Astin said in part, “So many of us were affected, but I'm so proud of our industry for coming together at this difficult time.”


	Last year, Conclave won the SAG Awards' top film prize of best cast while Timothee Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) and Demi Moore (The Substance) won best actor and actress respectively and Kieran Culkin and Zoe Saldaña took the supporting awards. On the TV side, Shogun nabbed the best TV ensemble drama award while Only Murders in the Building won best comedy ensemble. While Culkin and Saldaña would repeat their wins at the 2025 Oscars, Anora, which dominated last year's Oscars, was surprisingly shut out at last year's SAG Awards.

	











	The 2026 Actor Awards are set to stream live on Netflix from the Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall in Los Angeles on Sunday, March 1.


	A complete list of the 2026 Actor Awards nominees follows.

UPDATED with more details, full list of nominees: The Actor Awards, the new name of the SAG-AFTRA's SAG Awards, unveiled nominations for its 2026 edition on Wednesday. Check out the full list of nominees below.


	The marquee Motion Picture Ensemble category features a who's who of what's been leading the awards-season conversation so far: Netflix‘s Frankenstein, Focus Features' Hamnet, A24's Marty Supreme and the Warner Bros duo One Battle After Another and Sinners.


	A total of 15 categories — six in motion pictures, nine in TV — are up for grabs including in the Best Actor movie race, where Marty Supreme star Timothée Chalamet is up again after winning last year's SAG Award for playing Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. He will be up this time against One Battle‘s Leonardo DiCaprio, Blue Moon‘s Ethan Hawke, Sinners‘ Michael B. Jordan and Bugonia‘s Jesse Plemons.

	In the Best Actress movie race, the nominees are Hamnet‘s Jessie Buckley, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You's Rose Byrne, Song Sung Blue‘s Kate Hudson, One Battle‘s Chase Infinity and Bugonia‘s Emma Stone.


	This marks the latest and largest Hollywood guild to weigh in on the movie awards season, which has been dominated so far by the 1-2 punch of Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another and Ryan Coogler's Sinners, both from Warner Bros. One Battle, which is coming off a Best Picture win at Sunday's Critics Choice Awards, leads all films today with seven individual noms, followed by Sinners with five. It gave Warners a leading 13 noms overall, followed by Focus with six and A24 with four.

	











	Last year, Conclave won the Ensemble price on its way to eight Oscar nominations including for Best Picture.


	On the TV side, Apple TV's The Studio, the reigning Emmy comedy champ, leads all Actors nominees with five, including an Ensemble nom along with ABC's Abbott Elementary, Hulu's The Bear, HBO Max's Hacks and last year's defending comedy champion Hulu's Only Murders in the Building.


	In Drama Ensemble, the nominees are Netflix's The Diplomat, Paramount+'s Landman, HBO Max's The Pitt which won the Emmy in the category, Apple TV's Severance and HBO's The White Lotus. Last year, Shōgun swept through the field.


	There's no Actors Awards category for limited series ensemble, but Netflix's Emmy champ Adolescence picked up four individual noms today, for Owen Cooper, Stephen Graham, Erin Doherty and Christine Tremarco.


Abbott Elementary‘s Janelle James and Heated Rivalry‘s Connor Storrie handled the announcement this morning which streamed live on Netflix.

The Lowdown will return for another go-round. FX has renewed Sterlin Harjo's acclaimed drama starring Ethan Hawke for a second season.


	The first season of The Lowdown, which follows the gritty exploits of citizen journalist and self-proclaimed “truthstorian” Lee Raybon (Hawke), premiered earlier this year. Production on season 2 will begin in Tulsa this spring.


	In The Lowdown, Hawke's Lee Raybon's obsession with the truth is always getting him into trouble. While Lee's no idealist, he's fiercely committed to exposing corruption and unearthing the city's hidden rot, even when it puts him at risk. In season one, the publication of Lee's latest exposé – a deep dive into the powerful Washberg family – is immediately followed by the suspicious suicide of Dale Washberg, and Lee knows he's stumbled onto something big. Following a trail of breadcrumbs Dale has left behind, urging someone to dig deeper into the circumstances surrounding his death, Lee does just that.

	The series will be recognized at this week's AFI Awards as one of the top 10 TV shows of 2025.


The Lowdown is created by Harjo, who executive produces with Garrett Basch, Ethan Hawke, Ryan Hawke and Duffy Boudreau. The Lowdown is produced by FX Productions with all episodes currently available to stream on Hulu.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Paramount Pictures has acquired the bestselling Recovery Agent book series by Janet Evanovich for feature development as a potential starring vehicle for Gal Gadot, Deadline has learned.


	Paramount will develop and produce the project alongside Carol Mendelsohn and Julie Weitz under their Carol Mendelsohn Productions banner. Gadot and partner Jaron Varsano will also produce under their Pilot Wave banner. Gadot comes to the project after working with Skydance, pre Skydance-Paramount merger, on the chart-topping 2023 Netflix spy thriller Heart of Stone.


	Evanovich's books center on Gabriela Rose, a globe-trotting recovery agent who specializes in retrieving stolen or lost high-value items, typically under dangerous circumstances. Paired with her unpredictable ex-husband and partner Rafer Burke, she bounces from tropical islands to international hotspots, outsmarting criminals, rival treasure hunters, and law enforcement alike in the pursuit of the goods.

					By The Deadline Team 




Deadline announced Wednesday that Mike Fleming Jr., the entertainment news site's longtime Co-Editor-In-Chief and head of the film department, will be transitioning to a new role as the brand's Editor-at-Large, marking the next chapter in his extraordinary career.


Nellie Andreeva, Deadline's current Co-Editor-In-Chief and head of the TV department, has been named sole Editor-in-Chief. She will have full oversight of the newsroom and day-to-day editorial operations across the site's divisions in Los Angeles, New York and London. 


	In his new position, Fleming will leverage his relationships and expertise as one of the industry's most prominent news-breakers to continue shaping Deadline's influence within the entertainment world.

	Andreas Wiseman, Executive Editor of International and Strategy, and Anthony D'Alessandro, Editorial Director, along with Justin Kroll, Deadline's Film Editor, will continue in their roles overseeing the news site's prominent film coverage.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Mike's contributions to Deadline and his influence on the industry are immeasurable,” said Jay Penske, Chairman and CEO of Penske Media Corporation. “His deep industry access, grit, and passion for Deadline have helped solidify its position as the industry's leading breaking news outlet. I know he will continue to have great impact on Deadline's bright future.”


	Said Andreeva: “It's been an honor to lead Deadline's top-notch editorial team alongside Mike for the past 12 years. I'm happy that his voice will continue to be part of the fabric of Deadline as we remain focused on journalistic excellence and breaking big Hollywood stories.”  

	











	Fleming and Andreeva were part of the original editorial team at Deadline alongside founder Nikki Finke, joining in early 2010 after the site's acquisition by Penske Media Corporation predecessor MMC. They were later named Co-Editors-In-Chief following Finke's departure in 2013.


	Before joining Deadline, Fleming spent 20 years at Variety as a reporter, writer and columnist.


	“16 years ago, almost to the day, I shook hands with Jay Penske on a Sunday night at Scalinatella on East 61st Street and ended a 20-year run at Variety,” Fleming said. “A lifelong print reporter joined the digital age, and the following morning, I found out Sam Raimi had scrapped Spider-Man 4. I broke the story with founder Nikki Finke and was stunned by Deadline's reach when 826 comments rolled in.


	“The business was changing, and Deadline became a game changer for the business. We became the primary way that Hollywood got its news, and Deadline established itself as an industry dominant. We had a lot of fun building a culture that felt a lot like a family. After nearly 40 years breaking stories and writing profiles of top actors and filmmakers from my Long Island home, I am stepping back to allow the great team at Deadline to step forward.


	“I am writing a nonfiction book that will take me through the spring, but what we've built here at Deadline is my legacy. Rest assured, stepping back does not mean stepping away. I will continue to drop the big scoop and long-form pieces and do whatever is required to keep this great brand on top. I'm grateful to Jay and PMC that after chasing scoops so long, I can spend more time chasing grandkids.”


	Andreeva, meanwhile, brought a decade of experience from The Hollywood Reporter, where she served as TV Editor before joining Deadline.


	“Nellie is one of the hardest working journalists I've ever known,” Penske said. “She is uniquely talented, skilled and sharp and with her continued leadership as Editor-in-Chief, I know she will propel Deadline to even greater heights ensuring they remain the go-to source for Hollywood news.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Haylie Duff picks a side in sister Hilary's drama with Ashley Tisdale amid estrangement speculation","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/07/celebrity-news/haylie-duff-picks-a-side-in-sister-hilarys-drama-with-ashley-tisdale-amid-estrangement-speculation/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:51:00 GMT","

Haylie Duff is siding against her sister, Hilary Duff, amid the “Lizzie McGuire” alum's mom group drama with Ashley Tisdale.

Haylie “liked” The Cut's Instagram post promoting Tisdale's divisive essay published on New Year's Day. 

Her thumbs-up on the post could suggest that she agrees with the “High School Musical” star's message, which was headlined “Breaking Up With My Toxic Mom Group.”

Haylie, 40, and Hilary, 38, who were once inseparable, have not been photographed together since 2019 — leading fans to believe the sisters are at odds with each other. 

The “So Yesterday” singer added fuel to the fire when she admitted to struggling with “family drama” in a November 2025 interview with Rolling Stone.

It is unclear why there is tension between the two actresses, though a source told DeuxMoi that Haylie and her fiancé, Matthew Rosenberg, do not get along with Hilary's husband, Matthew Koma. 

Haylie's obvious alignment with Tisdale further suggested that she and Hilary are not on good terms. 

Tisdale recently faced backlash after describing herself in the piece as feeling “not cool enough” for the mom group, which partly includes Hilary, Mandy Moore and Meghan Trainor.

She also wrote that she felt excluded when they would not invite her to their hangouts.

Eventually, she texted the group, telling them, “This is too high school for me and I don't want to take part in it anymore.”

While Tisdale, 40, noted that she doesn't think the moms are “bad people” — except for “maybe one” —she wanted to cut them out after the “dynamic stopped being healthy and positive.”

The “Suite Life of Zack & Cody” star claimed the clique exhibited “mean girl behavior” and realized she wasn't actually part of the group when she wasn't invited to several hangouts.

On Monday, Page Six reported that Tisdale was missing from a photo from the group's getaway last October.

Tisdale was last photographed with the boujie crew in December 2024. 

After the essay went viral, Hilary's husband took a jab at Tisdale with a savage message on Tuesday night.

Koma posted a photo of himself posing the same way as Tisdale for her article with The Cut. He added a headline reading, “When You're the Most Self-Obsessed Tone Deaf Person on Earth, Other Moms Tend to Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.”

Tisdale's husband, Christopher French, inserted himself into the drama by also posting a cryptic quote to his Instagram Story that read, “It's your choice whether or not to engage.”

Hilary has yet to respond to Tisdale's accusations. 

Page Six has reached out to reps for Hilary, Haylie and Tisdale.

Today in “God, what's the point”: The great Henry Winkler is returning to television in the upcoming legal comedy Last Chance Lawyer. Now, while we'll take as much of the 80-year-old Winkler as we can get, but we'd be lying if we didn't see the news on Deadline and think, “Holy shit, are they doing a Barry Zuckerkorn show?” Alas, “those are balls” will have to go another year without becoming a catchphrase on par with “Ayyy” and “correctamundo.” (Even though “those are balls” hasn't this relevant since Arrested Development first aired in the mid-'00s.)

Still, we'd also be lying if we said that a lawyer comedy starring Winkler sounded bad. In Last Chance Lawyer, rather than the “very good” lawyer of the Bluth family, Winkler plays Howard Greenberg, a criminal defense attorney and “fierce advocate for his underdog clients,” per Deadline. That is where the characters differ most. While Howard believes no client is guiltier than the system, Barry Zuckerkorn once microwaved a Ding-Dong while it was still in its foil. Anyone for a hot ding dong?

“Dancing with the Stars” champion Robert Irwin just revealed his next move after winning the season 34 Mirrorball trophy. On January 6, the DWTS winner took to social media to share his excitement, and fans loved it. 

Irwin revealed he was about to touch down back home in Australia. This is the first time he's been back home and working since his triumphant “Dancing with the Stars” win. 

In the video, he excitedly shared, “Guys, I'm about to touch down back into Australia, and you know what that means.” To Irwin, that means jumping back into hanging out with the crocodiles. 

As Irwin talked, clips of him feeding the crocodiles at the Australia Zoo played. He chose the classic AC/DC song “Back in Black” to accompany the croc clips.

He and his extended family, which includes his sister, former “Dancing with the Stars” champion Bindi Irwin, her husband, Chandler Powell, and their mom, Terri Irwin, run the Australia Zoo. His father, the late Steve Irwin, known as the “Crocodile Hunter,” played a pivotal role in the zoo's early successes.

The latest Mirrorball champion shared that beginning January 8, he would be back at work at the zoo. “I cannot wait to see you,” Irwin gushed.

“It's been a while. It's about time,” Irwin declared. He noted, “It's going to be my first time feeding the crocodiles in about five months.” 

Irwin then joked, “What could possibly go wrong? Gonna wanna keep the cameras rolling.” 

The top comment on Irwin's Instagram post was from his mother, who wrote, “Woo-hoo!” and added a crocodile emoji. 

A fan noted, “Bro is grinning ear to ear you can tell he missed it lolll.”

Someone else joked, “Cross checking flight costs and bank balance. BRB [Be Right Back].”

Another fan commented, “And just like that Australia Zoo clientele demographic just shifted from children and families to women of every age lol.”

“Everybody knock on every piece of wood that you can,” suggested an additional fan, in a light-hearted effort to keep Irwin safe. 

On TikTok, a fan quipped, “Just don't forget where you are and try and lift one and spin it over your head.” This was surely a cute reference to his “Dancing with the Stars” moves with partner Witney Carson.

As several “Dancing with the Stars” fans noted on Irwin's posts, Carson's family is about to head to Australia for a visit. 

Fans cannot wait to see Carson and Irwin reunite and watch her sons take in the crocodiles and other animals at the Australia Zoo.

New year, new rebrand, and in the case of the Actor Awards — née the Screen Actors Guild Awards — it gets just a little confusing when the names are so similar.

The Screen Actors Guild's Actor Awards, which will stream on Netflix live March 1, revealed the first nominations under the new name on January 7. They were presented in a live stream by “Heated Rivarly” breakout/hearthrob/uncanny Russian impersonator Connor Storrie and “Abbott Elementary” star and Critics Choice Award winner Janelle James.

Per every other awards show so far this year and last month, films like “One Battle After Another” (seven nominations), “Sinners” (five nominations), “Hamnet” (three nominations), “Frankenstein” (three nominations), and “Marty Supreme” (three nomination) dominate on the film side, with familiar series like “Severance,” “The Bear,” “Abbott Elementary,” and “Hacks” popping back up on the TV side, as well as newcomers “The Studio” and “The Pitt.” (Yes, “Adolescence,” which premiered almost a year ago on Netflix, is also eligible this year and is expected to clean up.)

Speaking of film, at Tuesday night's New York Film Critics Circle Awards, Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I'd Kick You”), Wagner Moura (“The Secret Agent”), Benicio Del Toro (“One Battle After Another”), and Amy Madigan (“Weapons”) all picked up film prizes. At the Critics Choice Awards over in Los Angeles on Sunday, the top acting awards went to Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”), Timothée Chalamet (“Marty Supreme”), Jacob Elordi (“Frankenstein”), and Madigan. All these names minus Wagner Moura (don't rule him out of the international Academy) showed up on the Actor Awards list on Wednesday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:rollingstone.com","Nick Reiner's High-Powered Defense Lawyer Steps Down","https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/nick-reiner-high-powered-lawyer-steps-down-1235495230/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 18:03:30 GMT","


							By 

	Nancy Dillon



Nick Reiner lost his high-powered lawyer, Alan Jackson, on Wednesday and will now be represented by a public defender. He appeared in court in a brown jail uniform and had his arraignment postponed to Feb. 23.


	Nick stared at the courtroom gallery during the 30-minute hearing that included an extended meeting of the lawyers in the judge's chambers. When the judge asked Nick if he agreed to the change in representation, he responded: “Yeah, I agree to that.” His new public defender is Kimberly Greene.


	While details as to why Jackson could no longer represent Nick were not given, the lawyer said, “With Mr. Reiner's consent, we ask to withdraw as counsel of record… We feel we have no choice but to withdraw as counsel.”


	During a press conference after the hearing, Jackson said he wasn't able to offer more explanation but that he and his team “remain deeply, deeply committed to Nick Reiner and to his best interests.”


	“I had to withdraw as Nick Reiner's counsel, circumstances beyond our control, but more importantly, circumstances beyond Nick's control have dictated that,” Jackson said. “Sadly, it's made it impossible for us to continue our representation of Nick. I'm legally, and I'm ethically prohibited from explaining all the reasons why I know that's a question on everybody's mind. We expect the public defender to step in. They've already been appointed and very capably protect Nick Reiner's interests as he moves forward through the system.”

	











	He continued: “We know that the legal process will reveal the true facts of the circumstances surrounding this case, Nick's case. You know, a lot's been printed of late. Over the last three weeks, a lot has been printed, printed about Nick, printed about his family, printed about the circumstances. Speculation is in print on December 15, in the early morning hours, I was in New York at the time, and I got a call. Me and my team, we dropped everything, and for the last three weeks, we have devoted literally every waking hour to protecting Nick and his interests. We've investigated this matter top to bottom, back to front.”

	In a passionate final statement, Jackson offered a glimmer of insight into the case. “What we've learned, and you can take this to the bank, is that pursuant to the laws of this state, pursuant to the law in California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder.”


	Nick is accused of killing his parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, in a shocking double homicide inside the family's Los Angeles home last month.


Rob Reiner, who acted in the groundbreaking sitcom All in the Family before directing the beloved movies This is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride, was found stabbed to death along with his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, a photographer and producer, on Dec. 14, police said. LAPD Assistant Chief Dominic Choi told the city's police commission that the couple's bodies were discovered in the master bedroom of their Brentwood home.


	Choi said “information developed during the early stages of the investigation” caused officers to arrest Nick Reiner, 32, near a gas station in the Exposition Park area of downtown Los Angeles shortly after 9 p.m. that evening. The Medical Examiner later confirmed the couple died from “multiple sharp force injuries.” Nick was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, with prosecutors identifying the alleged murder weapon as a knife.


	Los Angeles County D.A. Nathan Hochman said the felony charges included the special circumstances of multiple murders with a deadly weapon, making Nick eligible for the death penalty if tried and convicted as charged. (Any trial would require that a judge first find him competent to stand trial.)

	Hochman said his office was still considering whether to seek the death penalty. Gov. Gavin Newsom currently has a moratorium on executions in California.


	Hochman declined to comment on whether Nick had a history of mental illness, separate from his admitted struggles with addiction. “If there is evidence of mental illness, it will be presented in court and in whatever detail the defense seeks to do that,” he said. Sources previously confirmed to Rolling Stone that Reiner had been treated for schizophrenia. The diagnosis was first reported by TMZ.


	Nick first appeared before a judge on Dec. 17, wearing a sleeveless blue suicide-prevention gown with a shackle around his waist. Jackson said then that it was too early to enter a plea, so the arraignment was postponed.


	“This is a devastating tragedy that has befallen the Reiner family. We all recognize that,” Jackson said in a statement outside the courthouse after the hearing. “Our hearts go out to the entire Reiner family. There are very, very complex and serious issues that are associated with this case. They need to be thoroughly but very carefully dealt with and examined.”

	











	Sources previously told Rolling Stone that the night before their slayings, Rob and Michele Reiner had asked if they could bring Nick as their guest to Conan O'Brien's holiday party. At the party, Nick was exhibiting “antisocial behavior,” including staring at people, sources said.


	Nick had a long and public history of battling drug addiction. He told People in 2016 that he was 15 when he first went to rehab. He said more than a dozen stints at recovery centers followed, and he experienced homelessness in Maine, New Jersey, and Texas. He later wrote a film script loosely based on his experience. It became the 2016 movie Being Charlie, directed by his dad.


	In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, the Reiners said they desperately tried to help their son, but navigating his care was challenging. “The program works for some people, but it can't work for everybody,” Reiner said. “When Nick would tell us that it wasn't working for him, we wouldn't listen. We were desperate, and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son.”


	Speaking to the Dopey podcast in 2018, Nick admitted he was an addict and described an incident where his drug use led to violent behavior. He recalled trashing his parents' guest house after he was “sequestered” there during a bender.


	“I went ten rounds with my guest house,” he told Dopey host Dave Manheim. “It's not much of a story. I got totally spun out on uppers. I think it was coke and something else. And I was up for days on end, and I started punching out different things in my guest house. I think I started with a TV and then I went over to a lamp and then, progressively, I just, everything in the guest house got wrecked. …I literally punched the TV.”


	Asked if he lacerated his hand, he said, “I don't even remember at this point.” The incident in 2017 led to another intervention, he said, and he ended up on a plane to Boston. He recalled having a cocaine-induced heart attack during the flight.


	Asked if he was trying to relieve tension when he destroyed the guest house, he said he couldn't “remember the specifics” of what sparked the outburst. He said his actions had “no logic.”

	The Reiners had three children together. On Dec. 17, their older son Jake, 34, and daughter Romy, 27, broke their silence to share their grief and thank supporters. “Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day. The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience,” the siblings said in the statement obtained by Rolling Stone. “They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends.”

	











	The siblings expressed gratitude for the outpouring of condolences they received. “We now ask for respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity, and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave,” they said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:rollingstone.com","This Viral 'No War Yes Peace' Remix Took Over the Internet -- Did It Push Trump to Capture Maduro?","https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/war-yes-peace-remix-trump-capture-maduro-1235494613/","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:36:38 GMT","


	Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro seemed to make a plea for peace back in October 2025, repeating a slogan that has since gone viral. During a state television broadcast, after U.S.-led missile strikes on small boats in international waters near Venezuela killed at least 87 people, he addressed Donald Trump directly.


	“Not war, not war, not war,” Maduro said at the time. “Yes peace, yes peace, yes peace, forever, forever, forever. Peace forever. No crazy war.”


	Later that month, the Dominican YouTuber Hey Santana decided to splice out that Maduro soundbite, which was already floating around social media, and remix it into a dembow track. It quickly took over the internet — and now, some political sources say it may have played a role in the U.S. operation that led to Maduro's capture and arrest on Jan. 3.


Hey Santana made the remix by setting Maduro's speech to a thumping beat and pairing the song with clips of funny dance moves in a video titled “Not War Yes Peace.” It has since amassed more than hundreds of thousands of views, with an extended edition that takes it from a minute and a half to three minutes in length.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	By November, the “No War, Yes Peace” remix had reached Maduro, who danced along to the song while welcoming Venezuelan university students at Miraflores Palace. “I was like this,” Santana tells Rolling Stone over Zoom, dropping his jaw. “I didn't know how to react!”


	At first, Santana thought someone had a video to make it look like Maduro was dancing to the song, but then he saw a CNN headline about the politician actually grooving to it. A few weeks later, the dictator danced to it again during a political rally, this time with cheers from the crowd layered in. Maduro played the song at so many events that Chavistas (or Maduro supporters) began to claim it as pro-Maduro, even though Santana made it as a parody of the president.

	











	“At one point, I was like, fuck. The people on the Chavistas' side were turning the song from a meme into a political moment in favor of Chavismo. It lost its humor. I would never support a dictator like that,” says Santana, who joined the Zoom call with Rolling Stone wearing a t-shirt printed with the image of Maduro's capture. “The song is super absurd if you really listen.”

	The track — and Maduro's dance to it — reportedly struck a nerve with Trump. Speaking to a gathering of congressional Republicans on Tuesday, Trump seemed to reference Maduro's dance moves, telling the group, per The Guardian, “He gets up there and he tries to imitate my dance a little bit.” (Trump has gone viral time and again for moving his short arms to the beat of Village People's “YMCA.”)




	“Mr. Maduro's regular public dancing and other displays of nonchalance in recent weeks helped persuade some on the Trump team that the Venezuelan president was mocking them,” a New York Times piece reported over the weekend, referencing two anonymous sources within the administration. According to that report, the White House decided to follow through on the military operation that occurred on Jan. 3. Trump announced that morning that U.S. forces had captured Maduro after a military operation in Caracas. By that afternoon, Trump stated from Mar-a-Lago that the U.S. would run the country until a “safe, proper and judicious transition.”

	The news has shocked Santana, whose song got 10,000 Shazams the day of Maduro's capture. “People have been thanking me online,” he says. “People are joking that I'm like a libertador.”


	Maduro pleaded guilty to the four charges against him, including narco-terrorism conspiracy and possession of and conspiracy to possess machine guns, during a court appearance Monday. He'll face a lengthy legal process that could come to a jury trial that could last well over a year.

      Ryan Graves testified to Congress that UAP sightings became ""an open secret"" among Navy aircrew - so routine they were part of daily briefs. New data shows 45% of pilots have witnessed UAP, yet only 5-10% report them.
    


      Why the silence? The ""aeromedical trap"": FAA regulations can classify unverified aerial observations as potential hallucinations, triggering psychiatric evaluation and career-ending grounding without pay.
    


      The recent Americans for Safe Aerospace white paper documents this systematically. When trained observers with instrument confirmation stay silent 90% of the time, we don't just have an aviation safety crisis - we have a civilizational failure to believe testimony that challenges our worldview.
    


      The question of the most convincing UFO sighting ever recorded is complex and often depends on individual belief and the nature of the evidence. However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples:
    


      Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail.
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature.
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting."" - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee.
    


      Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling.
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



Corroboration: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



Triangular Craft Sighting: [""I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/

Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy says that we have to take a step back from the alleged Minnesota fraud scandal and look at the wide scope of the federal welfare state on ‘Hannity.'

Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy revealed Wednesday that he has selected Ohio Senate President Rob McColley as his running mate in the 2026 Ohio governor's race. 

The campaign is planning a rally in Cleveland on Wednesday night to make the announcement. 

""I'm excited to announce Rob McColley as my running mate to be the next lieutenant governor of Ohio,"" Ramaswamy said in a statement. ""I'm an entrepreneur, not a politician, and selected Rob to be a governing partner who can help advance our ambitious legislative agenda."" 

""Rob is a proven conservative leader, and he is committed to my vision to make the American Dream a reality for every Ohioan,"" Ramaswamy added.

McColley, a fellow Republican, currently represents Ohio Senate District 1, which includes 11 counties in the northwestern part of the state. 

""Throughout his service in the Ohio General Assembly, McColley has earned a reputation as a principled statesman, proven leader, and effective problem-solver focused on delivering real results,"" Ramaswamy's campaign said. 

""First elected to the Ohio House of Representatives 2014, McColley was unanimously elected to serve as President of the Ohio Senate in January 2025. His record includes slashing government red tape, cutting taxes to spur economic growth, and enacting legislation to prevent a repeat of the COVID-19 shutdowns that Democrat Amy Acton advocated for (after which she quit her role as director of the Ohio Department of Health),"" the statement added.

McColley holds degrees from The Ohio State University and the University of Toledo College of Law, according to his biography on the Ohio Senate's website. 

""Before being elected State Representative, he served in the Community Improvement Corporation of Henry County, where he oversaw economic development efforts for the county and worked to improve local workforce development efforts between manufacturers and schools in Henry and Williams counties,"" it also said.

The campaign said the pair will travel across Ohio for the next 10 months ahead of November's election. 

""Ohio needs a businessman, not a bureaucrat; a creator, not a quitter; a visionary, not a victim. That leader is Vivek Ramaswamy,"" McColley said in a statement. ""He will be one of the boldest leaders in the history of our state, and I'm honored to help execute his vision.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Aston University and PFE Medical partner to create biodegradable gloves from food waste","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260107/Aston-University-and-PFE-Medical-partner-to-create-biodegradable-gloves-from-food-waste.aspx","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 19:17:00 GMT","

Aston University and Midlands-based company PFE Medical are teaming up to create biodegradable gloves made from food waste for use in the NHS.

They will offer a low-cost, convenient alternative to disposable gloves without compromising patient safety. More than 1.4bn disposable gloves are used by the NHS each year. They create large volumes of clinical waste which has both an environmental and economic cost.

The Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project will develop a more sustainable alternative made from polymers derived from food waste such as orange peel, able to degrade naturally. The gloves will initially be for use during low-risk tasks such as ultrasound scans, rather than in more critical situations such as operating theatres.

The gloves would be designed to not only reduce clinical waste and costs in the NHS, but also carbon emissions, helping the NHS reach its goal to be the world's first net-zero health service. With most personal protective equipment (PPE) currently sourced from Chinese manufacturers, the goal is to develop a biodegradable glove that can be manufactured using a UK supply chain.

The challenging project draws on Aston University's expertise in sustainable polymer chemistry, centred at Aston Institute for Membrane Excellence (AIME). Aston University has one of the largest research groups of polymer chemists in the UK. The project will be led at the University by Professor Paul Topham, director of AIME, and Dr James Wilson, AIME associate member.

The research team have chosen to focus on polymers from food waste in order to ensure that the final product can be manufactured sustainably. Most polymers are currently made from petroleum. Polymers made from food waste, ranging from fruit waste to corn or dairy products, have the potential for antioxidant and antibacterial properties if designed appropriately. The team will manipulate the polymer molecules so that they include the right monomers (the smaller units which make up the molecules) in the right location to achieve the properties they require.

Critical to the success of the project will be PFE Medical's commercial and clinical experience of taking new innovations into medical use. It will be the third KTP between Aston University and PFE, following on from successful projects to develop an automated endoscope cleaner, now in use across University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB).

At Aston University, we have a long history of working with industry, of translating fundamental research into solutions for real world problems. This project with PFE Medical provides us with that route, to take our science and engineering and make a difference to peoples' lives. That's exactly where, as researchers, we want to be.""

Professor Paul Topham, director of AIME

Rob Hartley, CEO of PFE Medical, said: ""Our previous KTP with Aston University was a phenomenal success, thanks to the brilliant team we had on board. I'm just as excited by this project, which is looking to solve an equally long-standing problem. If we can achieve our goal, then the implications are huge, going far beyond the NHS to all the other situations where people are wearing disposable gloves.""

KTPs, funded by Innovate UK, are collaborations between a business, a university and a highly qualified research associate. The UK-wide programme helps businesses to improve their competitiveness and productivity through the better use of knowledge, technology and skills. Aston University is a sector-leading KTP provider, ranked first for project quality, and joint first for the volume of active projects.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Cult Of Criterion: The Dead","https://www.avclub.com/cult-of-criterion-the-dead","Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:10:56 GMT","

In Cult Of Criterion, The A.V. Club highlights a new release from The Criterion Collection each month, examining the films entering an increasingly accessible film canon.

James Joyce's short story collection Dubliners comes to a jarring close with “The Dead,” a novella-length stretch of familial holiday melancholy, issued from a twentysomething who'd just been confronted by his own mortality. Finished in the wake of an incapacitating bout of rheumatic fever, “The Dead” is a story with a young man's preoccupation with death. When it was first adapted to film almost 80 years later, it was an old man's final statement as he looked into the nearing void—the prolific John Huston directed The Dead from a wheelchair, and would not live to see its release. Joyce ironically frets in the present, a romantic quarter-life crisis brought on by sickness and poverty and ambition; using the same work, Huston memorializes lives lost or squandered far in the past, a personal elegy that's as much reflection as adaptation.

This latter point springs naturally from the creative team that Huston surrounded himself with: Any adaptation where an ailing Huston worked with two sons and a daughter would inevitably become an intimate and revealing project. The Dead was written by his son Tony (briefly escaping the screenwriting slums of Curse Of The Swamp Creature and Mars Needs Women before he left the profession entirely), stars his daughter Anjelica, and had its second unit directed by his son Danny. The elder Huston, who helmed adaptations throughout his career (tackling everything from The Red Badge Of Courage and Moby Dick to Annie and the Bible), turned his final translation into a deathbed family farewell, an adaptation that—despite its closeness to the source material, finished as Joyce convalesced in 1907 on the eve of his daughter's birth—was essentially colored by its octogenarian filmmaker's 1987 reality.

But perhaps it would be impossible to make an impersonal film about milquetoast Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann) taking his wife Gretta (Anjelica Huston) to the annual holiday party thrown by his elderly aunts Kate (Helena Carroll) and Julia (Cathleen Delany). There's just something about the holidays, the family and friends, the snow on the ground, the big table and fine china and the rich cooking. It's all so sweet it can reek of death. So nostalgic one can find their emotions eroded by the sands of time. For Gabriel in particular, as he floats through the traditional goings-on and rote conversations, placating a blathering old woman and rebuffing a critical Irish Republican, there's a sense of detachment. This is present in Joyce's story, colored with the kind of sadness that accompanies dread—the writer hopes he doesn't ever become such a middling, apolitical, tepid man. But in The Dead, McCann and Huston imbue Gabriel's nod-and-smiler with regret. His life has been lived, and any revelation gleaned by the end of the night is too little, too late.

Gabriel wanders through the party—the conversation and atmosphere as alternatively prickly, awkward, warm, drunk, mean, icy, and geopolitically specific as one could hope for from Joyce—there is a dreaminess to the fidelity, one that lingers on endings. Gabriel's drive through much of the film is his anxiety around the toast he always gives at dinner. Both this midpoint speech and his late-night musings, alone with his thoughts in the finale, inevitably return to the mounting age of his aunts. He envisions himself at one's funeral, projecting himself as both mourner and mourned. Just as his wife holds onto the ghost of her past love—Anjelica Huston, showstoppingly poignant, is silently struck on the stairs by a song that still haunts her—Gabriel grasps at the ghosts of the near future, hoping to eulogize them appropriately in the present. Death is around the corner, and he knows it. There is a desperation to get ahead of it, to say what needs to be said and do what needs to be done. Julia's brittle singing voice, flickering like a candle about to go out, is just the loudest and most direct sign of time's cruel march.

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

But the most revealing piece of filmmaking is that which unfolds during her rendition of “Arrayed For The Bridal.” Fred Murphy's meandering camera wanders the home's halls and back rooms like a stranger browsing an estate sale. It considers all the little things left behind, distracted yet somber. Crossfades bleed into one another as slowly as the image navigates the spiraling stairs. If there are ghosts here, the audience might be counted among them. It's here where Joyce's immediate anxiety around the future, around age and failure and personal irrelevance, melt away. The same fate awaits us all, and Huston nudges us towards this through his lazy tour of the home's memorabilia. The filmmaker still engages with the nagging question of legacy, of the effect one has had on those around them and the world at large—how could he not, at the end of such a storied career?—but that grows muffled under the snowfall, an equalizing procession that erases the world, scrubbing it out into a blank white canvas ready for all the artists yet to come.

Foo Fighters are set to return to the road this month, but they'll be without guitarist Pat Smear, who found himself on the injured list not from rocking out too hard, but what's apparently the second greatest threat to rock stars everywhere: mishaps in the garden. 


	The band shared the news on Instagram with a fake tabloid cover featuring a photo of a grinning Smear hoisting a middle finger while being carried away on a stretcher. “Pat Smear Bizarre Gardening Accident!” reads the headline (The issue also promises “Aliens Spotted Warming Up for Spring Training!” and “2026 Fried Chicken and Champagne Diet Tips.”) 


	“In the classic tradition of rockstars having bizarre gardening accidents, Pat Smear has apparently rung in the new year by smashing the shit out of his left foot,” Foo Fighters wrote in the caption. How exactly Smear smashed his foot remains unclear, though the band said he was left with multiple broken bones.


	Smear will miss “a few shows” while he heals, the band continued, adding: “We'll miss our beloved Pat as much as you will, but we want him fully healed and back on his feet as soon as possible.” Smear's temporary replacement will be Jason Falkner, who's played guitar with Beck and St. Vincent.

	As goofy as the group's fake tabloid cover was, there actually is a weird history of “bizarre gardening accidents” in rock music — some fake, some real. On the fake side, there's the famous Spinal Tap bit where the metal band's first drummer, John “Stumpy” Pepys, died in a “bizarre gardening accident” that the authorities said was better left “unsolved.”  

	











	On the very real side, Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro actually did die while spraying insecticides in his yard in the early Nineties (though the coroner ultimately ruled that he died from a heart attack caused by cocaine use, not an allergic reaction to the pesticides). And in May 2020, Queen guitarist Brian May ripped his gluteus maximums “to shreds” in what he called “a moment of over-enthusiastic gardening.”

	The Smear-less Foo Fighters have a handful of shows scheduled this month, including gigs in Mexico, Los Angeles, and Tasmania. It's possible Smear will be back when the band plays Welcome to Rockville in Daytona Beach, Florida in May, or he may rejoin by the time the band kicks off a European and U.K. tour in June. A North American run is scheduled to start in August.


	Foo Fighters appear to be gearing up for a new album after releasing two new tracks, “Today's Song” and “Asking for a Friend,” last year. The band's most recent LP, But Here We Are, arrived in 2023.
