                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google has introduced a new way to grab the attention of students who are avid podcast listeners. Now available in Google Classroom, teachers can use a new Gemini-powered tool that generates podcast-style audio lessons, meant to promote deeper comprehension of educational material. There, they can select different customization options, such as selecting the appropriate grade level, defining topics, and setting clear learning objectives. Research shows that students spend significant time listening to podcasts, with an estimated 35 million Gen Z monthly listeners in the U.S. Plus, the popularity of podcasts as educational resources has grown rapidly; many universities now produce their own podcasts, and students increasingly seek out popular educational series on their own time. However, teachers are still grappling with integrating AI tools into their teaching practices. Many teachers express concerns about students' increased reliance on generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments. Gemini for Classroom first launched in 2024, and Google has continually added new features since then. Most recently, the company rolled out major updates last June, including features that help teachers brainstorm, develop lesson plans, and customize instructional materials for their students.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers in WSU's School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering unveiled a low-cost robotic apple-picking arm designed to help offset labor shortages for tasks such as harvesting and pruning, according to a news release Wednesday. Researchers published their work in the journal Smart Agricultural Technology. Washington state leads the nation in apple and sweet cherry production, contributing more than $2 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product in 2023, according to WSU. Farms across the state employ hundreds of workers annually for orchard tasks such as pollination, pruning, flower thinning and harvesting. But an aging population and a decline in migrant farmworkers have made it harder for growers to meet labor needs during harvest season. Compared to humans who can pick an apple every three seconds, the robotic arm is still slow. Deploying robots in fruit harvesting and other aspects of agriculture is not a new concept. WSU says that some robotic harvesting systems can be large, expensive and complex to use in orchards. “Having this very low-cost, safe robotic platform is ideal for the orchard environment,” said Ryan Dorosh, a PhD candidate and lead author on the work. GeekWire Studios has partnered with AWS for the Guide to re:Invent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator. Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator's questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services. One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out. Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia's Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar's machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn't often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia's physical AI strategy. During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company's Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits. While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The feature, called Buy for Me, started rolling out in April last year alongside another program known as Shop Direct. The tools are designed to help shoppers find products that aren't sold on Amazon — and, in some cases, allow Amazon to complete a purchase on a customer's behalf using AI. Bloomberg, Modern Retail, Financial Times, and others published stories this week citing brands who say they were caught off guard when their products appeared in Amazon search results. Some said they only discovered the program when strange orders started arriving from Amazon-linked email addresses. “Businesses can opt out at any time by emailing [email protected], and we remove them from these programs promptly.” Listings created with Buy for Me are labeled as coming from other stores when they show up within Amazon search results. Product and pricing information is pulled from public information on a brand's website, though Amazon says in an FAQ page that it “may modify these for display on the Amazon Shopping App.” The pushback from independent sellers — who make up more than 60% of Amazon's online store sales — highlights a growing tension as tech companies roll out AI-powered shopping tools. In November, Amazon sued Perplexity to stop the startup from using its AI browser agent to make purchases on its marketplace, citing computer fraud laws and security risks, along with a “significantly degraded shopping and customer service experience it provides.” Related: AI is coming for your shopping cart: How agentic commerce could disrupt online retail The chips powering your smart TV, voice assistant, tablet, and car all have something in common: MediaTek Tech Moves: Amazon AI leader joins Google Cloud; Meta taps new chief legal officer from Microsoft GeekWire Studios has partnered with AWS for the Guide to re:Invent.

This innovation is made possible by a proprietary AIO Q-Connector that relies on pogo pins for seamless connectivity, and we got a good look on the ground at CES 2026 in Las Vegas. The novel AIO Q-Connector is at the heart of Asus' breakthrough, featuring 11 spring-loaded pogo pins organized in two groups—nine for primary connections and two for additional controls. These precision connectors allow the new ROG Strix LC IV coolers to seamlessly receive power and control signals for the pump, ARGB lighting, and, in select models, an integrated 5.08-inch LDC display. Impressively, there's no need for users to connect any cables to the radiator fans manually; the AIO Q-Connector discreetly transmits PWM and lighting signals through a cable cleverly concealed inside the cooler's tube sleeving. Asus may expand the AIO Q-Connector to Intel motherboards in the future, but for now, AM5 users have a unique advantage in creating a next-generation, wireless cooling setup. While the ROG Strix LC IV series is designed for a truly cable-free experience, Asus has ensured flexibility by including a modular design that allows users to connect standard cables to any motherboard, even if it lacks the proprietary AIO Q-Connector. However, given that the key selling point of the ROG Strix LC IV AIO liquid coolers is its advanced wireless functionality, it would be counterintuitive to invest in this premium product without leveraging its signature feature. Asus has introduced three distinct base models for the ROG Strix LC IV series, each available in two color variants—providing a total of six configurations to suit various build aesthetics. These displays enable users to monitor critical hardware stats, showcase personalized content, or display exclusive ROG animations, enhancing both functionality and visual appeal. Notably, the LCD panel connects to the pump via a dedicated five-pin pogo connector, ensuring reliable data transmission and a streamlined installation process. The SLC model features shorter tubing—an intentional design choice aimed at PC builders seeking a tidier and more organized interior. The small adjustment helps prevent tubing from hanging awkwardly across other components. This model offers a more budget-friendly option for builders who want to experience the innovative cable-free design of the ROG Strix LC IV series without the additional cost of a display.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But in coming clean, Kennedy solved a decade-old New York City mystery: How and why had a young black bear—a wild animal native to the state, but not to modern-era Manhattan—been found dead under a bush near West 69th Street in Central Park? WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from public records requests. WIRED has obtained documents that shed new light on the incident from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation via a public records request. NYDEC spokesperson Jeff Wernick tells WIRED that its investigation into the death of the bear cub was closed in late 2014 “due to a lack of sufficient evidence” to determine whether state law had been violated. They added that New York's environmental conservation law forbids “illegal possession of a bear without a tag or permit and illegal disposal of a bear” and that “the statute of limitations for these offenses is one year.” Bonnie McGuire, then-deputy director at Urban Park Rangers, told two colleagues that UPR sergeant Eric Handy had recently called her about a “dead black bear” found in Central Park. “NYPD told him they will treat it like a crime scene, so he can't get too close,” McGuire wrote. “Poor little guy!” McGuire wrote in a separate email later that morning. (This didn't end up happening, as NYDEC took the bear to a state lab near Albany.) The bear is seen laying on its side in an unnatural position. Bits of flesh are visible through the bear's black fur, which was covered in a few brown leaves. Ioannidis,” notes that the bear “had multiple injuries to its body, rear legs, and jaw.” “Further inspection of [the] hour seems to indicate bear was hit by a car,” read notes obtained by WIRED, which appear to have been handwritten at 4 pm on October 6, though it's unclear by whom. Handy also communicated with Caroline Greenleaf—the director of community relations for the Central Park Conservancy, which had tipped UPR off about the bear—on October 6. “Thanks for letting us know about the bear!” Handy wrote in a 5:52 pm email. “Injuries included spinal fractures, all legs broken, and skull fractures severe enough for the majority of its brain to be lost through its mouth.” This is consistent with the preliminary forensic necropsy report Hynes eventually produced for the NYDEC, which WIRED obtained via a public records request. As reported by Business Insider, the necropsy notes that in addition to brain tissue being found in the bear's mouth, it was also in her “trachea and upper bronchus.” It also notes that “the remaining brain tissue is scrambled, liquefied, and hemorrhagic.” An Department of Environmental Conservation report obtained by WIRED notes that she “was healthy and eating [natural] sources of food” prior to death. At this point, it's useful to examine what precisely Kennedy said about the incident in his August 2024 video, in which he is speaking with, for some reason, Roseanne Barr. “I was taking a group of people falconing up in Goshen, New York, up in the Hudson Valley,” Kennedy says. (Goshen is in Orange County, NY, home to a bear population that Hynes theorized the cub may have belonged to.) Kennedy claims that he put the bear in his van with a plan to “skin the bear” and “put the meat in my refrigerator,” because she was in “very good condition.” “And you can do that in New York State; you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear,” Kennedy adds. Eventually, he found himself running behind for a trip “right back to the city” for dinner at Peter Luger Steak House—presumably the original location in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, rather than its Long Island location—and decided he didn't have enough time to drop off the bear at his Westchester, New York, home. “I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,” Kennedy says, insisting for the second time that he was absolutely not breaking any laws that day. I said, ‘Let's go put the bear in Central Park, and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike.' It'd be fun, funny for people.” He explains that there had been “a series” of fatal bicycle accidents around that time—there had been two in recent months—which inspired the idea. In the video, Kennedy claims that he was surprised to wake up the next morning and find that the story of a dead baby black bear in Central Park was big news—again, bears do not live in Central Park outside of its zoo—and had prompted a major law enforcement response. What made Kennedy especially anxious, he claims, was a news report that said the bike was being sent to a forensic lab for fingerprinting. As HellGate summarized shortly after Kennedy's video was posted, “?????????? Despite the new documents that WIRED is able to disclose, there are lingering questions about the decisions Kennedy made that day in 2014. Perhaps, even if he was meeting friends familiar with his purported love for animal carcasses (his daughter once alleged he decapitated a dead whale with a chainsaw, strapped its head to the top of his minivan, and brought it home, though a subsequent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration investigation said her claim was “unfounded”), he would've been unacceptably late. But why couldn't Kennedy have just abandoned his mission to skin and butcher this baby bear by placing it in a wooded area anywhere between Goshen and New York City, especially knowing that he had a flight later? Alternatively, Kennedy could've been going to Westchester County Airport. For that matter, was Brooklyn's Prospect Park ever considered? Why couldn't he have simply gotten in touch with city or state authorities if he was intent on not keeping the bear? We may not have the answers to any of these questions, but we can say one thing for certain: Kennedy planned to skin this baby black bear and store her meat in his refrigerator, then decided he didn't have time and disposed of her under a bush.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In November 2024, a powerful bomb cyclone and atmospheric river hit the Pacific Northwest, triggering severe flooding across multiple states and Canada. New research suggests the track is undergoing an unexpected change. By the end of the century, this will have significant implications for West Coast weather and water availability that current climate models don't fully account for, according to the researchers. Previous studies have suggested that the North Pacific storm track is shifting poleward, with climate models projecting a significant shift under global warming. But the lack of a historical wind record over the ocean has prevented researchers from confirming whether the shift has occurred in recent decades and how climate change is influencing it. “To overcome this, we establish a mathematical connection between storm tracks and sea-level pressure, which has been directly measured in recent decades,” Chemke explained. It also showed that this shift exceeds natural variability and is consistent with an externally forced change driven by human-caused warming. Climate models fail to capture the magnitude of this recent shift. “Since the shift we observe here is not due to natural variability in the system, but rather a response to climate change, the future shift may be larger than currently predicted.” With this critical gap in climate modeling now identified, improving how models represent storm-track dynamics will be essential for accurately projecting and preparing for future changes in storm activity, including heat and moisture fluxes along the West Coast, Chemke said. The shift he and his colleagues measured will allow heat and moisture transported along the West Coast to reach higher latitudes and drive an increase in weather variability in those regions. The West Coast is already struggling to adapt to weather extremes as climate change fuels unprecedented heatwaves, longer droughts, and more intense storms. Understanding—and accurately modeling—these complexities will be crucial for anticipating regional impacts and adapting to a warmer world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The White House account better be cooking up a sick edit,” Cam Higby, a right-wing influencer and member of the Pentagon press corps, wrote on X Saturday morning, as news of Maduro's arrest broke. Joey Mannarino, an influencer with more than 650,000 followers on X, spent Sunday debating whether to support vice president JD Vance or Marco Rubio as president for 2028. Most mainstream outlets—including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox News—refused to sign on to it, forcing an exodus of military beat reporters from the ranks of the Pentagon's official press corps. Weeks later, the Pentagon replaced them with Trump-friendly influencers from organizations like Turning Point USA, as well as independent creators like Tim Pool, a right-wing political commentator. “Legacy media chose to self-deport from this building,” Wilson said. Instead, we're welcoming new media outlets that actually reach Americans.” This model has clearly not been about journalism, or access to information. Several of them, including Higby, have turned their attention to alleged childcare fraud in Minnesota, chasing the same story that right-wing creator Nick Shirley claimed to uncover in a viral YouTube video last week. (Local Minnesota outlets have been covering this story for years.) This moment feels reminiscent of the early days of the Iraq war, where pro-war bloggers promised a similarly unrestrained alternative to mainstream coverage. He's gone on to call for additional raids as well, writing, “Could Iran be next? So far, it doesn't appear as if any of these newly credentialed Pentagon press members have reported any real news on the raid or even received a single briefing on the matter. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Are they just taking press releases or whatever is given to them?” On Monday, defense secretary Pete Hegseth launched what the Pentagon is calling an Arsenal of Freedom Tour. During the tour's first stop at a Virginia shipyard on Monday, he was accompanied by only one mainstream outlet, CNN, and a host of right-wing media figures, according to Status News.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. After departing from Seattle, we stopped in Olympia for lunch and a little recharge for our recently purchased 2024 Mach-E — the electric Ford Mustang. But the Level 2 charger found via Google Maps offered a paltry boost and we had 115 miles to our Portland destination. My husband went off on foot to a nearby farm supply store seeking the device. Our 17-year-old daughter, in the meantime, had run out of TikToks and patience. More map searching near our hotel led us to a nearly empty parking garage that promised charging on the eighth floor. After circling to the roof we found one broken charger and another being used by a couple in an embrace outside their electric truck, inexplicably kissing in the cold. The charging mishaps had left us tired, frustrated and anxious — with only ourselves to blame. Historically, I've been largely indifferent toward cars, owning a series of forgettable Toyotas and Hondas — safe, reliable cars that got me from point A to B with reasonable fuel efficiency. I had wanted to go electric in 2017 when shopping for my previous car, but the Chevy Bolt was underwhelming and Tesla too swanky. Their insurance covered the loss and we searched for a replacement. My husband genuinely likes cars and took the lead in shopping with my one condition in mind: it had to be an EV. We landed on the Mach-E, which startled friends and family alike who knew my milquetoast automotive track record. One spin behind the wheel and I was smitten. The fact it can go from zero to 60 in 4 seconds doesn't really impact my reality, but pleases me all the same. I size up exhaust-spewing muscle cars next to me at stoplights and imagine smoking them. When the holidays arrived, I was cruising in my Mach-E and imagined that our Portland trip would be as easy as traveling via gas power. After all, the EV market share had hit more than 20% in Washington in 2024, and charging stations were cropping up at grocery stores and along highways. I didn't want to download and create accounts with the many charging service providers. For decades after the internal combustion engine reigned supreme, drivers still needed to map out gas stops on lengthy road trips. The EV charging network, however, is still lagging and faces new challenges under the Trump administration, which has imposed policies to remove incentives and slow EV infrastructure deployment. In most ways, I'd found the switch to an EV surprisingly convenient. We're fortunate to have off-street parking at home, and it's super satisfying to simply click a Level 1 slow charger into car and walk away. The device uses a regular outlet in our garage and generally provides the vehicle enough power for work, errands and local day trips. We drove the Mustang on an overnight trip to Bellingham, Wash., in November and easily found power at clearly marked, city-owned parking spots with free electrons. On a separate outing to hike near the tulip capital of Mount Vernon, I simply plugged in afterwards at an EVgo fast charger near my house to quickly refill. We were lulled into complacency and unprepared for longer EV travel. I got feedback from Matthew Metz, founder of Coltura and CEO of EVQ, a startup supporting EV purchases; Scott Case, founder of the EV data platform Recurrent; and Grace Reamer and Jay Donnaway, who are respectively current and past leaders of the Seattle Electric Vehicle Association, or SEVA. EVQ and Recurrent also have their own terrific sources for essential information: Despite our rookie mistakes, panic and wasted time, we did have a nice trip to Portland (I highly recommend Casa Zoraya for amazing Peruvian food and my body literally aches for a return to Dragontree Spa).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This will hopefully prevent melting connectors from damaging your RTX 5090 GPU. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. “This proactive alert system enables potential power issues to be addressed before they result in permanent hardware damage,” MSI said in its PR. And if it indicates an anomaly, the only way you can stop the buzzing is by shutting your computer down, thereby cutting power to the GPU and helping protect it even before its power connector starts melting. MSI says that “In either case, the only way to get your PC up and running safely again is by shutting it down, unplugging the 12V-2x6 connector from your graphics card, inspecting for damage, and firmly re-plugging it if all's well.” This tech comes in four of MSI's latest power supplies — the top-of-the-line MPG Ai1600TS and MPG Ai1300TS PCIE5 get GPU Safeguard+, while its mainstream MAG A1200PLS and MAG A1000PLS PCIE5 PSUs are protected with GPU Safeguard. Nevertheless, this should help protect your system from unexpected meltdowns, especially for high-powered GPUs like the RTX 5090 and even some Sapphire Nitro+ 9070 XTs. Aside from these new PSUs, we also saw the MEG Maestro 900R panoramic PC case, with its triple-sided curved glass letting you see your build from every angle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At CES 2026, Ikea spent its first-ever time at the tech event showing off a number of new products, including a new Bluetooth speaker it calls the Kallsup. It's a teeny tiny cube that is, in every way that matters, far more of a delight than its $10 price tag lets on. The Kallsup is lightweight yet solid-feeling, a plastic box with speaker holes on one face, a USB-C port on the back for charging, and two buttons astride a small LED status light for power, playback, and pairing. With a few paired together, the Kallsup cubes were able to quickly fill the room with better-than-you'd-expect sound—not tinny or muffled. They certainly didn't push out much bass, and neither would I expect that at this size and price. The only real criticisms I have, at first glance, spring from Ikea's decision to only put two buttons on the box: a play button and one emblazoned with the Bluetooth logo. It's not obvious to me that you'd long press the play button, rather than the Bluetooth one, for pairing speakers together, and neither is it clear how they're turned off, or even if you can do that manually. If you wait long enough, though, the speakers time themselves out. Gizmodo is on the ground in Las Vegas all week bringing you everything you need to know about the tech unveiled at CES 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a conventional computer company, Lenovo never fails to make a splash at CES, regardless of whether the experimental products are actually practical to use. This year, the company has not one but two laptops with rollable OLED screens, one of which is a gaming laptop that can expand its display horizontally, adding an extra eight inches of screen real estate—all with the press of just a single key. You never knew you needed a screen that could do that, but it's exactly the kind of oddball tech CES is all about. Let's be real: a screen much wider than the laptop housing it looks wacky. And it requires the laptop lid to be comically thick. A 24-inch screen coming from the footprint of a 16-inch laptop is pretty awesome especially if you're someone who wants to take their gaming laptop on the go, whether while traveling or even just from one part of your house to another. Like the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable OLED laptop that came out last year, the full OLED screen is hidden until triggered to unroll with a key press. In this case, the laptop uses two motors that unrolls the screen in both directions simultaneously, giving you that ultrawide aspect ratio when fully expanded. Beyond that, it's built on the chassis of a Legion Pro 7i, so in theory a laptop like this would feature high-end components similar to what's in that model, like RTX 5090 graphics and the latest Intel processors. Lenovo has also announced the ThinkPad Rollable XD Concept, which iterates on its previous rollable design that expands the screen vertically. It still starts with smaller OLED display (this time a 13.3-inch screen) and can be expanded up to 16 inches with one keystroke. This is an even more dramatic transformation than last year's ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable, which starts at a 14-inch size before growing. Lenovo calls this a “world-facing” screen, but it's not clear exactly what the use case for this additional display area would be. The demo unit had some placeholder widgets but nothing that functioned yet. This is not Lenovo's first exploration of putting screens on the lid, but so far they have been always-on, digital-ink screens that only sip power and don't tax the battery too much. Definitely not an ideal spot for video calls. Lenovo is also announcing the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist. It still feels like a bit of a work in progress, but it shows that these proof-of-concept projects are more than just novelties. Lenovo even announced a price for the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist. Lenovo also announced some more conventional PCs at CES. There's a new superlight laptop, the Yoga Slim 7i Ultra. It weighs only 2.2 pounds yet feels sturdy and premium. It looks like it was meant to go head-to-head with the Asus Zenbook A14, one of our favorite laptops from 2025. Meanwhile, the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon and ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 look like last year's models on the outside, but both have a renewed focus on user repairability. Notably, you can now replace the battery yourself and buy a new one from Lenovo. The laptops have also been redesigned internally, following a design pattern Lenovo calls Space Frame. This allows Lenovo to use a much smaller board, saving interior space and enabling better cooling without the need for a thicker chassis. Lastly, the company had a couple of really interesting all-in-one PCs to show off. Even Apple has shrunk its iMac line to just a single option, so it's nice to see Lenovo breathe some fresh air into the category. It's an interesting alternative to rotating your screen entirely vertical. There's also the Yoga AIO Aura Edition 32, which has one of the boldest designs on a monitor I've ever seen. Although you can't adjust the height, it has a futuristic look that I'd love to have on my desk at home. Lenovo hasn't provided a release date or price for the ThinkCentre X AIO, but the Yoga AIO 32 will have a starting price of $2,400 and will launch in the second quarter of 2026.
