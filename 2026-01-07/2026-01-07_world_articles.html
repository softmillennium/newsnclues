European Command said that the vessel was violating the U.S.'s sanctions on Venezuela's oil exports, which legal experts have repeatedly said are illegal under international law. Russia's transportation ministry said in a statement that “no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states.” Reuters reports a Russian lawmaker from the ruling party has described it as piracy, and lawmakers have denounced the action. Armed Forces provided pre-planned operational support, including basing, to U.S. military assets interdicting the Bella 1 in the UK-Iceland-Greenland gap following a U.S. request for assistance,” the agency said in a statement. U.S. Southern Command also reported that the Coast Guard intercepted another tanker, this one flagged to Panama, with links to Venezuela in Latin American waters on Wednesday, known as the M Sophia. “The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT,” wrote Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The two seizures mark the third and fourth publicly announced tanker seizures in recent months. They are the first to be captured since the U.S.'s abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children's hospitals in Washington State, Colorado, and Minnesota face federal scrutiny for care that is legal. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Gender-affirming care for trans youth is legal in all three states. But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last month announced that medical practitioners who provide gender-affirming care to minors are out of compliance with federal health care standards. In response, Children's Hospital Colorado has reportedly paused gender-affirming care for trans youth. Children's Minnesota did not respond to a request for comment, and its website states that “at this time, our gender health services remain unchanged.” Seattle Children's hospital also did not respond. In earlier efforts by Trump administration officials to investigate and halt  gender-affirming care, both Children's Hospital Colorado and Seattle Children's Hospital successfully fought back against Justice Department subpoenas seeking trans patients' medical information. The administration previously pressured hospitals to halt gender-affirming care by threatening to revoke federal funding, which worked in many cases, but these HHS investigations mark a new escalation. They stem from Kennedy saying that, under his authority as health secretary, he can unilaterally decide that gender-affirming care — which  he calls “sex-rejecting procedures” — is not a safe and effective treatment for trans youth. On X, Stuart said that all three hospitals were referred to the agency's inspector general's office for failing to meet “recognized standards of health care,” citing Kennedy's declaration. The HHS has also proposed two new rules to restrict gender-affirming care for trans youth — both of which must still go through an approval process before they can be enforced. One rule would block hospitals from receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds if they provide gender-affirming care to trans youth. That care includes hormone replacement therapy for adolescents and puberty blockers for young kids who are experiencing dysphoria — intense discomfort or anxiety felt when someone's physical gender is out of sync with their identity. It also includes surgery, which is very rarely performed on minors. Another proposed rule would bar Medicaid from covering gender-affirming care for youth under 18 and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) from covering such care for youth under 19. Technically, states could still use their own funds for coverage — but experts say that would be extremely burdensome and ultimately cause gaps in care. The American Academy of Pediatrics, an organization of 67,000 primary care pediatricians and other specialists, strongly condemned these proposals, saying that they misrepresent current medical consensus and create uncertainty for patients. “Patients, their families, and their physicians — not politicians or government officials — should be the ones to make decisions together about what care is best for them.”The American Civil Liberties Union has said it will challenge these two restrictions in court if they are finalized.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arson attack that left parts of German capital in darkness for days stirs outrage over infrastructure insecurity But in recent days the windup radio – with its inbuilt torch and charge point – has come into its own during Germany's longest power cut since the second world war. Leftwing anarchist militants have claimed responsibility for an arson attack on Saturday that cut the electricity to about 45,000 households, almost 2,000 businesses, four hospitals, 74 care homes, 20 schools and a considerable chunk of the public transport network in south-west Berlin. Aside from some footprints left in the snow, investigators admit they have little to go on so far. On Wednesday morning the remaining 20,000 households and 850 businesses still without heating or hot water were finally reconnected. But many Germans still feel they are without answers to three vital questions: who was responsible, how could the infrastructure of Europe's largest economy prove so vulnerable, and how can authorities prevent such an attack from happening again? “How is it possible that the power grid is so insecure?” asked Anar, a cleaner in her 60s who was stuck on a train on the outskirts of Berlin on Saturday night, fearing she would be unable to get to her workplace – or be paid. The Red Cross, which came to the aid of thousands this week, has led urgent calls for more investment to be made in domestic civil protection and disaster relief. This week its members were among those handing out thermal flasks and muesli bars to residents. When Berlin's energy and economy senator, Franziska Giffey, turned up on Monday to see the fallout for herself, she could hardly hide her embarrassment. “You can find a lot of information on the internet,” Giffey admitted in an interview with the broadcaster DLF, saying policymakers needed to prioritise security over transparency in future. Glaring also is the failure of lawmakers to put pressure on utility companies and network operators. “Companies only do what they're legally required to do.” Politicians were keener to do things that were visibly striking, such as “building drone defence centres”, rather than implementing more mundane measures such as protecting energy networks or fixing dilapidated bridges or school buildings, he told Der Spiegel. In a statement, the party's deputy federal spokesperson, Kay Gottschalk, said the government had failed to develop “any sort of consistent political and security-related response” to sabotage or arson attacks. “It's no longer an abstract warning we face, but a bitter reality,” he said. Across Berlin there has been an outpouring of goodwill towards those who lost power. Vulkangruppe apologised to people such as the Peters – a retired nurse and caretaker in their 70s – who have had to stay with friends for days. But Silke gave this short shrift, saying: “Tell that to the elderly who were stuck in their lifts when the black out happened, or our neighbour whose cat ran away and has yet to return.” When they do, Silke will be in on a secret her husband had kept. “It turns out he'd been doing his own prepping,” she said, referring to supplies of tinned fish and a large canister of drinking water he had put in the cellar, unbeknown to her. The difference to just a short while ago is that most readily admit it now without fear of ridicule.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, can reasonably expect two things to happen as they get accustomed to their new day-to-day life at the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York: They will be uncomfortable and kept out of harm's way. “It truly is hell,” federal prison consultant Sam Mangel told CNN. CNN could not determine precisely how the couple is being treated. Neither prison officials nor lawyers representing the couple responded to requests for comment. Mangel as well as a former federal prisons official and a defense attorney with clients housed at MDC told CNN of the prison's challenging conditions and how high-profile detainees are typically handled in such an environment. What it's like inside the infamous jail where Venezuela's former president Nicolás Maduro is being held The federal Bureau of Prisons doesn't comment on current inmates, but Mangel said Maduro and Flores are likely housed in a segregated area, not with the general population — in separate cells and alone. “His case, he is a security risk in general population,” Mangel said. “No one knows what other inmates might think of him, other gang members, other cartel members, so putting him in general population at any time … I think would be tremendous security risk for the facility.” Before their US military capture on Saturday, the couple had lived at Miraflores Palace, a sprawling presidential residence known for its neoclassical architecture, large windows, grand halls and manicured courtyards. They are now among detainees who include a mix of suspects and defendants, including people accused of serious crimes, high-profile cases, and others awaiting sentencing or transfer. Maduro and his wife probably have no regular contact with each other, unless both have scheduled their meetings with their attorneys at the same time, said Hugh Hurwitz, who ran the Bureau of Prisons from May 2018 to August 2019. In the meantime, Maduro could possibly spend his time in a small recreational area within the jail, an area that would be much smaller than it would be in a larger facility, Hurwitz said. The life of inmates segregated from the general population includes a 6 a.m. wake-up call, with time scheduled to meet their attorneys daily, outdoor exercise five hours a week, and daily visits by health personnel, according to the Bureau of Prisons handbook. Inmates in the jail's Special Housing Unit, known as the SHU, where it's likely Maduro is being housed, are kept in solitary confinement under restrictive conditions, Daniel McGuinness, a criminal defense and civil rights litigation attorney who represents several clients housed at MDC, told CNN. Inmates spend up to 23 hours locked down inside their cells with restrictive escort protocols in place when they do move outside of them, and have limited access to legal phone calls, according to a Justice Department report. “I don't know whether they're locking him in his cell 23 hours a day …  but no doubt he's in a secure unit where nobody can access him,”  Hurwitz said. “I'm sure they're keeping him separated from other inmates. Hurwitz expects that the security protocols in place are with the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein top of mind. “They can't afford to have another Epstein incident,” Hurwitz said. CNN's Evan Perez and Lauren del Valle contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fossils unearthed in Morocco from a little-understood period of human evolution may help scientists resolve a long-standing mystery: Who came before us? They are intriguing to scientists because they are the first hominin fossils from this period to have been discovered in Africa. “There are a lot of fossil hominins in Africa until about a million years ago, but then after that there is a jump to around 500,000 years ago, and in this gap we have almost nothing,” said Jean-Jacques Hublin, an author of the study that published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature. “It is extremely exciting to have fossils right in the middle of this gap,” added Hublin, a paleoanthropologist at Collège de France and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. CT scans and analysis of the fossils' features revealed an ancestor who had a “mosaic” of primitive and more evolved features. For example, it didn't have a defined chin, unlike Homo sapiens, but the teeth and other dental features were quite similar to those of our own species and Neanderthals. Most of the fossils were unearthed in 2008 and 2009, but they were definitively dated much more recently, Hublin noted, using a technique known as paleomagnetism, which detects the geological signature of a reversal of the Earth's magnetic field in certain minerals with magnetic properties. Study coauthor Serena Perini, a geologist and paleomagnetist at Italy's University of Milan, said in a statement the technique allowed the team to “anchor the presence of these hominins within an exceptionally precise chronological framework.” The world's earliest known Homo sapiens remains have also been found in Morocco at a site known as Jebel Irhoud, and they date to 400,000 years ago. However, Hublin said it would be incorrect to regard this region as the exact place our species emerged. More likely, it was a result of geological conditions in the region that allow fossils to be preserved particularly well. Hublin noted that the cave these individuals called home would have been a dangerous place. The leg bone was covered in bite marks from a predator, most likely a hyena, and there was much evidence that carnivores occupied the cave. Neanderthals and Denisovans are thought to have gone extinct around 40,000 years ago, although the timing is less clear for Denisovans, a shadowy population first identified in 2010. “Debate over which fossils might represent this crucial evolutionary node persists, and correctly identifying this ancestor is essential for understanding the directions of subsequent evolutionary change,” Rosas, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a commentary published alongside the new research. Genetic evidence suggested that this ancestor lived around 550,000 to 765,000 years ago before splitting into three separate sister species, the study noted, but it's not clear what the ancestral species was or where it lived. Candidates include Homo antecessor, a group of fossils found in a cave in Atapuerca, Spain, that dates to roughly the same time as the Moroccan fossils, and a species known as Homo heidelbergensis, fossils of which have been found in Africa and Eurasia. “The question, then, becomes whether populations of Homo erectus directly gave rise to everything, including humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans, or whether there is a traceable lineage with observable changes along the way,” said Ryan McRae, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, who wasn't involved in the research, via email. “Any hominin fossil from this critical time period makes for an exciting new window into human evolution,” said Mongle, who also wasn't a study author, via email.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists predict increased disease outbreaks after Trump officials no longer recommend third of childhood vaccines “It's the largest change in our vaccination schedule in modern American history,” said Jake Scott, infectious diseases specialist and clinical associate professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. It is an “astounding” decision made without scientific evidence or public input that will worsen vaccine access and increase disease outbreaks, said Daniel Jernigan, former director of the National Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. US health officials, led by Kennedy, “want fewer vaccines”, Jernigan said, adding that they're inflating the risks while burying the benefits of vaccines and “sowing confusion” for parents and providers. Some shots are now only offered to “high-risk” groups – including hepatitis A, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis B and vaccines to prevent two types of meningitis. The dengue vaccine will continue to be recommended in high-risk areas only. Health officials said in a press release this will move the US closer to “peer, developed countries” as instructed by Donald Trump in December. Yet most other high-income countries have similar vaccine schedules to America's now-jettisoned recommendations. All of them except for Japan routinely recommend vaccines against meningococcal disease to children. The UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, and European countries recommend hepatitis A vaccines for high-risk populations. Several of these countries also routinely recommend vaccines the US does not. Many of these countries are “moving towards more protection” offered by vaccines, Scott said. “A lot of countries are expanding their vaccine schedule, and a lot of them have looked to the US over the years.” The new US schedule is now closer to that of Denmark, a much smaller nation with universal healthcare. When it comes to vaccine recommendations, “Denmark is an outlier”, Scott said. “They've got the most minimalist childhood vaccine schedule” of other high-income nations. The US is itself an outlier, Scott said, when it comes to healthcare and social safety nets. “We need to follow what our peer countries are doing – and have universal healthcare,” Jernigan said. There are profound health disparities in America; nearly a third of the population does not have access to primary care. Lack of healthcare access or paid sick leave means diseases spread more before Americans seek care. Dense urban centers alongside rural areas with very limited healthcare access, and plenty of travel across state and international borders, Scott said, means “disease moves differently” in the US. In other nations with fuller healthcare systems, it can be easier to access vaccines that are recommended only to high-risk populations, instead of all children. The children of pregnant people with hepatitis B are at high risk of getting very sick, for instance, yet in the US they are the least likely to access hepatitis B vaccines because they are frequently unable to see doctors for testing or follow-up care. Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, pointed to declining trust in public health, but did not provide evidence for how changing the vaccination schedule would affect public trust. Even other countries with universal healthcare recommend similar vaccines as the US once did. Scott said the recommendations aren't “really about aligning with peer nations. “We have a sweeping health policy that has no public engagement,” he said, noting that the process for making transparent decisions on vaccines was established long ago, yet “this administration just refuses to use the process”. “It lists two authors, which is very odd – to have a sweeping document that leads to significant policy change list two authors,” Jernigan said. “You end up with what is really an opinion piece.” Even the president's directive to re-examine the schedule was unusual, Jernigan noted: “I'm trying to think if a president has ever said: ‘Atvorstatin for lowering cholesterol, I think that should be changed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Jan. 5 derided Russia-supplied air defenses that failed to stop the American raid and subsequent arrest of Venezuela's longtime dictator Nicolas Maduro. During his speech at the Newport News Shipyard in Virginia, Hegseth applauded the large-scale military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3 that led to the capture of Maduro and his wife, both of whom have been transferred to the U.S. for trial. After vowing to "sink every drug boat headed in our direction," Hegseth mentioned the failure of Venezuela's defense systems to repel U.S. strikes in the unexpected morning military operation. Russia's Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. "aggressive actions and forced removal" of the Venezuelan dictator who has been in power since 2013. The U.S. administration proclaims to no longer be "playing the catch and release game" with South American drug organizations whose smuggling operations through the southern U.S. border have been a major focus of President Donald Trump's second term in the Oval Office. The criminal case against Venezuela's dictator is already underway, with four charges being announced on Jan. 5. His wife, Cilia Flores, has also been charged, and both have pleaded not guilty to their respective charges. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post that the couple "will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts." The next court appearance has been scheduled for March 17. Yevgeniya Doluda is an intern at the Kyiv Independent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oil extended declines on Wednesday as investors digested statements from President Donald Trump that the U.S. ​had reached a deal to import up to $2 billion ‍worth of Venezuelan crude, a move that would lift supplies to the world's largest oil consumer. Both benchmarks slipped more than US$1 during the previous trading session, with market participants expecting ample global supply this year. The United States and Venezuela have reached an agreement to export up to $2-billion worth of Venezuelan crude to U.S. ports, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, a move that could redirect oil shipments meant for China and ease pressure on Venezuela's sanctioned oil industry. The deal between Washington and Caracas could initially require cargoes that were bound for China to be rerouted, sources told Reuters. Venezuela has millions of barrels of ⁠oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship since mid-December due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump. The blockade was part of a U.S. pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government that culminated in U.S. forces capturing him over the weekend. Venezuela will be “turning over” between 30 million and 50 million barrels of “sanctioned oil” to the ‍U.S., Trump wrote in a social media post on Tuesday. “The ‌volumes are quite small in a larger context,” SEB commodities analyst Ole Hvalbye said. “If you ⁠look at the U.S. SPR in total, that's now 413 million barrels. Adding to geopolitical risk, the U.S. was attempting to seize a Venezuela-linked oil tanker after a more than two-week-long pursuit across the Atlantic, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Providing some support to prices, U.S. crude stocks dropped by 3.8 million barrels to 419.1 million barrels in the week ended January 2, the Energy Information Administration said. U.S. gasoline stocks increased by 7.7 million barrels in the week, the EIA said, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 3.2 million-barrel build.​ Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, climbed by 5.6 million barrels in the week versus ⁠expectations for a 2.1 million-barrel rise. Morgan Stanley analysts estimated the oil market could reach a surplus of as ⁠many as 3 million barrels per day in the first half of 2026, based on weak growth in demand last year and rising supply ‌from OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

BELGRADE, January 7. /TASS/. Military neutrality is an unchanging political choice of Serbia and cannot be revised by the decision of individual politicians, former Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and ex-Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin said in an interview with TASS.

"The National Defense Strategy clearly says that Serbia is a militarily neutral state. This is no longer a question that can be decided by any politician. This is a matter for the parliament, this is a matter for the nation. Therefore, military neutrality remains Serbia's constant political choice. For this to change, a lot must change," he noted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The announcement follows reporting that U.S. forces boarded the empty oil tanker, which was renamed Marinera and adopted a Russian flag after evading a U.S. blockade near Venezuela in December. The unprecedented incident risks further inflaming tensions between Russia and the U.S., sharpened by Washington's military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of dictator Nicolas Maduro, Moscow's ally, and Russia's refusal to cease hostilities in Ukraine. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called a "back-to-back meticulously coordinated boarding of two 'ghost fleet' tanker ships," with another Venezuela-linked ship captured in the Caribbean. Russia appealed to the U.S. to halt the pursuit and reportedly dispatched a submarine and other vessels to escort the tanker before it was boarded by U.S. forces. Russian military vessels, including a submarine, were in the general vicinity of the operation, though there was no sign of a confrontation, according to the news agency. The New York Times seemingly disputed this claim, writing that, according to its sources, no Russian warships were near the tanker. The British Defense Ministry confirmed it has provided operational support to U.S. forces at Washington's request. Russian state news outlet RT published footage of what is claimed to be a U.S. helicopter approaching the vessel. The Russian Foreign Ministry, in turn, said Moscow "demands that the U.S. ensure humane and dignified treatment of Russian citizens on the ship" and "not to hinder... (their) prompt return to their homeland." However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the crew could be brought to the U.S. to face trial over potential federal law violations "if necessary," without mentioning Russian crew members specifically. She also referred to the ship as a "Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel," in line with other U.S. officials who have avoided mentioning Russia in connection to the case. According to Leavitt, the vessel was deemed "stateless" after flying a false flag. U.S. authorities said they were acting on a seizure warrant because the ship was flying a false flag. The tanker has been sanctioned by the U.S. for purportedly transporting black-market Iranian oil on behalf of organizations designated by Washington as terrorists. "We welcome such (an) approach to dealing with Russia: act, not fear," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said. Separately, U.S. forces also intercepted another Venezuela-linked tanker in Latin American waters. "The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people," U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said. "Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce — as determined by the U.S. — will be permitted." Dan Hamilton, a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says U.S. President Donald Trump is demonstrating that "the U.S. will determine what energy flows out of Venezuela." Referring to the U.S. military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3, the expert noted that "while Russia has criticized U.S. actions publicly," it sees Washington's interventions in Venezuela as a sign that "big powers can intervene in the affairs of small powers." While this marks the first case in recent memory of the U.S. seizing a Russian-flagged vessel, European countries have previously detained several ships from the shadow fleet, suspected of engaging in illicit activities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colombian military patrol the Simón Bolívar International Bridge in Cúcuta on Tuesday. After the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, members of powerful armed groups started arriving in Colombia from neighbouring Venezuela.Yader Guzman/The Globe and Mail Before Mauricio Alvarez was threatened with death, he lived in the northeast Colombian village of La Gabarra, in an area that has farmed coca since the late 1980s. His attempts to negotiate better payment for small-time coca farmers earned him the fury of a criminal group that traffics in cocaine. Mauricio Alvarez has lived in hiding for the past year.Yader Guzman/The Globe and Mail His experience has given him a particularly clear perspective on the trade in a narcotic that has long made Colombia a place of interest for the United States – and, now, the subject of new threats from Donald Trump. But Mr. Alvarez doubts that such action, including any bid to remove Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a loud antagonist whom Mr. Trump accuses of being a narco-trafficker, will cut the country's production of narcotics. In fact, Mr. Trump's stunning decision on the weekend to seize Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro has already bolstered the influence in Colombia of armed drug traffickers, including those that Mr. Alvarez says want to kill him. What happened this weekend, seen by some as a blatant violation of international law, “sets a very harmful precedent that could cause stability here in Colombia to collapse,” said Gerson Arias, a former Acting High Commissioner for Peace in Colombia who has worked extensively to end conflict in the country. Mr. Trump has celebrated the South American political upheaval he set in motion, saying Tuesday that the operation to grab Mr. Maduro from his bedroom was “an incredible thing” that had removed a “violent guy” who has “killed millions of people.” Critics, he added, “should say, you know, ‘you did a great job.' In recent days, after the U.S. action against Mr. Maduro, hundreds of members of powerful armed groups – including those associated with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as FARC, and the National Liberation Army, known locally as ELN – have arrived from Venezuela, according to local officials, conflict research groups and the Colombian minister of defence. It will be worse,” said Leandro Ugarte, secretary for victims, peace and post conflict for Cúcuta, a Colombian city on the border with Venezuela. More militants will inevitably lead to a bid for control of more territory, “and if that is what is happening at this moment, then it's like what happened on Jan. 17,” he said. The FARC dissidents are groups who refused to disarm after a much-celebrated 2016 peace deal, which has badly frayed. More militants entering Colombia will inevitably lead to more violence, said Leandro Ugarte, secretary for victims, peace and post conflict for Cúcuta.Yader Guzman/The Globe and Mail Conflict in Catatumbo contributed to a grim year for Colombia with 1.6 million people affected by violence and armed conflict between January and November of 2025, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a tally three times higher than in 2024. The number of people who were either trapped or displaced by that violence – nearly a quarter million in total – was the highest on record since 2008, when OCHA began counting those figures. Fresh hostilities erupted on Dec. 22, and nearly 2,000 have already been displaced, Mr. Ugarte said. The arrival of militants from Venezuela is of particular concern because of who is believed to be coming, said Mr. Arias, who is now a researcher with Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think tank that works on conflict resolution. An estimated 70 per cent of the central command and national leadership for ELN has been based in Venezuela. He believes that as much as a third of the group's armed component in Venezuela may decamp for Colombia, driven by fear that they could be a target for further U.S. operations in the country – or given up by the current Venezuelan leadership as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the White House. Colombian Defence Minister dismisses Trump's threats, says U.S. is not an enemy That makes any peace process more difficult going forward,” Mr. Arias said. In Colombia, meanwhile, violence has returned to the country's Venezuelan border areas as presidential elections loom, scheduled for this May.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's aides infuriated by Keir Starmer's lukewarm response to Venezuelan president's arrest The White House has dismissed Britain as “weak” for its response to the daring US special forces raid to capture Nicolás Maduro. It is the latest sign in Washington that a once close relationship between Sir Keir and the US president is cooling. A senior White House official said the response from London was sadly predictable. This particular insult is one of the strongest thrown around by a White House that revels in decisive moments and pours scorn on leaders slowed by legal niceties. The Trump administration opened the year with a bang by sending special forces on an audacious raid to arrest Mr Maduro and Cilia Flores, his wife. The couple are now in a New York jail awaiting trial on charges of “narco-terrorism” and conspiracy to import cocaine, among others. The president called it “one of the most stunning, effective and powerful displays of American military might and competence in American history”. They have faced a similar dilemma over Greenland, with the White House announcing plans to acquire the island from Denmark – by force if necessary: European leaders united to condemn the US president's threatened take-over on Tuesday. For his part, Sir Keir – who is facing mounting pressure from his own party to condemn the capture of Mr Maduro – said the UK had always supported a transition of power. “We regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime,” he said, before raising the importance of international law. “It is, of course, for the US to set out the legal basis for their actions,” she said before UN Security Council discussions on Monday. As Mr Maduro was not the legitimate leader of his country, they argue, he does not enjoy any sort of immunity from American justice. “If the UN… and this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist and the same treatment in this charter of a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organisation is this?” he said. Oil has been at the centre of discussions about Venezuela's post-Maduro future. “I am pleased to announce that the Interim Authorities in Venezuela will be turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil, to the United States of America,” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform. “This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” The US has also demanded that Caracas cut ties with Russia, China, Iran, and Cuba, and partner exclusively with the US on oil production. The US is planning to seize a sanctioned oil tanker, linked to Venezuela, off the coast of Ireland after it evaded an American naval blockade in December. Russia's foreign ministry said it was monitoring the tanker's situation “with concern”, according to a state news agency. British officials reportedly fear that seizing the tanker could provoke retaliation from Russia. However, they are also wary of alienating the US by refusing support. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, ⁠Poland, Spain, ‍and Denmark said: “Greenland belongs to its people. However, according to one White House official, Europe's full-throated support for Greenland has not deterred Mr Trump. Asked about the US president's drive to acquire the territory during his remaining three years in office, they said: “It's not going away.”</p>
