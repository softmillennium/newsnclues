                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ryan Graves testified to Congress that UAP sightings became "an open secret" among Navy aircrew - so routine they were part of daily briefs. New data shows 45% of pilots have witnessed UAP, yet only 5-10% report them. The "aeromedical trap": FAA regulations can classify unverified aerial observations as potential hallucinations, triggering psychiatric evaluation and career-ending grounding without pay. The recent Americans for Safe Aerospace white paper documents this systematically. When trained observers with instrument confirmation stay silent 90% of the time, we don't just have an aviation safety crisis - we have a civilizational failure to believe testimony that challenges our worldview. However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples: Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail. Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): "Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. President Jimmy Carter: "If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. Astronaut Gordon Cooper: "I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla..." While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A community for discussion related to Unidentified Flying Objects. We aim to elevate good research while maintaining healthy skepticism. If You Call Them, They Will Come: Three True CE-5 Cases with Humanoids Have you ever called down a UFO? There are many different kinds of UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, onboard experiences, telepathic communication and more. Cases can be broken down into various categories such as close encounters of the first, second, third and fourth kind. This unique and profound category can contain all the other types of encounters, but is differentiated from them because these encounters themselves are the result of humans reaching out to ETs. Cases like these are important because they show that we can have an interactive relationship with the UFO phenomenon and the ETs. This video presents three extensive true cases of CE-5 contact that went beyond simple sightings and resulted in actual face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials. In June of 1996, Jeneva had a fight with her boyfriend and drove up to a remote location in the mountains of Santa Clarita, California to meditate and seek answers about the many issues in her life. Depressed, she screamed out to the skies, “Why is life so crappy?! After several minutes, it was close enough that she could see it wasn't a helicopter, plane or conventional object. Then it hovered directly overhead and beamed her with light. Jeneva had never been so scared in her life, but when the object stayed there, her fear began to pass. Before long, her fear left completely and she realized that the UFO was not going to hurt her. In fact, the whole experience became deeply moving and spiritually transformative. The object remained there all night long, communing with Jeneva for several hours, and totally lifting her out of her depression. When sunrise finally arrived, the object accelerated away in a split second. She became deeply interested in UFOs and searched for answers about her encounter. She began learning about such subjects as remote viewing and spirituality. She also began having very vivid dreams of being onboard a UFO. She went back to the same spot, hoping to have a repeat experience, but the UFO never returned. He had always wondered if they were real and what kind of technology they had, but he was only slightly interested in them. But in March 2015, he heard that there had been recent sightings near his home in San Juan, Argentina. But that night, after going to sleep, something very strange happened: he woke up to hear his name being called telepathically, in his head. He jumped up and went to the window just in time to see a brilliant UFO streak across the sky. Could it have been the UFO occupants? A few months later, Hector was sleeping in bed when the room filled with brilliant light. Waking up, he was terrified to see two tall extraterrestrial beings standing in the doorway. “We are not going to hurt you.” Hector's fear evaporated and instead, he felt “a love like never before.” One of the beings approached his bedside, cradled his head in his arms and said, “I have come to heal you.” Hector cried with intense joy and gratitude as the ETs gave him a strange pill and instructed him to swallow it, which he did. The experience hadn't been a dream. And his life would never be the same. It was April 2015 when 14-year-old Abdiel sat in his living room and stumbled on the TV show, Hangar One, all about UFOs. Then, one week later, Abdiel was in his backyard playing around with a soccer ball when a bright light caught his eye. He looked up and watched a golden-yellow object move across the sky. He had just expressed a desire to see a UFO one week earlier, and then one had appeared. He now found himself suddenly interested in psychic abilities and other similar subjects. After studying them for a few years, his interest in making contact increased. This was followed by strange knocks on the window of his home and a mysteriously blinking kitchen light. Shortly later, going out into his backyard, he was amazed to see a strange circle in the grass. It looked just as if a UFO had landed there. This was followed by another strange mark in the grass that looked very much like the portrait of an ET head. Could the ETs be trying to contact with him? A few days later, Abdiel got his answer. It was short, brown in color, with a large triangular-shaped bald head and big, dark, round eyes. Now he knew UFOs and ETs were real. He had reached out to them, and they answered. These three cases all qualify as close encounters of the fifth kind. In each case, people reached out to the ETs and received a dramatic unmistakable response. These cases show just how closely extraterrestrials are watching over all of us, and that if a person asks for contact, they can initiate their own encounter and experience the UFO phenomenon firsthand. If You Call Them, They Will Come: Three True CE-5 Cases with Humanoids However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples: Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail. Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): "Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. President Jimmy Carter: "If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. Astronaut Gordon Cooper: "I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla..." President Barack Obama: "What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are." While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature. - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee. Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling. Rectangular Craft Sighting: "Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom." Corroboration: "I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. Triangular Craft Sighting: ["I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Smaller cousins of our Sun could be harbouring their own extraterrestrial life At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Scientists have assembled a catalogue of more than 2,000 stars that could be supporting alien life. Researchers behind the study hope that it could provide a foundation for the study of those stars, and examination of whether they might support alien worlds. It is a full accounting of so-called K dwarfs, which are lower-mass cousins of our own Sun that could be harbouring their own inhabited planets. They are common throughout space, and offer a long-term and stable environment that could nourish life on the worlds that surround them. The new study brings together more than 2,000 of those stars, all of which are closer than 130 light years from us. Since they are located on two hemispheres, they can get a full look at the sky around us, letting us see all of those K-dwarfs. The K dwarfs are cooler and fainter than our Sun but are more common – in our patch of space, there are roughly twice of them as Sun-like stars – and they live much longer, meaning that they could be a more likely place to find other civilisations. The work is described in a new paper, ‘An All-Sky Spectroscopic Reconnaissance of More Than 2,100 K Dwarfs Within 40 Parsecs Using High-Resolution Spectra', that was presented in a conference this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international project investigating the form, content and consequences of online conspiracy theories has found that in German-speaking countries, such theories often originate locally and have come to form a complex ecosystem of alternative news websites, print media and parts of the political spectrum. The Tübingen research team found that not all conspiracy theories are equally dangerous. "However, the German-language debate on conspiracy theories is often alarmist and one-sided. This sometimes has a negative impact on the many projects aimed at combating conspiracy theories," says Butter. Conspiracy theories have a long history in German-speaking countries, but had been pushed to the margins of society by the mid-20th century, only gaining mass exposure once large numbers of people began using the internet. "Conspiracy theories shouldn't be lumped together with disinformation and fake news," says Butter. "They aren't simply misinformation that can be corrected by facts. As a result, followers of conspiracy theories are very attached to them. Researchers in the REDACT project first identified keywords which led them to posts on common conspiracy theories. They then collected six million relevant posts from the social media platforms Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, and Telegram from the years 2019 to 2024. "We initially analyzed these using quantitative methods, then qualitative ones, including methods from literary studies that capture the meaning of the text in all its nuances," says Mara Precoma, a doctoral student on the project. In their home countries, the regional teams also conducted interviews with members of various organizations dedicated to combating conspiracy theories and disinformation. These included government institutions, such as the Federal Agency for Civic Education in Germany, as well as initiatives and associations advising and supporting family members and friends of people who subscribe to conspiracy theories. Butter says there is no single model to fully explain conspiracy theories; nor is there a universal recipe for containing the damage they cause in society. Some projects are based on outdated assumptions, but most importantly, they receive funding that is too short-term and inflexible, and they have to spend too much time on reports and bureaucracy," he says. Butter and Precoma have set out recommendations for tackling conspiracy theories, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches: models or solutions from other countries should not be adopted uncritically, the researchers say, "It is also important that the adoption of a conspiracy theory should be seen as a symptom of a complex social situation, not as its cause." "If we want to combat conspiracy theories, we have to identify and address the underlying causes," says Precoma, adding: "In Germany, many projects against conspiracy theories target high school students. Similar programs should now be developed for other types of schools and for older people, as they are particularly susceptible to conspiracy theories." "The University of Tübingen sees it as its mission to examine socially relevant topics. Research such as that conducted in the REDACT project makes an important contribution to understanding the mechanisms behind social phenomena and developing effective strategies for open, fact-based communication," says University of Tübingen president, Professor Karla Pollmann.

UFO doesn't look like almost anything else in the typical running space, from its wide, marshmallow-y midsole and bright color blocking to the unfamiliar logo. before either—the brand has been best known in the CrossFit world, where it has released a series of cult-favorite (and MH Sneaker Award-winning) trainers. But this model is one of the most hyped releases of the current running shoe cycle, with maxxed out cushioning and an out of this world ride. I took it on the road to find out. Still, the shoe is surprisingly light at 8.8 ounces. The ride is extremely smooth thanks to the generous foam slab and rocker shape, which rolls me forward into each stride. The midsole is soft without being too pillowy; I can feel a slight depression into the ground when I take a step. This isn't the fastest shoe on the road, though; when I needed to pick up the pace in an interval workout, I didn't get the same pep that I feel from kicks with firmer foams or tools like plates. I'd wear this for anything other than tempo workouts and races. I'm giving the RAD UFO a 4.8 out of 5. The ride is incredibly smooth, and it might be the most comfortable pair of running shoes I can remember lacing up in recent memory. I kept reaching for the UFO, even after I had logged enough miles to have a solid review. Overall, the UFO is personally one of my favorite running shoes in recent memory and will be my go-to recommendation for a wide range of runners going forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Until now, astronomers have mainly been trying to detect advanced aliens by looking for odd radio signals from distant planets and peculiar heat signatures indicative of advanced technology. However, this approach may have a human-centric bias, ie, trying to understand ET entities through a distinctly human lens, and may not account for potential civilisations which could be completely different from ours, say researchers from the Arizona State University. In the new thought experiment, they propose a whole new way in which advanced aliens could potentially be communicating with other ET civilisations. Each firefly species has evolved to have flash patterns that are different from others, enabling members of a species to recognise each other. Even though fireflies do not understand what these flashes convey, their patterns can signal the presence of each firefly and its identity against a noisy natural background. Similarly, advanced aliens may also be flashing signals in a binary on/off flash pattern, which may not have any specific meaning, but could just stand out from the natural cosmic background of bright stars and galaxies, scientists say. Scientists developed a firefly-inspired model to explore how intelligent aliens might generate signals that are distinct from their background, but do not carry any decoded meaning. One of the brightest background objects in the cosmos is a pulsar, which is a spinning neutron star that emits regular pulses of predictable and periodic radio waves. They also accounted for the energy required to produce such a signal. This helped scientists estimate the kind of artificial signal most distinct from the pulsar background in space that could be produced by advanced aliens with reasonably low energy. Scientists found that artificial signals could be generated considerably more distinct from the pulsar population by an advanced alien civilisation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The problem is that there aren't a ton of feature-length films that really use liminal space to its fullest potential. At least, that's what I thought before feasting my eyes on 1974's Messiah of Evil. I have to give credit where it's due, as I first heard about Messiah of Evil after running a YouTube search for “Liminal Horror.” That rabbit hole led me to a channel called Nightmare Movies, which sold me on streaming the film after breaking it down so succinctly. If you're a fan of liminal horror and you've slept on Messiah of Evil like I had, it's in your best interest to check it out on Tubi. It's streaming there for free, and it will take you to a strange place in the uncanny valley that threatens to swallow you whole. The main thread follows Arletty Lang (Marianna Hill), who travels to the small beach town of Point Dune in hopes of reconnecting with her estranged father, Joseph (Royal Dano). Joseph is a troubled artist who has lived in the town for years, but has become increasingly unstable as of late. These writings also describe the increasingly vivid nightmares Joseph has been experiencing, which slowly bleed into something far more ominous. While talking at Thom's motel, they have a run-in with a local vagrant named Charlie, who warns them about an upcoming blood moon. After Charlie ominously claims that her father is “one of them now,” Arletty's curiosity turns into alarm, pushing her to dig deeper into what's actually happening in Point Dune. People who appear perfectly normal are suddenly shown feasting on raw meat in grocery stores, only to snap into pursuit once they spot someone who hasn't turned. For me, the liminal spaces these moments take place in make Messiah of Evil genuinely horrifying. Gas stations, Ralphs grocery stores, movie theaters, and other familiar third places feel menacing specifically because of their emptiness as Arletty searches for answers about her father. Joseph's artwork lurking in the background makes you hypervigilant as a viewer, never quite sure whether those paintings are playing tricks on your eyes or watching you back. There's a constant sense that something is wrong just outside the frame. Much of that dread forms in your own head rather than being spelled out for you. For nearly its entire runtime, the film sustains that feeling. The zombie attacks are just an added bonus. Messiah of Evil, which is currently streaming for free on streaming services like, Tubi, PlutoTV, and Hoopla, is one of those movies that rewards multiple viewings.</p>
