                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Isack Hadjar is gearing up for his next chapter as a Red Bull driver, with the Frenchman preparing to become Max Verstappen's new team mate. Isack Hadjar has shared an insight into what excites him most about his new chapter as a Red Bull driver, with the Frenchman citing racing alongside Max Verstappen as one of his highlights. The Milton Keynes-based outfit have numerous titles to their name, with Sebastian Vettel scoring four back-to-back championships at the team between 2010 and 2013, while more recently Verstappen clinched four consecutive Drivers' Championships until his run was interrupted by McLaren's Lando Norris in 2025. This history is an aspect of the move that appeals to Hadjar, who will become the latest driver to test himself against Verstappen. Elaborating further on what he admires about Verstappen, Hadjar said: “What I find very impressive with Max is that, after four World Championships, he's still very hungry, and very mad when it doesn't go his way because he always wants to win. “I don't think every champion can do that; once you've passed a certain level you can maybe slow down a bit in your approach, but he seems to be starting just like I am, so it's very impressive.” And while the step up is one that he is excited about, the young driver is not carrying any specific expectations into his sophomore season, one in which a wave of new technical regulations will come into effect. “I have no expectations at all because it's starting from scratch, everyone,” he explained. “So yeah, the work is going to be done. The drivers and teams will first be in action during a private pre-season test held at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya from January 26-30, while two three-day tests will follow at the Bahrain International Circuit on February 11-13 and February 18-20.</p>
