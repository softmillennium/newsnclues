                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Kansas City Current has announced former United States men's national team midfielder Chris Armas as its new head coach. The appointment marks Armas' first role in professional women's soccer following a coaching career spanning nearly two decades in Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Premier League. The 53-year-old previously spent four years as head of women's soccer at Adelphi University between 2011 and 2014. Armas has been out of management since he departed the Colorado Rapids in November following two seasons in charge. “From the talented group of players, the facilities and passionate fan base, this club represents a world-class environment,” Armas said in a club statement. He also made 66 appearances with the USMNT between 1998 and 2005. He began his coaching career as an assistant at Chicago Fire before taking the role at Adelphi University in 2011. Armas won a Supporters' Shield with the New York Red Bulls in 2018, stepping up from his role as assistant during the season after Jesse Marsch left for RB Leipzig. He then went on to serve as an assistant at Manchester United under Ralf Rangnick during the 2021-22 Premier League season and with Leeds United briefly under Marsch in 2023. “Chris brings a wealth of experience that will be invaluable for our organization,” Andonovski added. Armas follows Nick Cushing in moving from MLS to the NWSL, with Cushing named as expansion side Denver Summit's head coach in August following two years with New York City FC and an interim spell at Manchester City Women. Armas has lived many lives, from being one of the best defensive midfielders in U.S. men's soccer to coaching collegiate women's soccer and varying stints with six clubs over a 17-year managerial career. Leading the Current after such a historic year will be no easy task, with expectations high and generational players like Temwa Chawinga returning in 2026 from injury. Armas is also entering the locker room with 2025 still fresh on everyone's minds — especially with his official hiring coming on the same day as Brazilian forward Bia Zaneratto, a contender for 2025 NWSL MVP, announced her departure from the Current to re-join Palmeiras. It's curious, too, whether Armas' extensive resume on the USMNT played even a small role in his attractiveness for the Current, at least from a marketing perspective. We are, after all, in a men's World Cup year, with Kansas City set to host six matches at nearby Arrowhead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In October, he signed a three-year contract extension with Inter Miami to take him through the 2028 season. "I don't see myself as a coach," the 38-year-old Messi told the Luzu TV streaming channel in an interview recorded in December that aired Tuesday. "I like management, but if have to decide for one of the three, I would like to be an owner. Messi, who led Argentina to the World Cup title in Qatar in 2022, is already a part owner of Uruguay's fourth-division team Deportivo LSM, which is co-owned by Inter teammate Luis Suarez. "Deportivo LS is a family dream that began in 2018. We have grown a lot with more than 3,000 members," club founder Suarez said last May in a video alongside Messi. Messi won the MLS Golden Boot this season after scoring 29 goals, five more than LAFC's Denis Bouanga and Nashville's Sam Surridge. He also had 19 assists, and his 48 total goal contributions was one shy of matching the league record set by Carlos Vela in 2019. Messi also became the first player to win back-to-back MVP awards in MLS history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has announced it will use artificial intelligence to improve the accuracy of semi-automated offside decisions at next summer's World Cup – one of a series of new AI features set to be introduced at the tournament. World football's governing body's technology partner, Lenovo, will make an “AI-enabled 3D avatar” of every player participating in the finals, allowing the existing offside technology to track players in-game “during fast or obscured movements”. “Each scan takes approximately one second and captures highly accurate body-part dimensions, allowing the system to track players reliably during fast or obstructed movements.” The technology was trialled at last year's Intercontinental Cup, where the players of Flamengo and Pyramids FC were scanned before their meeting in December. Semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) has already been used at two World Cups (Qatar 2022 and the 2023 women's tournament in Australia and New Zealand), and is a tool for the VAR that automates key elements of the offside decision-making process in a bid to speed it up. FIFA also announced that every team at the tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico will have access to Lenovo's “generative AI knowledge assistant”, which uses millions of data points to simulate “text, video, graphs and 3D visualisations”. The tool could be used, for example, to show a team's last ten corner kicks. Nations will have access to the tool before and after games but not during matches in a bid to level the playing field between opponents at the first 48-team World Cup – where tournament debutants including Curacao and Cape Verde will be competing with traditional heavyweights such as Brazil, Germany and France. “Football AI Pro seeks to address this imbalance, with all of the 48 competing teams at global football's premier event set to benefit from the same advanced pre- and post-match analytical capabilities.” After a successful trial at last summer's Club World Cup, FIFA will also use AI to stabilise and improve the footage from referee cams at the tournament, which it said would improve transparency and the viewing experience for television audiences.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The truth behind a proposed €150 million (£130m/$175m) bid from Chelsea for Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior has been revealed after reports the Premier League giants were planning a mammoth offer for the Brazil star ahead of the January transfer window, amid claims he is unsettled in the Spanish capital since head coach Xabi Alonso's arrival back at his old club. Many eagle-eyed fans have picked up on his words and movements on social media ahead of a possible switch to the Middle East. Most recently, the winger was booed by supporters on Los Blancos' return from the winter break, only further fuelling exit rumours. The Blues are undergoing a huge change, sacking Enzo Maresca and replacing him with Strasbourg head coach Liam Rosenior. The reports claim one of his first major moves would be tabling a €125m-plus-€25m-in-add-ons offer for Vini Jr. Taking to YouTube, he claimed: "Reports on Vinicius Jr and Chelsea are completely wide of the mark. Vini Jr remains completely focused on Real Madrid, contract situation to be assessed." The news will come as a huge disappointment to fans of the London club, but the Blues do not have a shortage of wingers at their disposal as they embark on a new era under Rosenior. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Madrid won their first game back from the winter break in style. A 5-1 thrashing of Real Betis was a statement of intent from Los Blancos, who are chasing down Barcelona in La Liga. That win was without talisman Kylian Mbappe, although Vini Jr did not get on the scoresheet. However, manager Alonso came to the defence of his struggling forward, despite having a public falling out with him earlier in the campaign. It's important to start like this: calmly and with good feelings heading into the Super Cup. I value the victory in terms of La Liga. Barcelona won yesterday, and we have to win a lot of games. From tomorrow onwards, we're only thinking about the Super Cup." Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting With the likes of Mbappe, Rodrygo and several other emerging stars claiming plenty of minutes this season, there is certainly no guarantee that the Brazil icon will remain at his current club. With his contract ticking down to its final 12 months in the summer, Madrid may be forced to take a cut-price fee for one of their most valuable assets. However, if he doesn't, perhaps then it would make more sense for a club like Chelsea to enter the race for his signature, although they would likely face some heavy competition from others.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea are set to be disappointed in their pursuit of AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan, as the Italian giants edge closer to tying their captain down to a new contract. Maignan was a transfer target for the Blues last summer and they were expected to renew their interest this year given the Frenchman would be available on a free transfer. However, Milan are now in advanced talks to keep the highly-rated stopper at San Siro. According to Fabrice Hawkins, the player is now in advanced negotiations to extend his stay at the club by another five years, although no final agreement has been reached as yet. The news will come as significant blow to Chelsea, who had seemingly earmarked the highly-rated stopper to become their new first-choice goalkeeper once he had come to the end of his time at San Siro. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Milan CEO Giorgio Furlani denied claims that Maignan had tried to force his way out, saying: "There was interest from an English club, it was not considered an interesting interest from the club's point of view. There was openness to this interest but at the same time there was an interest on their part, not a forcing or a push, to stay at Milan. Then in the medium-long term future, those who live will see." Juventus have also since been credited with an interest. He likes being at Milan and Milan likes him being here, but now let's think about the game and then we will talk about it." Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Much-maligned current No.1 Robert Sanchez has seen his stock rise over the last year or so, but the position is still widely viewed as a weak point that needs to be strengthened. Whether incoming Blues head coach Liam Rosenior shares that view remains to be seen. He will be watching on closely from the stands when his new club make the short journey to face Fulham in a west London derby on Wednesday night.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifa has been working on ways to improve offside decisions for the World Cup Each player will enter a chamber to be scanned, a process that should take just one second and only needs to be done once during their pre-tournament photo shoot. It expects this to mean tournament officials will be able to "track players reliably during fast or obstructed movements" and says final decisions will be "displayed more realistically and in a more engaging way". Ruben Dias appeared to be jumping in the semi-automated offside graphic. Fifa hopes that by taking accurate scans of each player it can improve how these decisions are shown to supporters. Fifa announced last month it was testing new technology which can determine if the ball goes out of play before a goal is scored. It has also developed 'real-time 3D recreation' to make line-of-sight offside decisions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every player at this summer's World Cup will have their own physically accurate “AI avatar” that will be used in taking VAR decisions. The innovation, which will involve every player being digitally scanned and leaves the possibility of size mattering in future offside calls, was part of a package of technological measures announced by Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino, as he made a keynote appearance at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas. Infantino described the upcoming World Cup, with 104 matches due to played across the US, Canada and Mexico, as “the greatest show ever on planet Earth” and said the AI avatar would “ensure” that more accurate offside decisions would be made. “AI-enabled 3D avatars will ensure precise player identification and tracking,” Infantino said, describing it as “a big advancement in semi-automated offside technology providing great images, faster decisions and a clear understanding by everyone”. In the Premier League, SAOT involves 30 cameras identifying the position of the ball and tracking “up to 10,000” data points on a players' location but the graphical models used to reach a final decision do not match with a player's actual size. By adding personalised avatars, Fifa believes that the precision and speed of decision making will be improved, with the avatars allowing “the system to track players reliably during fast or obstructed movements”. The use of player-specific dimensions will personalise offside decisions as never before. It said each scan would take “approximately one second” and capture “highly accurate body-part dimensions”. These models would then be used by VAR in calculating offside decisions via SAOT, and Fifa intends that the models be incorporated into TV coverage so that decisions could be “displayed more realistically and in a more engaging way to fans at stadiums and to viewers around the world”. Also announced as part of an expanded relationship between Fifa and its official technology partner, the Chinese company Lenovo, was a new data platform – Football AI Pro – that is to be made available to all nations at the World Cup and will “help level the playing field” between better- and less-well-resourced nations “in an increasingly data-driven sport”. Infantino said: “The Fifa World Cup in 2026 is going to be the greatest show ever on planet Earth. Seven million people will attend the 104 matches – 104 Super Bowls – dozens of millions of fans will travel to North America to feel the Fifa World Cup vibe, six billion people will watch it from home, and the world will stand still.”</p>

When news broke that the United States military had attacked Venezuela on Saturday, there wasn't even a flicker of activity among the Fifa Council, according to senior sources. In the aftermath of the Venezuela attacks, Donald Trump spoke about how his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum, is “very frightened of the cartels” and that “something is going to have to be done with Mexico”. It's pointless to say Fifa here, since everything the federation does at that kind of level is now intertwined with the president. As such, no one dares broach this to Infantino, despite the farce of Fifa presenting Trump with an inaugural peace prize a mere month ago. The immediate diminishment of that prize – even if the presentation video already did a good job – was not just predictable. Just three days before the award, Trump said that military strikes on Venezuela would “start very soon”. That ultimately made it seven countries that the Trump administration had launched strikes against in his first year back in office. At the time, and in response to criticism of the highly politicised Maga-influenced video, Fifa's only real argument about any of this was that they feel like the single body that gets criticised for actually trying to promote peace. For all the jibes about Infantino's peace prize – given that we're talking about literal life and death – there is an even more serious point, That is the more philosophical and moral question of whether the tournament should even be hosted by a country that has recently launched an act of aggression. Infantino will possibly be relieved he doesn't have to think of any of this due to the muted response from Western governments and the Democratic Party, to go with how the context of Nicolas Maduro's rule further clouds debate. Whatever the actual answer, though, it is astounding that a transnational body, that has to be as attuned to geopolitics as Fifa, doesn't even have guidelines on this. It's all the more relevant when Infantino so willingly immerses them deeper into geopolitics. Because, worse, even if they did have guidelines, the Fifa president's very proximity to Trump would make such a situation even more problematic. It's often at this point in such discussions – as precisely happened with Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 – that a tit-for-tat moral relativism can evolve about what certain states have historically been responsible for. Infantino even indulged in it himself when insisting Europe should be apologising for 3,000 years of history in that infamous “I feel” address on the eve of the 2022 World Cup. He evidently doesn't feel quite the same way today. Against that, the very nature of geopolitics means states are always going to be involved in conflicts. Benito Mussolini's Italy didn't invade Abyssinia until the year after their 1934 World Cup. While academics and analysts would no doubt argue that some of these conflicts were still a direct consequence of previous invasions or historic acts of aggression, there is still a difference between present engagement and active aggression. In other words, as the football human rights advocacy group FairSquare describe, an act “unprovoked, uninvited and not sanctioned by the UN Security Council”. According to those terms, there is a much shorter list involving prospective World Cup hosts, which makes this story all the more distinctive. The latter did bring some calls from a small number of European politicians to strip Vladimir Putin's state of the tournament, but they inevitably went nowhere. Modern realpolitik dictates it is absurd to think there will be anything even remotely similar to that now, and the Fifa-USA relationship already looks much more skewed than the vast majority of previous hosts – bar perhaps Qatar. Groups like FairSquare nevertheless still believe there should be other lessons and pressure for Fifa. “It's clear that Trump thinks he can rely on Infantino's support no matter what he does, and Infantino, for his part, probably has no concerns about hitching Fifa's wagon to Trump so long as Fifa gets to rake in its billions. It is also why many involved figures actually see such an exceptional event as being of a piece with more regular Fifa issues, like the implementation of VAR and ticket prices, as well as another unique case like the eventual suspension of Russia over the 2022 invasion. Numerous sources criticise Infantino's Fifa for appearing to take so many decisions without proper consultation or preparation for foreseeable risks. Hence, a repeated argument that VAR was not properly road-tested before being implemented. Hence, the suggestion that the controversial World Cup ticket prices were ultimately about developing the game, despite Fifa not providing any response to FairSquare's three letters asking for evidence to support claims that they exert oversight on how member associations spend money. With Poland and Sweden refusing to play Russia, a force majeure argument was ultimately used to justify the position. Far from having to think about any of this, Infantino has already said his piece.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A visual countdown outside City Hall is reminding residents that Philadelphia is roughly 155 days away from the start of the FIFA World Cup. Experts say the city has never seen anything like what's coming in 2026 - and now is the time to book hotel rooms. Next year brings a trifecta of major events: FIFA World Cup games, America's 250th birthday celebration and the MLB All-Star Game. "There's going to be a lot of buzz in the city this year now. Officials expect an economic boom, but warn that lodging will fill up fast. There's still availability even during the matches; however, those are going to start to fill up," said Ed Grose, president and CEO of the Greater Philadelphia Hotel Association. FIFA is expected to announce in the coming weeks which team will set up its home base at Subaru Park. Grose said once that happens, remaining rooms in the city will book quickly. A quick hotel.com search showed more rooms outside the city, with better availability around the Fourth of July compared to World Cup match dates. "Once Center City fills up - what we call in the industry compression - the compression will bring room nights to suburban hotels, to City Line Avenue, to our airport hotels," Grose said. For travelers who can't book a hotel, home rentals may be an option.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At Lenovo Tech Day 2026 during CES, Motorola unveiled its first book-style foldable, the Razr Fold, alongside the new Motorola Signature. The clamshell foldable features a soft textured rear panel with patterns associated with the FIFA World Cup. It is available in a green color option, while offering the same specs as the standard Razr 60. Users will also get custom wallpapers, a FIFA theme ringtone, and a FIFA watermark for photos. Next, the new Moto Watch introduces Motorola's partnership with Polar for fitness and health tracking. The smartwatch comes with a 1.43-inch circular OLED display that's protected by Gorilla Glass 3. It gets a PPG sensor, Bluetooth 5.3, dual-frequency GPS, and offers an IP68 rating. It offers continuous heart-rate tracking, sleep insights, and supports multiple workout modes. The Moto Watch will be available in select markets across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Oceania, with stainless steel, silicone, or soft-luxe band options. It packs a 20W woofer, a 10W tweeter, and dual passive radiators, with support for Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 5, and UWB. The Sound Flow sports a twill-textured fabric finish, comes in Pantone Carbon and Pantone Warm Taupe colors, and includes capacitive touch controls. The Moto Pen Ultra features a 1.4mm tip, Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, and a 6-axis motion sensor. It comes with a USB Type-C charging case, carries an IP55 rating, weighs just 4.7g, and is claimed to deliver sub-5ms latency. Motorola's updated Tag 2 is powered by UWB, Bluetooth channel sounding, and the Find Hub network. It carries an IP68 rating and is claimed to deliver up to 500 days of battery life with a user-replaceable battery. Lastly, the company announced Qira, a unified AI assistant jointly developed by Lenovo and Motorola, and showcased an AI Perceptive Companion proof of concept dubbed Project Maxwell. Qira is positioned as a system-level, context-aware AI that can be activated using the “Hey, Qira” wake phrase, a dedicated hardware key, or a persistent on-screen pill. Motorola says Qira will roll out to select Lenovo devices in Q1 2026, followed by Motorola devices at a later date. Meanwhile, Project Maxwell, developed by Motorola's 312 Labs, explores new ways to bring AI into everyday use. It is a wearable accessory with a camera and a mic that integrates with Qira and can continuously process visual, audio, and environmental data to deliver real-time, context-aware insights. Not a bad design but it would be very tacky to own I can't even view my team in the World Cup because of how late the fixtures are in my local time. I'll literally be in bed at 11pm on a working day. Also that "wearable AI" thingy is beyond scary</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2030 World Cup is already beginning to take shape, with host nations outlining logistical plans and infrastructure upgrades needed to accommodate the tournament's expanded demands. While the 2026 World Cup will be staged across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the 2030 edition will be co-hosted by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, with the opening matches taking place in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. As part of its preparation as a host nation, Morocco is now exploring the possibility of staging another major international competition ahead of 2030. According to RMC Sport, Morocco is emerging as a strong candidate to host the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup. With several stadiums still under construction or undergoing renovations, a major tournament one year before the World Cup would serve as an ideal dress rehearsal. Morocco is already hosting the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, which could then be followed by the Club World Cup in 2029 and culminate with the 2030 World Cup. Kylian Mbappé's candidate to win the Africa Cup of Nations revealed by former teammate at PSG Reports suggest that Morocco's status as a World Cup host the following year could give it an advantage in the selection process. However, FIFA has yet to make any official announcement regarding the host nation or nations for the 2029 Club World Cup, nor has it outlined a clear timeline for when a decision will be reached. For now, the matter remains unresolved and is expected to be addressed in the coming months or years as FIFA finalizes its long-term tournament planning.

CES 2026 is underway, and it's the best platform around for making a big announcement. The colors used symbolize growth and renewal, and it looks pretty good with the vegan leather finish. Motorola has added exclusive wallpapers and ringtones to set the special-edition phone apart, and you also get a FIFA watermark that can be used when clicking photos. Like other Motorola phones, this one will also benefit from the Moto AI improvements. The FIFA World Cup 26 Edition Razr can be purchased on February 12 through Motorola, Verizon and Total Wireless. We expect to see the phone made available through Amazon as well. Don't want to miss the best from Android Authority? Motorola has refreshed its Android tracker with the Moto Tag 2. This new tracker now promises up to two years of battery life, up from the previous one year, through its CR2032 user-replaceable coin battery. The Moto Tag 2 comes with an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance. In a surprise move, Motorola is launching the Moto Watch. This watch features an OLED display, protected by Gorilla Glass 3, and is housed in a 47mm aluminum frame. Users can use third-party 22mm bands with the Moto Watch. The Moto Watch does not run Wear OS, though, but it does promise 13 days of battery life (dropping down to seven days with the Always On Display enabled). There's no standalone cellular connectivity, but you can take calls when connected to your Android phone via Bluetooth 5.3, as the watch features a microphone and speaker. The Moto Watch also features dual-frequency GPS powered by Polar. The Moto Watch will be available in PANTONE Volcanic Ash color on motorola.com starting January 22, 2026. Rounding up its announcements, Motorola is also launching the new Moto Pen Ultra stylus. It promises up to 31 hours of battery life with its case, with the case being charged through its USB-C port. It can be used to trigger features like Circle to Search, Handwriting Beautification, and Sketch to Image, and there's a customizable button as well. The Moto Pen Ultra promises a latency of less than 5ms. Thank you for being part of our community.</p>
