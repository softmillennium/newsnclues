                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aston University and Midlands-based company PFE Medical are teaming up to create biodegradable gloves made from food waste for use in the NHS. They will offer a low-cost, convenient alternative to disposable gloves without compromising patient safety. More than 1.4bn disposable gloves are used by the NHS each year. They create large volumes of clinical waste which has both an environmental and economic cost. The Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project will develop a more sustainable alternative made from polymers derived from food waste such as orange peel, able to degrade naturally. The gloves will initially be for use during low-risk tasks such as ultrasound scans, rather than in more critical situations such as operating theatres. With most personal protective equipment (PPE) currently sourced from Chinese manufacturers, the goal is to develop a biodegradable glove that can be manufactured using a UK supply chain. The project will be led at the University by Professor Paul Topham, director of AIME, and Dr James Wilson, AIME associate member. The research team have chosen to focus on polymers from food waste in order to ensure that the final product can be manufactured sustainably. Polymers made from food waste, ranging from fruit waste to corn or dairy products, have the potential for antioxidant and antibacterial properties if designed appropriately. Critical to the success of the project will be PFE Medical's commercial and clinical experience of taking new innovations into medical use. It will be the third KTP between Aston University and PFE, following on from successful projects to develop an automated endoscope cleaner, now in use across University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB). At Aston University, we have a long history of working with industry, of translating fundamental research into solutions for real world problems. This project with PFE Medical provides us with that route, to take our science and engineering and make a difference to peoples' lives. That's exactly where, as researchers, we want to be." Rob Hartley, CEO of PFE Medical, said: "Our previous KTP with Aston University was a phenomenal success, thanks to the brilliant team we had on board. I'm just as excited by this project, which is looking to solve an equally long-standing problem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For millions living with nerve pain, even a light touch can feel unbearable. Scientists have long suspected that damaged nerve cells falter because their energy factories known as mitochondria don't function properly. Now research published in Nature suggests a way forward: supplying healthy mitochondria to struggling nerve cells. Using human tissue and mouse models, researchers at Duke University School of Medicine found that replenishing mitochondria significantly reduced pain tied to diabetic neuropathy and chemotherapy-induced nerve damage. In some cases, the relief lasted up to 48 hours. By giving damaged nerves fresh mitochondria - or helping them make more of their own - we can reduce inflammation and support healing. This approach has the potential to ease pain in a completely new way." Their findings build on growing evidence that cells can swap mitochondria, a process that scientists are beginning to recognize as a built-in support system that may affect many conditions including obesity, cancer, stroke, and chronic pain. The work highlights a previously undocumented role for satellite glial cells, which appear to deliver mitochondria to sensory neurons through tiny channels called tunnelling nanotubes. When this mitochondrial handoff is disrupted, Ji said, nerve fibers begin to degenerate - triggering pain, tingling and numbness, often in the hands and feet, the distal ends of the nerve fibers. Injecting isolated mitochondria whether from humans or mice directly into the dorsal root ganglia, a cluster of nerve cells that send messages to the brain, produced similar results, but only when the donor mitochondria were healthy; samples from people with diabetes had no effect. Ji, worked with lead author Jing Xu, PhD, a research scholar in the Department of Anesthesiology, along with longtime collaborator Caglu Eroglu, PhD, a Duke professor of cell biology known for her expertise in glial cell behavior. More work is needed, including high-resolution imaging to confirm precisely how nanotubes help deliver fresh mitochondria in living nerve tissue. Even so, the study highlights a previously overlooked communication pathway between nerve and glial cells that could treat chronic pain at its source. Mitochondrial transfer from glia to neurons protects against peripheral neuropathy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cathepsin B belongs to a family of lysosomal cysteine proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) present inside the cell. This plays a crucial role in various processes, such as tissue repair and immune function. When this enzyme becomes overactive, it contributes to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, causing joint damage and inflammation. That's why understanding the role of Cathepsin B becomes important for better treatments. Researchers use different tools and enzymes to get deeper insight into how cathepsin B is involved in disease and test new therapies for this. Go through this post to learn how Cathepsin B impacts arthritis and how it is used in research. This enzyme is involved in several processes, such as: To study its role, scientists create lab-made proteins such as the Ctsb recombinant protein, which is a similar copy of the original enzyme. Cartilage breakdown: Cathepsin B plays an essential role in breaking down cartilage (tissue that cushions our joints). These enzymes become overactive and accelerate the joints, leading to joint pain during rheumatoid arthritis. This damage causes a problem while moving the joints. Involvement in inflammation: It activates specific molecules like pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are responsible for swelling and pain. A high level of Cathepsin B worsens the arthritis and causes severe symptoms. Finding a specific blocker: Cathepsin B performs many different tasks, like cell cleanup and healing. If the inhibitor is too broad, it can lead to side effects by stopping the good functions like tissue repair and normal cell functioning. Difficult to target: It is important to understand how to stop the enzyme's harmful activity, such as joint damage, without disturbing its normal functions in different parts of the body. Cathepsin B plays an important role in the development of inflammation and arthritis, contributing to joint pain and damage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just outside Salt Lake City sits an old, two-story, brick hotel. It's been given new life as a homeless shelter for seniors. The Medically Vulnerable People shelter — or MVP shelter, as it's known — is for people 62 and older or for younger adults with chronic health issues. Unlike the MVP, most homeless shelters aren't equipped to help seniors, especially those 65 and older. Not only are people who struggle with chronic homelessness aging, but many seniors are becoming homeless for the first time in their lives. Getting in and out of bunks, managing medications, and making it to a shared bathroom in time are among the major challenges of shelter life for older adults. The MVP is unusual among shelters because it provides on-site medical care to better serve its residents as they age. Last spring, Jamie Mangum, who is in her 50s and has lung cancer, tripped and fell in her room. Mangum said that in other shelters she'd likely have had to find her own way to an urgent care office or get an ambulance ride. Specialized case managers at the MVP have helped her get treatment for lung cancer as well. Maybe they were living independently before, but they were unable to maintain that and got evicted due to dementia or different things like that," said Baleigh Dellos, who manages the MVP shelter for The Road Home, a local nonprofit. Specialized medical case managers work at the shelter. Residents can even receive physical therapy in private spaces on-site. For people living on the streets, just keeping hold of regular medications is a challenge. Diabetes patients without homes often bury their insulin to keep it cold. Helping residents at the shelter get those medications can stabilize their conditions, allowing them to focus on other priorities, such as getting an ID and other documents they need to apply for disability, Social Security, and various programs that can help them secure housing. Nonprofits and local governments have opened similar shelters in Florida, California, and Arizona to meet the needs of older unhoused adults. In cold-weather states, denying seniors a bed because of mobility and other health issues can be especially risky. In 2022, a Bozeman, Montana, senior froze to death after he was asked to leave a shelter because of incontinence. "A typical shelter doesn't allow somebody on oxygen to come in because that's such a fire hazard and risk," she said. Synovec said giving seniors better access to health care inside shelters is the best way to help them succeed once they get housing. Health issues are a common reason seniors can't afford or maintain housing, she said. The MVP model is showing promise, both in Utah and elsewhere. "Over 80% of the people who've stayed in our program this past year have moved into stable or permanent housing," said Jacob Torner, vice president of programs for the TaskForce for Ending Homelessness in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The nonprofit runs a shelter called Elder Haven. The MVP shelter near Salt Lake City is also marking success. It was able to permanently house 36 seniors as of late last year. Still, there are more seniors in need of shelter than it can accommodate. For residents who do get a room, it's life-changing. Last spring, 62-year-old Jeff Gregg was playing fetch with his dog, Ruffy, just beyond the lawn in front of the MVP. An old back injury forced Gregg to hunch over as he threw the ball. It also fueled a decades-long addiction to opioids. That cycle was hard to escape, he said. "Fighting that, having a job, insurance, then losing the job, not having insurance, going out to the streets and being back in that crap, and I'd be back in the same position," he said. It took me a couple months, but I just kept plucking away," he said. This article is part of a partnership with NPR and Montana Public Radio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Based on our clinical experience, we suspected that rates of [ED] visits for infants would be increasing,” co-author Maria I. Garcia Lloret, MD, told Medscape Medical News. “As allergists, we receive regular referrals for infants experiencing food reactions, many times with an associated [ED] visit, and our study's findings were in line with our experience in the clinic.” Though national guidelines now recommend early introduction of allergenic foods to young children, whether these have affected ED encounters was poorly understood. To fill that knowledge gap, the study compared pediatric ED encounters at UCLA for FIR, including food-induced anaphylaxis (FIA), during the pre- and post-guideline periods, 2013-2016 and 2022-2024. The retrospective analysis of 67,059 ED visits identified 350 visits for FIR and 182 for FIA in patients age-stratified into two groups: infants 0-1 year and children 2-5 years. Overall, both FIR and FIA annual rates increased significantly over time. In multivariate analysis, post-guideline infants had an OR of 2.21 (95% CI, 1.37-3.55). Older children were more likely to have been evaluated by an allergist and prescribed epinephrine, with their caregivers educated on recognizing and managing allergic reactions, Garcia Lloret said. FIR rates remained stable in children aged 2-5 years (OR, 1.019 per year; 95% CI, 0.974-1.065; P = .419). Her center has now implemented an educational tool to guide families on the early introduction of allergenic foods, including the recognition and management of food reactions. “These have been distributed to our primary care offices and shared with families during infant well-child checks,” she said. Commenting on the study but not involved in it, Ruchi S. Gupta, MD, MPH, director of the Institute for Public Health and Medicine - Center for Food Allergy & Asthma and a professor of pediatrics at Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, said the findings make sense. Is it possible that early-introduction guidelines have been implemented too hastily? These data were so strong that we made recommendations for all infants.” Added Garcia-Lloret, “Aside from children with severe eczema and/or known food allergy, for whom we recommend allergist consultation, common allergens can be introduced to infants early. However, parents should receive the proper guidance on what to expect.” In otherwise normal infants, exposure to a food to which they are already sensitized will result in a mild urticarial rash that can be managed with antihistamines and at-home monitoring. “However, more severe reactions involving the respiratory or gastrointestinal systems can occur. This raises the concern for anaphylaxis and parents should also be educated on proper emergency care such as calling 911,” she said. Gupta added that the development of an eight-food introduction study is currently underway to learn more about factors influencing early sensitization and allergy. More families are introducing egg and peanut early, but once you introduce a food you must keep it in the diet, two to three times a week ideally, Gupta said. “Also, use a barrier cream around the mouth when introducing so there's no contact dermatitis, which can be mistaken for an allergic reaction.” Finally, introduce foods you eat in your family diet. Future studies should evaluate guideline adoption, parental guidance, and the long-term impact of early allergen introduction and whether guidance for high-risk infants reduces ED utilization, the authors wrote. Fortunately, despite these overall rising visit rates, those for food-induced refractory anaphylactic reactions remained stable. This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Center for Advancing Translational Science UCLA. Gupta reported receiving funds from Food Allergy Research and Education.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New evidence suggests that trapping iron in unusable forms may starve vulnerable neurons, challenging decades of thinking about iron toxicity in Parkinson's disease and opening new therapeutic questions. This iron may be in a trapped form, making it unavailable for the iron-dependent biological processes that are critical in dopaminergic cells, including mitochondrial respiration and dopamine synthesis. In a recent perspective published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers discussed evidence that challenges a long-standing scientific belief that Parkinson's disease is commonly hypothesised to be driven by toxic iron overload in the brain. For decades, abnormal iron accumulation has been linked to Parkinson's disease, particularly in the substantia nigra, the brain region most affected in those with the condition. This association led to the dominant hypothesis that excess iron drives neurodegeneration through oxidative stress and iron-dependent cell death pathways such as ferroptosis, although the causal role of ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease remains debated. Recent clinical trials suggest that chelating iron with the brain-penetrant agent deferiprone can worsen symptoms, especially in patients who have not yet initiated dopaminergic therapy. These unexpected findings have forced a reconsideration of the role of iron in Parkinson's and opened the door to an alternative explanation, functional iron deficiency. In such cases, total iron levels are normal or perhaps elevated, even as bioavailable ferrous iron (Fe2+), which is essential for cellular processes, is insufficient. This strategy was subsequently supported by evidence showing reduced activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an iron-dependent enzyme responsible for initiating dopamine synthesis. Early biochemical studies demonstrated that iron strongly stimulates TH activity. These insights prompted early clinical experiments with iron supplementation. Reports published during the 1980s described substantial symptom improvement in Parkinson's patients receiving iron therapy. Some were able to reduce or discontinue dopaminergic medications. Although these studies lacked modern trial design, they raised the possibility that iron deficiency, rather than excess, could limit dopamine production in those with the disease. Despite early hints that iron might be beneficial, there was a marked shift toward an iron overload hypothesis as imaging and histological studies revealed increased iron signals in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease. These findings, combined with growing interest in oxidative stress and ferroptosis, strengthened the belief that excess iron was toxic and should be removed. However, the lack of benefit and potential harm observed in iron chelation trials directly challenge this model. Instead, worsening symptoms suggest that iron removal may deprive already vulnerable neurons of the iron they need for survival and function, particularly at earlier disease stages. Ferric iron (Fe3+), which is relatively inert, is more readily detected by MRI and histological techniques because it is stored in dense forms such as ferritin and neuromelanin. In contrast, Fe2+ is the active form required for enzymatic reactions, dopamine synthesis, and mitochondrial respiration. MRI cannot distinguish between Fe3+ and Fe2+, nor can it identify which cell types or subcellular compartments contain iron. As a result, increased MRI iron signals may reflect sequestration of unusable Fe3+ rather than a surplus of functional iron. Additional mechanisms may worsen this problem in Parkinson's disease, including lysosomal dysfunction that prevents iron release into the cytoplasm and sequestration of iron within glial cells rather than dopaminergic neurons. Several lines of evidence strengthen the functional iron deficiency hypothesis. Disorders such as manganism resemble Parkinson's disease and disrupt iron handling, reducing the activity of iron-dependent enzymes like TH and mitochondrial aconitase. Deleting the transferrin receptor in mouse dopaminergic neurons causes iron deficiency, neuron loss, and Parkinson-like motor symptoms. Epidemiological data also link anemia and recent blood donation to increased Parkinson's risk, although these associations are observational and cannot establish causality. Taken together, the evidence challenges the idea that iron overload is a primary driver of Parkinson's disease. Instead, many findings are better explained by a model of functional iron deficiency, where iron is present but biologically inaccessible. This framework explains why iron chelation can worsen symptoms and why restoring iron bioavailability, rather than indiscriminately removing iron, may warrant further investigation, while accounting for disease stage and prior dopaminergic treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From fast nerve signals to microbial metabolites, scientists are uncovering the biological conversations between the gut and brain that may explain chronic pain, weight gain, and neurodegenerative disease, and point to a new generation of treatments that work by targeting communication rather than symptoms alone. Information can be transmitted from the gut lumen to the brain in a variety of ways, but recent research has highlighted four distinct categories of signaling. (A) In hormonal signaling, hormones from the gut epithelium are either released into the bloodstream (endocrine) or locally (paracrine), where they act via receptors to exert an effect. (B) In neuropod-mediated signaling, EECs form close connections that rapidly transmit information from the gut lumen to the CNS. In more proximal regions of the gut (i.e., stomach, small intestine), signals are typically transmitted via the vagus nerve and convey nutritive information. Neuropod signaling in more distal regions (i.e., colon) conveys information related to visceral pain and stretch, which are received by the brain via the dorsal root ganglia. Some of these changes induce an inflammatory response. Alternatively, microbes or metabolites (such as short-chain fatty acids) act locally on receptors to modify cell function. Responses can be modified via inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract, leading to increased permeability and allowing further immune interactions. Concurrently, top-down mechanisms have been described, including glucocorticoid-dependent activation of ENS microglia leading to inflammation within the gut epithelium. In a recent review published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers synthesized evidence from roughly 200 cited studies to elucidate the past decade of research on the “gut–brain axis.” The review delineates four distinct mechanisms of communication between these formerly thought-to-be distinct systems: hormonal signaling, direct neural connections, microbiome interactions, and immune system pathways. Review findings highlight how dysfunction in any of these communication pathways may contribute to disorders ranging from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) to Parkinson's disease (PD) and depression. Furthermore, it details how modern therapeutics leverage these pathways, demonstrating the clinical potential of targeting gut–brain communication. For more than 2,000 years, human academics have hypothesized a physiological link between the digestive system and the mind, a concept famously attributed to Hippocrates, who posited that “all diseases begin in the gut,” and William Beaumont, who observed that emotional states could visibly alter gastric function. Unfortunately, despite substantial advancements in medical science and research, the specific mechanisms underlying these observations remained unknown until recently. The present review aims to address this need by synthesizing data from human and animal studies over the past 10 years to construct an updated mechanistic framework of gut–brain interaction, while also outlining key translational challenges. The review included peer-reviewed publications across several interconnected research fields, including: Hormonal signaling: The gut has been identified as the body's largest endocrine organ, secreting over 30 hormones, most of which exert physiological effects elsewhere. For example, while serotonin is a known neurotransmitter essential for brain health, research has found that over 90% of it is produced in the gut, where it primarily acts locally and does not cross the blood–brain barrier. These studies have helped clarify mechanisms underlying obesity-related hormone dysregulation. While the hunger hormone ghrelin usually stimulates appetite, it is lower in individuals with obesity than in those with lower body mass indices (BMI), suggesting a state of hormonal resistance rather than hormonal excess. Direct “neuropod” connections: Recent research has identified neuropod cells, specialized sensory epithelial cells that form direct synapse-like connections with the vagus nerve. These cells can distinguish between sugar (using the neurotransmitter glutamate) and artificial sweeteners (using ATP) in milliseconds, influencing food preferences and reward signaling at far faster timescales than classical endocrine pathways, although the anatomical generalizability of these connections remains under investigation. Animal studies have shown that severing the vagus nerve (vagotomy) can prevent gut-to-brain propagation of PD-like pathology; however, the directionality and universality of this pathway remain controversial, with evidence also supporting possible brain-to-gut spread. Immune mediation: The review cites evidence that stress increases intestinal permeability through corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling. In animal models, colonic inflammation has been shown to trigger immune cells, such as monocytes, to migrate to the brain, inducing anxiety-like behaviors, although the clinical implications of stress-related permeability are often overstated. Encouragingly, the review also highlights modern clinical interventions such as linaclotide (for IBS) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (for obesity), which modulate gut–brain signaling pathways to reduce abdominal pain and promote weight loss, respectively, despite acting outside the primary symptomatic organ system. The findings suggest that neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease may, in some patients, be influenced by gastrointestinal processes, while digestive disorders such as IBS have demonstrable neural and central components.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nurses in critical care units who perceive higher levels of teamwork with their colleagues are more likely to take breaks during their shifts, according to new research from The Center for Health Design published in American Journal of Critical Care (AJCC). "Unit Layout and Critical Care Nurses' Perceptions of Visibility, Teamwork, and Taking Breaks" examined how the physical design of a critical care unit influences the nursing culture, finding that units that foster connection and collaboration may encourage break-taking behaviors. The study was conducted by Yolanda Keys, PhD, DHA, RN, NEA-BC, EDAC, research associate, and Ellen Taylor, PhD, AIA, MBA, EDAC, vice president for research. The layout of critical care units has evolved significantly, and many newly designed units have decentralized workstations with individual alcoves between patient rooms. Yolanda Keys, PhD, DHA, RN, NEA-BC, EDAC, research associate Prior research has found that leadership support, adequate staffing and intentionally designed break areas are essential to encourage nurses to take restorative breaks, mitigate burnout, retain a viable nursing workforce, encourage health-promoting behaviors, and foster resilience. Taking breaks during a shift is associated with lower rates of burnout, but breaks are often skipped, interrupted or compromised by workload factors. Of the nurses who responded to the survey, less than half (43%) were very likely or extremely likely to take a 30-minute meal break during a 12-hour shift, and 50% indicated they were not likely at all to take any nonmeal breaks. For the study, participants first selected which of 13 simple-to-interpret unit layouts most closely represented their own. The layouts were variations of three broad categories of unit types: racetracks with a closed middle section, racetracks with open centers where staff members are able to see across the entire unit, or variations of pod layouts. They then completed an online survey that included the Nursing Teamwork Survey and demographic questions, plus a researcher-developed scale asking about their ability to see patients from both a central location and in a patient room. In open-ended questions, approximately 80% of respondents also elaborated on physical barriers that prevented them from seeing co-workers or patients. The most frequently cited barriers to visibility included built environment obstructions, such as walls, columns and doors. Curtains, either on doors or inside rooms, were the second most mentioned barrier.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Detecting cancer in the earliest stages could dramatically reduce cancer deaths because cancers are usually easier to treat when caught early. The researchers developed an AI model to design peptides (short proteins) that are targeted by enzymes called proteases, which are overactive in cancer cells. Nanoparticles coated with these peptides can act as sensors that give off a signal if cancer-linked proteases are present anywhere in the body. Depending on which proteases are detected, doctors would be able to diagnose the particular type of cancer that is present. We're focused on ultra-sensitive detection in diseases like the early stages of cancer, when the tumor burden is small, or early on in recurrence after surgery." Bhatia and Ava Amini '16, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research and a former graduate student in Bhatia's lab, are the senior authors of the study, which appears today in Nature Communications. Carmen Martin-Alonso PhD '23, a founding scientist at Amplifyer Bio, and Sarah Alamdari, a senior applied scientist at Microsoft Research, are the paper's lead authors. More than a decade ago, Bhatia's lab came up with the idea of using protease activity as a marker of early cancer. The human genome encodes about 600 proteases, which are enzymes that can cut through other proteins, including structural proteins such as collagen. The researchers' idea was to coat nanoparticles with peptides that can be cleaved by a specific protease. Those peptides would be secreted in the urine, where they could be detected using a paper strip similar to a pregnancy test strip. "We have been advancing the idea that if you can make a sensor out of these proteases and multiplex them, then you could find signatures of where these proteases were active in diseases. And since the peptide cleavage is an enzymatic process, it can really amplify a signal," Bhatia says. The researchers have used this approach to demonstrate diagnostic sensors for lung, ovarian, and colon cancers. However, in those studies, the researchers used a trial-and-error process to identify peptides that would be cleaved by certain proteases. In most cases, the peptides they identified could be cleaved by more than one protease, which meant that the signals that were read could not be attributed to a specific enzyme. In their new study, the researchers moved beyond the traditional trial-and-error process by developing a novel AI system, named CleaveNet, to design peptide sequences that could be cleaved efficiently and specifically by target proteases of interest. "If we know that a particular protease is really key to a certain cancer, and we can optimize the sensor to be highly sensitive and specific to that protease, then that gives us a great diagnostic signal," Amini says. For a peptide that contains 10 amino acids, there are about 10 trillion possible combinations. Using AI to search that immense space allows for prediction, testing, and identification of useful sequences much faster than humans would be able to find them, while also considerably reducing experimental costs. For the training data, they used publicly available data on about 20,000 peptides and their interactions with different proteases from a family known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These sequences could then be fed into another model that predicted how efficiently each peptide would be cleaved by any protease of interest. To demonstrate this approach, the researchers focused on a protease called MMP13, which cancer cells use to cut through collagen and help them metastasize from their original locations. Prompting CleaveNet with MMP13 as a target allowed the models to design peptides that could be cut by MMP13 with considerable selectivity and efficiency. This cleavage profile is particularly useful for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. "When we set the model up to generate sequences that would be efficient and selective for MMP13, it actually came up with peptides that had never been observed in training, and yet these novel sequences did turn out to be both efficient and selective," Martin-Alonso says. These sensors could include detection of not only MMP-mediated cleavage, but other enzymes such as serine proteases and cysteine proteases. Peptides designed using CleaveNet could also be incorporated into cancer therapeutics such as antibody treatments. Using a specific peptide to attach a therapeutic such as a cytokine or small molecule drug to a targeting antibody could enable the medicine to be released only when the peptides are exposed to proteases in the tumor environment, improving efficacy and reducing side effects. Beyond direct applications in diagnostics and therapeutics, combining efforts from the ARPA-H work with this modeling framework could enable the creation of a comprehensive "protease activity atlas" that spans multiple protease classes and cancers. Such a resource could further accelerate research in early cancer detection, protease biology, and AI models for peptide design.
