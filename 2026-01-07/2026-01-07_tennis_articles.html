                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Switzerland reached the United Cup semifinals with a 2-1 victory over Argentina on Wednesday. Belinda Bencic and Jakub Paul won the deciding mixed-doubles match, as Bencic improved to 6-0 in singles and doubles to start the season. Switzerland, led by Belinda Bencic's unbeaten singles and mixed doubles record, advanced to the United Cup semifinals with a 2-1 win over Argentina in their quarterfinal tie in Perth. 11 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, stayed unbeaten to start the season with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Solana Sierra in singles. It was her partnership with Jakub Paul in mixed doubles, though, that sent Switzerland to Sydney, where they will face the winner of Czechia and Belgium. Bencic and Paul cruised to a 6-3, 6-3 win over Maria Lourdes Carle and Guido Andreozzi to secure the tie, and have now won all three mixed-doubles matches they have played this week. Against Sierra, Bencic broke serve in the third and seventh games of the opening set and took it 6-2. "It's what you hope for to kind of keep going how last season ended. So, of course, to keep the momentum. "It gives you a lot of confidence that you come out of the blocks pretty good, and you already have so much play before Australian Open is always very important, I would say. Now I think it's time to focus on Sydney." He backed it up with another strong performance against the 40-year-old Wawrinka, who had earlier posted a dramatic three-set win over Arthur Rinderknech. The seven-time tour-level winner saved all five break points he faced and pressured the former world No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings with his flat, penetrating groundstrokes. Baez has now won three matches at a tour-level hard-court event for only the second time in his career, previously doing so en route to the title in Winston-Salem in 2023. Switzerland reached the United Cup semifinals with a 2-1 victory over Argentina on Wednesday. Belinda Bencic and Jakub Paul won the deciding mixed-doubles match, as Bencic improved to 6-0 in singles and doubles to start the season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mirra Andreeva snapped a three-match losing streak to defeat Olivia Gadecki in her Brisbane International opener -- and having had to learn to deal with pressure, the 18-year-old had some sage advice for 17-year-old Emerson Jones, who fell to Liudmila Samsonova in her second-round match. Elsewhere, Amanda Anisimova cruised through in 63 minutes against Kimberly Birrell. In her season debut, Mirra Andreeva showed she was ready to reset. Andreeva broke into the Top 10 last year, highlighted by back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells, but faded as the season wore on. She went 4-5 after Wimbledon and ended 2025 with three straight losses, making Wednesday's comeback effort an encouraging start to the new year. After defeating Gadecki, Andreeva acknowledged that she had struggled -- but also learned from her experiences on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. "I did feel pressure from a lot of people, especially after I won the two tournaments," she said. "I felt like people would expect me to win Miami, and then they would expect me to win Madrid and Rome. And I was, you know, that's basically almost not possible. I have learned a lot from the last year, and if that happens this year, I certainly know what to do with this." 9 also had words of encouragement for another teenager drawing attention in Brisbane. Australia's 17-year-old Emerson Jones, the former junior world No. 1, followed up her first-round upset of Tatjana Maria with a Vogue Australia feature this week. Once Samsonova, a former Wimbledon quarterfinalist, settled into the match and imposed her power, she took control and won 12 of the final 14 games to close out a 6-4, 6-1 victory. Andreeva is one of many who has been impressed by Jones, just one year her junior, this week. "I just think that if I had a chance to tell her something, maybe I would have said not to focus on whatever people say," she told press. "Because there's going to be a lot of people that would say, 'Oh, you're going to be the next Sharapova or the next Ash Barty.' She's going to have her own career, and I think she should focus on making her own path in tennis." Home players had recently proved a consistent hurdle for her: Between the 2024 US Open and the end of 2025, she lost six of eight matches against opponents competing on home soil. Last year, she fell to Amanda Anisimova in Miami, Lois Boisson at Roland Garros, Taylor Townsend at the US Open and Zhu Lin in Ningbo. 204-ranked Gadecki, it looked like more of the same. The match turned at 1-1 in the second set, when Andreeva faced two break points that would have left her down a set and a break. She saved both with strong serving, then broke Gadecki in the next game with a trademark backhand down the line. From there she took command, winning 13 straight points to close out the second set and start the third, and never looked back. 2 seed Anisimova faces the challenge in 2026 of backing up a breakthrough year. And like Andreeva, she got off to a solid start against local opposition, needing just 63 minutes to dismiss wild card Kimberly Birrell 6-1, 6-3. Unlike Andreeva, Anisimova finished 2025 hot, backing up her pair of Grand Slam finals at Wimbledon and the US Open with her second WTA 1000 title in Beijing. 3 Anisimova slam 18 winners to her opponent's four. She ran off 11 consecutive points to close out the first set and start the second; a brief blip up 3-2 in the second set, when she double faulted to drop serve for the only time, was quickly shaken off. Anisimova's backhand on the run was arguably her most improved shot of 2025, and it was appropriate that she sealed match point with a scorching winner off that wing. Andreeva and Anisimova are both just one match away from meeting in the quarterfinals this week, though both will have to navigate tough third-round opponents first. 16 seed Marta Kostyuk, who defeated lucky loser Yulia Putintseva 6-7(5), 6-1, 6-0; she has defeated the Ukrainian just once in three meetings, and that was a 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 battle in last year's Doha quarterfinals. For the third year in a row, Andreeva will face Linda Noskova in Brisbane after the Czech No. 9 seed battled past Magdalena Frech 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-4 in 2 hours and 31 minutes. In her on-court interview, Noskova referred to struggling with a leg injury during the match. "Brisbane is not Brisbane if I don't play Linda, starting from the first year I came here," Andreeva said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison won their third straight deciding mixed-doubles match to send the defending champion United States into the United Cup semifinals in Sydney. Gauff opened the tie with a straight-sets win over Maria Sakkari. Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison extended their mixed-doubles success Wednesday in Perth, lifting the defending champion United States into the United Cup semifinals. Rallying from a set down against Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari, Gauff and Harrison won their third straight mixed-doubles match, 4-6, 6-4, [10-8], to keep alive the Americans' bid for a third United Cup title in four years. In a rollercoaster quarterfinal, Gauff gave the Americans an early lead with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Sakkari, marking Gauff's third straight win over Sakkari on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. But Tsitsipas answered with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over world No. 3 earned his first Top 10 win in more than 18 months, using a dominant serving performance to close out the straight-sets result. He fired an ace to fight off a set point at 4-5 in the second set and broke Fritz in the following game to set himself up to serve out the match. Tsitsipas improved to 9-2 at the United Cup in singles. It was his first Top 10 victory since defeating No. 10 Casper Ruud on his way to winning the 2024 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters title. Gauff delivered when it mattered most Wednesday, securing a composed 6-3, 6-2 victory over Sakkari in 1 hour, 26 minutes at RAC Arena to give the United States an early lead. The performance came just days after one of her more uneven recent outings, particularly on serve, but any lingering concerns quickly faded. 4 was in control from the opening games, dictating play throughout and never allowing Sakkari to establish momentum. "I think for me [the loss to Bouzas Maneiro] felt like one of my worst matches of my career," Gauff said Wednesday. Gauff posted much-improved numbers from the service line, landing 68% of her first serves while winning 76% of those points. After hitting 14 double faults just two days earlier, she cut that total to six against Sakkari en route to her 245th career victory. For Sakkari, the match was a step back in what has otherwise been a promising week, highlighted by wins over Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu. A former top 5 player, Sakkari enters the is currently No. The win marked Gauff's third straight over Sakkari and gives her a 6-5 edge in their head-to-head. In the semifinals, Gauff will meet either Australia's Maya Joint or Poland's Iga Swiatek, whom she defeated in last year's United Cup final. Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison won their third straight deciding mixed-doubles match to send the defending champion United States into the United Cup semifinals in Sydney. Gauff opened the tie with a straight-sets win over Maria Sakkari.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 27-year-old ATP Tour star finished with a 3-0 singles record for his country at RAC Arena in Perth, where he on Wednesday downed Team USA's Taylor Fritz 6-4, 7-5 for his first Top 10 victory in more than 18 months. Despite the Americans going on to clinch the tie with a deciding mixed-doubles triumph at RAC Arena, Tsitsipas was happy to reflect on the positives after he sank Fritz to improve to 4-2 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. It was not easy getting into the match. I've been absent for a long time and matches like this challenge you to the fullest,” Tsitsipas, who had not played a competitive match since September due to a back injury prior to arriving in Perth, told ATPTour.com. “I feel like you really get tested in the most brutal and intense ways against players that have been very consistent in the past couple of months. I was aware entering the court that my focus levels needed to be at their highest. “I couldn't allow myself to disconnect at any given moment during the match, and I delivered that excellently. I was trying to read play, trying to read the court and see what patterns he might start building up and liking a little bit more. I tried to stay away from those and played my game. I dominated from the baseline at times. It is one of those wins that adds to my confidence.” You May Also Like: Gauff, Harrison win deciding mixed vs. Greece to lead USA into United Cup SFs Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari were unable to overcome Coco Gauff and Christian Harrison in the mixed doubles clash as Greece missed out on a spot in the semi-finals in Sydney. Yet the 12-time ATP Tour champion Tsitsipas feels both he and his countrywoman would be taking plenty away from the encounter. I'm very proud of her, she did excellently. “We are building a great duo, me and her. I feel like every doubles match that we get to play, we come to new realisations about our games. We blend in quite well, and I feel like every match we've played, we've always received feedback and always understood how our games can interact even better. “Obviously it sucks losing today and not capturing that win to go to Sydney, but I see that as a greater opportunity to grow from it, use it in a positive way, and hopefully come back next year with hunger.” Tsitsipas, who revealed he is hoping to play the Adelaide International before heading to Melbourne for the Australian Open, was also elated at the way his body had held up across three singles matches and two mixed doubles rubbers in Perth. “So far everything is good,” said the 2023 Australian Open finalist, when asked about how he felt physically. “It's great feedback, knowing that sort of thing, knowing that I'm not feeling any aches or pains. Especially when you are dealing with so much pain and especially in the lower back, you are very discouraged pretty quick when you see yourself a few times in that same situation. Training doesn't become as enjoyable anymore. “I couldn't allow myself to disconnect at any given moment during the match, and I delivered that excellently.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daniil Medvedev maintained his impressive Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Frances Tiafoe on Wednesday at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ to reach his 90th tour-level quarter-final. Medvedev did not face a break point and won 91 per cent (31/34) of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to recording a comfortable 6-3, 6-2 win in 61 minutes. The top seed, who is chasing his 22nd tour-level trophy this week, now leads Tiafoe 6-1 in the pair's Head2Head series, with all seven of their meetings coming on hard courts. "The court is pretty fast so you need to serve well and I am happy with the way I served," Medvedev said. "I thought I played much better than in the first round, didn't face a break point, and that puts a lot of pressure on the opponent. I had a couple of good games on his serve and that was enough today." 13 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has yet to drop a set through his first two matches of 2026 and will aim to continue that form against Kamil Majchrzak. The Pole beat Reilly Opelka 6-7(2), 7-6(7), 7-6(8), saving three match points. In a battle between good friends, American Alex Michelsen overcame countryman Learner Tien 6-4, 6-2. The 21-year-old Michelsen trained with Tien during their teenage years and has had the better of the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion since their first meeting in Jeddah 13 months ago. Michelsen will meet Sebastian Korda in the quarter-finals. The 25-year-old advanced after the defending champion Jiri Lehecka was forced to retire due to an ankle injury, with Korda leading 6-3, 1-2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rallying from a set down against an inspired Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari, Gauff and Harrison won their third consecutive live mixed rubber 4-6, 6-4 10-8 on their third match point to keep alive the country's hopes of claiming a third United Cup title in the past four years. Today's other quarter-final in Perth sees Switzerland play Argentina. "I'm really happy that we're able to move through," Gauff said. "I felt I was playing really good today and that Christian was playing very well as well, and I knew that once we got some opportunities it would eventually swing out way." But Tsitsipas responded with a 6-4, 7-5 triumph over World No. 9 Taylor Fritz – his first Top 10 victory in more than 18 months. "I was fighting for the team and it was such a great match from my end," a delighted Tsitsipas said. "It's pretty straight forward when you are 0-1 down; I was aware of the level I needed to bring onto the court today. Putting 84 per cent of first serves into play in the first set put the Greek in an aggressive mindset. He won 80 per cent of first serves in the match. Tsitsipas improved to 9-2 at United Cup in singles. It was his first Top 10 win since defeating No. 10 Casper Ruud to win the 2024 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. Tsitsipas will partner Sakkari in the deciding mixed doubles against Christian Harrison and Coco Gauff. When Coco Gauff is at her best, it's not far-fetched to say the American puts the star in “stars and stripes”. So it came as no surprise that Gauff delivered in a big moment on Wednesday in the United States' quarter-final tie against Greece. 4 defeated Maria Sakkari 6-3, 6-2 in one hour and 26 minutes at RAC Arena to give the Americans an early lead in the tie. What made Gauff's performance even more impressive was that she was coming off one of her rougher outings in recent memory, particularly on serve. “Definitely a much better match today,” Gauff said in her on-court interview. “Last match, I just tried to erase it. That's the beauty of this tournament, and having a team like Taylor [Fritz] and Christian [Harrison] that gave me the chance to stay in the tournament and be able to prove myself better today. So definitely happy to give my team the lead today.” Gauff posted much-improved numbers from the service line, landing 68 per cent of her first serves while winning 76 per cent of those points. After hitting 14 double faults just two days earlier, she cut that total to just six against Sakkari en route to victory. For Sakkari, the match was a step back in what has otherwise been a promising week, highlighted by wins over Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu. Gauff's win marks her third straight over Sakkari, giving the American a 6-5 edge in their head-to-head. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!
