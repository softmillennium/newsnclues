                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new album is slated to drop later this winter. Harry Styles fans knew they were going to get a new music video on Friday (Jan. 23) for “Aperture,” the singer's latest single, but what they didn't realize beforehand was that they were going to get the tracklist to his upcoming album, too. Disco, Occasionally popped up, styled in the form of a circular spiral. Other intriguing titles include “American Girls,” “Season 2 Weight Loss,” “Pop” and “Dance No More.” Though fans got to hear the house-inspired, dance-inducing “Aperture” on Thursday (Jan. 22) and watch its music video the next day, they'll have to wait until March 6 to hear Kiss All the Time. The One Direction alum's next project will come more than three years after his last full-length, Harry's House, dropped in 2022 and spent two weeks at No. “It just became really obvious that it was music that was meant to be played loud,” Styles said of making Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally in a recent interview with John Mayer. “That is when it feels its best … I hope that people will kind of road test it in a couple different ways and see how their album experience kind of shifts.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He also said that instead of feather boas, he wants his fans to show up to his tour in their dancing shoes. Disco, Occasionally, is coming this spring — but will there be any featured artists joining him on the dance floor? In an interview with Capital Breakfast on Friday (Jan. 23), Styles managed fan expectations by revealing that — like all three of his prior solo albums — HS4 won't include any special guests. “There are no collabs on this album,” he said, choosing not to beat around the bush when asked about it point-blank. The musician's answer may not come as a surprise, as Styles has never been one for including duets on his albums. Elsewhere in the interview, the One Direction alum spoke about having to “fall in love with music all over again” during his three-year break from the spotlight after feeling burned out from his Love On Tour, as well as gushed about his lifelong love of Shania Twain, who will be joining him on a few dates of his recently announced Together, Together tour. And while Styles' fans have shown up to his shows in sparkles and feather boas in the past, the Grammy winner told Capital Breakfast that this time around, “I just want them to come ready to dance.” “I want them to come ready to be with their friends, close their eyes, open their eyes, dance, let it go and be whatever and whoever they are in that moment,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Upon his reelection, Trump nominated attorney and former Fox News talking head Harmeet Dhillon to serve as assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. Dhillon, who worked as a legal adviser for Trump's 2020 campaign, moved quickly to purge the division of senior officials and dismiss a slew of ongoing cases — many focused on police brutality and law enforcement misconduct. In a series of memos, Dhillon outlined that the division would be shifting its priorities to “Keeping Men out of Women's Sports” and “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling.” It was “really hard to write transition memos feeling like they were just going to go in the trash,” a former employee of the Civil Rights Division tells Rolling Stone. The former employee, who was granted anonymity to speak more freely about their experience, described the frenetic shuffling of staffers between departments and agencies amid the administration's early DOGE cuts and mass firings. “I think of the people that I worked with who filed complaints [to the DOJ] and were looking for help from the U.S. government, and just kind of completely disappeared on them,” they say. Others were confidential, as the department tends to keep active investigations under wraps until they determine a finding is in the public interest. Dhillon's management of the division was thrust back into the national spotlight this month after the DOJ refused to open an investigation into the killing of Renee Good, a Minneapolis mother of three who was shot and killed in her car by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Shortly after her murder, the Justice Department indicated that it would not launch a probe into the incident, with sources telling CBS News that the division's criminal section was explicitly ordered not to pursue an investigation into Good's killing — sidelining them from a case they would have typically pursued under past administrations. Instead, sources within the department told multiple outlets that the DOJ had begun investigating Good's widow, Becca Good, on allegations of impeding a federal officer and ties to activist groups. Dhillon, a prolific social media poster, boosted unfounded claims on social media that Good was associated with “Antifa”, and statements from Trump describing Good as a “professional agitator.” Epstein Survivors Are Compiling a List of His Associates: ‘We Know the Names' “They're all about clicks and PR,” Young says. “You're seeing Harmeet Dhillon not just prematurely announce investigations on social media, but threaten individuals and entities on social media.” “I mean, it's hard for the division to maintain any kind of integrity when its leader is willing to engage in that conduct.” Earlier this month, half a dozen Minnesota federal prosecutors resigned over the DOJ's  handling of Good's case. A group of activists — along with former CNN host Don Lemon, who was covering the protest — interrupted a service at the Cities Church in St. Paul. The protesters chanted “ICE out!” and “David Easterwood, out now!” They then left the church and marched to a nearby alley. “Whenever anyone conspires to violate the protected civil rights of American citizens, the Klan Act can be used to bring a conspiracy charge,” Dhillon told Johnson. It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws! Nor does the First Amendment protect your pseudo journalism of disrupting a prayer service,” she wrote. Phil Collins Says He's ‘Totally Mobile and Healthy' Following a ‘Difficult, Frustrating Few Years' Attorney General Pam Bondi added in a separate post that “attacks against law enforcement and the intimidation of Christians are being met with the full force of federal law.If state leaders refuse to act responsibly to prevent lawlessness, this Department of Justice will remain mobilized to prosecute federal crimes and ensure that the rule of law prevails.” Despite the incident being a peaceful demonstration, members of the administration — including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel — have described it in various instances as a “riot” or an “attack” on the church. The DOJ tried to bring charges against Lemon, as well, but a federal magistrate judge rejected the move, citing First Amendment protections for Lemon in his role as a journalist.

As an adult, however, Feldman entered a decades-long stint in the tabloid wilderness, working as an actor only intermittently after struggles with addiction and the trauma of alleged abuse as a child in the film industry. Related Stories ‘The History of Concrete' Review: John Wilson Illustrates How to Get Over a Beloved TV Show with a Moving and Hilarious Meditation on Death ‘Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!' Review: An Exuberant and Whimsical New Spin on the Grief Drama Feldman was a legitimately great actor with both dramatic (“Stand by Me”) and comic (“The ‘Burbs”) chops, but in the 1990s and beyond he became known less for his talent as a thespian than for his bizarre forays into pop music and for “Corey's Angels,” a group of attractive young women who lived in his house and served as his backup band. Feldman claimed they were aspiring actors and singers he was supporting; to the outside world it sometimes looked as though Feldman was exploiting them or even serving as a kind of amateur cult leader. Feldman's frequent assertions of his own abuse and exploitation when he was younger only served to complicate the issue. Documentarian Marcie Hume is one of those people who always found Feldman to be an intriguing figure, and in 2016 she began filming him for what would ultimately become “Corey Feldman vs. the World,” a riveting feature documentary that follows Feldman and his “angels” on tour. Hume was given incredible access to Feldman for around a year, and the film that resulted from it is astonishing — riotously funny, deeply troubling, and provocative in the complex questions it raises about celebrity, power, money, sex, abuse, and how they're all intertwined. Hume adopts a vérité approach that largely lets Feldman speak for himself — there's no editorializing, and there doesn't really need to be given that Feldman's life and personality are so dramatic that a straightforward presentation of the facts is plenty wild. Whatever your preconceived notions about Feldman are, Hume's film will expand and challenge them; the movie's greatness lies in its ability to capture all of Feldman's contradictions and self-destructiveness, empathizing with him without soft-pedaling his sins. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. IndieWire: What were the origins of this documentary, and what was your prior relationship to Corey Feldman and his work? Marcie Hume: I had a deep, visceral fascination and reaction to Corey, seeing him pursuing his music and making these self-produced videos. It was just jaw-dropping and unreal watching him try to establish a different type of career as somebody that many of us had grown up seeing in the limelight in a time when fame was very different. I made contact with his management and met with him and filmed a sizzle reel for a TV show that didn't sell. It took me quite a while to get from there to the documentary, because that was not as exciting or enticing to Corey and his management as a TV show. But then my film [“Magicians: Life in the Impossible”] came out, and I think they saw that I could make and finish a movie. I was invited to come film Corey's wedding in Las Vegas, so I packed up my gear and drove there, and that was the first thing I filmed for the documentary. He's learned not to trust people, so I just tried to be very friendly and open with him. He did try to establish control over everything, but that was really difficult when you're on the road in an RV or a bus with all of these people wanting to live their own lives. As we developed more of a rapport, he didn't really tell me what to do. Because seeing his reaction to the movie, over which he has zero control, it's quite extreme. And it has forced me to think about the idea of having no control over your own story and how scary that must be. We did let him tell his own story, and so much of the movie is from his own point of view. It was crucial to show his perspective and how it's the foundation of the world that he created and why these women are with him on tour and why things fall apart. But also, you see firsthand the ideas that he expresses himself, and you as an audience have to grapple with what is going on inside this man's mind. I cannot make a judgment about what is happening psychologically with him. Corey isn't only a victim and he isn't only a villain, and you have to sit with the fact that he can be harmed and also harm others. And we all have those contradictions — maybe not to the same degree, but we all want to behave a certain way and we all fail to behave the way that we want to all the time. There's no easy answer to any of it. I had my own bunk where I slept with my Canon 5D and my mic attached because I wanted to be ready at any moment to just take off the lens cap and start rolling. I have a filmmaking partner named Star Rosencrans who filmed when I was in New York or otherwise unavailable, and Bryan Donnell filmed one or two days with me. But other than that, it was just me and my 5D shooting Corey for about a year, which was the only way it could have happened. There wasn't room for anyone else either physically or personality-wise. It's been several years since you shot with Corey, so how long did it take you to go through the footage you had and find a shape for it? Eventually I found [editor and producer] Adam Franklin, who was already a Corey enthusiast. During the pandemic he had the time to sit and watch down all of the footage — and there was a lot of footage because I rolled as much as I could. We started talking about a structure and really staying squarely in Corey's point of view, until the aperture started to open to the perspectives of other people on tour. And honestly, that aperture continues to open for me now as I meet and talk with the women. Adam was almost supernatural in his ability to craft the story and let the humor come out without ever being mean or unfair. When did your relationship with Corey start to fall apart? He asked me if he could have my footage, and I said, “I'm sorry, Corey, but I've spent so much time and almost all my money on this movie. I didn't take other work to do this. When you're a documentarian, your empathy finds corners that it wouldn't in an average everyday relationship with someone. I thought there was a very good chance that he would like most of it because it is very much his point of view and who he is. He came over to watch the movie, and we did not get a chance to talk about it. He left before we had a chance to talk, and then the day before the premiere, we received a cease and desist. But the movie is out there, so has he actually been able to do anything to hurt it? Apparently Amazon errs on the side of extreme caution, so they have not put it back up even though there's no danger, which is a real shame. We're working on that and I would like it to be back up there. But otherwise I guess all has been fine. His claims are completely outrageous and baseless, but it's very much his way of dealing with the world. I think we need to treat this moment we're in in the industry as an opportunity to do things differently. I could never get attention on this film in the right way, and it blew my mind because to me I had a subject that was just so inherently intriguing and entertaining. I think some people really just don't like Corey and find him hard to watch, and some I just couldn't get to engage with the movie. I truly wouldn't know where to begin. This film almost killed me, and it's still killing me because I'm trying to get people to pay attention, and it's very difficult. I don't mean to be Pollyanna about it. It's going to get harder, but there are only so many people who know how to really make a movie and get it done. So if you're one of those people, it's your time to shine. Really figure it out and keep that light alive. “Corey Feldman vs. the World” is currently streaming on iTunes. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the general way Nihon Falcom's Trails games work has been pretty set in stone for a while—take jobs to help people out, learn about the world and those people and the problems of both while you do it, see the overall narrative progress as villains swoop in to do their thing—the longtime RPG developer still likes to play with structure. Last year's The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II instituted a rewind feature for Van Arkride and his Arkride Solutions crew that had you replaying sections of the game in order to avoid failure, injury, or even character death that had been baked into the narrative. Trails Into Reverie split the game up not just into acts with an intermission, as is the usual setup, but also broke you into separate paths with different parties, all converging on the same spot eventually and occasionally interacting with each other, sometimes without even knowing this was happening. It plays nearly exactly like its predecessors, only now Falcom has added even more bells and whistles to the action-oriented “Field” combat that lets you, without pause, fight enemies in an action RPG style instead of in a turn-based format, if you so choose: you can now briefly slow down time to deliver a series of big hits in a row to stronger foes and larger groups of enemies so that these action-oriented battles go by more quickly, and there's also a charge meter that lets you deliver devastating, powerful blows to rip through even the game's “A-level” monster threats. In the “Command” battles—the turn-based ones—you can now use some of your built-up ability meter to set yourself up for back-to-back turns by a single character, and there are additional support opportunities from allies who aren't in your party to extend combos and dish out more damage per turn. If those games felt good in your hands, then this one will, too. Trails Beyond The Horizon, of course, would share DNA with the preceding Daybreak games, in cast and in location and in general gameplay, but Trails Into Reverie and Trails In The Sky The 3rd get more than just a little shine and callbacks here, as well, in terms of structure and themes. Trails Beyond The Horizon also gleefully borrows the penchant of both games to turn previous villains into uneasy, unlikely allies in the present in a way that lets you get a better sense of who they are and how they can be different—a perfect fit for the Trails subseries that focuses on those characters who straddle the line between lawful and chaotic, who live in the gray by choice or because society has forced that upon them. There's a tension in the game nearly from the start when it becomes clear that everyone has their own agendas that they are unwilling to share for one reason or another—because a character or group likes to hold their cards close to the chest in general, because they are from another country and are wary of spilling secrets to a now-ally but former foe, or because a certain protagonist is hiding things from everyone, even their closest confidants and established allies. There's an unease to it for you, the player, since you're aware of the personalities and motivations of all these characters, who you've grown accustomed to liking and appreciating, and who now might very well be in conflict with each other. It's all told in an exceptional fashion that will have you guessing even when you think you know what's going on or why any decision is made by the characters in question. Trails Beyond The Horizon is a 70-hour game that feels much, much denser than that, one that keeps piling new twists and realizations on top without those moments ever feeling forced, because they have been earned over the course of not just this subseries' three games, but over the 13 that make up Trails as a whole. That decision made plenty of sense in the moment, given how many loose ends there are to tie up for a series that is heading toward its overall conclusion—yes, a video game series telling a complete, start-to-finish story is allowed if publishers will only let it happen—but it is even more justified after seeing how Trails Beyond The Horizon plays out. Trails Through Daybreak II is its own worthwhile story and entry in the series, but it's also 60 hours of staging for what's to come, a slowed-down look at the game world and its characters to prepare you for the breakneck pace of Trails Beyond The Horizon, which is Vladimir Lenin's quote about weeks where decades happen given video game form: the entire game takes place over a matter of days, with a clear deadline for its story to wrap up, and it is incredible how much happens in that span and how different the world is when it wraps. Every little thing that has popped up in the Daybreak games to this point, whether new or building on previous Trails' subseries, matters in Trails Beyond The Horizon. Falcom is so on top of it that they even manage to make the protagonist of the Cold Steel games, Rean Schwarzer, not an annoying distraction here, and instead a fit for what he's used for that doesn't detract from the experience. But it also doesn't just tug at your heartstrings; it rips them right out of your chest not just with what actually happens in front of your eyes, but the implications of it, as well. As you can imagine given all of this detail above, Trails Beyond The Horizon is arguably the least-newbie-friendly game that Falcom has ever produced, but that's not a negative nor a reason to ding it. Earn your way to this game's payoffs, which tie together even moments you might have once thought wouldn't matter beyond the one in which they were experienced, or ones you had even forgotten about entirely. Falcom didn't just bring Kevin Graham back because it had been awhile—it is bad news when he shows up, because his job is to dirty his hands in the tasks no one else is equipped to handle, either mentally or physically. His being partnered with the Picnicking Front here—a group that, despite its intentionally goofy, lunch-loving namesake, is full of former child assassins, a major (former) series antagonist, and a constructed consciousness so powerful it's been used for evil in the past—is no mistake. Graham is a conflicted misfit with dangerous abilities unsure of his own place in the world as well as his worth, with a weariness and desire for things to be different and an inability to know how to make them so. You can get a sense of that from how everyone discusses him within the context contained solely in Trails Beyond The Horizon, sure, but it all works so much better if you have lived through the very struggles that still haunt him, as you do in Trails In The Sky The 3rd. The same goes for understanding what the Picnicking Front's whole deal is, which you need the Trails Of Cold Steel games, Trails Into Reverie, and Trails Through Daybreak II for in order to paint a complete picture of what is a whole bunch of tragic backstories and presents aiming to make the characters more than “just” that. Trails is the most ambitious epic in games, and that's only becoming truer with each new entry that builds on the previous ones. Which, if you want to experience Trails Beyond The Horizon in full, go start with that. It's been said before, but you don't start a lengthy book series in the middle; why would you do that with Trails, unless FOMO is your primary driving force? The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Beyond The Horizon was developed by Nihon Falcom and published by NIS America. Our review is based on the Switch 2 version.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The “Good Place” alum, 39, took to Instagram Stories on Thursday to address her texts with Justin Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, which were uncovered in recently unsealed court documents. Just gender equity,” Jamil said in a video, per The Hollywood Reporter. “It does not mean you have to like every single woman. It doesn't mean you have to be friends with every single woman. It means you can actually beef with other women. The self-proclaimed feminist and activist continued, “That's all feminism is. It is not a sleepover where we braid each other's pubes, OK?

Jamil curtly replied, “She's a suicide bomber at this point.” Later in their conversation, Abel expressed that she hated Lively “so much,” to which Jamil agreed. “I've never seen such a bizarre villain act before,” the “She-Hulk” actress texted. A source close to the matter exclusively told Page Six Thursday that Jamil's comments were “disappointing.” Rumors of Lively and Baldoni's feud sparked in August 2024 after their movie, “It Ends With Us,” premiered in New York City. By December, Lively filed an official complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of sexually harassing her on set, before officially suing him. This past summer, a judge dismissed both of Baldoni's countersuits; however, Lively's legal battle against the actor is still ongoing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paris Hilton discussed the 2004 release of a sex tape that featured her during an appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Hilton, accompanied by Democratic New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Florida representative Laurel Lee, the reality star gave an impassioned speech about the importance of protecting women from similar incidents. “When I was 19 years old, a private, intimate video of me was shared with the world without my consent,” Hilton said. Hilton made the appearance in support of the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act, or DEFIANCE Act. The bipartisan legislation would allow victims of AI-generated, sexually explicit content to take legal action against people who create it, distribute it, and solicit it with the intent to distribute. “There were no laws at the time to protect me,” Hilton explained. “There weren't even words for what had been done to me. These people didn't see me as a young woman who had been exploited. Hilton explained that she had the platform to reclaim her story, but “so many others don't.” “And what I've learned is that when your image is violated, it doesn't disappear; it lives inside you, but so does your power,” she said. “Telling the truth has helped me heal, and I am so proud that today I stand here without shame.” When I was 19, a private video of me was shared without my consent — and there were no laws to protect me. What people called a “scandal” was actually abuse, and it's something survivors are still facing today. That's why today, I spoke on Capitol Hill with @Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and #LaurelLee about the DEFIANCE Act 🏛️🩷 This bipartisan bill strengthens legal protections for survivors of AI-generated explicit deepfakes giving people real options to fight back and seek justice when intimate images are shared without consent. The sex tape was filmed by Hilton's then-boyfriend Rick Salomon. Phil Collins Says He's ‘Totally Mobile and Healthy' Following a ‘Difficult, Frustrating Few Years' Now Green Day Have Entered the Chat In 2021, Hilton described the sex tape to Vanity Fair as “something that will hurt me for the rest of my life.” “It was a private experience between two people,” Hilton said. “You love someone, you trust someone and to have your trust betrayed like that and for the whole world to be watching and laughing… It was even more hurtful to me to have these people think that I did this on purpose — that killed me. In the film, Hilton will confront the often deeply misogynistic ways she was portrayed in the media, and discuss her experiences at troubled teen schools, where she claimed she was abused.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Abby Ryder Fortson and Sam Waterston also star in Rachel Lambert's story of a divorced doctor struggling to reconnect with or pull away from a former girlfriend. Whether playing sexy comedy or hostility, raw emotional agita or hollowness, Chris Pine and Jenny Slate are so damn fine in Carousel that you keep wondering why we seldom get to see these gifted actors bite into characters of such substance and complexity. Rachel Lambert's latest is a strange and beguilingly lovely relationship drama. But first, the writer-director needs to get out of her own way, peeling away the fussiness and frustration of her oblique approach and finally cutting back on her overbearing use of a cascading score to give us unfettered access to characters about whom it's clear she cares deeply. Not to pile onto composer Dabney Morris, who presumably is doing what was asked of him, but the wall-to-wall music of the opening scenes is almost a deal-breaker. Dramatic Competition)Cast: Chris Pine, Jenny Slate, Abby Ryder Fortson, Sam Waterston, Katey Sagal, Heléne York, Dagmara Domincyzk, Jessica Harper, Jeffrey DeMunn, Tien TranDirector-screenwriter: Rachel Lambert There are moments early on that draw us in, notably between Noah (Pine), a Cleveland doctor with a small family medical practice, and his teenage daughter Maya (Abby Ryder Fortson), when he drops her at school and she has a full-blown panic attack after realizing she left some important papers at home. Lambert clues us in quickly that Maya is suffering from anxiety and depression, and the way Noah tiptoes around her — showing support and concern but holding back as if by not making a big deal of it, the problem will go away — is quietly affecting. It's carefully blocked but lived in and spontaneous as Noah and Rebecca cycle through anger, regret, self-justification and defeat, setting the drama on a decisive new trajectory from which it never looks back. The pair were a couple back in school, their relationship ending in bitterness and resentment when Rebecca left Cleveland to pursue a career in the political sphere and Noah chose to stay put and start a family. When they initially reconnect through Maya at a farmers market, it seems as if they barely knew each other — beyond being cast in the same production of Fiddler on the Roof. Noah is bruised by his recent divorce from Maya's mother (Dagmara Domincyzk), saddened by the decision to retire of his mentor at the financially precarious clinic (Sam Waterston), and we later learn, grieving from the unexplained but seemingly tragic loss of his father. But he's so inured to shoving aside his troubles so he can keep a vigilant eye on Maya that a complicated romantic relationship with Rebecca feels like more than he can handle. The minute Maya is out of the picture for a summer studies program at Stanford, Noah falls apart, literally unable to pick himself up and even get out of the airport for what seems like days. The love between the central couple is never in doubt, but hesitancy is a big part of this romantic drama. Lambert is clear-eyed and perceptive about the emotional safeguards people put up to protect themselves from the messiness of relationships. The long final scene, melancholy but beautiful, again framed from a detached distance, this time in half-light, encapsulates that sense of hope with pleasing delicacy. Returning to solitude as a central theme after Sometimes I Think About Death, the director has made a flawed movie that requires patience, but it delivers in the end, thanks in large part to the sensitive work of three excellent leads. Slate's Rebecca at first glance has a brittle aspect but slowly reveals a yearning that makes her question her choices. And Fortson, who was such a radiant discovery in Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret, is maturing into a first-rate actor, alternatively heartbreaking and resilient. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

When John Wilson thinks about concrete, the erstwhile star of HBO's “How to With John Wilson” thinks about DMX, Hallmark movies, Kim Kardashian, public diarrhea, a trailblazing Asian American judge, the world's first 3D-printed Starbucks, and a 3,100-mile footrace that honors a dead Brooklyn cult leader. What do those things have in common? Maybe a little bit less than that. But definitely, definitely at least this: They're all things that John Wilson thinks about when he thinks about concrete. And that turns out to be all the connective tissue we need to appreciate the relationship between them. Related Stories Corey Feldman's Documentarian Marcie Hume on Why the '80s Teen Icon Is More Than Just a ‘Victim' or ‘Villain' ‘Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!' Review: An Exuberant and Whimsical New Spin on the Grief Drama A sweetly Dantean scavenger who collages this broken existence back together from an endlessly amusing library of first-person video snippets and unpredictable detours (his clips layered with a quizzical voiceover that warps their images into cheeky visual puns, and evokes the affect of an alien kindergartner sending travelogues about life on Earth to its friends back home), Wilson makes sense of the world by sanding the edges off its infinite strangeness. Much like the episodes of his show (very much like, to the point of being indistinguishable, aside from its length), Wilson's consistently hilarious and sneakily profound “The History of Concrete” is sustained by an internal tension between order and entropy. This meandering but laser-focused essay film is, like the best episodes of Wilson's show, sustained by parallel dramatic questions that inevitably answer each other by the end. (The series finale of “How To” is especially relevant, as its search for lasting purpose amid the transience of all things perfectly tees up this debut feature). The first is as simple as it gets: What is Wilson going to do with himself now that his short-lived but deeply beloved premium cable TV series is over? The second is more complicated, even though it's basically the first question in disguise: How is Wilson going to cut all the footage he's been shooting ever since into a coherent rationale that allows him to rescue a convincing sense of peace from his jobless uncertainty? It would be a waste of time to walk you through how Wilson gets from 49-cent royalty checks and rueing his life as a Ridgewood landlord to the oldest buildings in Rome and a brick-laying contest in Las Vegas, but suffice it to say that concrete — everyone's favorite composite material composed of aggregate bound together with fluid cement — serves as the great connector. Wilson is compelled to the substance because he recognizes how well it straddles the divide between false permanence and ephemerality. People make skyscrapers and highways out of it. They scratch their names into the mixture before it dries as a bid for immortality. It is nothing less than the backbone of modern infrastructure. And yet, concrete only lasts for about 40 years before it starts to crumble. I've already held out for longer than that, and my body is made out of mushy stucco and wiry gray hair. Even the most solid things on Earth aren't meant to last forever. And Wilson must understand that at heart, as he ended “How To” on his own accord. But as anyone knows who's ever lost — or even voluntarily relinquished — a foundational piece of themselves, to understand loss is not the same as to accept it. And “The History of Concrete” is nothing if not a sprawlingly beautiful self-portrait of a man trying to strike a balance between letting go and holding on. The existential anxiety of that mission provides “The History of Concrete” an even deeper bedrock of wistfulness than could be found in the flooded basement of Wilson's previous work (among this movie's other miracles: It made me sympathetic towards a New York City landlord). That context is probably enough to appreciate some of the film's most delightful asides, such as a profile of the man behind GumBusters — a business that power blasts old gum off the streets of NYC — and a brief aside into the temporary venues that host Wilson's favorite DIY noise shows. By the same token, fans of his work will be familiar with how “The History of Concrete” looks askew at its hero characters without ever looking down on them. And no hero character in any of Wilson's previous stuff plays a larger role than part-time rock-and-roller Jack Macco, who Wilson meets when the guy is handing out free tequila samples at a liquor store. While Macco is an undeniable eccentric, and there's something a little sad about the empty bar gigs he plays along the Jersey shore (a sadness made that much stronger by his bandmates' refusal to rehearse), he gradually comes to embody the core truth at the heart of Wilson's work: There's more to everybody than meets the eye. It isn't long before Macco's set list — a careful negotiation between originals and covers — erupts into an existential dilemma over the push-and-pull between creation and inertia, which in turn leads to a wildly unexpected personal revelation that confronts us with a universe of new possibilities at the same time as it bring the film back to its nucleus of grief. That circularity is a defining staple of how Wilson has always shaped his vision of the world, and, perhaps even more than the filmmaker's signature aesthetic, is the thing about this movie that might engender the feeling that he's simply repeating himself with a longer running time. I don't think Wilson would deny that. That comfort can be manufactured, even inauthentic, but everyone needs to make their own sense of this merciless world if they want to enjoy living in it. John Wilson finds the same from stringing “random” things together until life itself begins to resemble a wildly bizarre — and oddly soothing — evidence board in the case he's building against meaninglessness. Humanity has long regarded the lack of a grand design as an invitation to create their own, and you don't have to believe in the connections that Wilson makes in “The History of Concrete” to appreciate how the act of making them keeps the world from crumbling around him, and allows him to make his own kind of peace with the fact that it will some day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Co-helmed by Neil Berkeley, the Sundance-premiering film delves into Bamford's mental health and professional journeys. It's rare to see a lofty executive as front-and-center in a documentary as Netflix's Ted Sarandos is in Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley‘s Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story. Sarandos takes justifiable pride in Bamford's career, since Netflix helped launch her mainstream visibility with the documentary The Comedians of Comedy and then fronted two seasons of Bamford's surreal and semi-autobiographical Lady Dynamite, which Sarandos boasts he bought from co-creator Mitch Hurwitz based on only a brief hallway pitch. Sarandos even calls Lady Dynamite his favorite Netflix original, a likably quirky choice, though he goes one step too far. Judd Apatow on Mel Brooks, Interviewing Rob Reiner and What It'll Take to Revive Studio Comedies Venue: Sundance Film Festival (Premieres)Directors: Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley “Critics really did love the show, but then they didn't talk about it much in the second season,” Sarandos declares, to which I can only say: I know at least one critic who had the second Lady Dynamite season in his Top 10 list for 2017. She has built a career on people taking personal ownership over “discovering” her. With every success, pundits have tipped her as being on the verge of breaking out, as if she craved something “bigger,” when the truth is that with her avant-garde eccentricities and increasingly confessional approach to her battles with mental illness, Bamford has never seemed destined for stadium tours. So anyway, Maria Bamford seems to be on the verge of breaking out with Paralyzed by Hope, a 115-minute exploration of Bamford's personal and professional journey from Duluth to Altadena, with myriad roadblocks — depression, OCD, suicidal ideation, family tensions — along the way. The documentary has one serious problem that won't bother many viewers and doesn't fully detract from a portrait that blends the candid, silly, uncomfortable, sad and triumphant, just like Bamford herself. The most Bamford-ian part of the documentary is actually the beginning, with Apatow and crew arriving at Bamford's house, offering her a banana and a small cash payout — “Maybe we have no ethics here,” Apatow confesses — and sitting down for a casual conversation that Bamford compares to dating. The documentary is well-represented with Bamford's various colleagues, comics like Jackie Kashian, who met her at open mics in Minneapolis in the '90s, and Patton Oswalt, Bamford's Comedians of Comedy touring partner, who says without hesitation that when he first saw Bamford onstage he didn't get her. Oswalt is far from the only person who required some exposure to understand Bamford, whose material has evolved to include Andy Kaufman-esque anti-comedy absurdity and those impressions, which have always been astonishing. Bamford's stand-up has been primarily autobiographical for years and she's covered her stints in mental wellness facilities, her struggles to find a proper diagnosis and medication, her bumpy relationship with her family and several prominent tragedies in cable specials, talk show appearances, podcasts and, yes, in Lady Dynamite, which critics apparently didn't support enough. Apatow frames several of those oft-discussed biographical details as surprises in a way that felt a little cheap to me — not grossly manipulative, but not exactly additive. In contrast to how Lady Dynamite depicted Bamford life, with its boundary-pushing whimsy and expressive weirdness, Paralyzed by Hope is shaped by a very straightforward, somewhat dry and largely familiar approach. Because Maria Bamford is on the verge of breaking out, but apparently not there yet. So it's a good opportunity to fall in love with Maria Bamford if you're unfamiliar.
