                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Binance founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao said his business relationship with President Donald Trump's family has been "misconstrued" in the wake of his pardon. "There's no business relationships whatsoever," Zhao told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on Thursday in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The former Binance CEO served four months in prison after pleading guilty in 2023 to charges he enabled money laundering during his time leading the company. Trump's pardon in October 2025 drew attention to Binance's ties to World Liberty Financial, a crypto company run by the president's family. The connection stems from a $2 billion investment in March 2025 by state-owned firm MGX of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, into Binance. MGX paid using USD1, a stablecoin created by World Liberty Financial. Zhao stepped down as Binance's CEO in 2023 as part of the plea deal and $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. "My request to them was they pay us in crypto. I don't want to deal with banks, really." Zhao told CNBC the company has since converted that investment out of USD1 in portions over time. Just because I accepted that, it doesn't mean I invested in the issuer of that," he said. "A lot of people say that he wasn't guilty of anything," Trump said, when asked later why he issued the order. "And so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people." NBC News reported the week of Trump's pardon that Binance had recently hired lobbyist Charles McDowell's firm, Checkmate Government Relations. McDowell is a friend of Donald Trump Jr., the president's son. Checkmate disclosed that it was paid $450,000 for work that included lobbying the White House and Treasury Department for "executive relief" and "financial services policy issues relating to digital assets and cryptocurrency." "There is a lot of media saying that there is some deal in place to get me the pardon," Zhao told CNBC at Davos. CNBC has reached out to World Liberty Financial for comment. Zhao told CNBC at Davos that he has still not spoken directly with Trump. "The closest that I got to him was today when he was doing the Board of Peace session," Zhao said. "I was in the audience, about 30 to 40 feet away from him." "I have no idea who he is," Trump said. "I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration." — CNBC's Jacqueline Corba contributed to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google rolled out a powerful new feature to AI Mode in Search this week. This was also launched recently in Gemini, Google's AI chatbot. Business Insider's Pranav Dixit tried it and was blown away. Personal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook. With my permission, Gemini can tap into my Google account — Gmail, Photos, Search history, YouTube, and more — and reason across all of it to answer questions the way a human assistant might, except this one has years of receipts on my life. This is something I've wanted since AI-powered chatbots blew up in late 2022. Back then, I'd pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer. Then, the bot would immediately forget I existed, like a genius goldfish. Over the last few years, OpenAI and Anthropic have enabled their chatbots to connect to services like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. But Google has home field advantage: it already has the broadest view of what you've actually done, searched, watched, and saved. Gemini's ability to connect the dots is scary-good, well beyond what ChatGPT or Claude can do. When I asked it for sightseeing ideas for my parents, who have already visited the Bay Area a few times, it suggested museums and gardens, correctly inferring they've already done hikes and trips to redwood forests. When I asked Gemini how it knew, it told me it deduced this based on "breadcrumbs" left across my Google account: Family emails, photos of Muir Woods, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for "easy hikes for seniors." VP Josh Woodward said Google takes "steps to filter or obfuscate personal data" from the conversations we have with Gemini. I also asked Gemini when my car insurance was up for renewal and it correctly told me, based on emails from AAA in my Gmail inbox. This is the future every AI company keeps promising. Last year, Meta said its new north star wasn't "the metaverse" — that alternate VR universe the company is literally named after — but "personal superintelligence," an AI that "knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them." One path to that vision: AI-powered glasses that can see and hear what you see and hear, turning everyday life into the raw material for an always-on assistant. To get there, Meta has poured billions of dollars into a hiring spree and into the data centers needed to run it all. And after Meta killed Supernatural, my favorite VR workout app, I have very little reason to use its Quest headset anymore. Meta talks about "personal superintelligence" as a future goal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former official of U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration is planning a multi-billion-dollar data center project in a remote corner of Greenland, as hyperscalers scramble to build out capacity across the globe to keep up with the AI rollout. The data center is aiming to be operational at 300 megawatts (MW) by mid-2027, before further expansion would see it hit 1.5 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2028. The Greenland data center project will cost billions of dollars to complete and has binding commitments with investors to finance half of its initial phase of development and half of the final phase, Drew Horn, a senior aide to Trump's first-term vice president Mike Pence and CEO of GreenMet, a company that's offering strategic support to the project, told CNBC. Technical partners have been enlisted to help with the physical buildout, but the project has yet to secure land or approvals from the local authorities, Horn said. Commercial opportunities in Greenland have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Arctic island has become the center of a geopolitical firestorm after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on acquisition talk. Critical minerals mining and freshwater reserves have been touted as potential prospects, though skeptics point to logistical challenges around tapping into them with Greenland's limited infrastructure. Data center deals hit a record $61 billion in 2025 amid a rush to build out the infrastructure needed to power energy-intensive AI workloads. Big tech firms, including Meta, OpenAI, Oracle, AWS, Microsoft and Google are investing huge sums into developing facilities across the globe. Work on plans for the Greenland data center project began a year ago, and Horn told CNBC it has secured technical partners to assist with construction, operation and supplying energy. Committed financing, which is in the form of debt and equity, is contingent on the project meeting key milestones, including securing permits from local government, said Horn — who was also a senior advisor to both the energy and intelligence departments towards the end of Trump's first term. Other former senior Trump employees also have stakes in GreenMet, which says on its website that it helps companies with government and private funding and strategic partnerships. George Sorial, who was an executive vice president and chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization until 2019, and Keith Schiller, who was a longtime bodyguard for Trump and director of Oval Office operations during the U.S. president's first term, helped set up the company in 2021 and remain shareholders. "We are not actively involved with GreenMet or Greenland," Sorial told CNBC. Schiller had not responded to a CNBC request for comment as this story went live. CNBC has approached Denmark's U.S. embassy for comment. Tensions have cooled since Trump backtracked on plans to impose tariffs on several European nations over the issue, but questions still remain as negotiations around U.S. military and economic involvement in Greenland continue. "Our effort, which is purely private, it succeeds only if we have the buy-in from the relevant affected parties and countries," Horn said. "Larger corporate entities" will be taking the lead on the construction and development of the data center, but GreenMet will continue to be involved as an advisor as the project looks to secure government investment from nations including the U.S., Greenland, Denmark, and other NATO countries, Horn told CNBC. "We've spent about a year putting together everything from the power to the technology components, [and] we have a Greenlandic partner on the ground," Horn said. "Right now we're waiting on approvals from the Greenlandic side." A big challenge for projects of this scale in Greenland is access to power. Greenland's Ministry of Business has been approached for comment. Horn argues that if local authorities greenlight the large hydroelectric facility, energy prices will make the project commercially viable long-term. There are some significant advantages to building data centers in an environment with low temperatures, analysts told CNBC. "The biggest value sits in its resource profile, specifically in hydro for electricity generation and a 'free cooling' proposition given the lower ambient temperature," Noah Ramos, strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, told CNBC. But there are hurdles the project will have to overcome. Nvidia is also touting a new generation of chips that require less cooling. "It's early days, but if future generations of chips are even more efficient in this regard, it could negate the need for expensive data centre build outs in places like Greenland," Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel shares plunged more than 15% on Friday after the chipmaker issued lackluster guidance and warned of a supply shortage. During a fourth-quarter earnings call with analysts Thursday, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company wouldn't be able to meet full demand for its products. He said production efficiency, or yield, is also below his targets. "We are on a multiyear journey," he said. The chipmaker expects first-quarter revenue to range between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share to break even. That was below LSEG expectations for earnings of 5 cents per share and $12.51 billion in revenue. The company's foundry business has long underperformed competitors, which are profiting massively from the data center artificial intelligence boom. The company's foundry business creates chips for other companies. CFO David Zinsner told CNBC that Intel expects customers for its next-generation 14A technology to appear in the second half of the year. But analysts at RBC Capital Markets warned that a "meaningful revenue contribution" from 14A customers may not pop up until late 2028. "We appreciate the recent excitement around opportunity for INTC but still don't see a clear path forward given further share loss, no AI strategy and unclear fab/packaging opportunities," wrote analysts at Jefferies. Despite the soft outlook, Intel topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings and revenue expectations.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boneless wings are one of the most popular options at chain restaurants on game day, and chains that specialize in chicken wings, such as Wingstop, are also experiencing significant growth. We ranked boneless wings from five chain restaurants — Applebee's, Chili's, Buffalo Wild Wings, TGI Fridays, and Wingstop — based on taste and value. At Buffalo Wild Wings, an order of 15 boneless wings, which included up to three different sauce flavors, cost $24.99, excluding tax. Given that the chain is famous for its wings, I was surprised that the chain's boneless wings landed last in my ranking. They had a sweet buttery flavor without packing too much spice. Of the three kinds I tried from Buffalo Wild Wings, these were my favorite. In some ways, these boneless wings reminded me of standard chicken nuggets. Boneless wings are made exclusively from chicken breast, while nuggets are typically made from a blend of various chicken parts. I ordered boneless wings from TGI Fridays in three flavors: Buffalo, garlic Parmesan, and apple-butter barbecue. I ordered them as part of the chain's combo platter, which lets you choose three appetizers. At the TGI Fridays I visited in Massachusetts, the order cost $18.29, excluding tax, and came with eight of each flavor wing. TGI Fridays doesn't seem to have its own house Buffalo sauce and instead douses its wings in Frank's Red Hot Buffalo sauce, a pretty standard grocery-store hot sauce. Compared to the other Buffalo boneless wings I tried, these were just average. The wings had a crunch when I bit in — which I didn't quite get with the Buffalo boneless wings — and paired excellently with the chain's ranch. I could distinctly taste the apple butter in this sauce, which gave it a sweet, almost molasses-like flavor. However, Wingstop's senior director of culinary, Larry Bellah, told BI that the chain's bone-in traditional wings are still its most popular offering. Bellah also said the five most popular sauce flavors at Wingstop are lemon pepper, Original Hot, hickory-smoked barbecue, garlic Parmesan, and hot honey. Wingstop doesn't have a Buffalo sauce, but their Original Hot flavor is the chain's own spin on a classic. They were buttery, with just the right level of spice. The sauce had a bold, smoky flavor with a rich balance of sweet, tangy, and savory notes, and coated every square inch of the boneless wing. Of all the sauces, this flavor paired best with the chain's ranch, which was creamy and mildly tart. The chicken meat inside tasted high-quality and shredded apart with every bite. I ended up ordering two separate orders of eight boneless wings, which cost $16.99 each, at my local Applebee's in Brooklyn. I also got another order of eight boneless wings as part of the chain's "2 for $2X" deal, which included an appetizer and two entrées for $30, excluding tax. As of this past year, Applebee's also offers an Ultimate Combo appetizer platter, which would allow you to choose three different kinds of boneless wings in a smaller portion for $16.99 total — a much better value if you're looking to try multiple flavors. In the end, I ended up paying more than at any other chain, so I could try multiple flavors by ordering them separately. Next time, I'll opt for the Ultimate Combo. They paired well with the chain's ranch, which was tangy and creamy and perfectly balanced out the heat. The wings were perfectly balanced between sweet and smoky. The wings were impressively large and packed with tender, juicy chicken. When it came to flavor, Applebee's was exceptional. All three sauces I tried were well-executed and flavorful. However, the garlic Parmesan stood out as my favorite. Its rich, creamy blend of nutty Parmesan and savory garlic created a bold and indulgent flavor that took the wings to another level. While the other sauces were delicious, the garlic Parmesan offered a perfect balance of crispy breading and zesty flavor that kept me going back for more. I got 15 wings in three different flavors as part of Chili's popular Triple Dipper appetizer combo, which allowed me to select three appetizers for $17.89, excluding tax, at a Chili's in Massachusetts. Executives say the viral popularity of its signature appetizer combo helped drive such growth. Chili's also said the Triple Dipper and fried mozzarella "bricks," which have also gone viral for their lengthy cheese pulls, are attracting younger customers and getting them to come back more often. The wings appeared to be baked in the Buffalo sauce rather than tossed in it after cooking. The Buffalo sauce was sweet and slightly spicy, with a light buttery flavor. The wings were moist yet crispy, and I couldn't get enough of them. The sauce was smoky with a slight sweetness, but they could have benefited from a little acid for some brightness. They were full of chicken meat, which made this an incredibly filling appetizer to share among a few people at a Super Bowl party … or to keep all to yourself while catching the game. For under $20, the Triple Dipper delivered incredible value, with a generous portion of high-quality wings that didn't skimp on flavor or size. For me, it's no surprise this menu item has become such a hit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fully remote jobs aren't as easy to come by as they might've been during the pandemic remote work boom. Recent data from FlexJobs, a jobs site for remote roles, shows the fields where these fully remote jobs are growing fastest. "Workers want to work remotely," Toni Frana, career expert manager, tells CNBC Make It. Companies "know that it makes sense to offer work flexibility like remote work to help them attract and retain talent." In FlexJobs' Remote Work Index, 85% of professionals called remote work the biggest factor that would make them apply to a job, ahead of competitive pay and benefits. Analyzing more than 60 career categories, FlexJobs compared the total number of 100% remote job postings between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2025 to identify the 15 fastest-growing fields for fully remote jobs. FlexJobs defines a "fully remote job" as a professional-level role allowing someone to perform their job responsibilities entirely from home. FlexJobs' report notes the list "excludes long-time leaders in the remote space," like IT, customer service and project management roles in order to highlight emerging fields where remote work is quickly growing. To boost their chances, workers applying for these positions should focus on learning in-demand skills for these roles and demonstrating their impact in prior roles on their resumes and in interviews. Particularly for remote roles, candidates also want to show they can "work really effectively as independently as possible with less manager oversight," Frana says.

With TikTok guaranteeing its presence in the U.S. (which we cover below), it looks like my screen time will remain far higher than it should be. The market is coming off another winning day. As investors continue to breathe easier amid easing geopolitical and trade tensions, inflation data released yesterday gave traders another reassuring sign. Trump is taking JPMorgan Chase and its CEO Jamie Dimon to court. In a lawsuit filed yesterday, the president alleged that the bank's closure of his and related accounts in early 2021 was politically motivated. Trump told reporters yesterday that Dimon "debanked" him, saying that he's "not allowed to do what he did." Trump is seeking at least $5 billion in civil damages as part of the suit, which was filed in Florida state court. As CNBC's Hugh Son and Dan Mangan note, JPMorgan's closure of Trump's accounts followed the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and Trump's departure from the White House later that month. "While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit," JPMorgan said in a statement to CNBC. CFO David Zinsner told CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos that the company's weak outlook was due in part to supply constraints. While Intel doesn't have the materials to meet seasonal demand this quarter, supply should improve in the next three-month period, he said. Trader excitement has been driven by investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia in the California-based company last year. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. Big technology news last night: TikTok announced it officially formed a joint venture that will keep it operating in the U.S. Adam Presser — TikTok's head of operations and trust and safety — will become CEO of the venture, which the company said will operate as an "independent entity." TikTok CEO Shou Chew will be a director, and Americans will comprise a majority of the seven-member board. It was the second most-downloaded app in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2025, according to Sensory Tower data. After Trump's market-moving announcement that he reached a "framework" of a deal with NATO over Greenland, European leaders are trying to get the nitty-gritty. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen similarly said he did not know the specifics of the framework, but that the island's sovereignty and territorial integrity were "red lines" that couldn't be crossed. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called out European leaders in a strongly worded Davos address. "Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost trying to convince the U.S. president to change," Zelenskyy said yesterday. Between Davos and the Greenland deal framework, there's been no shortage of news to keep up with.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok has just announced a new U.S. venture that will keep it operating there after years of concerns about its links to China. But even as it was nearly banned and faced scrutiny from officials, the short-video platform still dominated in 2025. Another ByteDance app, CapCut, ranked fourth, with the video editing tool climbing three places from a year ago. Other China-linked apps also had strong showings across U.S. app stores in 2025, with major e-commerce players like Temu and Shein thriving even as they were targeted by policy changes, Sensor Tower data showed. Temu, which ran a high-profile Super Bowl ad campaign in 2024, fell from the top position that year, but still ranked in seventh place in 2025, even as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs upended its business model. Separately, OpenAI's ChatGPT was America's most downloaded app last year, as adoption of generative artificial intelligence continued to expand. Sensor Tower's data shows that U.S. consumers continue to favor apps coming out of China, often synonymous with addictive algorithms, affordability, and convenience. "2025 showed that these China-originated apps aren't just policy arbitrageurs, but are adaptive ecosystems with governance capabilities on both the demand and supply sides," Liang Chen, a Professor of Strategy & Entrepreneurship at Singapore Management University, told CNBC. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April 2024, cited risks of the Chinese government accessing user data for surveillance or influence operations. Although TikTok briefly went dark in January, the law was never enforced. Upon taking office, Trump repeatedly extended the law's deadline as he negotiated a divestment deal. The threat of a TikTok ban also drew increased attention to Chinese alternatives such as Xiaohongshu, known in English as RedNote. Despite the uncertainty, not only did interest in TikTok's app hold steady, but it managed to expand its e-commerce business, TikTok Shop, which allows users to purchase products directly through videos and live streams. The company has said that, under the new joint venture plans, TikTok Global's U.S. entities will continue to manage certain commercial activities, including e-commerce and advertising. According to data from retail consulting firm Coresight, TikTok's U.S. revenues, including ad revenue, in-app purchases and commerce, rose 26.2% year over year to $13.9 billion, following 25.7% growth in 2024. "TikTok's success in 2025 demonstrates a path to navigate geopolitical headwinds despite the continuously deteriorating U.S.-China relationship — a rare case of clever commercial strategy triumphing over politics," said Xiaomeng Lu, director of geo-technology at Eurasia Group. The app looks poised to close its deal with U.S. investors, with multiple Trump-Xi meetings planned throughout the year, she added. Although Shein and Temu have moved their headquarters out of China in recent years, much of their operations and suppliers remain in the country. Analysts said both companies adjusted to tariffs by negotiating lower supplier prices, absorbing some of the levy costs, and expanding supply networks beyond China, including in the United States. "[Policy] shocks in 2025 didn't really make demand disappear. Rather, they proved that these platforms can adapt their logistics, merchant mix, and incentive design faster than consumer habits shift," said Singapore Management University's Chen. Analysts said the staying power of apps such as TikTok, Temu and Shein stems from their attention-driven platforms and algorithms. "The success of Temu, Shein, and TikTok Shop fundamentally reflects a shift in demand generation: moving away from legacy marketing tactics like simple ad-spend and display campaigns to a continuous, attention-economy strategy," said Scott Miller, CEO of e-commerce consulting firm pdPlus. "Their growth shows that American consumers now discover products through highly engaging, viral, and personalized content, making demand creation a function of entertainment and constant digital presence rather than traditional top-down branding," he added. Those same algorithms and features have also drawn scrutiny from U.S. regulators. For example, officials have raised national security concerns over TikTok's recommendation algorithm, citing its potential for manipulation by the Chinese government. "American consumers overall don't really care an app's association with any specific country as long as they can find something they want at an affordable price," said Yao Jin, an associate professor of supply chain management at Miami University. "[That] is exactly the competitive advantage of most China-originated apps." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Czech-based defense firm Czechoslovak Group (CSG) soared over 30% on its stock market debut on Friday, underscoring sustained investor interest in defense companies amid Europe's growing push for military sovereignty. CSG, one of the world's fastest-growing defense firms, made its debut on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The Prague-based company, which makes armed vehicles, ammunition and advanced defense systems, raised a total of 3.8 billion euros in its initial public offering. Euronext said the listing marked the world's largest defense IPO ever recorded, both in terms of amount raised and market capitalization. "Today marks a historic milestone for CSG as we join the Euronext Amsterdam market and we welcome the confidence shown in us by investors," Michal Strnad, chairman of CSG, said in a statement. "Becoming a publicly listed company demonstrates our commitment to high standards of transparency, disclosure and corporate governance and strengthens our ability to invest in innovation, expand our global reach and deliver on our mission to be a critical long-term supplier of advanced defence and industrial solutions to NATO states and Government partners worldwide," he added. The listing comes after weeks of mounting geopolitical tensions, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to use military force to seize Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. In a surprise development on Wednesday, however, Trump said he had agreed to a framework of a future deal with respect to the self-governing Danish territory. In Europe, meanwhile, investors have continued to pile into defense stocks, fueled by a mix of European Union, national and private capital funding. Strategists have cited Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the end of the U.S. defense umbrella in Europe as underpinning a so-called "mega-trend in the making." — CNBC's Hugh Leask contributed to this report.

Some 68% of these young professionals are anxious about AI automation, while 58% use AI tools at least three to four times a week, according to new research from think tank Oliver Wyman Forum. Today's youngest workers are leaning into AI more so than their older counterparts, who are less anxious about the technology and use it less often, the study shows. Compared with boomers, for example, Gen Zers are 1.7 times more likely to participate in AI training and 2.3 times more likely to report a productivity increase from using AI at work. Anthropic's chief, Dario Amodei, also said at the conference that he hasn't changed his prediction from May, when he warned that AI could erase half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years. Meanwhile, economist Marc Sumerlin said in November that companies may pause hiring young workers as they await the benefits of AI, and that ultimately the technology could lead to fewer jobs for recent graduates. Already, some companies have cited AI directly or indirectly as a reason for layoffs. Some corporate leaders are more optimistic about AI's impact on Gen Zers' careers. Earlier this month, Figma CEO Dylan Field said on the podcast "In Good Company" that AI skills give young professionals a hiring advantage and that the technology won't wipe out entry-level jobs. Similarly, Reid Hoffman, the venture capitalist who cofounded LinkedIn, said in a video posted to his YouTube channel in June that young people should use their familiarity with AI as a selling point when seeking work. Some Gen Z workers say AI is helping them advance faster in their careers than they likely would have otherwise. Lindsay Grippo, 28, credits the technology for helping her practice big-picture strategic thinking when drafting newsletters, blog posts, and other copy for her editor role at Codeword, a New York-based digital marketing agency. She views the AI's output as if it's from a more junior creative. "It is training me to think like a more senior-level creative." A 46-year-old Gen Xer, Monson sees AI fluency as an advantage for young workers that makes him jealous. "That's when your career really starts to take off," said Monson.</p>

I was less than a year from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with a double major in computer science and economics, and some large tech companies had announced major layoffs before the end of the year.

The prior summer, I'd interned as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, but I realized that finance didn't feel like the right path; I was more excited about the kind of work happening in tech. It felt like unfortunate timing to be searching for tech roles — but at least I didn't have to job hunt alone. When one of us heard from a recruiter or HR professional, we'd share their contact information with the group. I didn't end up getting the job, but I'm confident that getting on the recruiter's radar helped boost my chances. In my experience, though, sharing what we knew and helping each other out made the process easier — and faster — for all five of us. Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was the motivation I needed to keep pushing for a job offer. One landed a role at Amazon, and another joined Salesforce. However, by the end of 2022, I was still looking. Business Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. In early January 2023, I came across an opening at Snap Inc. — the company behind Snapchat — for a software engineering role. However, February came around, and I still hadn't heard back from Snap. I decided to take action; I got on LinkedIn and searched for a recruiter at the company who specialized in hiring new graduates. My goal was to reach out via email rather than a LinkedIn message. I eventually found someone who appeared to be the recruiter, but their email wasn't listed anywhere. It included my résumé and an expression of interest in the role. By March, I had received and accepted an offer for the software engineering role. I started at Snap in August 2023 and am now a machine learning engineer. My top pieces of advice for other job seekers are: Additionally, I'd recommend leaning on others, whether that's friends or your broader network.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was nearly six in the morning on a Tuesday in mid-2023, and Jimmy Donaldson, better known to the world as MrBeast, had been up for hours sending a stream of frustrated texts about MrBeast Burger, his nearly three-year-old food venture. The YouTuber was furious with his business partners over customer complaints of undercooked burgers, and tensions had reached a breaking point. "As long as I have no control, I couldn't care less about it," Donaldson, who is known to be exacting and kill projects he doesn't believe are up to snuff, texted a friend. These texts — revealed as evidence in a legal battle between MrBeast and his partner Virtual Dining Concepts that could go to trial later this year — represent a stark departure from the grand ambitions Donaldson had described for the brand just six months earlier. "I want to go down the food rabbit hole and become a god in this space," he wrote. By mid-2023, the promising fast-food endeavor had become a colossal headache for Donaldson. "I was getting destroyed online, and it was impacting how people viewed me, and it made me chronically depressed," he later said of the experience in a deposition. The MrBeast Burger saga provides a cautionary tale for independent creators about the potential downsides of handing over control to third parties, and to brands about working with influencers who insist on tight creative oversight. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Plenty of celebrity-brand deals have been fruitful, but for every Kim Kardashian and Skims partnership, there's a Kanye West and Gap flameout. MrBeast Burger's food is made by various "ghost kitchen" partners ranging from 7-Eleven and Red Robin to local mom-and-pops. For social media creators, whose livelihoods depend on their relationships with fans, reputation is paramount. "The inherent risk is, when you do these licensing deals, the creator's name is the product," said Keith Gelman, founder of entertainment marketing agency Talent Partnership Advisors, who has negotiated partnerships with celebrities including Snoop Dogg and Reba McIntyre. He'd soared to internet fame through videos involving cash giveaways and stunts like being buried alive. His business was mainly run by family members, a close circle of friends, and his management team at Night Media. VDC's founder, Robert Earl, is a British expat restaurateur and TV personality best known for founding Planet Hollywood before moving with his son into the virtual dining business. Often seen sporting colorful shirts, Earl is at home with movie stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. "We were beyond slammed and ill-prepared for his incredible following and demand that ensued," Earl told Business Insider shortly after MrBeast Burger's launch. Early on, he began musing about merging MrBeast Burger with his candy brand Feastables and going public. Despite a hot start, there were early signs of trouble. Customer complaints about product quality — including undercooked burgers, soggy fries, and incorrect orders — began appearing on social media almost immediately. The worst part for Donaldson: There was little he could do about it. The problems MrBeast Burger ran into are common for ghost kitchen brands with many locations, Rich Shank, a senior principal at the food-service consultant and research firm Technomic, told Business Insider. "There's just a lot of variances and nuances in the ghost kitchen space that make it challenging," he said, including standardizing ingredients, cooking processes, and other factors that differ from kitchen to kitchen. VDC used a variety of methods to monitor quality issues, including working with the guest feedback platform Tattle to analyze customer satisfaction. It hired a third-party firm, Intellishop, to send "mystery shoppers" to order from various MrBeast Burger locations and see what they delivered. At one time, about 5% of orders were coming back wrong, more than double VDC's target rate of around 2%, according to an email from VDC CEO Stephanie Sollers. Sollers said in a deposition that incorrect orders were an unfortunate feature of "most restaurant businesses." "People were ridiculing me and saying I didn't care," Donaldson said in a deposition. Donaldson's lawsuit compared his philosophy to that of Yankee great Joe DiMaggio: "There is always a kid who may be seeing me for the first time. Donaldson's solution was the same one he applies to his YouTube content: "obsess over it" until he figures out an answer. That kind of micromanaging wouldn't be "operationally prudent" and would be "a very quick way of having your line cooks want to quit," Shank said. Undercooked food was not the only source of tension in MrBeast Burger land. In November 2022, Donaldson made the first in a series of attempts to acquire nearly all of the company from VDC. Tech billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya, an investor in MrBeast's company, said in a 2023 email that the creator's media business was a break-even proposition that had "some enterprise value but not much." "The real value is using it as a platform to launch CPG and other kinds of companies," Palihapitiya wrote. "We need to own at least 80% of each company." During one meeting with VDC, Donaldson banged a clothes hanger on the table out of frustration. In another, the YouTuber claimed Earl showed him a desk drawer of lawsuits to make the point that he wasn't afraid of being sued. His lawyers shot a letter to VDC alleging breach of contract, and his team changed the passwords on the MrBeast Burger social accounts, cutting off VDC's access. "Fuck those pieces of shit," he wrote to a friend. In June 2023, his rage went from texts to tweets when he fired off a string of posts about MrBeast Burger that would become central to VDC's countersuit. MrBeast tweeted that if he had the ability to shut down MrBeast Burger, he "would have done so a long time ago sadly." After Donaldson's tweets, one VDC investor pronounced the venture "dead and buried." Amid the feud, MrBeast Burger's ghost kitchen revenue fell from around $64 million in 2022 to about $45 million in 2023, court documents said. As the negotiations stalled, Donaldson hatched a new plan. The first step was to go to court and request termination of the partnership and a ban on VDC using his name or image. In a series of text messages, he called it "the new giga brain play." The full plan went something like this: Win the VDC lawsuit, make a deal with Burger King or McDonald's for MrBeast Burger 2.0, do $100 million in sales, and eventually be bought out for $300 or $400 million. The result, he wrote, would be "a legendary dub" — online speak for "win." In July 2023, Donaldson's company sued VDC, portraying the YouTuber as a victim seeking to escape an unfair contract that had tarnished his reputation as a philanthropic, family-friendly entertainer. VDC fired back soon after with its own lawsuit, saying Donaldson had walked away from a promising deal and failed to meet various contractual obligations, including appearances and promos. "But for Donaldson's opportunism, disparagement, and interference, MrBeast Burger would have continued its explosive growth," VDC's suit says. The MrBeast Burger brand lost customers and market partners after Donaldson went scorched earth, Earl said in a deposition. Donaldson's lawsuit said that VDC had earned millions from the endeavor, while the creator hadn't earned "a dime." Earl said in a deposition that Donaldson's mother and financial manager instructed VDC to reinvest the money in the business. "I'm never giving up control of Feastables so I can always do what's best for my fans," he said in a July 2023 tweet contrasting the business with MrBeast Burger. Feastables generated over $200 million in 2024 and was profitable, according to investor materials from early 2025 viewed by Business Insider. "I just obsess over the product," he said during a deposition when asked why Feastables had been successful. Donaldson has taken more control of his company, Beast Industries. The company, now some 450 employees strong, is mostly centralized in Greenville. Donaldson's plans for Beast Industries will again put control at odds with expansion. His road map includes launching in new categories like mobile phones and financial services — with help from $200 million in fresh funding from a crypto company — that will require bringing on partners. In investor pitch materials from early 2025, Beast Industries said its plan for Beast Financial was to partner with a "scaled fintech partner to white label a suite of products," tailored to MrBeast's audience and supported by financial literacy content. Partnership is simply a necessity for creators with big business ambitions. "There's no way that a lot of these creators could just on their own build and run a hundred million or billion dollar brand," Eric Bogard, CEO of talent-firm UnderCurrent Management, which operates a product division called Viral Goods, told Business Insider. You can still order his Beast Style crinkle-cut fries and smash burgers from hundreds of ghost kitchens around the world — from Singapore to Switzerland — according to its website, which still features photos of a beaming Donaldson. MrBeast's zombie brand lives on, even if it's dead to its creator.</p>

Two things can be true of Tesla's Full Self-Driving: It's an impressive piece of technology, and it still doesn't go far enough. CEO Elon Musk and his most bullish investors believe that autonomy will help take Tesla's valuation to new heights. Today, FSD (Supervised), as the name suggests, is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that requires constant human supervision. Tesla gave a glimpse of this future on Thursday, launching Robotaxi rides in Austin without a safety monitor in the vehicle. FSD proved to be a highly capable driver — so much so that it has spoiled me into wishing that I didn't have to constantly babysit the system. I drove the Model 3 for a few hours around Berkeley and Alameda. The drive was a little less than 100 miles through a wide range of driving conditions — highly dense urban streets, university roads, canyons, and the highway. FSD came to a rolling stop rather than an abrupt halt, which is exactly how I would've handled the situation. FSD's "Mad Max" mode is impressive in the way it lane-changed around a few cars that were moving too slowly on the highway for my taste. At no point did I need to disengage FSD or question the system enough to take over the steering wheel. My friend, who doesn't actively follow tech news or everything Musk says as much as I do, described the experience like being in a "spaceship." That wasn't necessarily a compliment from his end — he likes older cars — but it's exactly how Musk intended the Tesla experience to be. I gained enough trust in FSD that I wanted to test the system's limits by closing my eyes while driving down University Avenue — a fairly busy thoroughfare in Berkeley. It was like having an itch that's just not quite fully satisfied. People who swear by FSD like to say that the system is a game changer, lifting the burden of driving off their shoulders. I agree that driving can be a tedious chore. I immediately think about the drive between San Francisco and Los Angeles that I do a few times a year. It's about 400 miles and can easily be a 7-hour drive depending on traffic. The problem isn't that it's hard in a problem-solving sense. The problem is that I have to stay awake. I can listen to music, put on an entertaining podcast, or get 200 mg of caffeine from a can of Celsius, but the drive is so monotonous that I could easily doze off while on the 5 highway. I obviously can't do that yet with Tesla FSD, which makes me wonder: How significant is the difference, really, between the cognitive effort it takes to manually drive from SF to LA than having to supervise an ADAS? Musk said an FSD (Supervised) is now capable enough for drivers to take their eyes off the road in certain conditions without triggering the warning system. That would be useful only if Tesla were to take full responsibility when I get pulled over by the police. I've filed an entire story inside a robotaxi and used it several times to take me home after a night of drinking. That's the bar I want Tesla FSD to reach and exceed: a system capable enough to let me sleep behind the wheel on any road, meaning no geofences, and one in which Tesla will take accountability for any issues that arise while FSD is unsupervised. I'm also thinking about folks like David Moss, who said he broke a record for driving more than 11,000 miles on FSD without touching the steering wheel. Moss told me how FSD could be a life-changer for his father, who is legally blind and unable to drive. If Tesla's ADAS can reliably — and legally — put people like Moss' dad behind the wheel, I can see Full Self-Driving going from a nice-to-have to a need-to-have.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk said Tesla will raise subscription prices for its Full Self-Driving software as it gets better, and it could cost more than $100. The Tesla CEO said in an early Friday X post, "I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD's capabilities improve." "The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD)," he said. Customers can currently buy the system for $8,000 on a one-time basis, per the vehicle's listing on Tesla's website. However, this option will no longer be available from February 14. Most of Tesla's vehicles previously came with Autopilot as standard. The software included traffic-aware cruise control, which maintains a set driving speed and slows down automatically in response to traffic, as well as features like Autosteer, which allowed Tesla's cars to automatically follow lane markings. The move attracted backlash from some Tesla fans on X, with several pointing out that rival brands like Toyota offer lane centering technology as standard on many models. It comes as Tesla pushes to drive subscriptions for FSD, which Musk has described as a critical part of the company's future. Adoption of the technology has been sluggish, with Tesla's CFO telling investors in October that only around 12% of Tesla owners are paying for the assisted-driving feature. Boosting FSD subscriptions is also a crucial part of Musk's massive Tesla pay package. Tesla currently makes it clear that FSD requires driver supervision. The company announced Thursday that it had begun offering fully autonomous rides without a safety monitor in its robotaxi service in Austin, and Musk has said that he expects "unsupervised" FSD to massively boost demand for Tesla's vehicles.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok's US workers can finally breathe a sigh of relief. The company announced Thursday that it has closed a deal to spin off parts of its US business in a new joint venture with an investor group. The venture's seven-man, majority-American board includes TikTok's CEO Shou Chew. TikTok's new US owners include tech company Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, each of which owns 15% of the new venture. ByteDance will own around 20% of the entity, and affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will own around 30%, according to a December memo from Chew. Other investors include Michael Dell's family office and a venture run by the partners of growth investor Dragoneer. While Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake will serve as managing investors in the new US joint venture, their focus will be on areas such as data security. Key commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will remain with ByteDance. The company began splitting up its US staff into different legal entities in January based on whether their work would remain under ByteDance's purview, Business Insider first reported. Following the announcement, President Donald Trump said in a Thursday night Truth Social post that he was "so happy to have helped in saving TikTok." He said the deal had reached a "very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion." At the start of Trump's presidency, TikTok went dark for its 170 million US users, but came back online soon after when Trump promised to delay a ban. Since then, he has been pushing back the divest-or-ban deadline, saying tech leaders like Elon Musk and Oracle's CTO, Larry Ellison, could buy the app.</p>

OpenAI has pulled in a billion-dollar month from something other than ChatGPT. "People think of us mostly as ChatGPT, but the API team is doing amazing work!" Many of Silicon Valley's high-profile startups rely on OpenAI's models as core infrastructure. Perplexity uses OpenAI's models to power parts of its AI search and answer engine. Harvey, one of the fastest-growing legal tech startups, is built on OpenAI's models to assist lawyers with research and drafting. Altman's comments underscore how OpenAI's infrastructure business is emerging as a key growth engine, even as the company faces massive costs for computing power and data centers. Last week, the company said it is gearing up to test ads inside ChatGPT as it faces about $1.4 trillion in spending commitments over the coming years. Less than two years ago, Altman said advertising was a "last resort." "Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me," Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. Earlier this week, OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, raised the idea of "licensing models" that would let the company share in downstream sales if a customer's product succeeds. "Let's say in drug discovery, if we licensed our technology, you have a breakthrough.</p>
