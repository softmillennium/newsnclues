Every House Democrat and two Republicans voted in favor of the measure. Every other Republican voted against it.

The latest in a series of congressional efforts to rein in President Donald Trump's military aggression against Venezuela failed Thursday as Republican lawmakers again defeated a war powers resolution by the tightest possible margin.

House lawmakers voted 215-215 on H.Con.Res.68 — introduced last month by Rep. James McGovern (D-Mass.) — which “directs the president to remove US armed forces from Venezuela unless a declaration of war or authorization to use military force for such purpose has been enacted.”

Unlike in the Senate, where the vice president casts tie-breaking votes, a deadlock in the House means the legislation does not pass.

Every House Democrat and two Republicans — Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — voted in favor of the measure. Every other Republican voted against it. Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) did not vote.

By the tightest margin, Republicans blocked a War Powers Resolution to stop Trump's illegal military action to take Venezuela's oil.Trump is losing support in Congress. The American people are sick of foreign conflicts. Progressives will not stop until we end these wars. https://t.co/Ft38ERyUpC

The House vote came a week after Vice President JD Vance's tie-breaking vote was needed to overcome a 50-50 deadlock on a similar resolution introduced last month by Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 — also known as the War Powers Act — was enacted during the Nixon administration toward the end of the US war on Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The law empowers Congress to check the president's war-making authority by requiring the president to report any military action to Congress within 48 hours. It also mandates that lawmakers approve any troop deployments lasting longer than 60 days.

Thursday's vote followed this month's US bombing and invasion of Venezuela and kidnapping of its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife on dubious “narco-terrorism” and drug trafficking allegations. Trump has also imposed an oil blockade on the South American nation, seizing seven tankers. Since September, the US has also been bombing boats accused of transporting drugs in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.

This is the second time I voted for a War Powers Resolution to stop Trump's unconstitutional attacks on Venezuela.The maniac in the White House does not have the authority to bomb and invade anywhere he wants across the globe. Congress must put an end to this. No more forever…

“If the president is contemplating further military action, then he has a moral and constitutional obligation to come here and get our approval,” McGovern said following the vote.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Gregory Meeks (D-NY) lamented the resolution's failure, saying, “The American people want us to lower their cost of living, not enable war.”

Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said on Bluesky: “Only Congress has the authority to declare war. Today, I voted for a war powers resolution to ensure Trump cannot send OUR armed forces to Venezuela without explicit authorization from Congress.”

Cavan Kharrazian, senior policy adviser at the advocacy group Demand Progress, also decried the resolution's failure.

“We are deeply disappointed that the House did not pass this war powers resolution, though it's notable that it failed only due to a tie,” he said.

“As with the recent Senate vote, the administration expended extraordinary energy pressuring Republicans to block this resolution,” Kharrazian added. “That effort speaks for itself: With the American people tired of endless war, the administration knows that a Congress willing to enforce the law can meaningfully curtail illegal and escalatory military action. We urge members of Congress to continue fully exercising their constitutional authority over matters of war.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks.

We can only resist Trump's attacks by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is ordering an administration-wide review of federal funding for over a dozen states, the vast majority of which are led by Democratic governors.

The review will focus on federal funding for the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Washington, all of which are led by Democrats. Washington, D.C. will also face a review from OMB.

The memo only orders the review of one Republican-led state, Vermont. Even that inclusion, however, comes with a caveat: While Vermont has a Republican governor, its state legislature is controlled by Democrats, meaning its purse strings are largely controlled by that party. 

The review is ostensibly meant to root out “fraud” in those states, and will likely target the supposed misuse of federal funds by immigrants in particular. Although state investigators have been tackling such fraud in Minnesota for months, the Trump administration has exaggerated the scale of the fraud, seemingly in order to scapegoat immigrants and justify attempts to block billions of dollars in federal funding to states.

According to the memo, the reporting request aims “to collect a detailed spending report on Federal funds,” and will “be used to better understand the scope of funding in certain States and localities in order to facilitate efforts to reduce the improper and fraudulent use of those funds through administrative means or legislative proposals to Congress.”

A response from the states is due by the end of this month. 

“We are moving forward with taking fraud seriously,” a spokesperson from OMB said.

That statement, however, is doubtful, given that all but one of the states OMB is targeting with its inquiry are controlled by Democrats.

Democratic lawmakers panned the OMB memo for being blatantly politically motivated.

“OMB has no goodwill. They never say what they mean. They never mean what they say,” said Rep. Joe Morelle (D-New York). “I have zero doubt that they intend to withhold funds and they intend to punish people who have different views than they do.”

“We have to fight it in the courts because it is all illegal, and the courts have shown they're not going to tolerate the disregard for the law,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Connecticut) said.

The OMB memo seeks to disrupt any legal recourse relating to its investigation.

“This is a data-gathering exercise only. It does not involve withholding funds, and therefore does not violate any court order,” the memo stated.

It's possible, though, that a legal challenge could still block the inquiry from moving forward, as the results of the OMB investigation could be used to unfairly block Democratic-led states only, since it includes just one GOP-led state.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks.

            Top Wall Street bankers during the Trump 2.0 era have tread carefully around the subject of politics generally and President Donald Trump specifically. The consensus has generally been: Smile and nod, stay in your lane, don't become a target.
    


            But when a Trump “affordability” proposal earlier this month targeted banks' profit engine, the mood shifted. Publicly and forcefully, Wall Street executives were telling Trump “no.”
    


            It's not going over well.
    


            On Thursday, the notoriously litigious president sued JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, alleging the bank improperly “debanked” Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol. Trump is seeking $5 billion in damages.
    


Trump sues JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon for dropping him as a customer after Jan. 6 attack



            Trump has previously threatened the suit, which was likely in the works for months. But, perhaps not coincidentally, its filing in Florida state court came one day after Dimon told a room full of powerful people at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Trump's proposal to slash credit card interest rates roughly in half would be “an economic disaster.”
    


            The White House referred questions about the case to Trump's outside counsel, Alejandro Brito. His law firm didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            Dimon's public critique breached what has become an unofficial, often uneasy, agreement among the leaders of Corporate America: Stay out of the Trump's way, even when his policies directly affect the bottom line.
    


            When Trump last spring rolled out steep global tariffs that threatened to sap corporate profits, executives stayed quiet. Ditto when Trump began going after the Federal Reserve, a body whose independence is vital for a stable business environment. Even when he started explicitly meddling in private companies, carving out a cut of revenue for the government from companies like Nvidia and Intel, no one spoke out.



Corporate America is silent as Trump abandons free-market principles



            Corporate America comes by its trepidation honestly. Since Trump's second term began a year ago, he and his administration have investigated, sued or brought charges against an array of perceived enemies, including media companies like CBS, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal. He threatened Apple with massive tariffs last year over a perceived slight from CEO Tim Cook, and Trump said he would block Exxon from entering Venezuela because Trump didn't like CEO Darren Woods' lack of enthusiasm during a meeting of oil executives earlier this month.
    


            Privately, some trade groups were drafting plans to push back against the Trump administration in defense of their business interests, people familiar with the matter told CNN at the time. But those plans were shelved, as members worried about inviting the ire of the White House.
    


            And CEOs across the board are “very alarmed” by the administration's attack on the Fed's independence, according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. Sonnenfeld and his research team found that 80% of the CEOs they surveyed believed Trump was not acting in America's best interest by pressuring Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. (Notably, that survey was conducted before the Department of Justice launched its criminal investigation into the bank and Powell.)
    


            But for Wall Street, the president seemed to finally cross a red line with the proposed 10% cap on credit card rates. In a Truth Social post on Jan. 9, the president, who is struggling to convince voters that Republicans care about the cost-of-living crisis, said the public will no longer be “ripped off” by credit card companies, which charge an average interest rate of 20% on card purchase.
    


Trump's affordability pledge strikes directly at the heart of Wall Street's profit engine



            Even though such a cap would probably need to come from Congress, the statement rattled Wall Street, prompting rare critical public statements from executives.
    


            “A rate cap is not something that we can support,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, on the bank's earnings call.
    


            Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan — no stranger to being publicly dressed down by Trump — said last week that a cap wouldn't have the effect Trump is seeking: “If you bring the caps down, you're going to constrict credit, meaning less people will get credit cards and the balance available to them on those credit cards will also be restricted.”
    


            But Dimon's “economic disaster” statement at Davos was a more direct critique, coming from the most prominent figure on Wall Street, and someone who has had a rocky personal relationship with Trump.
    


            Trump and Dimon have had an uneasy relationship for years.
    


            In 2018, in a comment Dimon almost immediately walked back, the Wall Street titan told a panel at the bank's headquarters that he “could beat Trump” in a head-to-head presidential race “because I'm as tough as he is, I'm smarter than he is.
    


            Trump responded online, calling Dimon “a poor public speaker & a nervous mess.”
    


            Dimon's approach to the president during his second term has been far more measured. In his Davos interview, Dimon said he disagreed with some of Trump's policies, agreed with others, but largely avoided a question about why he and other CEOs have been so unwilling to stand up to the president.
    


            He may have seen the writing on the wall. After a tepid statement on JPMorgan's earnings call disagreeing with Trump's credit card rates plan (“it would be dramatic on subprime”) and his criminal investigation of Powell (“not a good idea”), Trump called out Dimon publicly.
    


            “Jamie Dimon probably wants higher rates,” Trump said on January 15. “Maybe he makes more money that way.”
    


            Two days later, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had previously offered Dimon the Fed chair role, Trump announced he would sue.
    


            “There was never such an offer and, in fact, I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest,” Trump said on Truth Social.

            Days after Brooklyn Peltz Beckham exposed the depth of his rift with his parents, David and Victoria Beckham, in a blistering Instagram post, the DJ who performed at his wedding has offered his account of the now-infamous dance that contributed to the feud.
    


            Nicola Peltz Beckham, Brooklyn's new wife, left the room “crying her eyes out,” after Brooklyn danced with his mother, Victoria, before her at their April 2022 wedding, DJ Fat Tony told British TV show This Morning on Friday.
    


            The British celebrity DJ, whose real name is Tony Marnach, said singer Marc Anthony called up “the most beautiful woman in the room” to join Brooklyn on the stage, a moment everyone present expected to precede the newlyweds' first dance.
    


            But rather than calling on the bride, Anthony went on to invite the mother of the groom, Victoria, to the stage.
    


            As for the dance itself, “there was no slutdropping, there was no black cat PVC catsuits, there was no Spice Girl action,” Marnach said, dispelling some of the memes circulating on social media this week.
    


            Instead, Marnach said the “timing” made the dance “inappropriate.”
    


            “Brooklyn went onto the stage, and the next minute everyone's expecting it to be Nicola to go up and do the first dance,” said Marnach.
    


            “So Victoria is by the stage, she goes onto the stage, and of course at that point Brooklyn is literally devastated because he thought he was going to do his first dance with his wife. Then Nicola leaves the room, crying her eyes out,” Marnach said.
    


            “Brooklyn is stuck there on stage, and they do this dance, and Marc Anthony says ‘put your hands on your mother's hips' … and the whole situation was really awkward for everyone in the room.”
    


            That incident — which Brooklyn described as his mother dancing “very inappropriately on me in front of everyone,” leaving him “humiliated” — was one of several that the eldest Beckham child described in a long Instagram post Monday.
    


            In it, he accused his parents, who are among the most famous couples in the world, of trying to “ruin” his marriage to Peltz, planting stories about him in the media and of prioritizing “Brand Beckham” over the family unit.
    


David and Victoria Beckham family drama pulls in a generation unafraid to go ‘no contact'



            “I do not want to reconcile with my family,” he wrote, confirming yearslong rumors of a rift. “I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.”
    


            David and Victoria Beckham have not so far commented on their son's allegations. CNN has reached out to their representatives, as well as representatives for the Peltz Beckhams.
    


            Marnach added that he had performed at several Beckham parties, describing them as a “close-knit family” who love to dance. “If (Brooklyn) felt it was inappropriate and awkward, it was inappropriate and awkward,” he said.
    


            Brunch the next day was “the most awkward part of it all,” Marnach recalled, because everyone was discussing the previous evening.
    


            “When the bride and the groom leave their own wedding devastated, word trickles out,” he said.

France's famed high-speed rail service TGV INOUI is facing a backlash after introducing a new premium-class carriage that bans children.
    


            As of January 8, national rail operator SNCF has been offering “Optimum” class on many TGV INOUI routes to and from Paris, according to the ticket-selling SNCF Connect website.
    


            As well as flexible tickets and a dedicated customer service, the offer promises a “dedicated 1st-class carriage” designed for “privacy” and “access to a quiet, dedicated space on board.”
    


            Not only does the carriage have “a limited number of passengers,” but the type of passengers that it allows is restricted, the train company says, noting that “to ensure maximum comfort in the dedicated space, children are not permitted.”
    


            On Friday, a journey from Paris to Lyon was priced at €132 ($155) for a seat in traditional first class, and €180 ($211) for the child-free Optimum Plus, a version of Optimum only offered on the Paris-Lyon route that includes a personal host and dining.
    


            But the latest offering has prompted criticism from French officials and citizens alike, who have described the restriction as “discrimination.”
    


            “Faced with the #NoKids pressure, SNCF must not give in,” Sarah El Haïry, High Commissioner for Children at France's Ministry for Health, Social Affairs and Labor, wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday, referring to the phenomenon — amplified by social media — of people seeking child-free spaces.
    


            The train company's move “really amounts to direct discrimination against children, and that's why I think this matter is causing such a stir today,” said Stéphanie d'Esclaibes, entrepreneur and creator of the podcast “Les Adultes de Demain” (The Adults of Tomorrow), while speaking on French radio program RTL Soir on Thursday about the so-called “No Kids” movement.
    


            “I understand needing quiet on the TGV when you want to work, but I also think this shouldn't come at the expense of a social group, namely children. And I think it's an opportunity to rethink spaces for children and families as well,” added d'Esclaibes.
    


A guerrilla approach to flying with kids



            “SNCF invents an ‘Optimum' class… without children,” essayist Naïma M'Faddel wrote in a post on X on Thursday. “In a country worried about its birth rate, this signal is disastrous.”
    


            Last year, France recorded more deaths than ‍births for the first time since ‌the end of World War II.
    


            Sharing an image of the book “Yes Kids” by Gabrielle Cluzel, M'Faddel recommended that people read the “magnificent plea for assumed and happy parenthood,” adding, “The child is life.”
    


            A day earlier, SNCF Voyageurs, the national passenger rail operator, released a video on social media responding to the “controversy” and defending the move.
    


            The Optimum class is “open to everyone aged 12 and over, as was already the case with our previous Business Première offering,” a spokesperson said in the video posted Wednesday.
    


            “These Optimum seats represent only 8% of the available space on our trains from Monday to Friday. This means that 92% of the other seats are available to everyone, and 100% on weekends,” the spokesperson continued.
    


            “I can even tell you that we have been under pressure for years to restrict children's access to certain areas of our trains. This is something we have always refused to do. Our services are designed for everyone, and of course, for families,” she added.
    


The most exciting new trains coming in 2026



            In a statement to CNN on Friday, an SNCF Voyageurs spokesperson said the company “never accepted the numerous requests from customers” for entire sections, “such as first class, to be child-free on TGV INOUI trains.”
    


            The previous Business Première service, for which toddler and child tickets were not valid, existed “for many years” and “without any negative feedback,” the spokesperson added.
    


            TGV trains have nursery areas, according to the spokesperson, who said passengers can also reserve tickets in the dedicated family area on all TGV INOUI trains on weekends and in school holidays and public holidays.

Ryan Wedding allegedly ran a drug-trafficking organisation that moved 60 tons of cocaine a year into Los Angeles

Ryan Wedding, the Canadian Olympic snowboarder turned alleged drug kingpin, has been arrested, US law enforcement officials announced on Friday.

Wedding, 44, has been sought by the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for his role in overseeing what the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, called the “one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations” in the world.

Officials in the US allege that Wedding's organisation had moved nearly 60 metric tons of cocaine a year into Los Angeles from Mexico using a network of semitrucks. Wedding is also accused of ordering the killing of a key FBI witness as well as several other murders, including that of a couple who were killed in a case of mistaken identity.

US authorities had previously said that they believed Wedding to be in hiding in Mexico. On Thursday, the FBI director, Kash Patel, was in Mexico City for meetings with the country's security chief, Omar García Harfuch. And on Friday morning he left with a souvenir: Ryan Wedding, and another, unnamed, “priority objective”.

García Harfuch released a statement saying that Patel was leaving with “a non-US citizen who was arrested by Mexican authorities and is among the FBI's 10 most wanted, and a Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered yesterday at the US embassy”.

NBC News first announced news of the arrest and US law enforcement officials familiar with the operation confirmed it to the Guardian.

In March, Wedding, whose nicknames include “Public Enemy”, “El Jefe” and “Giant”, was added to the FBI's list of 10 most wanted fugitives, and there was a $15m reward for information leading to his arrest.

Patel, who is due to speak to the media later in the day from California, has compared Wedding to Pablo Escobar and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.

The head of the RCMP, Michael Duheme, will also be present.

Wedding was allegedly being protected by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico while he was on the run.

Conservative communities accept president's arguments for why the US needs the Arctic island as genuine

Owen Strickland's life as mayor of a town of 568 people between Rocky Mount and Raleigh, North Carolina, is usually small-town politics. But this particular moment has been giving his political science degree – with a concentration in national security policy and international relations – a workout.

Donald Trump's call to annex Greenland has roiled markets and flabbergasted half the world. But the president's supporters in conservative communities – to the degree that this issue has their attention at all – are apt to accept his political argument as genuine.

Americans of either party are unlikely to know much about China's “Belt and Road Initiative”, a series of investments in infrastructure – ports, roads and rail across continents – to connect Chinese trade to the world, Strickland said.

“They started about a decade ago,” Strickland said. “They are attempting to make inroads worldwide, up to and including Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, areas like that. That includes the Arctic, Greenland, Iceland and the extreme north of Canada. They are doing everything they can to reduce western influence.” (The Chinese investments in Greenland, many of which have been blocked are actually part of what it hopes to call the “Polar Silk Road”.)

Strickland is one of many conservatives who believe that Trump's efforts to bring Greenland under American control are justified. “I may not necessarily agree with his approaches,” Strickland said. “But our president is a negotiator, and he's proven where his thought processes are, and he's also proven that he's meant to be believed. Everything with our president is a negotiation.”

Trump also alludes to the “Golden Dome” project, a system of defensive countermeasures to shield the United States from nuclear missiles, as a reason to take over Greenland. The technical elements for knocking down intercontinental ballistic missiles are both untested and classified. Accepting an assertion that the system would work as advertised and requires ownership of Greenland to function is an article of faith to supporters of Trump's push for annexation.

But faith is not in short supply among the converted, said Jack Watts, a Christian author in Atlanta with a large conservative social media following.

“The confidence that people have – particularly conservative Christian people – is that Trump has our best interest at heart,” Watts said. “He's playing chess while others are playing checkers, and what he does they agree with even if they don't understand it.”

A deal was going to happen, Watts said, “and it's going to happen very quickly”.

But for a transfer of sovereignty? Probably not, he added. “I think that it will be like Guantánamo Bay, which is part of Cuba, but we have a permanent lease on it. We have an impenetrable base in Guantánamo Bay and the same thing will happen, and it won't happen near anybody that's living any place.”

Voices to the farthest right of the political spectrum are leaning into the rhetoric of America as empire and Greenland as territory to conquer, taking a cue from Stephen Miller's comments earlier this month in which the senior White House adviser said to news anchor Jake Tapper that “we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world.”

Matt Walsh, host of the rightwing Daily Wire, said that taking over Greenland by force was “worth talking about”, adding: “It's interesting to me when people today get so offended by the very notion that we would try to acquire land, that we would try to grow the empire, and in particular, that we would try to do it by force … that's the only way that America exists in the first place.” (In Davos on Thursday Trump said he would not consider military force in his quest.)

Some conservative leaders have been critical of the Trump administration's demands for Greenland, but more often challenge the provocative process than the underlying rationale.

The conservative commentator Erick Erickson described Trump's fixation on Greenland as evidence of “insane impulse control issues”, arguing that the fixation on Greenland was a product of isolationism within his cabinet. But even Erickson believes the issue is valid.

“The crazy thing here is that I agree with Donald Trump about the strategic importance of Greenland,” Erickson wrote in his newsletter. “But this is counterproductive to accomplishing the security goal he wants. The Europeans cannot now be seen to be bullied into giving up 840,000 square miles of territory to an unhinged and obsessive 80-year-old.”

In either case, the refrain that Trump's bluster – from his tariff threats to his talk at Davos – is the art of the deal reverberates from conservative commentary on talk radio and YouTube through social media into the kitchen table talk of his voters.

Jerry Mobley, chairman of the Winston County Republican party in Alabama, represents a rural conservative community 50 miles north-east of Birmingham. Alabama Republicans are focused more on political primaries than international politics. Hotly contested races for governor, US senator and statewide offices could upend Alabama politics this year. But the Greenland news has been hard to ignore.

“I'd hate to say it's all in the wrong hands,” Mobley said of Greenland. “I think it's a security point … I would just like Trump to make sure that we maintain security for us and all of our allies.”

Antonio Ruiz is a former Army Ranger in New Braunfels, Texas. He's been to Greenland a couple of times, always on the way somewhere else. The prospect of a military confrontation with Nato is absurd to conservatives, even as the public discussion contemplates the possibility, he said.

“We laugh at it because there's no way that, number one, it will get to that point,” Ruiz said. “I mean, it's not like you guys haven't seen how Trump operates. We understand he throws a smattering on the board, but his pinpoint objective is right there at the bottom. It's bringing the people to the table to make a deal.”

Denying China a clear shipping route through the Arctic, and Chinese bases in the region, is a valid strategic objective, Ruiz said. The discussion within conservative military circles has been about how to achieve that objective.

“A majority of them are all believing that this is this is a strategic thing that needs to happen,” Ruiz said. “How we go about it is, all told, we want it diplomatic. I mean, we don't want to have to be watching your backs and going through guerrilla operations to hold a military base installation in Greenland. It's just not feasible.”

            A former Canadian Olympic snowboarder and the largest cocaine distributor in Canada, according to officials, has been arrested and is being placed in US custody.
    


            Ryan Wedding was one of FBI's “Ten Most Wanted” fugitives, with a $15 million reward for his capture, after being indicted for allegedly running a criminal enterprise, cocaine trafficking and murder in an operation stretching across the US, Canada, Mexico and Colombia.
    


            According to FBI Director Kash Patel, Wedding was taken into custody in Mexico on Thursday night and is being transported to the US. Officials say Wedding has been hiding in Mexico for over a decade, working for the Sinaloa Cartel and their cocaine operations – shipping the drug from Columbia to the US and Canada.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi previously said Wedding's operation was responsible for more than $1 billion a year in illegal drug proceeds. Officials had believed Wedding to be somewhere in Mexico under the protection of the Sinaloa cartel.
    


            “This operation is the result of tremendous cooperation and team work with the Government of Mexico,” Patel wrote in a post online Friday announcing the arrest. “Special thanks to our amazing partners in Mexico who facilitated this - President Sheinbaum, Secretary Harfuch, Ambassador Ron Johnson, Legat Mexico, and more.”
    


            Competing for Team Canada, Wedding finished as the 24th-best parallel giant slalom snowboarder in the world at the 2002 Winter Olympics.
    


            Wedding was taken to the US Friday, arriving at the Ontario International Airport in Southern California where officials, including Patel, gave a press conference following his arrest.
    


            During the press conference, officials said they had been searching for Wedding for over a year and accused the former snowboarder of orchestrating murders including of government officials.
    


            Officials say they seized guns, expensive cars, artwork and other items as part of the arrest. Wedding is expected to appear in federal court as soon as Monday, Patel said during the press conference, referring to the alleged cocaine kingpin as a “modern day Escobar.”
    


            FBI officials say they are still searching for more individuals involved in Wedding's operations.
    


            Wedding's arrest was first reported by NBC.
    


            This won't be the first time Wedding faces a judge.



            In June 2008, Wedding was arrested along with two other people and accused of conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, according to a criminal complaint.
    


            The arrest came after Wedding and associates traveled from Canada to San Diego, California, to buy cocaine as part of a drug trafficking organization based in Vancouver, according to an affidavit. The operation was a sting, though, and FBI agents arrested the trio after the deal was done, the affidavit states. Investigators allegedly found $100,000 in cash in their hotel room, the affidavit states.
    


            His two co-defendants pleaded guilty, according to court records, but Wedding took the case to trial. He was found guilty in November 2009, and in 2010, was sentenced to four years in prison, per court records.
    


How an Olympian became a fugitive



            At his sentencing hearing, Wedding invoked his sports background in speaking to the court, saying it was his personal goal to rebuild his reputation.
    


            In October 2024, however, federal prosecutors released a superseding indictment charging Wedding with running a criminal enterprise, cocaine trafficking and murder in an operation stretching across the US, Canada, Mexico and Colombia. The indictment says the enterprise began around 2011, when Wedding was released from prison.
    


            The crimes Wedding is accused of now, though, are even more serious.
    


            Prosecutors accuse him, along with another man, of ordering the killings of several people. They say he directed the November 2023 murders of two members of a family in Ontario “in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment” and of ordering the murder of another person in May 2024 over a drug debt.

Snow, sleet and freezing temperatures are forecast for the south, midwest and east coast over the weekend

Trump says the big US winter storm is proof of climate hoax – here's why he's wrong

The dangerous monster storm threatening half of the US was bearing down on Friday with 13 states already declaring emergencies and areas typically unused to prolonged Arctic temperatures bracing for power failures and supply shortages.

At least 230 million people are likely to be affected by the huge winter weather system as it forms in parts of the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains and surges across southern and midwestern areas from Friday, blowing up the east coast on Saturday and as far north as Maine by Sunday.

State governors have declared emergencies ahead of time that warn of mortal danger but also free up financial reserves to deal with the conditions. By early Friday, states of emergency had been announced in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina in the southern US. Emergency declarations were also made in Missouri, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. New York added itself to the list later on Friday morning.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump on Friday morning posted on his social media platform: “Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States. Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain – WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”

In fact, the climate crisis is causing more instability in weather systems and patterns, disrupting the polar vortex and bringing more extremes amid rapidly rising global temperatures. Arctic temperatures are more frequently and persistently sweeping across parts of the US not accustomed to prolonged deep chills. The US president has long been a climate crisis skeptic and is determinedly pulling the US back from domestic climate action and international treaties to curb global heating driven by human-caused emissions, while spinning inaccurate information.

Even the American Red Cross said on its website: “Winters are getting warmer and shorter because of the climate crisis. But, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, heavier snowfalls are more likely to occur.”

Lines have been forming at stores in several states, with residents hurriedly stocking up on supplies ranging from bottled water and electricity generators to food, toilet paper and blankets. The American Red Cross warned the public to prepare, while many local media outlets posted images on social media of empty retail shelves.

Meteorologists forecast snow, sleet and, treacherously, much freezing rain that is expected to leave thick layers of ice in many areas, potentially turning roads deadly and bringing down power lines while making clearance efforts more difficult. Authorities in southern areas are warning residents to brace for prolonged electricity outages.

Temperatures will plummet well below freezing in southern states, where such cold conditions are not typical, as well as in more northerly states that are more used to dealing with bitter and fierce winter storms.

The National Weather Service said: “Snowfall totals exceeding 12in are likely across the Ohio valley, mid-Atlantic and north-east.”

More than 100 million people across the US can expect to endure temperatures below freezing until at least next Wednesday.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has abruptly stopped firing people, with staff being told the agency would “cease off-boarding” workers who assist in times of disaster and whose contracts were due to expire, CNN reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.

Fema has reportedly drafted plans to eliminate thousands of staff this year, with the agency repeatedly under attack from the White House in the second Trump administration.

Fema send the following statement to the Guardian on Friday morning in response to CNN's reporting: “This is a mischaracterization of how Fema's CORE program works. The CORE program consists of term-limited positions that are designed to FLUCTUATE based on disaster activity, operational NEED, and available funding. Fema's National Response Coordination Center has been activated in response to a historic winter storm, in line with this mission Fema is following standard protocol to ensure mission functions are being met. We urge the media to report on how Americans can stay safe this weekend, not create manufactured drama while a winter storm looms.”

US airlines have already canceled 1,400 domestic flights scheduled for Saturday, according to the site FlightAware, and transportation in all modes is expected to be severely affected by the storm.

Snow-removal equipment was being urgently tested out at Charlotte's airport in North Carolina on Friday morning.

Further north, New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, declared a state of emergency for the entire state and said she was coordinating with the new mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani.

He took office on 1 January after barnstorming the election and is facing the first big test of his skills in managing operational logistics for the severe weather that could bring 18in of snow in a storm of a scale the city has not seen in several years.

Ukraine's army, with about a million troops, should form the backbone of a prospective European joint forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Jan. 23.

The statement comes after Zelensky reiterated on Jan. 20 the call to create a joint European army of at least 3 million personnel in response to growing Russian threat.

"(Russian) army will number 2.5-3 million. They want to reach all of this by 2030, and, based on their speed, we see that this is possible," Zelensky said following the World Economic Foundation's meetings in Davos, Switzerland. 

"I'm not saying it will be that way, I'm saying it's possible," the president added. 

Zelensky pointed out how the Ukrainian army had used European and American weapons to great and even unprecedented effect in fending off the Russian army. 

Russia, meanwhile, now has both a supercharged domestic defense industry and 1.5 million soldiers or former soldiers with experience fighting in Ukraine.

"Considering European forces, we're not just talking about quantity, but about capability and experience. Without the Ukrainian army — without a million Ukrainians — you won't manage. And this will be the backbone of such an army."

The size of the Ukrainian army, as announced by Zelensky, significantly exceeds Russia's demands, which seek to ensure that, following a peace agreement, Ukraine's military would consist of no more than 600,000 personnel — a condition Kyiv categorically rejects.

Yet Ukraine has reportedly agreed to limit its peacetime military to 800,000 service members, the Financial Times reported on Nov. 25, citing unnamed Ukrainian officials. 

A Ukrainian army of this size would still remain the second-largest European force after Russia and put it close to its current wartime strength of about 900,000 service members.

Zelensky's recent remarks come nearly a year after he first called on European partners to create a new armed force at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, 2025, amid uncertainty over further U.S. support if Russian aggression escalates.

Since then, European leaders have taken no steps toward implementing the initiative for nearly a year, according to Zelensky.

"Maybe now, with all the new challenges, European leaders will take it more seriously," the president said.

Several European nations, led by the U.K. and France, have held a series of talks aimed at establishing a "Coalition of the Willing," which aim to provide Ukraine with the military guarantees underpinning a peace deal. So far, this coalition has yet to guarantee any European boots on the ground in post-war Ukraine. 

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump's saber-rattling over Greenland, which he wants to take from Denmark, has reinvigorated talk of a joint European army, with several nations sending token forces to military exercises on the Arctic island on Jan. 15.

"The issue of Donbas is key," President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters hours before the talks began.





Orban cited a confidential document on Ukraine's accession allegedly presented at an EU summit in Brussels on the previous day. 

Kyiv, home to more than 3 million people, is still reeling from the Jan. 20 attack in which Russia launched 33 missiles and 339 drones against Ukraine. 

 The Kyiv Independent's Chris York speaks with Adam Entous, an investigative reporter at The New York Times, about his new investigation into the first year of U.S. President Donald Trump administration's peace efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

A fire broke out at an oil depot in the Russian city of Penza following a Ukrainian drone attack overnight on Jan. 23.

"(Russian) army will number 2.5-3 million. They want to reach all of this by 2030, and, based on their speed, we see that this is possible," Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Describing the plan, which was first floated in December, as a "bundle of documents," President Volodymyr Zelensky said he expects progress to be made in the future.

Kyiv's utilities workers have reconnected 650 high-rise apartment buildings in the past day, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Jan. 23. 

"We spoke with President Trump about additional anti-air missiles – the PAC-3s, against ballistics, which are what we need," Volodymyr Zelensky said. "I'm counting on a positive result."

Russia launched 101 drones, including roughly 60 Shahed-type deep-strike unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), into Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said.

"We are interested in resolving the (war) through political and diplomatic means. But until that happens, Russia will continue to pursue its goals on the battlefield," Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said.



The number includes 1,280 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Researchers found a new way to filter and destroy Pfas chemicals at 100 times the rate of current systems

New filtration technology developed by Rice University may absorb some Pfas “forever chemicals” at 100 times the rate than previously possible, which could dramatically improve pollution control and speed remediations.

Researchers also say they have also found a way to destroy Pfas, though both technologies face a steep challenge in being deployed on an industrial scale.

A new peer-reviewed paper details a layered double hydroxide (LDH) material made from copper and aluminum that absorbs long-chain Pfas up to 100 times faster than commonly used filtration systems.

“This material is going to be important for the direction of research on Pfas destruction in general,” said Michael Wong, director of Rice's Water Institute, a Pfas research center.

Pfas are a class of at least 16,000 compounds often used to help products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in the environment, and they are linked to serious health problems such as cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders and birth defects.

Current filtration technology like granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis or ion exchange absorbs Pfas in water, and the chemicals caught in the filter must be stored in hazardous waste facilities, or destroyed. Destruction of the chemicals typically involves a thermal process that subjects them to high heat, but that leaves toxic byproducts, or essentially breaks larger Pfas into smaller Pfas. There is no technology that fully destroys Pfas on an industrial scale.

Wong said Rice's non-thermal process works by soaking up and concentrating Pfas at high levels, which makes it possible to destroy them without high temperatures.

The LDH material Rice developed is a variation of similar materials previously used, but researchers replaced some aluminum atoms with copper atoms. The LDH material is positively charged and the long-chain Pfas are negatively charged, which causes the material to attract and absorb the chemicals, Wong said.

“There you go – it just soaks it in to the order of 100 times faster than other materials that are out there,” Wong added.

Pfas are virtually indestructible because their carbon atoms are bonded with fluoride, but Rice found that the bonds could be broken if the chemicals in the material were heated to 400-500C – a relatively low temperature. The fluoride gets trapped in the LDH material and is bonded to calcium. The leftover calcium-fluoride material is safe and can be disposed of in a landfill, Wong said.

The process works with some long-chain Pfas that are among the most common water pollutants, and it also absorbed some smaller Pfas that are commonplace. Wong said he is confident the material can be used to absorb a broad array of Pfas, especially if they are negatively charged.

Most new Pfas elimination systems fail to work at an industrial scale. Wong said the new material has an advantage because its absorption rate is so strong, it can be used repeatedly and it is in a “drop in material”, meaning it can be used with existing filtration infrastructure. That eliminates one of the major cost barriers.

Laura Orlando, a Pfas researcher with the Just Zero non-profit and a civil engineer who works on waste-management design, said she is always skeptical of claims around total destruction of Pfas, and new filtration technologies, because the processes are so complex in real-world conditions. Other challenges like occupational safety, or regulations and permitting, would have to be considered.

“We're going to need as many technologies as we can possibly find to deal with Pfas in drinking water, and if this works to scale on wastewater, then it would be really something to pay attention to,” Orlando said.

            US President Donald Trump has once again questioned whether NATO allies would “be there” if the United States “ever needed them,” baselessly claiming that the alliance's troops “stayed a little back” from the frontlines in Afghanistan.
    


            “I've always said, ‘Will they be there, if we ever needed them?' And that's really the ultimate test. And I'm not sure of that. I know that we would have been there, or we would be there, but will they be there?” Trump said Thursday in an interview with Fox News in Davos, Switzerland.
    


            In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the US became the first and so far only NATO member to invoke Article 5, which states that an attack against one member is an attack against all. For 20 years, NATO allies and other partner countries fought alongside US troops in Afghanistan – a sacrifice Trump has routinely downplayed.
    


            “We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did – they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines,” he said.
    


            The president's comments have rankled US allies in NATO, coming at the end of a week in which he has severely strained the alliance through his repeated threats to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous part of Denmark, another NATO member.
    


            While in absolute terms the US lost by far the most troops of any NATO country in Afghanistan, some European countries – with much smaller populations than the US – lost almost as many troops in relative terms.
    


            Around 3,500 allied troops died in the conflict, of which 2,456 were Americans and 457 were British. Denmark, with a population of around 5 million when the invasion began, lost more than 40 troops.
    


            The force dispatched to the southern Helmand province – a Taliban stronghold and a center of opium production – initially comprised mostly British and Danish troops, before the US sent reinforcements in 2008. Britain and Denmark suffered most of their casualties in Helmand.
    


            On Friday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer sharply criticized Trump's “insulting and frankly appalling” comments, and suggested the US president apologize for his remarks.
    


            “I'm not surprised they've caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured,” Starmer said. “If I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologize.”
    


            Prince Harry, who was twice deployed to Afghanistan, said in a statement provided by his spokesperson that the sacrifices of NATO troops deserve respect.
    


            “Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defence of diplomacy and peace,” he said in a statement provided by his spokesperson on Friday.
    


            Since the turn of the year, Trump has repeatedly questioned NATO's willingness to support the US. “I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM,” he blasted on Truth Social on January 7. “We will always be there for NATO, even if they won't be there for us.”
    


            Before Trump's comments to Fox News, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte had pushed back at the president's previous attempts to diminish the alliance's willingness to support the US.
    


            “There was one thing I heard you say yesterday and today – you were not absolutely sure that Europeans would come to the rescue of the US if you will be attacked,” Rutte said Wednesday in Davos, sitting next to Trump. “Let me tell you – they will. And they did in Afghanistan, as you know.”
    


            “For every two Americans who paid the ultimate price, there was one soldier from another NATO country that did not come back to his family,” Rutte said. “This is important. It pains me if you think it is not.”
    


            British lawmakers across the political spectrum were also outraged by Trump's comments.
    


            “NATO's Article 5 has only been triggered once. The UK and NATO allies answered the US call. And more than 450 British personnel lost their lives in Afghanistan,” said Defense Secretary John Healey. “Those British troops should be remembered for who they were: heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation.”
    


            Emily Thornberry, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Trump's comments were an “absolute insult,” while Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, called them “flat-out nonsense,” saying that the allies' sacrifice “deserves respect not denigration.”
    


            Other members of the Trump administration have also made light of the sacrifices made by NATO allies in Afghanistan. In June, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said his fellow US troops in Afghanistan would joke that the ISAF acronym on their shoulder patches – which stood for International Security Assistance Force – actually stood for “I Saw Americans Fighting.”
    


            “What ultimately was a lot of flags … was not a lot of on the ground capability,” Hegseth said, disparaging the efforts of NATO allies.

Labor unions and progressive organizations have called on workers across the state to stay home

Full report: Economic blackout in Minnesota to protest against ICE: ‘No work, no school, no shopping

A “no work, no school, no shopping” blackout day of protest was kicked off by community leaders, faith leaders and labor unions on Friday in protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) surge in the state.

The Day of Truth & Freedom protest comes in the wake of the killing of Renee Good, the unarmed woman killed by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Their demands include that ICE leave Minnesota, that the ICE officer who killed Good be legally held accountable, an end to additional federal funding for ICE, and for the agency to be investigated for human rights and constitutional violations.

Dozens of local businesses in Minnesota have announced closures in solidarity. The Minneapolis city council endorsed the day of action and the general strike. The day of action culminates with a march in downtown Minneapolis at 2pm local time.

“We are going to be having dangerously cold weather on Friday – -10F with wind chills. Like the high is going to be -10F with wind chills of up to -20F,” Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the Minnesota Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, told the Guardian.

“We are a northern state, and we are built for the cold, and we are going to show up, but folks are going to need to pay attention to not just the march, but what people are doing, the individual stories of solidarity that people are going to be doing.”

The Minnesota AFL-CIO, the state's federation of more than 1,000 affiliated local unions, has endorsed the day of action, along with dozens of local labor unions.

CNN has spoken to the Columbia Heights, Minnesota, school district superintendent Zena Stenvik about ICE's detention of four students in the city, including five-year-old Liam Ramos.

A reminder that Liam was taken into custody on Tuesday as he and his father arrived home from preschool in the Minneapolis suburb. According to school officials, an ICE agent used the child to knock on the family's front door to determine if anyone else was inside, before detaining father and son. They were later transported to Texas.

Stevnik described arriving to the scene to people crying in the street who told her the child had been taken. The father's car was also still running, she told CNN, contradicting claims from homeland security that he had attempted to flee on foot and abandoned Liam. Stevnik also said that another adult at the home had pleaded to take care of Liam but was denied.

Vice-president JD Vance has defended ICE's detainment of Liam, claiming the child would've been left to “freeze to death” if he wasn't taken with his dad. Asked if the child would've been abandoned and left outside, Stevnik said, “Not a chance.” She told CNN she spoke to Liam's mother, the school board chair and neighbors close to the family, all of whom wanted to take him.

I entered the home and the mother was distraught. She wanted Liam, she wanted to open the door. And I can't even imagine as a mother myself how conflicted she must have been. This is what she told me, seeing her husband standing in the driveway in handcuffs saying, don't open the door and also hearing her little one.

And she could see the ICE agent standing there at the door. So, I – I just can't imagine as a mother what she was going through. It was heartbreaking for me to hear her. And she looked up at me and - and said, I don't understand what's happening. We're not criminals. And as our – as the family's attorney stated yesterday, they have followed everything that they've needed to do in terms of the legal processes.

Stevnik went on:

Here in the Twin Cities right now, it's pretty common that people are not opening their doors because once anyone cracks open their door, the ICE agents are bursting through or even breaking doors down. So, that's the behavior that we're seeing. So, that's the only behavior that we can assume would have happened.

Marc Prokosch, an attorney representing the family, has said the Ramos family had followed proper legal procedures. They have an active asylum case and entered the US at an official port of entry, he said.

The family did everything they were supposed to in accordance with how the rules have been set out. They did not come here illegally. They are not criminals.

FBI director Kash Patel has conducted another purge of field office leaders and senior agents linked to the two criminal investigations of Donald Trump, MS NOW reports citing multiple people briefed on the matter.

While the exact number ousted is unclear, two people familiar with the matter told MS NOW that the special agent in charge in Atlanta has been removed, as has the acting assistant director in charge of the New York field office and a former special agent in charge in New Orleans.

What is more, two people said that as many as six agents in Miami were forced out over their connection to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, and other agents pushed out were involved in the “Arctic Frost” investigation of Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election.

Talks between Russia, Ukraine and the United States have begun in Abu Dhabi, according to the United Arab Emirates' ministry of foreign affairs.

The UAE is hosting a rare set of trilateral talks, bringing together negotiators from Russia, Ukraine, and the US. The talks have started today, and are scheduled to continue over the next two days.

According to a press statement, the UAE hopes that these discussions would “contribute to tangible steps toward ending a crisis that has persisted for nearly four years and resulted in immense humanitarian suffering”.

A reminder that special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, also Donald Trump's son-in-law, are representing the US.

A new poll from Emerson College finds that 51% of likely voters disapprove of Donald Trump's performance in office, one year into his new administration.

Also included in this latest survey, 57% of voters think the presence of federal immigration agents in communities has been more harmful than beneficial, while 38% think it has been more beneficial than harmful.

Linked to this, only 38% of respondents had a favorable opinion of Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, while 45% had an unfavorable opinion.

Senator Elizabeth Warren and fellow Democrats have accused Donald Trump of letting white-collar criminals “off the hook” by diverting crucial resources to his sweeping immigration crackdown.

In a letter to federal watchdogs, the Democrats demand an investigation into the US president for shifting more than 25,000 personnel away from investigating fraud, tax evasion and money laundering in favour of his immigration enforcement agenda.

“The Trump Administration is letting white-collar criminals off the hook for all kinds of wrongdoing,” Warren, from Massachusetts, said in a statement. “Instead of protecting American families from fraud and predatory behavior, the Administration is diverting resources to pursue its inhumane immigration agenda.

“Nobody is above the law, and the Trump Administration needs to stop treating white collar criminals with kid gloves.”

In the letter to inspectors general of the justice department, state department, homeland security, the postal service and the treasury's tax division, the Democrats allege that the administration is “diverting critical federal law enforcement personnel and resources” away from corporate crime and into what they describe as Trump's “civil immigration dragnet”.

The letter – signed by Democrats including Warren, Senator Richard Blumenthal and Representatives Dan Goldman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Madeleine Dean – demands a formal evaluation of the extent of the transfers and their impact on US financial crime enforcement.

It cites a “deep concern” that entire investigative units have been “gutted” as agents are sent to bolster Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.

The president also made sure to tout his achievements at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. “So many things accomplished,” he wrote in a post on Truth Social, “including the framework of a deal with NATO on Greenland. Also, the BOARD OF PEACE. WOW!!! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

A reminder that the neither Trump, nor Nato chief Mark Rutte, have provided explicit details on the Greenland deal. Earlier in the week, the president said it would last “forever” while speaking to reporters in Davos.

Ahead of the snowstorms expected on the US east coast this weekend, the president took to Truth Social to posit how global warming could still exist in the face of adverse weather conditions like these.

“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States. Rarely seen anything like it before,” he wrote. “Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain – WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”

Of course, global warming does not stop winter … but in fact causes average global temperatures to rise. Increased temperatures also intensify snowstorms, and a rapidly warming Arctic has ultimately stretched the polar vortex – meaning the US is facing the brunt of colder weather over the coming days.

My colleagues Oliver Laughland and Tom Silverstone have spent time in Minnesota, following the fatal shooting of Renee Good.

In their latest piece, they travelled to neighbourhoods in Minneapolis, grappling with a surge of federal immigration enforcement, to speak with residents who are fighting to defend their communities from violence and intimidation. They also embed with ICE watch groups, hear from Somali American residents, and witness a swarm of federal agents conduct a sweep in the suburbs.

Watch here:

Donald Trump doesn't have any public events today, according to the White House schedule.

He's due to sit for a print interview later today, and meet with Frank Bisignano, the commissioner of the Social Security Administration.

We will, however, hear from the vice-president, JD Vance, who will speak at this year's March for Life in Washington. A reminder that this is the country's largest anti-abortion rally. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, is also set to address demonstrators.

We'll bring you the latest lines as that gets under way at 11am ET.

The United Nations rights chief voiced astonishment on Friday at the “now-routine abuse” of migrants by US authorities, urging Washington to end practices “tearing apart families”.

Volker Turk called on the United States to ensure migration policies and enforcement practices respect human dignity and due process and slammed the “dehumanising portrayal and harmful treatment of migrants and refugees”.

“I am astounded by the now-routine abuse and denigration of migrants and refugees,” he said in a statement.

“Where is the concern for their dignity, and our common humanity?”

Thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to Democratic-led Minneapolis, as the Republican administration of Donald Trump presses its campaign to deport what it says are millions of illegal immigrants across the country.

A “no work, no school, no shopping” blackout day of protest was kicked off by community leaders, faith leaders and labor unions on Friday in protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) surge in the state.

The Day of Truth & Freedom protest comes in the wake of the killing of Renee Good, the unarmed woman killed by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Their demands include that ICE leave Minnesota, that the ICE officer who killed Good be legally held accountable, an end to additional federal funding for ICE, and for the agency to be investigated for human rights and constitutional violations.

Dozens of local businesses in Minnesota have announced closures in solidarity. The Minneapolis city council endorsed the day of action and the general strike. The day of action culminates with a march in downtown Minneapolis at 2pm local time.

“We are going to be having dangerously cold weather on Friday – -10F with wind chills. Like the high is going to be -10F with wind chills of up to -20F,” Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the Minnesota Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, told the Guardian.

“We are a northern state, and we are built for the cold, and we are going to show up, but folks are going to need to pay attention to not just the march, but what people are doing, the individual stories of solidarity that people are going to be doing.”

The Minnesota AFL-CIO, the state's federation of more than 1,000 affiliated local unions, has endorsed the day of action, along with dozens of local labor unions.

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the latest news lines.

We start with news that a vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy has been urging Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores on Friday to protest against immigration enforcement in the state.

“We really, really want ICE to leave Minnesota, and they're not going to leave Minnesota unless there's a ton of pressure on them,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 groups that are mobilizing. “They shouldn't be roaming any streets in our country just the way they are now.”

The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer during an operation on 7 January, AP reports.

The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents nearly 2 million service and healthcare workers across the US, is leading calls for nationwide participation.

“Martin Luther King wrote to Cesar Chavez during the Great Boycott and said our separate struggles are really one struggle,” David Huerta, president of SEIU-United Service Workers West (USWW) and SEIU California, said on Sunday on Politics Nation with the Rev Al Sharpton on MS Now.

“Right now, more than any time ever, we see our civil rights, workers' rights, and immigrants' rights … in alignment with one another.”

He added: “When we look at Minneapolis – the violence, the cruelty that's being brought by this federal government against working people – it is now more than ever that we have to stand together, regardless of our differences.”

Friday's mobilization was planned as the largest coordinated protest action to date, including a march in downtown Minneapolis despite dangerously cold temperatures that the National Weather Service forecast in the single to double digits below zero (-20 to -30C).

In other developments:

Donald Trump withdrew on Thursday an invitation for Canada to join his “board of peace” initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts. “Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post directed at the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney.

Greenland has demanded its red lines on sovereignty be respected after Donald Trump claimed an agreement with Nato would give the US full and permanent access to the Arctic island, the object of an increasingly bitter months-long dispute. Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Greenland's prime minister, said on Thursday he did not know what was in the deal but the largely self-governing territory wanted a “peaceful dialogue” with the US, and its sovereignty was non-negotiable.

Before the US military snatched Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, earlier this month, Delcy Rodríguez and her powerful brother pledged to cooperate with the Trump administration once the strongman was gone, four sources involved at high levels with the discussions told the Guardian. Rodríguez, who was sworn in on 5 January as acting president to replace Maduro, and her brother Jorge, the head of the national assembly, secretly assured US and Qatari officials through intermediaries ahead of time that they would welcome Maduro's departure, according to the sources.

The White House posted a digitally altered image of a woman who was arrested on Thursday in a case touted by the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, to make it seem as if she was dramatically crying, a Guardian analysis of the image has found. The woman, Nekima Levy Armstrong, also appears to have darker skin in the altered image. Armstrong was one of three people arrested on Thursday in connection to a demonstration that disrupted church services in St Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday.

Jack Smith, the former special counsel, has defended his decision to seek criminal charges against Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in his first and perhaps only public appearance to discuss the cases after they were dropped last year. “No one should be above the law in this country, and the law required that he be held to account,” Smith said in his opening remarks before the House judiciary committee. “So that is what I did.”

The Trump administration will block organizations that receive US foreign aid from subsidizing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and what the administration calls “gender ideology”. The new policy will affect about $30bn in foreign assistance.

Ukraine is banking on more anti-ballistic air defense missiles from the U.S. following a "positive" meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 23. 

"What did Davos bring to Ukraine? Above all, let's be fair: An important meeting with the United States of America. With all due respect to other leaders," Zelensky told reporters.

"We actually had a positive meeting with President Trump and his team," Zelensky said. "Above all, if I'm being honest, I raised the question of air defense, and I think that the U.S.A. will return with a positive result."

Relations between Ukraine and the U.S. have soured since Trump returned to office just over a year ago. His administration has largely cut off aid, in contrast to extensive U.S. weapons support under President Joe Biden. Ukraine's air defense in particular has been suffering. 

Lack of air defense has left Ukraine vulnerable to Russian air strikes that have taken large swathes of energy infrastructure offline, leaving millions of Ukrainians without electricity and heat in the coldest winter of the full-scale war yet. 

"We spoke with President Trump about additional anti-air missiles – the PAC-3s, against ballistics, which are what we need," Zelensky said. "I'm counting on a positive result."

PAC-3s are missiles for Patriot air defense systems that are to date the only reliable defense against Russian ballistic missiles like Kinzhals and Iskanders. "Nothing else works," Zelensky said earlier this week. 

Zelensky is also further looking for Trump to underwrite security guarantees for Ukraine. 

"The treaty is ready to be signed. Of course, there will be different technical details, and on the basis of this document, other supplementary documents will come up," Zelensky said. "Now I'm waiting for the time and place from President Trump. It's up to him."

Ukraine and the U.S. have been discussing a potential agreement for several months that is expected to include security guarantees on land, sea, and air, as well as the involvement of foreign military contingents.

A European "Coalition of the Willing," led by the U.K. and France, has held several meetings but has yet to secure commitments, such as providing boots on the ground, for a post-war Ukraine.

Zelensky said on Dec. 26 that the U.S. had offered Ukraine security guarantees for 15 years, but the president expressed hope the guarantees could be extended for a longer period.

On Jan. 12, Zelensky said the document was essentially ready and added that the next step would be its final review at the highest level.

His work has appeared in Radio Free Europe, Fortune, Breaking Defense, the Cipher Brief, the Foreign Policy Research Institute, FT's Sifted, and Science Magazine. He holds a BA from Vanderbilt University.

"The issue of Donbas is key," President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters hours before the talks began.





Orban cited a confidential document on Ukraine's accession allegedly presented at an EU summit in Brussels on the previous day. 

Kyiv, home to more than 3 million people, is still reeling from the Jan. 20 attack in which Russia launched 33 missiles and 339 drones against Ukraine. 

 The Kyiv Independent's Chris York speaks with Adam Entous, an investigative reporter at The New York Times, about his new investigation into the first year of U.S. President Donald Trump administration's peace efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

A fire broke out at an oil depot in the Russian city of Penza following a Ukrainian drone attack overnight on Jan. 23.

"(Russian) army will number 2.5-3 million. They want to reach all of this by 2030, and, based on their speed, we see that this is possible," Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Describing the plan, which was first floated in December, as a "bundle of documents," President Volodymyr Zelensky said he expects progress to be made in the future.

Kyiv's utilities workers have reconnected 650 high-rise apartment buildings in the past day, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Jan. 23. 

"We spoke with President Trump about additional anti-air missiles – the PAC-3s, against ballistics, which are what we need," Volodymyr Zelensky said. "I'm counting on a positive result."

Russia launched 101 drones, including roughly 60 Shahed-type deep-strike unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), into Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said.

"We are interested in resolving the (war) through political and diplomatic means. But until that happens, Russia will continue to pursue its goals on the battlefield," Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said.



The number includes 1,280 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

There have been two very different Canadian reactions to our shock of realizing, slowly over the last year and then very quickly over the last week, that the United States is no longer an ally or even a competitor, but a tangible threat to Canada's well-being – and possibly its existence.

One response involves reaching out and renewing connections with more reliable partners. The other involves hunkering down, bunkering in and quite literally choosing the nuclear option.

We heard the outward-facing response in Prime Minister Mark Carney's Davos speech: We need to forge new alliances with other mid-sized countries, and reconstruct the globalized systems of open trade and collective security that have protected us since the 1940s, but without Washington. It was a summary of what Canada and European countries have been attempting to do for the past year.

The inward-turning response is most visible in the surprising number of people calling for Canada to develop its own nuclear-weapons program.

“Canada needs a nuclear deterrent” has become a widespread message on social media lately; a search of those words on X or Bluesky or Reddit will yield hundreds of versions, some from commentators with large audiences (interestingly, voices on the left seem to dominate).

Carney calls for national unity in face of economic challenges ahead

But it's also a message coming from circles of well-informed Canadians. Jean-François Bélanger of the NATO Defence College argued here in The Globe that Canada should get itself both nukes and ICBMs to confront “a continued and serious threat of annexation by the United States.” Political consultant Jamie Carroll said we need to replace the U.S. nuclear umbrella with our own to guard against Russia, China and other threats. University of Toronto political scientist Aisha Ahmad made the case that Canada needs “a bulletproof defence of its homeland” that only domestic nukes can provide.

At root is the increasingly popular image of a Hobbesian 21st-century world in which nuclear-armed countries invade or conquer those without nukes, and only individual countries adopting the bomb can protect them.

That is a fallacy on several levels – especially as it applies to Canada. 

In 1949, Canada chose to replace the old and very expensive idea of autonomous, soup-to-nuts national defence with the burden-sharing concept of collective security in the form of NATO. This includes both mutual defence, as embodied by its charter obligation to come to the aid of any member under attack, and perhaps more importantly collective deterrence – the notion that not every member country needs to possess every defensive armament and protective weapons system, and only a few need to have the really expensive ones, in order to protect all. This was not simply a way to get protection from the United States – even without Washington, it provides us middle powers a range of deterrents on a superpower scale.

There is no conceivable threat to Canada that would be reduced by Canada possessing its own nukes. 

An attack over our northern border by Russia or any other major military would immediately be viewed by Washington – regardless what sort of regime is present there and regardless its attitude toward Canada – as an incursion on its northern and Alaskan borders. Both NATO allies and a hypothetical non-NATO America would assert their conventional and nuclear deterrents.

And in the event that Mr. Trump decided to turn his red-white-and-blue map of North America into reality by force, we'd be no better off with nukes. Recent years have shown the world that nuclear weapons have no deterrent power against attacks or invasions by adjoining countries.

Opinion: America the predator: Trump wants to show the world he can take what he wants

The province of Kursk, theoretically protected by Russia's 5,459 nuclear warheads, was recently invaded and occupied by non-nuclear Ukraine for almost a year. The world's largest nuclear arsenal was of no help in either preventing the invasion or eventually bringing it to an end, because Ukrainians knew that Russia would not irradiate millions of its own people (the same reason why experts say that Ukraine keeping its Soviet nukes would have hastened rather than prevented a Russian invasion). Likewise, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal did nothing to prevent India's large-scale aerial bombing of hundreds of Pakistani military sites following a conventional war last year – much as it hasn't stopped India from more or less permanently occupying parts of Kashmir that international law designates as Pakistani.

It was a relief to see that the Canadian military's secret plans to defend against a U.S. invasion, revealed in The Globe this week, seem to understand this – they are limited to insurgency strategies and reliance on our collective-security umbrella, including our European deterrents. True, Canada will need to contribute more to military burden-sharing in the event that Washington withdraws from NATO. But we need not learn to stop worrying and love the bomb.

Icicles have formed on Harris's woolly hat and there's frost on her eyelashes. When she cries, genuine tears of sadness at what's happening to her home city, you half expect them to turn to ice too.

The weather has turned achingly cold, down to 36 below freezing, and the ill wind blowing through Minneapolis and St Paul makes it feel all the colder still. It's near enough the kind of weather that defeated Napoleon and Hitler in Russia.

Yet Minnesota won't be cowed; Minnesotans are determined to brave the coldest of cold snaps to continue their street demonstrations against Donald Trump and the army of immigration agents roaming the Twin Cities rounding up illegal aliens. Theirs is the politest and in some ways most middle-class of protests.

They shout “your mother would be ashamed” at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents driving out of the gates of their base on the outskirts of Minneapolis. Occasionally they swear at them.

It's been a fortnight since Renee Good was shot dead by an ICE agent in what the Trump administration has insisted was an act of self-defence against a “domestic terrorist”, but which video and eyewitness evidence suggests was a needless shooting of an innocent mother.

A little over five years before, George Floyd, a black man, was murdered by a white police officer who knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes until he suffocated.

The killing – just a few blocks from where Good was shot and killed – triggered violent protests, arson attacks and looting. Minneapolis's third precinct police station was overrun and set ablaze.

The response to the death of Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, in contrast has been muted. In part it's because many of those protesting are middle-class “moms” like Good, but it's also because no one wants to give Donald Trump a reason – or call it an excuse – to crackdown on a city he really doesn't like.

Eighteen months ago Tim Walz, Minnesota's governor, called Mr Trump “weird” in an interview that went viral and earned him the Democratic nomination for vice-president. Many Minnesotans now believe Mr Trump is hell bent on revenge for that humiliation.

The people here know Minnesota is on a knife edge.

It's no wonder Harris, 38, (she won't give her full name for fear of any consequences) starts to cry. She takes up her spot from 9am every day bringing supplies like hand and toe warmers, beanie hats, blankets and gas masks to the daily protest at the Bishop Henry Whipple Building where the department of homeland security has its Minnesota base.

“I am here until ICE stops,” she says. “It will end one way or another. We are not going anywhere. They say Minnesota Nice and they think it means we are pushovers. But what it means is we are passionate and we care.

“There's a saying: ‘we all do better when we all do better'. That's why I get up, that's why I do it.” And then Harris, who works with children with special needs, starts to weep.

The Trump administration has deployed 2,000 federal agents in Minnesota to round up illegal immigrants. It's not clear how much of a problem there is. Studies suggest there are somewhere between 80,000 and 95,000 undocumented migrants in Minnesota – about 1.5 per cent of the state's population.

Florida, where Trump lives in Mar-a-Lago, has somewhere between 770,000 and 1.15 million undocumented migrants, in the region of five per cent of the population. Texas, another “red” state, has an estimated 1.7 illegal migrants – in the region of six per cent of a 30 million population.

Yet Pete Hegseth, Mr Trump's defence secretary, has ordered 1,500 active duty soldiers with the army's 11th Airborne Division in Alaska to prepare for deployment to Minnesota.

It's no coincidence that troops have been chosen from Alaska, acclimatised as they are to Minnesota's savage winters. Temperatures were dropping to a low of -20C in the early hours of Tuesday morning, with a wind chill that makes it feel more like -27C. Frostbite, at those temperatures, can take hold in 15 minutes.

On Wednesday, the Pentagon also put an army military police brigade on standby to deploy to Minneapolis. That came after the local police in the city complained that off-duty ethnic minority officers with the force were being stopped by ICE.

At the same time, Mr Walz has mobilised the Minnesota National Guard to be ready to assist. It does, say protesters, risk a clash of troops under potentially different commands. The city is so tense, civil war is spoken openly as a possibility – and not easily dismissed as a laughable prospect.

There have been reports of Left-wing militants armed with semi-automatic rifles patrolling neighbourhoods on the lookout for ICE agents, the videos circulating on the social media feeds of hard-Right Trump supporters.

The anti-ICE protesters are convinced the White House is capable of cooking up a “red flag” operation to give the president the excuse to send in the troops.

Lily Wood, 43, a stay at home “mom” of three children, with “ICE OUT” pinned to her furry hat, said: “We are just hoping Donald Trump is so obsessed about Greenland that he forgets about us.”

That may be wishful thinking. On Tuesday, to mark his first year in office, Mr Trump opened his address to the nation by displaying the photos of Minnesotan criminals caught by ICE agents. JD Vance flew into Minneapolis on Thursday.

Ms Wood had attended the protests with her best friend from school Liz Walla, 43 and also a mother of three, on a day off. The pair are well used to Minnesota's freezing conditions. In the killing of Good, “you are seeing yourself, a white woman and a mother”.

She would go home later to put a casserole in the oven for her husband and kids but wanted to let the ICE agents coming in and out of the Whipple building know what she thought of them. The abuse is all verbal.

“Trump wants the protests to turn violent, to give him the excuse to deploy troops. We don't want this to de-escalate but really don't want it to escalate either. It's so frustrating. ICE are supposed to catch the murderers and bad people, instead they killed a mother,” she says.

Across town at the makeshift shrine where Good was shot, Karen Hutt, 68, a Unitarian minister, had watched the dead woman's body being carried limp from her car, placed on a stretcher and taken to an ambulance, which she said was prevented from breaching the police cordon following the shooting. She had heard the fatal gunshots.

“It was disgusting. It was inhuman,” said the grandmother. “This is all about Walz and the election. He called Trump weird and this is his retribution campaign. It's not complicated. Trump is a juvenile; he is not serious. He's a clown.

“But the big crisis is coming when Walz deploys the state national guard, Hegseth sends in the regular army from Alaska and ICE with its Stasi agents then who is fighting who?”

In 2020, when George Floyd was murdered, the city – in parts at least – was in flames. The gas station on the corner where Floyd died remains burnt out and his shrine still in place, surviving demands for it to be removed.

Becca Cerra, 34, education officer at the arts centre right where Floyd died, is hopeful ICE will be defeated by… well, the ice. “I am surprised if they can survive the cold,” she said.

“They haven't got the kit. No gloves, no hats. You can tell their boots aren't going to keep them warm,” she said. Videos circulating online are said to show ICE agents slipping and sliding, falling over.

Her boss, Victoria Lauing, 54, a mother-of-two, urges caution. “There is no interest in provocation. Most folks here are really not taking the bait,” she said.

“It's different from 2020 when the murderer was one of our own in the police force.” Then the backlash was violent, this time there is a genuine realisation that taking on the Trump administration appears to be exactly what it wants.

“This may well be a personal vendetta. That is how Trump operates,” said Ms Lauing. “He wrote to Norway, explaining he was taking Greenland because he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize. He is a petulant child except he is a grown man.”

How Minneapolis continues to respond is another matter. The fear for many will be that the memory of Good will fade and ICE will persist. And then the White House will have won.

It deployed the agents en masse in part on the pretext of a billion dollar fraud ring, a great chunk of it perpetuated by Somalis, starting in the Covid-era that covered food programmes, housing, day care centres and other social service provisions.

To date, more than 90 people have been charged and 60 convicted, many of them Somalis. On the back of the scandal, Mr Walz announced he would not be seeking re-election.

Nobody really thinks sending gun-toting immigration agents to a city to clear up a fraud makes any sense.

Meanwhile, the department of justice (DoJ) has begun opening up fresh cases in the wake of Good's death. Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot her, is not under investigation but reports have suggested that Good's widow, Becca Good, is being investigated over allegations she impeded a federal officer in the moments before a shooting.

Mr Walz and Jacob Frey, Minneapolis's mayor, are also facing federal investigation by the DoJ over allegations they impeded ICE operations by encouraging locals on the ground to report and record agents' activities.

The DoJ is also investigating protesters who disrupted a Sunday service at a church in Minnesota where the local pastor was also said to be a senior ICE official in charge of local field services, who had appeared at a department of homeland security press conference back in the autumn ahead of the launch of Operation Metro Surge.

At least two people were arrested on Thursday.

It's the kind of stunt that's been cheered by the protesters, but has got the White House's backs up.

There have been clashes. Police have used pepper spray and tear gas to dispel crowds. Protest groups are split over whether to get more confrontational. Not less. The Minnesota immigrant rights action committee, a prominent anti-ICE group, issued a statement last week that declared: “There is violence and there is resistance to violence. They must not be equated.”

Asamblea de Derechos Civiles, the faith-based nonprofit, also pushed for a stronger response to what it called a “racist, fascist” federal government.

Ben Ramirez told the local Minnesota Star Tribune: “It's now time to take our gloves off. We will not go peacefully.”

Back at the Whipple federal building, demonstrators ignored the snow, the ice and bone-chilling cold to hurl obscenities – but nothing more – at the agents driving out the building. Elizabeth Bubnash, 40, an ICU doctor born in Minneapolis had flown in specially from Pennsylvania to register her dissent.

“They hit us with chemical weapons but we are staying peaceful,” she said. “The white community is seeing for the first time what the black community have been seeing for decades – that this is a country of white privilege and white supremacy. But now one of our own has been murdered in the street and now there is a white outcry.”

Minnesota's middle-classes will continue to register their anger in their largely polite ways.

Women dressed from Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale, but wearing gas marks, promenaded past the ICE facility, the literary reference presumably lost on their adversaries. Or else they held up placards that proclaimed “Hey ICE – was that bonus worth your soul?” and “I need to be able to tell my grandchildren I did not stay silent.”

In the bitter chill of Minnesota that really stings.

These companies govern, unelected, through data-intensive platforms. It's time we explicitly acknowledge that

Wendy H. Wong is a professor of political science and Principal's Research Chair at the University of British Columbia, and the author of We, the Data: Human Rights in the Digital Age, which won the 2024 Balsillie Prize for Public Policy. Her next book, Mirrored States, will be published in 2027.

In the digital realm, small mistakes can result in big consequences. 

On July 19, 2024, a faulty software update from a company most people had never heard of grounded global air travel from Hong Kong to Hamburg. Hospitals couldn't access medical records or schedule appointments. Banks froze payments. Millions of people suddenly found themselves cut off from everyday services they assumed were reliable, all because of one cybersecurity company: CrowdStrike. 

What was a planned routine update from CrowdStrike triggered the largest global IT incident on record, crippling more than 8.5 million Windows machines. They fixed the bug the same day, but the fallout lingered. 

Images of stranded travellers and closed retail terminals peppered the news. Delta Airlines cancelled 7,000 flights and has since been cleared to sue CrowdStrike for the losses.

What the CrowdStrike fiasco revealed is that we're governed continuously, and unavoidably, by a complicated, interconnected and deeply enmeshed system of data-intensive platforms. That is, technologies (often working seamlessly in the background) structure how we live. When they fail, we feel the lack of order – the lack of governance – immediately. 

Technologies govern. Governance means setting the conditions under which people live, play and work – establishing rules, shaping expectations and allocating resources. When we say “Big Tech,” we mean the many companies that govern our lives, through their platforms that traffic in data.

It's time we acknowledge that governance explicitly. As governors, Big Tech companies should take accountability for the outsized role they play in our lives. 

We often talk about Big Tech as if it were just Google (Alphabet), Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft – the Big Five. Add Tesla and Nvidia if you like – the Magnificent Seven, instead. What unifies them is economic: market capitalization, stock valuations or shares across markets.

What if we thought about “bigness” as their embeddedness and indispensability in our lives? Not just user base, but the depth of our collective and individual entanglement with the platforms they run. These companies create platforms for users to access online resources. Through these platforms, they collect, store and analyze the behavioural data about and made by humans. 

I recently chatted with a friend about libraries over dinner as we shared photos on our phones – and libraries popped up in her socials and online ads the next day. When my sister was house hunting, she and I were texting about a Midwestern city I was speaking in; the next day, her suggested houses included properties in that city, thousands of kilometres away from her targeted search. Big Tech companies mediate communication, commerce, transportation, entertainment, education, health care, and social services – and, now, they're our portals to AI. 

Big Tech companies, it can be said, not only control the means of connection through platforms, but also the means to computation as organizations and individuals rely increasingly on AI, which in turn depends on cloud computing. Platforms pull us in and data encourage us to stay. Your connectivity gives you access to a share of computation that is not otherwise possible.

Governing is about creating a shared order with enforceable expectations. Since the Second World War, we've lived in a world where governance is presumed to be, and set up as, the domain of states, or governments. Today, we live in a world of multiple governors: states, yes, but also Big Tech governance.

Big Tech governs through:

• Data: More data means better platforms; better platforms attract more users; more users produce more data. These self-reinforcing network effects give companies reach no state could achieve.

• Platforms: The apps we use to direct our automated, internet-connected devices – from smart thermostats to office tools – create shared expectations and behaviours. Platforms create and control those digital networks: consumers to markets, business to business. It's not about the hardware so much as the software that runs on top.

From data-intensive platforms, Big Tech companies learn and steer human behaviours and choices. With current AI models' power and data-hungry tendencies, computation is now the domain of the cloud, which is the engine of artificial intelligence, logistics, social networks and online services. The data, platforms and computation are mutually reinforcing, making better services that keep you online. 

The marvel and challenge is that technologies have enabled companies to govern. Like governments, they are rather difficult to forsake.

You can (usually) opt out of social media. You can opt out of voting. You can sometimes emigrate to a different country. 

But do you have a job? Do you have a cellphone? Do you use e-mail or make digital payments? Have you passed by a smart doorbell like Ring or Nest? If so, you're already in the cloud, and you can't opt out of Big Tech governance.

Within days of each other, in October, 2025, two of the three biggest cloud computing services, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's Azure, erred and crashed. 

It was a dark October for thousands of businesses and, by extension, millions of people worldwide. The outages touched companies as varied as Alaska Airlines, Costco, Snapchat, Slack, Vodaphone, and Coinbase, government services such as Britain's HM Revenue and Customs, and anyone using Microsoft 365. Online gaming “tilted” as Roblox, Pokémon Go, Epic Games and the PlayStation Network went dark. 

One unique casualty was Eight Sleep, a company that sells “smart beds” with temperature controls, sensors and adjustable bases. When AWS went down, the beds malfunctioned. Customers found themselves stuck upright, overheated or shivering until the outage was resolved.

Most of us don't own smart beds. But most of us have smartphones. Moreover, we all depend on platforms for our work, communication and finances. That dependence becomes obvious only when something breaks.

We saw this during the 2021 Facebook outage, in which a configuration error of the company's internal systems took down Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram for six hours. Roughly 3.5 billion social network users lost access, but so did 200 million businesses that rely on such platforms to reach customers. In many parts of the world, WhatsApp is the way people communicate. Other users mused philosophically about who they really were without digital social networks, both as connections, and their personhood altogether. 

Technical problems must be recognized as social and political problems. A small error in one system can cascade through dozens of others, toppling the digital dominoes that underpin daily life. Platforms come in many forms. There are consumer-facing ones, such as TikTok, business-oriented ones, such as Salesforce, and ones that enable the world to run, providing compute for our lives to work, such as Amazon Web Services.

“Compute” is a term that technical types use to describe the resources needed to complete tasks, from loading websites to large language models like ChatGPT. These days, the interwoven nature of platforms creating, sharing and storing data that needs to be accessed quickly requires an incredible amount of compute, and it's not cheap. 

This leaves us vulnerable to how Big Tech platforms govern us. They don't have to actively collude to govern us across all the different domains of human life – social, political, cultural and economic. What they possess is much more elementary: Big Tech companies have invented and maintain the means to connectivity and computation that underlie modern societies.

This is a call to see Big Tech for what it is: a governor. Their power and motivation ostensibly come from the market, but their reach goes far, far beyond that. The word “governor” more accurately characterizes what they do, and also, how we should view their powers. If we understand them better, we can also imagine different strategies to reduce their disproportionate dominance in the economy and control of data, among other things.

When we look back at other “big” sectors, they've historically been active in limited areas. Think Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Tobacco. 

But Big Tech has moved beyond those limits and enmeshed itself in society and lives through platforms, and leverages the data collected from those platforms to govern us in ways that are hard to imagine ever giving Standard Oil or Philip Morris. 

We haven't seen business models like Big Tech before, because prior to the internet era, we didn't have the technology that has allowed companies to create the widespread tools and data collection capacity that we know today. This capacity enables them to govern.

There's a saying: If you're not paying, you're the product. We've moved beyond this implied choice. You're governed, whether you pay or not.

Governments haven't been exactly enthusiastic about shaking up the bargain with Big Tech. But they also seem stuck in an antagonistic dynamic. 

Somewhere along the way we've been swept up into this idea that states and companies are at loggerheads. But in digital technologies, governments (particularly the U.S. government) have been a key investor and developer of tools we take for granted. Expansive studies have shown that many of the things we take for granted in our smartphones, from GPS to touchscreen displays to the very internet that enables their smartness, are based on government-funded research. 

Generative AI models like ChatGPT and many others benefited from Canadian government funding. Canada led the way among states in national support with the Pan-Canadian AI strategy.

Aside from losing the thread of government support enabling innovation, governments have played an exasperating game of whack-a-mole, chasing the symptoms of Big Tech governance on companies' terms. You don't win the game by trying to whack those moles with what they give you. The mallet's too small and it's tied to the machine itself, putting you at a disadvantage from the start. To stand a chance of winning, you either drop the mallet and use your hands, or you figure out the underlying mechanism's pattern of revealing those smiling little mole faces.

If anything, some government forays have intensified the problem. The U.S. declaring Google a monopoly hasn't resulted in profound changes. In fact, Amit Mehta, the Washington, D.C.–based U.S. federal judge overseeing the Google antitrust case, made it such that Google was required to share search data with other companies, which only spreads the wealth embedded in those data. 

Similarly, the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) places special demands on the “gatekeeper” companies, including that they must make data available to other businesses. 

Sharing data makes the hold data-intensive platforms has on us worse, even as it introduces “competition” by undercutting the most powerful firms. Several of the EU's regulatory mechanisms rely upon heavy fines as deterrents and punishments. For example, the DMA can levy fines up to 10 per cent of a company's annual revenue, an admittedly impressive penalty. But fines are only effective if they can be collected and not ensnared in courts for years.

Holding a handful of massive companies responsible does not address the underlying system of data-intensive platforms. While it's normal to focus on some very prominent companies, we lose sight of the fact that in the very short history of the internet, Big Data and AI constantly introduce new players that can bring down seemingly unstoppable giants (pause here for AOL, Yahoo! and MySpace). 

More importantly, it perpetuates the idea that states need to whack companies into submission. Sometimes, positive incentives matter just as much (if not more) than punishments.

The answer to ineffective governance isn't to let companies do what they wish. Far from it. 

First, states don't have to be punitive (or use “sticks”) to govern. They can also change the incentives of other governors, by using “carrots.” As we know from international relations, power can be soft or hard, and hard power doesn't always prevail. Second, acknowledging that Big Tech companies are governors isn't just rhetorical. It means that they take on responsibilities of governing, just as governments do.

Practically speaking, governments can wield power without force. For one, states have the power of procurement. They need a lot more digital infrastructure than most customers, and the private sector wants those lucrative government contracts. For as much talk as there is about the antipathy between states and Big Tech, the companies benefit immensely from government largesse. 

Tech Inquiry revealed in 2022 that U.S. military and intelligence agencies, alone, had awarded US$28-billion to Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet from 2018 to 2022. 

Procurement can come with strings attached. Journalists at The Guardian recently exposed the lengths to which Google and Amazon went to win a US$1.2-billion cloud contract with the Israeli government (“Project Nimbus”). The deal included a “winking” alert system that notified Israeli officials whenever their cloud-stored data was queried, and provisions preventing either company from cutting off Israel's access to their technologies–even if the terms of service were violated.

Procurement is governance by wallet, but not punishment. Governments can embed requirements for complying with government policies in the contracts themselves. Thus, any value, be they transparency, security, oversight, accountability or rights, can become requirements in the contracts tech companies seek. In Canada, government can set standards on procurement through policies at the Treasury Board, or consider each case individually.

Another tool states have is the power of incentives, often called market-based policies (as opposed to punitive command and control policies). Think about how governments created supply and demand for electric vehicles in relatively short order. State-driven investments can support important research to overcome existing problems; it's also a way for governments to channel support as they see fit. 

This is the approach that Canada seems to be following with the Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy and the recently proposed $1-billion over the next five years designated for AI and quantum research in the 2025 budget. 

It has also announced a registry to report federal government uses of AI. The Canadian AI Safety Institute, created under the Trudeau government with a relatively modest $50-million, signals an intention to support research on the political and social effects of AI systems.

There is no escape hatch from the digital world. Even without AI, platforms would still shape how we communicate, shop, work and live. But calling them “governors” allows us to see their power for what it is – and to use more tools to reshape it.

Importantly, calling Big Tech companies governors gives us – the public, governments, other companies – the right to demand accountability and responsibility in line with the outsized power these firms wield. We expect states to hold other actors accountable because they represent the public.

In turn, constituencies hold governments to account. No one or few entities ought to dominate all others. Why wouldn't we demand the same responsibility from other governors that we demand from governments?

Overcoming their dominance requires creativity, a willingness to use incentives and a recognition that platforms, like states, are governors in the digital age.

MOSCOW, January 23. /TASS/. The Russian-US consultations in the Kremlin, which lasted for about four hours, were constructive and frank, Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov said.

In his words, Vladimir Putin's conversation with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and entrepreneur Jared Kushner "continued for about four hours, and was particularly meaningful and constructive."

"I would also describe it as frank and trust-based to the utmost," Ushakov added.

The diplomat added that the talks were also attended by Commissioner of the US General Services Administration's Federal Acquisition Service Josh Gruenbaum.

"He is a senior adviser at the White House, a specialist on the economic dossier. It was the first time that he joined the US team," the Kremlin official said.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly defeated a Democratic resolution that would have limited President Donald Trump's ability to use the military in Venezuela.

The 215–215 vote on the measure, which would have restricted military activity in the region through use of a War Powers Act resolution, was a nail-biter on Capitol Hill.

MOSCOW, January 23. /TASS/. Russia's Tu-22M3 long-range strategic bombers have performed a scheduled flight over the neutral waters of the Baltic Sea, the Russian Defense Ministry said.

"Tu-22M3 long-range bombers of the Russian Aerospace Forces have performed a scheduled flight over neutral waters of the Baltic Sea. They were escorted by Su-35S and Su-30SM aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces," the ministry said in a statement.

The flight continued for more than five hours. At certain stages of the route, the long-range bombers were escorted by fighter jets of foreign countries.

The ministry said that long-range aviation crews regularly fly over the neutral waters of the Arctic, North Atlantic, Pacific oceans as well as Baltic and Black seas. All flights of the Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft are carried out in strict compliance with international rules on the use of airspace over international waters.

President Volodymyr Zelensky is prepared to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 22. 

Trump's remarks followed a meeting between the two leaders earlier that day at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Shortly after the meeting, Zelensky announced that Ukraine would participate in trilateral talks with the U.S. and Russia in the United Arab Emirates starting Jan. 23.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Jan. 22, Trump said Zelensky told him during their conversation that he was ready to make a peace deal. 

"He said he'd like to make a deal. ... He came and he said he wants to make a deal," Trump said. 

The comment marks a shift from Trump's position earlier this month, when he claimed that Zelensky was the one holding up a potential agreement.

Trump also said on Jan. 22 that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to make a deal. As Trump spoke to reporters, his envoys held a meeting with Putin and his aides in Moscow ahead of the trilateral talks.

While Trump was asked to provide details about the content of the agreement, the remaining points of contention, and possible changes that may have made Kyiv or Moscow more amenable to a deal, the U.S. president provided few specifics. He said there were "no changes" and that the discussion topics are "things that have been discussed for six or seven months."

At times, Trump's commentary on the war veered into disjointed abstractions and real estate jargon. 

"It's complex. You have metes and bounds, you have streets, you have rivers, you have everything — you know, where does it end? So it's a little bit complicated. ... There are metes and bounds, it's a location, it's boundaries," he said. 

Trump also acknowledged the "tough" situation Ukrainians face amid a worsening energy crisis — without mentioning that Russia caused the crisis by deliberately attacking Ukraine's power grid despite severe winter cold. 

"It's really tough for the people of Ukraine, I'll tell you that," Trump said. "How they live, without heat, where it's 20 degrees below zero, you know it's very cold. ... I asked (Zelensky), I mean, how do they do that and he gave me an answer. It's pretty amazing what they do to live. It's no way to live."

Trump has been trying to strike a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine for over a year, brokering a series of talks that have yielded few results and done nothing to hamper Russia's intensifying drone and missile campaign against Ukrainian civilians. 

Russia has not signaled any interest in cooperating with the U.S.–Ukraine peace plan finalized in December, although it has acknowledged receiving the provisions. The latest plan is a revised version of a 28-point proposal co-drafted by Russia that heavily favored Moscow.

"The issue of Donbas is key," President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters hours before the talks began.





Orban cited a confidential document on Ukraine's accession allegedly presented at an EU summit in Brussels on the previous day. 

Kyiv, home to more than 3 million people, is still reeling from the Jan. 20 attack in which Russia launched 33 missiles and 339 drones against Ukraine. 

 The Kyiv Independent's Chris York speaks with Adam Entous, an investigative reporter at The New York Times, about his new investigation into the first year of U.S. President Donald Trump administration's peace efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

A fire broke out at an oil depot in the Russian city of Penza following a Ukrainian drone attack overnight on Jan. 23.

"(Russian) army will number 2.5-3 million. They want to reach all of this by 2030, and, based on their speed, we see that this is possible," Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Describing the plan, which was first floated in December, as a "bundle of documents," President Volodymyr Zelensky said he expects progress to be made in the future.

Kyiv's utilities workers have reconnected 650 high-rise apartment buildings in the past day, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Jan. 23. 

"We spoke with President Trump about additional anti-air missiles – the PAC-3s, against ballistics, which are what we need," Volodymyr Zelensky said. "I'm counting on a positive result."

Russia launched 101 drones, including roughly 60 Shahed-type deep-strike unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), into Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said.

"We are interested in resolving the (war) through political and diplomatic means. But until that happens, Russia will continue to pursue its goals on the battlefield," Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said.



The number includes 1,280 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

A California man was arrested and his home was raided after he was accused of stealing millions of taxpayer dollars meant for the homeless.

California officials have arrested Alexander Soofer, who allegedly used tens-of-millions of taxpayer dollars meant to house and feed the homeless to fund his lavish lifestyle, Fox News has learned. Soofer was the executive director of the charity Abundant Blessings, which received government funding for its work.

First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli said in a news conference on Friday that Soofer was charged with wire fraud, a felony that carries a maximum of 20 years in prison.

"I want to tell you a little bit about his organization, Abundant Blessings. It was a South Los Angeles-based charity whose purpose is to help house and properly feed the estimated 72,000 homeless people living in the greater Los Angeles area. His organization received more than $23 million in taxpayer funds for the purpose of housing and feeding the homeless," Essayli said.

"California was pushing this money out quickly. A lot of money went out the door, with, frankly, very little vetting, very little checks and balances. And, he's one of the individuals that got it in this organization," he added.

Essayli alleged that Soofer provided fake invoices to make vendors appear to be legitimate.

Essayli said that rather than providing the needy with "at least three healthy, balanced, nutritious meals a day," which he was allegedly contracted to do, Soofer gave them ramen noodles and a microwave.

Soofer allegedly used the money to put a down payment on his $7 million mansion, pay for his children's private school tuition and to purchase a $125,000 Range Rover, according to Essayli.

Essayli slammed Soofer, saying "he was living the high life while the people suffering, homeless on the streets with no shelter, no food, they're living out on the streets. People are literally dying, and this guy is out vacationing, buying homes, buying Range Rovers and going shopping."

Law enforcement took Soofer into custody in a pre-dawn bust at his multi-million-dollar mansion in Los Angeles. Federal authorities, who claim Soofer used the funds to make improvements on his luxury home, later arrived to tow his Range Rover.

The bust comes after independent journalist Nick Shirley, who worked to expose the fraud scandal in Minnesota, told Congress that the fraud in California could be "worse" than what he found in the North Star State. Shirley made the remark in response to a question posed by Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., about whether his state was showing similar signs of fraud to what was seen in Minnesota.

"Fraud in California might be even worse than the fraud in Minnesota," Shirley said. When asked to elaborate, he noted the missing $24 billion in homeless funds, as well as various other projects and issues that, in his opinion, appear to signal fraud.

Earlier this month, Essayli dubbed Gov. Gavin Newsom the "king of fraud."

"California has spent $24 billion in the last five years on homelessness, and no one can account for where that money has really gone," Essayli told "Fox & Friends" earlier this month.

In April, Essayli launched a task force to investigate corruption in California, with a focus on homeless services. The task force has already resulted in federal charges against two men accused of using real estate projects to exploit the state's homelessness system for personal profit.

Essayli said those cases, which involve millions of dollars in alleged fraud, are only the "tip of the iceberg."

Live Updates


• New wave of protests: Hundreds of Minnesota businesses are expected to close and a rally is planned in Minneapolis as organizers urge people to protest the Trump administration's latest surge in its aggressive, nationwide immigration crackdown.
    


• Preschooler taken by ICE: A 5-year-old is one of the latest children caught up in the mass deportation campaign after he and his father were taken by federal agents outside their Minneapolis-area home. They were pursuing an asylum claim, their lawyer says.
    


• Church protest in focus: Three people who denounced federal immigration agents in a protest at a St. Paul church have been arrested – and more arrests could be coming. Minneapolis' Democratic mayor condemned one of the arrests, while the White House welcomed it.
    


            A top Border Patrol and a top US Immigration and Customs Enforcement official used a Friday news conference in Minneapolis to engage in sweeping attacks against immigrants, the media and protesters.
    


            Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino pledged “wholesale” removals of immigrants accused of crimes, some of whose photos were shown on a screen behind him as he spoke.
    


                    “We're going to take them off the streets wholesale,” he said. “It's on. We won't quit.”
                





            Bovino accused the media of failing to cover stories about undocumented immigrants committing violent crimes. He took as an example the 2023 killing of Rachel Morin, which was covered by both local and national media outlets.
    


            ICE Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Marcos Charles accused “political activists” and the media of trying “to deceive the American public about ICE and our operations.” It's been a common theme for DHS officials, who have railed against “fake news” and pushed back on reporting about immigration enforcement operations.
    


            Charles said ICE is arresting “dangerous criminal, illegal aliens” – a contrast to data showing the agency has detained nearly 75,000 people without criminal records.
    


            Charles characterized the anti-ICE protest that disrupted Sunday services at a Southern Baptist church in St. Paul as a “riot” and said it was “not a peaceful protest.” Dozens of demonstrators rushed into Cities Church during worship, chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good” and saying in part they were protesting one of the church's pastors believed to be a senior ICE official.



            Church leaders and politicians, especially on the right, have decried the protest for interrupting a religious service, and multiple people have been arrested. But there haven't been reports of physical violence committed by demonstrators – just disruption.
    


            The 5-year-old who was taken by federal agents from the driveway of his home in Minneapolis after returning from preschool is now being held with his father at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dilley, Texas, according to school district officials and a family attorney.
    


            Family detention, which expanded under former President Barack Obama, had been paused under the Biden administration before resuming this year. The Dilley facility — intended to be a residential detention center, not a criminal facility — is designed to house families, with a series of beige trailers with dedicated spaces for a library, gym and classroom. Children at Dilley range from infants to teenagers.
    


            But over time, immigrant advocates and attorneys have routinely raised alarm over detaining children. And detainees have described that same facility as a place of prolonged stays and despondent children, with limited access to potable water and agents offering money for families to voluntarily leave the country, court declarations filed in December show.
    


            The documents shine a light inside the facility, where families who had either crossed the US-Mexico border or been picked up by authorities in the United States as part of the administration's sweeping crackdown are currently housed.

            Asked about discrepancies between federal and Minnesota officials' counts of non-US citizens in state custody, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Marcos Charles said Friday that ICE has “better databases.”
    


            He said there are over 1,300 people with ICE detainers in state custody in Minnesota.
    


            But Paul Schnell, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections, disputed this number during a Thursday news conference.
    


            Schnell said Minnesota conducted a point-in-time survey of county jails, finding a total of 301 individuals with ICE detainers — nowhere close to the federal figure.
    


            A top ICE official denies allegations from a Minneapolis school that the 5-year-old son of an asylum seeker was used as bait to capture his father.
    


            “(Adrian Alexander) Conejo Arias was not walking to school with the child, and we did not target the child,” said Marcos Charles, executive assistant director of Enforcement and Removal Operations.
    


            ICE officials say the 5-year-old, Liam Conejo Ramos, seen being loaded into a federal vehicle while wearing a backpack and blue beanie with bunny ears, had been abandoned by his father when he saw agents approaching.
    


            “(Agents) cared for him, took him to get something to eat from a drive-thru restaurant and spent hours ensuring he was taken care of,” Charles said.
    


            Columbia Heights school superintendent Zena Stenvik said earlier this week agents took the child to his home to knock and try to draw other members of the family out.
    


            Charles countered, saying the agents were trying to reunite Ramos with other family members.
    


            “Tragically when we approached the door of his residence, people inside refused to take him in and open the door,” he said.
    


            The father eventually asked to have Liam stay with him, Charles said. They are now at South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, according to family attorney Marc Prokosch.
    


            “We do everything in our power not to separate families,” said Charles.
    


            An Immigration and Customs Enforcement official today sharply criticized anti-ICE protesters who disrupted a Sunday church service in St. Paul, calling the incident “a riot” rather than a peaceful protest.
    


            “They rioted at the church. At church services, they screamed and harassed children,” Marcos Charles, ICE's executive assistant director of enforcement and removal operations, said at a Friday morning news conference. “They denied Minnesotans the ability to worship peacefully.”
    


            Demonstrators on Sunday rushed into Cities Church during worship, saying in part they were protesting one of the church's pastors, who they claimed was a senior ICE official. Once inside, they questioned another pastor about his role, according to a protester who spoke with CNN.



            Charles called the targeting of the church “disturbing” and accused the protesters of “viciously harass(ing) innocent families.”
    


            Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino said at a Friday morning news conference that “we are experts in dealing with children,” in the wake of controversy after a 5-year-old boy and his father were taken by ICE in Minneapolis.
    


            Border Patrol officials are “experts in dealing with children, not because we want to be, but because we have to be,” he said.
    


            He claimed that hundreds of thousands of children are trafficked across the border.
    


            Organizers of a march protesting the surge of ICE agents to Minnesota will face a particularly challenging opponent this afternoon: the weather.
    


            “We will walk in below-zero degrees in one of the coldest days in Minnesota,” Emilia González Avalos with UNIDOS Minnesota, one of the groups behind the event, told CNN's Sara Sidner.
    


            The wind chill in Minneapolis is not expected to rise above -20 today. The march that was originally scheduled to begin and end at the city's Commons Park will instead conclude with an indoor rally at Target Center.
    


            “We're asking people to march,” said González. “We're asking people boycott today. We're asking people to get trained as legal observers.”
    


            The event is part of a broader Friday strike activists have called for, encouraging people to stay home from school and work and for businesses to close.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security is calling for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey to turn over a convicted sex offender they said federal agents were searching for when they dragged a US citizen from his St. Paul home on Sunday.
    


            “This is exactly what we have been saying: We need state and local law enforcement engagement and information so we don't have to have such a presence on the streets,” reads a post on X from the agency.
    


            Paul Schnell, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections, told CNN yesterday he had notified DHS that the offender was in state custody.
    


Some context: ICE agents bashed open ChongLy “Scott” Thao's door before detaining him and leading him outside in his underwear in frigid conditions, according to the Associated Press. The episode, captured on video, provoked anger and criticism of the ICE agents' tactics.
    


            DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Thao of living with two convicted sex offenders, the targets of the operation, and said both were still at large.
    


            But Schnell said that one of those sex offenders is already in prison.
    


            “He is, in fact, in prison and subject to a detainer,” Schnell told CNN yesterday. “They should know, because we did notify them that they were in our custody.”
    


            The Trump administration has ordered a review of federal funding sent to more than a dozen Democratic-led states, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The sweeping scale of the review is outlined in a budget data request that was sent Tuesday to all federal departments and agencies except for the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    


            The Office of Management and Budget memo, which was reviewed by CNN, requests detailed spending information to “facilitate efforts to reduce the improper and fraudulent use of those funds.” Notably, the effort “does not involve withholding funds,” the memo says and is part of a “data-gathering exercise.”
    


            The request signals a dramatic escalation of the Trump administration's increasingly aggressive strategy to target federal funding in blue states — an unprecedented policy approach triggered during last year's government shutdown that has rapidly accelerated in the wake of sweeping fraud allegations in Minnesota.

            Federal officers in tactical gear line up at the driveway of a large block-shaped building wedged between the city limits of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Across from them, a crowd of protesters yell at the officers and sometimes try to block cars driving in and out.
    


            The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building has served as the backdrop for the ongoing tense dance in the Twin Cities since federal agents shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good earlier this month. Its stark brick structure is home base for the immigration proceedings at the heart of the crackdown in the state, prompting fear, anger and confusion.



            The man behind the name — Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple — would be standing outside with protesters if he were still alive, one historian and scholar said.
    


            Whipple, Minnesota's first Protestant Episcopal bishop, was known for advocating for the welfare of Native Americans throughout the mid-to-late 1800s, according to historians. While his legacy reflects his advocacy, it falls short of altruism and the building bearing his name perches on sacred land also known for its traumatic and violent history toward Indigenous peoples.
    


            Now, the Whipple building is where many people are temporarily detained after being swept up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — now facing a subpoena from the Trump administration in an investigation of possible obstruction of justice — says the dramatic increase in federal immigration agents is not making his city safer.
    


                    “This is not about safety. It's not even about immigration,” Frey told CNN's Sara Sidner. “What we are seeing right now is that this is political retribution. It's about causing chaos on our streets.”
                





            President Donald Trump has called Frey “a fool” for his support of the city's Somali community and posted on Truth Social earlier this month, “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”
    


            “You don't need to take my word for it,” Frey said. “You can listen to exactly what Donald Trump is saying.”
    


            The United Nations Human Rights Chief is calling on the Trump administration to ensure immigration and enforcement practices “respect the human dignity and due process rights” and to end practices that he says are tearing apart families.
    


            “Individuals are being surveilled and detained, sometimes violently, … often solely on mere suspicion of being undocumented migrants,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said in a news release as he questioned the administration's concern for dignity and humanity.
    


            The Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies “are resulting in arbitrary and unlawful arrests and detentions, as well as flawed removal decisions,” Türk said highlighting “that many arrests, detentions, and expulsions occur without effort to assess and maintain family unity.”
    


            The high commissioner also said he is worried these policies are often enforced without carefully assessing each person's situation. He expressed concern “about the harmful and dehumanising narratives frequently used to describe migrants and refugees.”
    


            He called for “an independent and transparent investigation” into what he said is a concerning rise in the number of detainee deaths while in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.
    


            A Cumberland County, Maine correctional officer recruit was detained by federal agents in Portland's Bayside neighborhood, according to the sheriff. CNN has reached out to DHS for comment but has not yet received a response.

            A Chicago-area man accused of offering a $10,000 bounty for the life of Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino over Snapchat was found not guilty Thursday,  the Associated Press reported.
    


            Juan Espinoza Martinez, 37, faced up to 10 years in prison on a murder-for-hire charge.
    


            Prosecutors cited Snapchat messages from Espinoza Martinez to his brother and a friend who turned out to be a government informant, including one that read, “10k if u take him down,” with a photo of Bovino.
    


            Defense attorneys told jurors the government didn't present any evidence against Espinoza Martinez, who they said didn't follow up on the messages and had only a few dollars in his bank account. Espinoza Martinez did not testify.
    


            His defense attorney Dena Singer did not respond to the AP on its request for comment on the verdict. Neither did the US attorney's office in Chicago nor the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            Born in Mexico, Espinoza Martinez has lived in the US for more than 30 years. He does not have legal permission to stay in the United States.
    


            Hundreds of Minnesota businesses are expected to close on Friday as part of a protest against immigration enforcement in the state.
    


            The strike, organized by local faith leaders and unions, urges Minnesotans to avoid shopping and stay home from work or school, according to CNN affiliate KARE. There is also a rally planned in downtown Minneapolis uniting under the slogan “ICE out of Minnesota.”
    


            The statewide strike comes a day after Vice President JD Vance, who visited Minneapolis, blamed a lack of cooperation from local authorities for some of the problems in the city, and suggested that is why ICE needs such a robust presence in Minneapolis.
    


Here's a look at the latest:  



            The attorney for 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, who were taken by federal agents this week, said the two were “not eluding ICE in any way.” He also pushed back on Vice President JD Vance's comment that agents were arresting an “illegal alien.”

            A new memo obtained by the Associated Press says ICE agents can enter people's homes without a warrant signed by a judge, allowing agents to exercise sweeping new powers. It's a move, CNN's Josh Campbell reports, that can potentially ramp up already tense interactions between the public and immigration officers.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent took aim at Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his political stunt at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, brushing the left-wing governor off as operating with a "brain the size of a walnut."

"I think Gavin Newsom may be cracking up, some of these things he's saying. I think he may be in over his hairdo," Bessent told Politico's "The Conversation."

Newsom traveled to Davos, Switzerland, recently to attend the World Economic Forum, where President Donald Trump's presence headlined the event as the administration pressures European leaders to strike a deal for the U.S. to acquire Greenland. 

The Democratic governor is a longtime political opponent of Trump's, and issued a warning to foreign leaders to grow a "backbone" with Trump in a political broadside against the White House from the forum Monday. His attack included saying he should have brought "kneepads" for foreign dignitaries interacting with Trump while also comparing Trump to a T.rex.

"This is diplomacy with Donald Trump. He's a T.rex. You mate with him, or he devours you, one or the other," Newsom said Tuesday. "The Europeans could be (devoured) if they continue down this path and process. They need to stand tall, stand firm, stand united." 

Bessent shot back Thursday that the comparison was nonsensical while saying the governor has a "brain the size of a walnut."

"Being on the national stage is very different than being governor of California with no signature achievements, but to say strange things, like President Trump is a Tyrannosaurus rex. What the hell does that mean?" the Treasury secretary said. "I could say, Gavin Newsom is a brontosaurus with a brain the size of a walnut."

Newsom did in fact bring kneepads to the forum as part of a political stunt, calling them "Trump signature series kneepads" during a speech in Davos, Switzerland.  

Amid his meetings in Davos, Newsom was photographed with left-wing billionaire Alex Soros, the son of billionaire philanthropist George Soros.

Bessent quipped: "If you brought the kneepads, maybe that was for his meeting with Alex Soros. I don't know."

The Treasury secretary added that Newsom knows "less about economics than" former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he described as "a terrible place to be in."

Bessent's remarks to Politico are his latest this week against Newsom, comparing him to a mix of "American Psycho" main character Patrick Bateman "meets Sparkle Beach Ken" doll Tuesday.

"We're deeply in their head," Newsom said in response to Bessent's comparison on Thursday from Switzerland.  "I think the affordability agenda appears to be I'm living rent-free in the Trump administration's head."

Trump was asked about Newsom's presence in Davos Tuesday during a press briefing, remarking that the pair had a warm relationship before it fell to political tatters.

"I had a very good relationship with Gavin Newsom when we were, you know, in office together," Trump told the media, referring to his first term in the Oval Office. "I was president. He was the governor of California. We had a really … he would talk about it often. And, somewhere, we just went astray. I just, I just hate the way California is being run.

"We actually have people leaving. It's never happened before, but I hate the way it's being run. He and I had a very good relationship. Really, close to the word exceptional, but now we seem not to."

IRVING, Texas (AP) — The College Football Playoff will remain at 12 teams after the commissioners of the Southeastern Conference and Big Ten couldn't come up with a compromise for expansion.

The CFP Management Committee announced Friday the 12-team format would stay the same for the 2026-27 season. The decision provides additional time for evaluation and discussion on the current format and potential changes in the future.

The CFP went from four teams to 12 teams for the 2024 season, and the two most powerful conferences favored further expansion but could not agree on a number.

The SEC pushed for 16 teams, with an emphasis on at-large bids — a format favored by the Power Four leagues other than the Big Ten and most of the smaller conferences that are hoping for access into whatever comes next.

The Big Ten has pushed for a bracket of up to 24 teams with multiple automatic qualifiers from each conference. It could do away with the need for conference title games and replace them with seeding games to determine, say, two or three of the automatic spots.

“After ongoing discussion about the 12-team playoff format, the decision was made to continue with the current structure,” CFP executive director Rich Clark said. “This will give the Management Committee additional time to review the 12-team format, so they can better assess the need for potential change. While they all agree the current format has brought more excitement to college football and has given more schools a real shot in the postseason, another year of evaluation will be helpful.”

The 2026-27 season's format will feature 12 teams based on conference champions and final ranking by the CFP selection committee. First-round games will be played on campus sites, followed by quarterfinals and semifinals hosted by the CFP bowls, and the national championship game, which will take place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 25, 2027.

The two leaders clasped hands for about 26 seconds.

President Donald Trump has turned up the heat on European leaders as he looks to ink a deal for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, including a specific focus on French President Emmanuel Macron in recent weeks. 

Trump was in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum Wednesday and Thursday, delivering a speech and holding bilateral meetings with foreign leaders at the annual conference that attracts foreign dignitaries, business leaders and celebrities to discuss the world's economy. 

The president's visit to Switzerland came as he threatened to impose tariffs on eight European nations if no deal on the U.S. acquiring Greenland was achieved by Feb. 1. Initial tariffs would have begun at 10% on goods from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was set to increase to 25% by June 1 if there is no deal by that point. 

Trump has put many of Europe's top leaders on notice as he looks to secure the deal, but he has taken an outsized focus on Macron.

The French president has meanwhile vowed from Davos that France will stand up to "bullies" and added that U.S. threats to impose tariffs in a bid to acquire Greenland was "fundamentally unacceptable."

Trump announced Wednesday that he would not impose tariffs that were set to take effect, citing a "framework of a future deal" with NATO involving Greenland and the Arctic region.

"Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

The French president was pulled into more U.S. headlines in early January, after the U.S. military successfully captured Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and his wife, which opened the floodgates to heightened discussions of the U.S. making moves to acquire Greenland from Denmark. 

Days after Maduro's capture and as talks of Greenland mounted, Trump joined House Republican lawmakers Jan. 6, when he imitated Macron's accent while recounting how Trump pressured Macron to raise drug prices in France in 2025 as the U.S. looked to bring parity to its sky-high prescription costs compared to other nations.

"He's a nice guy," Trump said before launching into an accent and recounting their conversation in a viral moment. 

Trump again put on a French accent to recount the same conversation he held with Macron Jan. 16 during a rural healthcare roundtable at the White House. 

"I said, ‘Emmanuel,'" Trump recounted. 

"'Yes, Donald, Donald. Thank you so much for calling,'" he continued, using an accent to indicate Macron was speaking.

"I said, 'You're not going to like this call,'" Trump continued. 

TRUMP'S ‘SMALL ASK' FOR GREENLAND WOULD BE THE REAL ESTATE DEAL OF A LIFETIME

Trump recounted the story to show his long history as the deal-maker-in-chief and pressure Macron to raise France's ultra-low government-set prices that Trump said let pharmaceutical companies shift costs onto Americans. 

France was listed among eight countries facing additional tariffs if no Greenland deal is made. Trump singled out France early Tuesday morning when he shared a text message Macron sent Trump, which included the French leader saying, "I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland."

"My friend, We are totally in line on Syria(.) We can do great things on Iran(.)" Macron wrote, according to the screenshot. "I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland(.) Let us try to build great things: 1) i (sic) can set up a g7 meeting after Davos in Paris on thursday afternoon. I can invite the ukrainians, the danish, the syrians and the russians in the margins 2) let us have a dinner together in Paris together on thursday before you go back to the us."

The president also shared a text from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on social media, who told Trump that he was "committed to finding a way forward on Greenland."

"It just made my point," Trump said in an interview with The New York Post of why he shared the messages. "They're saying, ‘Oh gee, let's have dinner, let's do this, let's do that.' It just made my point."

Simultaneous to talks on potentially acquiring Greenland, Trump extended invitations to a swath of foreign leaders to join the Gaza Board of Peace, which is styled as a new oversight body tied to the next phase of the Gaza peace plan that the Trump administration ironed out in 2025.

Macron turned the invitation down, with his office saying the Board of Peace proposal "goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question," according to Politico.  

TRUMP CHALLENGES CARNEY AT DAVOS, ASSERTS CANADA SHOULD BE 'GRATEFUL' FOR GOLDEN DOME MISSILE DEFENSE

Trump, again, targeted Macron with fiery comments when asked about the declined invitation. 

"Oh, did he say that? Well nobody wants him, because he's gonna be out of office very soon. That's alright. What I'll do is if they feel like hostile, I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes and he'll join. But he doesn't have to join. If he said that, you're probably giving it to me a little bit differently, but if he actually did say that — but as you know, he's gonna be out of office in a few months," Trump said.

Macron's term ends in 2027, and he is unable to run for a third consecutive term under French law. 

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on the president's rhetoric focused on Macron and France's role in a potential Greenland deal but did not immediately receive a reply. 

Trump underscored from his speech in Davos Wednesday that "no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States." Trump is looking to acquire the island from Denmark for national security purposes, citing its strategic location among the United States, Russia and China.

"All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland," Trump said Wednesday from his speech at the World Economic Forum. "Where we've already had it as a trustee, but respectfully returned it back to Denmark not long ago after we defeated the Germans, the Japanese, the Italians and others in World War II, we gave it back to them."

Trump also took a shot at Macron during his address to the body, remarking on the French president wearing sunglasses during public events before again recounting his prior discussion with him regarding drug prices. 

TRUMP TELLS DAVOS US ALONE CAN SECURE GREENLAND, INSISTS HE WON'T 'USE FORCE'

"I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses," Trump said to the crowd. "What the hell happened?" 

Macron spoke before the World Economic Forum Tuesday while wearing aviator sunglasses, sparking mockery and memes online. Macron's office said he had worn them due to a burst blood vessel and need to protect his eyes. 

"Competition from the United States of America through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions, and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe," Macron said from Davos in a hit on Trump. "Combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable – even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty."

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy urged Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores Friday to protest immigration enforcement operations, even as subzero temperatures beset the state.

Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the Twin Cities for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.

Organizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses across the state have closed for the day in solidarity with the protest -- from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.

“We're achieving something historic,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 groups that is mobilizing. The demonstration coincides with a blast of cold air hitting the Upper Midwest and ahead of a severe winter storm that is expected to affect millions. 

On Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative from that of a 5-year-old boy detained by ICE officers in Minneapolis by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.

Organizers hope Friday's mobilization will be the largest coordinated protest action to date, with a march in downtown Minneapolis planned for Friday afternoon. Earlier Friday, the temperature in Minneapolis was minus 21 with a wind chill of minus 40 (minus 29 Celsius with a wind chill of minus 40 Celsius). 




Havelin compared the presence of immigration officers in Minnesota to the winter weather warnings.

“Minnesotans understand that when we're in a snow emergency … we all have to respond and it makes us do things differently,” she said. “And what's happening with ICE in our community, in our state, means that we can't respond as business as usual.”

Somali businesses especially have lost sales during the enforcement surge as workers and customers, fearing detention, stay at home. 

Many schools were planning to close Friday, but cited different reasons. The University of Minnesota and the St. Paul public school district said there would be no in-person classes because of the extreme cold. Minneapolis Public Schools were scheduled to be closed “for a teacher record keeping day.”

Clergy planned to join the march as well as hold prayer services and fasting, according to a delegation of representatives of faith traditions including Buddhist, Jewish, Lutheran and Muslim.

Bishop Dwayne Royster, leader of the progressive organization Faith in Action, arrived in Minnesota on Wednesday from Washington, D.C.

“We want ICE out of Minnesota,” he said. “We want them out of all the cities around the country where they're exercising extreme overreach.”

Royster said at least 50 of his network's faith-based organizers were joining the protest. About 10 were traveling from Los Angeles while others from the same group planned a solidarity rally in California, said one of the organizers there.

“It was a very harrowing experience,” said the Rev. Jennifer Gutierrez of the large immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles last year. “We believe God is on the side of migrants.”

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Outraged critics accused President Donald Trump of “whitewashing history” on Friday after the National Park Service removed an exhibit on slavery at Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park in response to his executive order “restoring truth and sanity to American history” on display at the nation's museums, parks and landmarks. 

Empty bolt holes and shadows are all that remains on the brick walls where explanatory panels were displayed at the President's House Site, where George and Martha Washington lived with the people they owned as property during the years when Philadelphia was the nation's capital. One woman cried silently at their absence. Someone left a bouquet of flowers. A hand-lettered sign said “Slavery was real.”

Crews on Thursday removed the exhibit which included the names and other biographical details about the nine people enslaved by the Washingtons at the presidential mansion. Their names remain engraved on a cement wall at the entrance.

Seeking to stop the display's permanent removal, the city of Philadelphia on Thursday sued Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and acting National Park Service Director Jessica Bowron.

The panels came down because Trump's order requires federal agencies to review interpretive materials to “ensure accuracy, honesty, and alignment with shared national values,” an Interior Department statement said. It called the city's lawsuit frivolous, aimed at “demeaning our brave Founding Fathers who set the brilliant road map for the greatest country in the world.”




The department did not answer questions about what will replace the exhibits that were removed. 

The City of Philadelphia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The people enslaved at the mansion included Oney Judge, who famously ran away and remained free despite Washington's attempts to return her to bondage. Slavery is central to the site's story, Philadelphia's lawsuit argues, adding that the terms of the city's management partnership with the federal government gives the city equal say over any design changes. 

Critics condemned the removals as confirmation that the Trump administration seeks to erase unflattering aspects of American history.

“Their shameful desecration of this exhibit raises broader, disturbing questions about this administration's continued abuse of power and commitment to whitewashing history,” said Rep. Dwight Evans, a Pennsylvania Democrat.

Taking pride in American independence shouldn't mean hiding its mistakes, said Ed Stierli, senior mid-Atlantic regional director for the National Parks Conservation Association, which works to protect national parks. These historic sites should help Americans grapple with the difficult truths and contradictions in how we frame history, he said, and removing the exhibit is an insult to the memory of the enslaved people who lived there.

“It reverses years of collaborative work by the National Park Service, City of Philadelphia, and community members, and sets a dangerous precedent of prioritizing nostalgia over the truth,” Stieri said.

“It shows that the United States is still unwilling to reckon with the horrors of its past and would rather prefer to sanitize the history that it has and try to present a convenient lie,” said Timothy Welbeck, director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University.

The order, which Trump signed last March, accused the Biden administration of advancing a “corrosive ideology” at the nation's historic sites. 

“At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — where our Nation declared that all men are created equal — the prior administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates dismantling ‘Western foundations' and ‘interrogating institutional racism' and pressured National Historical Park rangers that their racial identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting Americans because America is purportedly racist,” the order states.

Marques Armstrong, the husband of Nekima Levy Armstrong, speaks out following her arrest on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. 

The husband of a woman whom Attorney General Pam Bondi said "played a key role" in the storming of a church in Minnesota this week by an anti-U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) mob is now speaking out, slamming the "Beavis and Butt-Head" prosecution. 

Marques Armstrong made a reference to the cult MTV sitcom as he spoke Thursday following the arrest of his wife Nekima Levy Armstrong. Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly were also taken into custody. 

"Continue to pray for us. Understand that this is not our first rodeo. Threats on our lives have been coming since we have been doing this work," Armstrong said.  

"I won't go into too much detail about the Beavis and Butt-Head show for the prosecution," he continued.

"We are making a statement, we are making a stand not just for the individuals here, not just our state, but for this entire nation. I want to encourage us to continue to stand up and peacefully protest. We cannot afford to take the bait," Armstrong added. "I repeat, we cannot afford to take the bait and be provoked into violence. That will give the people over in the administration the green light to unleash more hell upon our state." 

FBI Director Kash Patel said Armstrong's arrest was in connection with an alleged violation of the FACE Act, which prohibits interfering with the exercise of religion at a place of worship. Kelly allegedly stormed the Cities Church service in St. Paul and berated congregants, according to video posted online, while Allen is a member of the St. Paul School Board who also helped organize the protest. 

"Minutes ago at my direction, HSI and FBI agents executed an arrest in Minnesota," Bondi wrote on X on Thursday, adding, "We have arrested Nekima Levy Armstrong, who allegedly played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota."

"Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP," Bondi also said. 

Marques Armstrong said on Thursday that, "My wife wasn't taken." 

"She gave herself up, tall, no crime. Y'all know who she is. She is fierce, she is strong, and she is powerful. That is how she stood. We have the videos to prove that, to dispel the lies and the twisting of the truth that this administration constantly does on a consistent basis. And for those of you who are following this group of liars, criminals, thieves, shame on you," he said.

"The actions of Chauntyll Allen, my wife, Nekima Levy Armstrong, and all of the protesters were not criminal, violent, or destructive," Armstrong also said. "They did not harm any person or animal, damage property, or incite chaos. Their conduct remained nonviolent, verbal, restrained, which matters both morally and legally. What motivated their action was not lawlessness but consciousness."

With many Americans still recovering from repeated snowstorms and bitter cold in the North, a new weekend storm could glaze roads, trees and power lines with damaging ice across much of the South.

KENNESAW, Ga. (AP) — Millions of Americans from New Mexico to the Carolinas are bracing for a potentially catastrophic ice storm that could crush trees and power lines and knock out power for days, while Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Boston could see enough snow to make travel very difficult or nearly impossible, forecasters say.

More than 170 million people — about half the population of the United States — were in the path of heavy snow and crippling ice, the National Weather Service said Friday. Alerts from the weather service stretched from Arizona and Montana in the West to the Carolinas and Maine in the east.

The storm, which began early Friday and continues through the weekend, is also projected to bring heavy snow and all types of wintry precipitation, including freezing rain and sleet. An atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas before heading northeast, forecasters said.




“Snow amounts could reach a foot or more in the I-95 major cities from D.C. to Boston,” said weather service forecasters on the East Coast, who are increasingly confident the storm will strike the big cities.

More than 1,500 flights scheduled to fly through U.S. airports Saturday were canceled by the time the storm began early Friday, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Airports in Dallas, Atlanta, Oklahoma and Tennessee were among the most affected.

Here's a look at the storm and how people are preparing for it, by the numbers:

The number of snowplows owned by the city of Jackson, Mississippi, where a mix of ice and sleet is possible this weekend. The city uses other heavy machinery like skid steers and small excavators to clear roads, said James Caldwell, deputy director of public works. Jackson also has three trucks that carry salt and sand to spread across roads before freezing weather.




The amount of ice — half an inch, or 1.27 centimeters — that can lead to a crippling ice storm, toppling trees and power lines to create widespread and long-lasting power outages. The latest forecasts from the weather service warn of the potential for a half-inch of ice or more for many areas, including parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee.

The number of Nashville snowplows named after country music legend and Tennessee native Dolly Parton (Dolly Plowton). Another snowplow in East Tennessee was named Snowlene after her classic hit song “Jolene” as part of a 2022 naming contest.

The number of layers needed to keep warm in extreme cold. AP video journalist Mark Vancleave in Minnesota explains the benefits of all three — a base layer, a middle layer and an outer shell — in this video.

The number of beet juice-dispensing trucks in the city of Chicago, according to Cole Stallard, Chicago's commissioner of Streets and Sanitation. The natural sugars of beet juice lower the freezing point of water, allowing salt mixtures to work at much lower temperatures and preventing refreezing, while also helping salt stick to the road longer.

The number of snow and ice removal trucks operated by Memphis, Tennessee's Division of Public Works. The city also has six trucks that spread brine, a mixture designed to melt wintry precipitation. Statewide, the Tennessee Department of Transportation has 851 salt trucks and 634 brine trucks, and most of the salt trucks double as plows.

The degree in Fahrenheit when water freezes, equivalent to 0 Celsius. This is a magic number when it comes to winter weather, said Eric Guillot, a scientist at the weather service. If the temperature is slightly above 32, it will be mostly liquid. But the colder it is below the mark, the more efficiently precipitation will freeze.

The number of snowplow trucks at the ready in Nashville, Tennessee, according to the Nashville Department of Transportation and Multimodal Infrastructure.

The windchill value — how cold it feels to a person when winds are factored in — that is expected in parts of the Northern Plains, the weather service projects. That equates to minus 45.6 Celsius and is forecast for parts of northern Minnesota and North Dakota.

“When the weather forecast says, ‘feels like negative 34,' it's just a matter of covering skin and being prepared for it,” said Nils Anderson, who owns Duluth Gear Exchange, an outdoor equipment store in Duluth, Minnesota.

The number of miles added last year to snowplow routes in Nashville, Tennessee. That was done “to get deeper into our neighborhoods — roads that had never been plowed before,” said Alex Apple, a spokesperson for Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell.

Texas has this number of pieces of winter weather equipment, including snowplows, motor graders and brine tankers, Texas Department of Transportation spokesperson Adam Hammons said. He said the agency also works with state partners and contractors to get more equipment when needed. In the Dallas area, “right now our main focus is treating our roadways in advance of the storm,” agency spokesperson Tony Hartzel said Wednesday.

The number of cubic yards of salt on hand at the Arkansas Department of Transportation. The state has 121 salt houses around the Arkansas, plus 600 salt spreaders and 700 snowplows, said Dave Parker, an agency spokesperson.

Former Canadian Olympic snowboarder and FBI Ten Most Wanted fugitive Ryan Wedding has been captured in Mexico with the help of local authorities, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed Friday.

Bondi announced Wedding's capture in a post on X, adding the Canadian national was flown into the United States, where he will "face justice." Patel accompanied Wedding on the flight to the U.S., sources said.

"At my direction, Department of Justice agents @FBI have apprehended yet another member of the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted List: Ryan Wedding, the onetime Olympian snowboarder-turned alleged violent cocaine kingpin," Bondi said.

"This is a direct result of President Trump's law-and-order leadership. Under @POTUS, criminals have no safe harbor. Director Patel has worked tirelessly to bring fugitives to justice. We are grateful to our incredible Ambassador Ron Johnson and the Mexican authorities for assisting us in this case." 

Patel highlighted in a separate post on X that Wedding was the first fugitive added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list during his tenure and, "Now, less than a year later, he is in custody." 

"Wedding is believed to have been hiding in Mexico for over a decade - and has been wanted on charges for cocaine trafficking and murder since 2024," he said in part. 

"This is the SIXTH Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitive this FBI has captured within a year — fugitives who had been on the run for almost 40 years combined. That's no accident. President Trump is letting good cops be cops and the results speak for themselves."

MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SEIZE $40M IN MOTORCYCLES FROM OLYMPIC SNOWBOARDER TURNED FUGITIVE, FBI SAYS

Wedding, 44, was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted list in March 2025 and is accused of running a transnational drug trafficking network that "routinely shipped hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia, through Mexico and Southern California, to Canada and other locations in the United States," according to the FBI. 

He is also accused of orchestrating multiple murders and attempted murder as a part of his drug trafficking operation. 

Wedding and 14 other alleged associates were specifically accused of orchestrating the January 2025 murder of a witness who was shot and killed at a restaurant in Colombia. He allegedly placed a bounty on the victim's head, thinking the victim's death would lead to the dismissal of charges against him and the drug-trafficking ring he allegedly heads, according to an indictment unsealed in November.

Just last month, FBI officials confirmed that Mexican authorities seized $40 million in motorcycles believed to be owned by Wedding. That news came more than a month after Wedding was hit with additional charges and raised the reward for his capture to $15 million.  

He participated in the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City after missing out on the 1998 Games. It was the only Olympics he competed in.

Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on House Republicans' plan to assist first-time home buyers on 'Special Report.'

Every few years, Washington comes up with a "creative" solution to an affordability problem that sounds helpful on the surface and quietly creates a much bigger problem underneath. 

The latest example? A proposal tied to President Donald Trump's housing affordability agenda that would allow Americans to tap their 401(k) retirement savings to fund a down payment on a home. 

I understand the intent. Housing affordability is stretched. Home prices are near all-time highs. Mortgage rates are still hovering around 6%. First-time buyers feel locked out. COVID-19 buyers can't afford to trade up. Politically, this all sounds like a win. 

Financially, it's a terrible idea, in my view. This is the classic case of robbing Peter to pay Paul and, in this case, Peter is your future self.

GEN Z IS STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE — AND REPUBLICANS CAN'T AFFORD TO LOOK AWAY

Trump's solution to the American dream is a nightmare for those who cash in part of their retirement to buy houses. (iStock)

Your 401(k) was designed for one purpose. To fund decades of income when you can no longer work. It was never meant to double as a short-term housing fund or a policy pressure valve when affordability gets tight. 

When you pull money out early of your 401(k), even if it's labeled a "loan" or "special access," three brutally damaging things happen:

PRO-TRUMP GROUP UNLEASHES BLUEPRINT FOR CRUCIAL HOUSING INITIATIVE FEATURING TOP MAGA INFLUENCER

That last point matters more than politicians would like to admit. 

AMERICANS HAVE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO MORE LUXURIES, BUT WHY DO WE FEEL SO POOR?

According to multiple retirement studies, a large percentage of 401(k) loans are never repaid because of job changes, layoffs or life disruptions. What do we think will happen when someone takes a 401(k) distribution for a down payment on a home? The odds are it will never ever get paid back for retirement. 

Let's put real numbers behind this. 

If a 35-year-old pulls $50,000 from their 401(k) to buy a home and never replaces it, that single decision could cost them $300,000 to $400,000 by retirement, assuming long-term market averages. That's just math.

And here's the irony about this. The people most likely to use this proposal are the ones who already struggle to save consistently. They don't have excess cash flow. They don't max out retirement plans. So, once the money is gone, it's gone.

TRUMP'S 50-YEAR MORTGAGE JUST INTRODUCES A NEW KIND OF DEBT

Supporters of this idea argue that "homeownership builds wealth." That's partially true, but it's also incomplete in the financial planning equation. 

A home is:

BIPARTISAN PLAN AIMS TO MAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR MILLIONS OF FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS

Retirement accounts, on the other hand, are: 

CONSTRUCTION LABOR CRUNCH DRIVES UP COSTS AND DEEPENS AMERICA'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS

Using retirement money to buy a home concentrates risk instead of spreading it. You're tying your future financial security to one asset in one location at one moment in time.

WHITE HOUSE TEASES MAJOR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PLAN AS PRICES SQUEEZE AMERICANS

One way to defeat the affordability crunch is the most traditional way — marriage. (iStock)

The truth is uncomfortable right now, but necessary to review. 

Housing isn't unaffordable because Americans aren't creative enough with their retirement money. It's unaffordable because:

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: GOP TARGETS AFFORDABILITY WITH RECONCILIATION 2.0 PLAN AHEAD OF MIDTERMS

SCAMMERS TARGET RETIREES AS MAJOR 401(K) RULE CHANGES LOOM FOR 2026 TAX YEAR AHEAD NATIONWIDE

Letting people tap 401(k)s doesn't fix any of that. It simply injects more demand into a broken system, which can push prices higher and reward sellers not buyers.

6 KICK-BUTT FINANCIAL RESOLUTIONS YOU SHOULD MAKE TODAY TO PROTECT TOMORROW

In other words, this proposal could make homes even more expensive while quietly hollowing out retirement security, putting even more pressure on Social Security. 

Policies that trade long-term stability for short-term relief almost always backfire.

Using retirement money to buy a home concentrates risk instead of spreading it. You're tying your future financial security to one asset in one location at one moment in time.

We've already watched Americans underfund retirement for decades. Encouraging them to drain the one bucket that actually works for them, which is a tax-advantaged long-term, automated saving program, is going to move people backward. 

Homeownership matters.

Retirement security matters more. 

And no matter how you dress it up, it's never a good idea to rob Peter to pay Paul, especially when Peter is the older version of you who won't get a second chance to fix it.

Former ATF special agent Bernard Zapor evaluates the Trump administration's crusade against criminal gangs on ‘Fox Report.'

A Venezuelan national accused of threatening Arizona residents at gunpoint while claiming control over part of a Maricopa County community is facing multiple felony charges, including terrorism, authorities said.

Arizona Department of Public Safety investigators allege Javier Enrique Erazo-Zuniga, 27, claimed control over part of Maricopa and threatened residents with deadly weapons in an effort to extort money, according to reporting by InMaricopa and statements from state authorities.

DPS spokesperson Bart Graves told InMaricopa detectives began investigating Erazo-Zuniga in December after receiving information that he was "claiming Hidden Valley in Maricopa as his territory and demanding money from victims."

Investigators allege Erazo-Zuniga was tied to a series of violent incidents involving residents who were targeted at their homes. In one 2024 incident, authorities say he put a victim in a headlock and held a knife to the person's neck, leaving a cut. Last month, investigators allege he waited at the end of another victim's driveway and held the victim at gunpoint.

SUSPECTED VENEZUELAN GANGSTER IN PORTLAND CBP ATTACK TIED TO SHOOTING AT APARTMENT COMPLEX: POLICE

During a search of Erazo-Zuniga's bedroom, detectives recovered a firearm believed to have been used in the December gunpoint incident, Graves said.

Erazo-Zuniga was booked into the Pinal County Jail, where jail records show he remains in custody on a $250,000 secured bond. He was later indicted by a Pinal County grand jury.

Court records obtained by the outlet show the grand jury charged Erazo-Zuniga with aggravated assault involving a firearm, two counts of forgery and two counts of misconduct involving weapons, including possession of handguns while prohibited. Prosecutors allege the aggravated assault charge qualifies as a dangerous felony because it involved the use or threatened exhibition of a firearm.

DPS has also stated that Erazo-Zuniga is charged with assisting a criminal street gang and terrorism, though those allegations were outlined by the agency rather than detailed in the indictment documents released by the Pinal County Superior Court. Authorities have said additional charges could be forthcoming, potentially at the federal level.

According to a minute entry filed in superior court, Erazo-Zuniga is scheduled to be arraigned Friday.

Graves said investigators believe there may be multiple additional victims, but that some have been afraid to come forward.

"We encourage them to contact our tip line," Graves said. DPS asked anyone with information related to the case to call 602-644-5805.

Authorities have not confirmed whether the investigation could expand beyond Maricopa.

The case comes amid heightened national law enforcement scrutiny of Venezuelan criminal groups following a series of high-profile investigations in Colorado in 2024 and 2025.

Federal prosecutors there indicted Venezuelan nationals accused of participating in organized robberies, kidnappings, extortion schemes and firearms offenses tied to the transnational gang Tren de Aragua. While some early claims of gang "takeovers" were later disputed or clarified, authorities have confirmed multiple violent cases involving coordinated criminal activity and armed suspects.

Joel Klatt and Colin Cowherd discuss the importance of Indiana winning the National Championship, and whether or not Miami can rebound following their loss. 

The result of the College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday marked a historic night for the sport, but no one expected it to be the Indiana Hoosiers making it happen. 

The Hoosiers became the first-ever 16-0 college football team, as Curt Cignetti's squad defeated the Miami Hurricanes, 27-21, at Hard Rock Stadium. When Jamari Sharpe read Carson Beck's deep pass with 44 seconds left on the clock and picked it off, that kneel down to the ground cemented one of the great stories in college sports. 

But despite how great this season has been for the Hoosiers, some question whether this is sustainable. Can Indiana continue its dominance like it did in 2025, securing the No. 1 overall seed in the CFP and winning a national title?

One of its players has no doubt. 

"I was just talking to one of the guys, and I was just saying, ‘I wouldn't be surprised if Indiana makes it back next year,'" Hoosiers cornerback D'Angelo Ponds told Fox News Digital before his celebratory "shift" alongside Sharpe and receiver Elijah Sarrat at Raising Cane's in Bloomington on Thursday. 

Ponds told reporters his plan is to enter the 2026 NFL Draft, ending his college career on the highest note possible as a national champion, but the main reason behind his thought about a potential college dynasty falls on his belief in his head coach.

Ponds was with Cignetti during his freshman year at James Madison University, and when "Coach Cig" made the move to the Hoosiers' program, the 5-foot-9, 173-pound cornerback went to Bloomington with him.

Cignetti went viral during his introductory press conference at Indiana for his answer after a reporter said what his pitch would be to recruit players to a program that had gone a combined 9-27 over its last three seasons before his arrival. 

Cignetti, coming off a 19-4 career at JMU, including an 11-1 campaign in 2023, was blunt with his response. 

"It's pretty simple. I win. Google me," he said.

The proof is in the hardware now.

"I felt like nobody expected us to do this, especially us coming from JMU," Ponds added. "But I trusted in Coach Cig and his process, and knew that we were going to be successful. Him just believing in himself and the guys he brought with him, we brought the standard to Indiana and made history."

Sharpe was already at Indiana when Cignetti took over, and he learned quickly what his new coach was all about. After a 3-9 season in 2023, Cignetti led the Hoosiers to the CFP with an 11-2 record, followed by a perfect season this year. 

"This year has taught me a lot — brotherhood," he said. "It was a long year, and sticking together with my teammates to be able to go 16-0 and be able to win the national championship. It was a good season for us, and I'm just glad we were able to get it done."

So why can Indiana do it again in 2026 and beyond? 

"Just from Coach Cig and his process — he's a process-oriented guy. He doesn't dwell on the past. He's going to get right back to work and I wouldn't be surprised we go back to back," Ponds responded.

Chef Coombs talks about delicious and easy-to-make soups for guests on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

Amid pricey groceries and packed schedules, many Americans are gravitating toward simple, affordable meals rooted in tradition, connection and comfort.

From pot roasts to casseroles, "grandma-style cooking" is quietly taking over kitchens across the country. Dubbed "nonna-stalgia" online, the trend reflects a growing appetite for meals that warm the heart and home, especially in the cold winter months.

Experts told Fox News Digital the shift is a response to years of fussy food culture and constant trend-chasing.

CHICKEN SOUP OR TOMATO SOUP? DIETITIANS SAY ONE IS THE HEALTHIER CHOICE

"When the things around us feel overwhelming, we crave comfort and reach for the things that feel familiar and simpler," said Emmy Clinton, a Colorado-based recipe creator and founder of Entirely Emmy. 

"Grandma-style cooking represents comfort and memories that can make us feel safe and life feel a lot less complicated."

Her favorite is a pot roast. "You can find hundreds of pot roast recipes online, but they all have the same grandma logic: time, simple ingredients and ‘let it cook.'"

Others say the fading tradition of daily family dinners is helping fuel the trend. 

Dorina Lantella, an Italian American entrepreneur born in Washington, D.C., and CEO of Dorina's Kitchen, has built her career around restoring shared tables and traditional cooking. She was inspired by the "Roseto Effect," a phenomenon linked to Roseto, Pennsylvania.

THIS BUDGET-FRIENDLY VEGETABLE IS BECOMING ONE OF 2026'S BIGGEST FOOD TRENDS

"People are yearning for traditional family meals and shared table experiences because we are starving for connection," said Lantella, whose go-tos are lasagna and a simple pot of soup.

Many agree the pull is emotional. California chef Jessica Randhawa, founder of the food blog "The Forked Spoon," said returning to family recipes helped her cope with the loss of her parents.

"For me, grandma-style cooking has been both a healing process after losing both my parents in the last four years, and a way to pass on family traditions, flavors and food smells to my son," Randhawa said.

That yearning shows up clearly in the recipes resonating most right now. 

Here are five grandma-style dishes to consider this winter.

Today's home cooks are embracing the same mindset that shaped family meals in the 1960s, said Lanie Smith, the Kansas-based creator of TheVintageCook.com.

"Families wanted real meals, but they also wanted time together," she said. "They did not want to invest in 15 ingredients for a single dish or spend two hours in the kitchen after getting home from a long day at work."

Smith's recipe for chicken and dumplings calls for just a few ingredients: rotisserie chicken, Bisquick mix, milk and chicken bouillon powder. 

"It's a hearty meal in 30 minutes," she said.

The dish comes together by simmering rotisserie chicken in a thickened chicken broth, then dropping spoonfuls of Bisquick-and-milk dough on top and letting them steam into fluffy, biscuit-like dumplings.

Smith also recommends a fun take on two American classics — hot dogs and chili — that come together as an easy, inexpensive and comforting meal.

"There is a return to cooking that respects people's time and budgets," she said.

Her six-ingredient hot dog chili includes inexpensive, higher-fat ground beef to create a sauce specifically for topping hot dogs. "People love it because it feels like the food they grew up with," Smith added.

Some recipes shouldn't be reinvented, Randhawa said, such as her dad's cream of mushroom pork chops.

The dish is made with pan-seared pork chops simmered in canned cream of mushroom soup and milk, just as he cooked it when he was feeding his kids on a tight budget.

"It is pure, nourishing, easy and accessible comfort food," Randhawa said.

She insists on using Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup. 

"Using a homemade cream of mushroom soup simply will not do."

Also known as snert, split pea soup is a traditional Dutch dish that Randhawa's mother grew up eating in a small Iowa community. 

After her mother died, the wholesome soup began appearing more often in Randhawa's kitchen as part of her grieving process, she said.

Made with a leftover ham bone, vegetables and split peas, the recipe reflects the kind of practical, nourishing cooking that stretches ingredients, improves with time and is rooted in family tradition.

Randhawa's Grandma's Spaghetti Sauce with Meat is a no-frills, extra-meaty sauce passed down from her grandmother to her father and now to her.

It is made by browning ground beef and Italian sausage, then simmering it with canned tomato sauce, tomato paste, onions and basic seasonings.

"It makes me happy to know that, even though my son never met his great-grandma, he loves her recipe," Randhawa said.

Police in Indiana announced the arrest of five suspects in the shooting of an Indiana judge and his wife at their home earlier this week. 

The Lafayette Police Department said Raylen Ferguson, 38, and Zenada Greer, 61, both of Lexington, Ky., and Thomas Moss, 43, Blake Smith, 32, and Amanda Milsap, 45, all from Lafayette, Ind., were taken into custody following the Jan. 18 attack on Tippecanoe County Judge Steven Meyer and his wife Kimberly. Steven Meyer sustained an arm injury, while Kimberly Meyer had a hip injury. Both are now in stable condition, police said. 

Ferguson, Moss and Smith were arrested on charges including attempted murder, aggravated battery and intimidation with a deadly weapon, with gang and firearm enhancements. Police also listed Moss and Smith as "habitual offenders." 

Milsap was arrested on bribery and obstruction of justice charges, while Greer was charged with assisting a criminal and obstruction of justice.

"These arrests are the result of a comprehensive, collaborative effort among multiple agencies," the Lafayette Police Department said. 

Sunday's incident marked the first recorded act of violence against the judge, according to the Lafayette Police Department. Officials had no records of previous threats against Meyer or 911 calls from the judge's Mill Pond Lane address, a department spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital.

Dispatch audio obtained by Fox News Digital showed that the unidentified shooter allegedly knocked on the door of Meyer's home around 2:15 p.m. Sunday, then fired gunshots through the door. Before firing the gun, the suspect said, "We have your dog," according to the audio. 

"I am so grateful for the outpouring of support from friends, the community, court colleagues, and law enforcement," Judge Meyer said in a statement Wednesday in his first public comments since the shooting. "I want to express my heartfelt thanks to my medical team. I am receiving excellent care and I am improving. Kim is also deeply appreciative for the community support, and she too is healing."

"I want the community to know that I have strong faith in our judicial system," the judge said. "This horrific violence will not shake my belief in the importance of peacefully resolving disputes. I remain confident we have the best judicial system in the world, and I am proud to be a part of it."

            Federal officers in tactical gear line up at the driveway of a large block-shaped building wedged between the city limits of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Across from them, a crowd of protesters yell at the officers and sometimes try to block cars driving in and out.
    


            The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building has served as the backdrop for the ongoing tense dance in the Twin Cities since federal agents shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good earlier this month. Its stark brick structure is home base for the immigration proceedings at the heart of the crackdown in the state, prompting fear and anger.
    


            The man behind the name — Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple — would be standing outside with protesters if he were still alive, one historian and scholar said.
    


            Whipple, Minnesota's first Protestant Episcopal bishop, was known for advocating for the welfare of Native Americans and was a well-connected leader who stood up to government officials on their behalf throughout the mid-to-late 1800s, according to historians. While his legacy reflects his advocacy for those in the minority, it falls short of altruism and the building bearing his name perches on sacred land also known for its traumatic and violent history toward Indigenous peoples.
    


            Now, the Whipple Federal Building is where many people are temporarily detained after being swept up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Others are called to appear there for asylum and deportation hearings and other proceedings that have become increasingly confusing for migrants in the second Trump administration.
    


            Though Whipple, who died in 1901, began his term as bishop more than 165 years ago, some say he has influenced the protests and social justice efforts  present in the city today as activists respond to President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.
    


            Whipple “arrived in a Minnesota that was deeply racially divided at a national moment that was full of lots of conflict and tension,” said Craig Loya, current bishop of the Episcopal Church in Minnesota. “He spent his whole ministry, oftentimes at great personal cost, standing with Jesus on the side of those who were marginalized and excluded.”
    


            That imperative of standing with vulnerable people is something Loya said he thinks his congregation has carried on through the decades. Whipple was a “missionary bishop,” according to Michael McNally, the director of American Studies and professor of religion at Carleton College. Whipple and settlers were the newcomers in Minnesota. In the 18th century, the Dakota were living in the southern part of the state, and the Ojibwe were in the north, McNally said.
    


            The bishop wanted to extend the gospel to them and along the way developed a reputation as a well-connected person who would advocate for the tribes at a time when the White population wanted to remove them, McNally said.
    


            “Part of his story and his myth is that he was given a name that translates to a ‘straight tongue' because Ojibwe and Dakota leaders saw him as sort of worth their trust, but he also had a big network of people, and he was a very sort of powerful voice in DC and other places,” McNally said.
    


            While Whipple is best remembered for advocating for Native Americans, his attitude towards them was “paternalistic,” McNally said. Though he thought the Indigenous peoples could be neighbors with the White settlers, Whipple believed they had to assimilate to White culture to do so, he added.
    


            At the time, Whipple made it his aim to understand and advocate for Indigenous peoples' best interests — or rather “what we thought their best interests were,” he said.
    


            The result, McNally said, were Indian boarding schools in large part created by Whipple, where Native American children were forcibly taken, stripped of their culture and sometimes abused, he said.
    


            “I think he'd be out in the parking lot of the Whipple office building complaining about what's going on in there. But that doesn't mean that he's an uncomplicated person from the past with a real problematic legacy in terms of the boarding schools,” McNally said.
    


            In 2019, there were efforts to remove Whipple's name from the federal building, but not because of his complicated history, according to the campaign's leaders. Religious and community activists argued that he would have been opposed to what was taking place inside.
    


            The movement, known as “What Would Whipple Do?” was led by the Episcopal Church in Minnesota, the Minnesota Council of Churches, and the Interfaith Coalition on Immigration. The group said federal immigration officials were sending detainees from the Whipple building to Minnesota county jails, according to a letter sent to the federal government requesting the name change. They also claimed that a “well-oiled, ruthless, and inhumane deportation machine” was being run out of the federal building.
    


            “It came up because… Whipple never would have wanted his name on a building where these bad things are happening, because he was an advocate for people,” said Kathleen Motzenbecker, the refugee services director at the Minnesota Council of Churches.
    


            The building was named after Whipple when it opened to the public in 1969 at the initiative of then-Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota, someone Motzenbecker said was respected on both sides of the aisle and knew both the significance of the land and the importance of the bishop's legacy. Any push to rename the building now would likely take an act of Congress, according to a government report.
    


            But things have changed since the initial “What Would Whipple Do?” movement, with community and religious organizers like Motzenbecker saying the situation is even more urgent now than it was in 2019. The network of resources she said was strengthened by the campaign years ago is now in overdrive trying to help people.
    


            “There's a paramilitary group yanking people out of cars, armed men with masks. There's arrests before people get re-interviewed,” she said, adding that the new intensity is a product of a new initiative to reexamine the pending cases of legal refugees, on top of increased enforcement of illegal immigration policies. “That was not happening in 2019.”
    


            Federal agents surged to the city earlier this month and were met by demonstrators condemning President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement crackdown.
    


            Protests intensified after Good, a 37-year-old mother, was fatally shot by an ICE agent on January 7. Since then, demonstrators have been denouncing the agency and its use of force, leading to tense standoffs between officials in riot gear and protesters – many of them in front of the Whipple federal building. Other loosely organized groups have made an effort to follow and document immigration enforcement efforts and warn neighbors about where operations are taking place.
    


Federal authorities have called those who monitor ICE ‘domestic terrorists.' Here's what we know



            The group of advocates pushing for the Whipple building to be renamed did not stop fighting, even if the movement died off. Loya said it has evolved to respond to new, more pressing threats, taking the form of direct services and financial support for immigrants and refugees. A vigil is held every month by the Minnesota Interfaith Coalition outside the building. In that respect, the bishop said the movement “is still going strong.”
    


            “Even if we succeed in getting Bishop Whipple's name removed from the federal building, the injustices taking place there remain. And whether Bishop Whipple's name is on that building or not, we will continue to do everything we can to stand up with immigrants and to witness against the cruelty that is taking place inside,” Loya said.
    


            For the Episcopal Church Whipple once led, fighting for immigration and human rights continues. In addition to belief in the scripture, the church has been standing on the foundation of principles laid by Whipple, Loya said.
    


            The church has established a network of resources for immigrants and refugees and has been involved in legislative efforts for more than 60 years, said Loya. Through its Office of Government Relations, the church supports ongoing efforts to create comprehensive reform, refugee resettlement and pathways to citizenship, according to the church's website.
    


            Using the political and legal system to fight for social justice was a key part of Whipple's legacy, too, McNally said. The bishop was known to call on leaders in Washington, DC, New York and Philadelphia as well as influential people in Episcopal networks to advocate for his cause, he said. He also became a well-known consultant on Native Americans and served on commissions to try to address corruption in government organizations that dealt with policy around Indigenous peoples.
    


            Whipple persuaded President Abraham Lincoln to commute the sentences of the more than 300 arrested Dakota leaders after the US-Dakota war in 1862. Still, 38 were executed with little to no judicial process.
    


            Fort Snelling, where the Whipple building now sits, played a key role during and after the conflict. Weeks after the end of the war, more than 1,600 Dakota people, mostly women, children and the elderly, were marched hundreds of miles to a concentration camp nearby, according to the Minnesota Historical Society, and as many as 300 people died while they were detained over that winter.
    


            Several years later in 1871, Whipple went to bat again for the rights of the Ojibwe and Dakota people when the US wanted to end treaties with Native Americans, McNally said. As a consultant, he advocated to retain a treaty-based approach but said the government should no longer treat Native American tribes as independent nations. In the end, as Whipple desired, Congress passed the Indian Appropriations Act, essentially placing tribal nations under the control of the United States, according to the National Museum of the American Indian.
    


            Loya acknowledges Whipple's “complicated legacy” as he works to carry on the mission as his successor. He said Whipple was “standing with the vulnerable in the best way that he was capable” and that he too will “do that in an imperfect way.”
    


            Ramona Kitto Stately, a member of the Santee Dakota Nation, knows the lands surrounding the Whipple building well. They are part of her family history.
    


            The area of Fort Snelling encompasses not just the federal building, but the historical fort for which it is named, a state park and the airport. It is also the place of the Dakota people's creation story, and they have lived in the river valley for more than 1,200 years, according to Kitto Stately. In the Dakota language, it's called the Bdote — a word to describe the energy of where the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers converge, she said, the most sacred site to the Dakota people.
    


            Kitto Stately is the project director for the nonprofit We Are Still Here Minnesota, a group that wants to expand education about Indigenous peoples. The Bdote – the sacred land – includes the federal building and the land surrounding it on both sides of the river, she said.
    


            The current immigration actions at the site are triggering, Kitto Stately said.
    


            “We have a word in our Dakota language, because we have been through this, we have had people make us carry papers, people who have stolen our children, people who have just disappeared like our missing and murdered Indigenous women. It's something that we have constantly stood against. We even have a word in our language for these men that come and snatch people. We call it ‘wicayuze,'” Kitto Stately said.
    


            “It means ‘men snatchers' and so when we look at our history and we connect it with our language we already know that this has happened in our past. We already have a name for them,” she said.



            The Dakota and other Indigenous peoples in Minneapolis have not been silent about the ICE actions in the city. Kitto Stately said there is a group involved in peaceful protests and which has been present outside the only inner-city reservation, a 212-unit housing development called Little Earth. Enhanced security measures are in place around casinos and large event spaces owned by Native Americans, she added.
    


            Last week, the Native American Rights Fund said in a statement that it stands “with our neighbors —whatever their country of birth — who are getting ripped away from their families or violently apprehended for their lawful efforts to protect their communities” and called for an end to ICE's campaign.
    


            Recent reports of Native Americans being stopped at their homes and workplaces and being questioned or detained by federal agents, has revived historic trauma, Kitto Stately said.
    


            Especially in Minnesota, the fear of being arrested and taken to the Whipple building — the very site of the Dakota people's forced encampment years ago — is present in the community, she said.
    


            “I mean, who's more of a citizen than a Native American person with tribal ID,” she said.

            As thousands of protestors demonstrate in Washington, DC, at Friday's annual March for Life, the Trump administration faces a deadline to explain why it opposes a lawsuit that would achieve a key goal of its allies in the anti-abortion movement by ending the availability of abortion pills by mail.
    


            The lawsuit, brought by Louisiana against the President Donald Trump-appointed health officials, is one of several pressure points the anti-abortion movement is pressing to push the administration to limit access to medication abortion, which now accounts for roughly two-thirds of all abortions in the United States.
    


            “We're at a point where, from a lot of the pro-life movement's perspective, this is too important to play political games with,” Katie Glenn Daniel, the director of legal affairs for SBA Pro-Life America, told CNN. “They could pull these drugs out of the mail tomorrow. The justification is more than there.”
    


‘The most feminist thing you can do for yourself is not take birth control': The shifting politics of the pill



            While Trump has erected some hurdles to abortion in his second term, his administration has not reversed regulatory rules that have allowed abortion pills to be sent by the mail. That policy, enacted under President Joe Biden, has made it possible for women within states that limit of ban abortion to obtain the two-step drug regimen used to terminate a pregnancy.
    


            Trump health officials promised to look at the drug's safety data, but they have been noncommittal about when that would happen, or if they would ultimately reverse the Biden-era changes.
    


            “Where we are is that that the Trump administration has managed not to say anything,” said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at UC-Davis and author of several books about the anti-abortion movement. “It seems pretty clear politically that all the steps that Republicans and abortion opponents are taking aren't really moving the administration.”
    


            Anger within the anti-abortion community over the lack of action has reached a fever pitch and is manifesting in lawsuits, congressional hearings and calls for the firing of a top Trump appointee.
    


            “We can simply fix this if we have the courage to do it,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and staunch Trump ally, said last week. “So, what all of us are telling the administration: ‘you've been a very pro-life president, Mr. President, it's now time to deal with this issue.'”
    


            The White House, which did not respond to CNN's inquiry, is this week announcing new anti-abortion measures related to federal funding, including an expansion of a policy that bars foreign aid to groups that promote abortion. But SBA-List said that addressing abortion drugs was an “urgent” issue the administration must act on.
    


            “If there are those that don't care about the life issue, they should care about the politics of this,” said Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council. “This is going to be a political problem for those who have sold out the pro-life movement.”
    


            At a Senate hearing last week that aired GOP grievances about how medication abortion was reaching states that had banned the procedure, Republicans made clear that they had lost patience with the administration.
    


            “Republican members of this committee and many other senators expect an answer,” said Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the chair of the committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. “At an absolute minimum, the previous in-person safeguards should be restored and that should be done immediately.”
    


            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr said in a September letter to Republican attorneys general that he had ordered drug regulators to “review the latest data” on mifepristone's risks and safety. But Kennedy and agency spokespeople did not say when the review began or how long it would take.
    


            Abortion advocates and mifepristone manufacturers say that years of data show the drug is overwhelmingly safe and has fewer reported side effects than Viagra or penicillin. Mifepristone is also safer than procedural abortions, which are banned or heavily restricted in more than a dozen states.
    


            The Food and Drug Administration also approved a generic version of the abortion pill last fall, further infuriating conservative leaders. Graham led a letter with nearly all of the Senate GOP caucus demanding that the FDA revoke access to the drug while it conducts the review.
    


            “It's not even that things are paused where they were the day the president came into office. They are worse because there is another generic now on the market,” said Daniel of SBA Pro-Life America.
    


            Trump has checked some boxes off the anti-abortion movement's wish list, by reversing federal guidance requiring hospitals provide abortions in medical emergencies, restricting Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, and barring abortion at Veterans Affairs facilities.
    


            And without the justices appointed by Trump in his first term, the Supreme Court would not have overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a monumental victory for the anti-abortion movement that ended national protections for abortion access and allowed states to ban the procedure.
    


            To their dismay, however, the number of abortions has gone up since that court decision, with the provision of abortion pills by mail driving the increase.
    


            The FDA has not made any changes to the rules around medication abortion and neither Secretary Kennedy, nor FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, have testified before congressional committees in recent months. Makary, who has faced calls from anti-abortion groups that he be fired, also made comments to a conservative outlet in December suggesting that the mifepristone review was still in an early phase.
    


            “I hope the rumors are false, some of them are in print, that the agency is intentionally slow walking its study on mifepristone's health risks. I really hope that that's not the case,” Sen. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican, said at last week's hearing.
    


            In a statement, HHS denied that the review was being slow-walked for political reasons, and it said that the “FDA's scientific review process is thorough and takes the time necessary to ensure decisions are grounded in gold-standard science.”
    


            Facing indifference from the administration, last week's Senate hearing showcased the case the anti-abortion movement is now making about the current medication abortion rules, framing the pervasiveness of abortion-by-mail as a public health danger. The testimony of GOP witnesses highlighted accusations that women were being coerced to take the drugs and were allegedly facing increased health risks by not having an in-person visit with a doctor first.
    


            “This is basically setting a stage to demand a different reaction from the Trump administration,” said Rachel Rebouché, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law who specializes in reproductive health law.
    


Anti-abortion movement seeks to escalate clashes over blue state ‘shield' laws



            While their counterparts in Congress hold hearings and press conferences, anti-abortion state officials are going to court to force changes to access to medication abortion.
    


            Six states are currently suing the FDA over its rules for the drug. Missouri, Kansas and Idaho are carrying forward a case, originally brought under the Biden administration by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations, that seeks to reverse several FDA moves that made medication abortion easier to obtain.
    


            A separate case, brought by Florida and Texas, is trying to reverse the 2000 approval of mifepristone as well, effectively banning medication abortion.
    


            The Louisiana lawsuit is not challenging the underlying approval of mifepristone, focusing on FDA's rules around the drug instead, but it's taken a more aggressive approach in the litigation. The state has asked for a preliminary order that would immediately end the provision of abortion pills by mail while the lawsuit plays out.
    


            Its filing cited specifically the reports that the FDA was moving on a slow track to complete the review of the drug.
    


            “There should be no reason why they shouldn't just simply agree or take their own action,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told CNN. “If they want to moot my lawsuit or any of our concerns about this… they should just do what they said.”
    


            The Trump administration must file its brief opposing Louisiana's emergency request by Monday, and the judge will hold a hearing on the matter in late February.
    


Trump administration halts use of human fetal tissue in NIH-funded research



            The legal cases are a more effective tool to force Trump's hand than the political pressure, said Zeigler, because the administration can't avoid taking a position in court.
    


            “Court decisions are not within the administration's control in the same way these political decisions are, which means there's a lot more unpredictability there,” Ziegler said.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The cold, hard reality facing any U.S., NATO or European plans for Greenland is the ice. It chokes harbors, entombs minerals, and freezes shorelines into minefields of white and blue shards that threaten ships all year.

And the only way to break through all that is, well, with icebreakers: enormous ships with burly engines, reinforced hulls, and heavy bows that can crush and cleave ice. 

But the United States has only three such vessels, one of which is so decrepit as to be barely usable. It has entered agreements to obtain 11 more, but can only source additional ships from adversaries — or allies it has recently rebuffed.

Despite toning down his rhetoric, U.S. President Donald Trump seems set on the U.S. owning Greenland for security and economic reasons: to keep what he calls “the big, beautiful piece of ice” out of the hands of Moscow and Beijing, to secure a strategic Arctic location for U.S. assets, and to extract the island's mineral wealth including rare earths. 

Without specifying any plan, he told world leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday that “to get to this rare earth you got to go through hundreds of feet of ice.”

Yet there is no meaningful way to do that — or anything else in the semiautonomous Danish territory — without icebreakers' crucial ability to cut trails through frozen seas.

Even if they decided to surge U.S. material into Greenland tomorrow, “they would have two or three years gap in which they're not really able to access the island most of the time,” said Alberto Rizzi, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.




“On a map, Greenland looks surrounded by sea, but the reality is that the sea is full of ice,” he said.

If the U.S. wants more icebreakers, there are only four options: the shipyards of strategic adversaries China and Russia or longtime allies Canada and Finland, both of whom have recently weathered blistering criticism and threats of tariffs by Trump over Greenland.

Icebreakers are expensive to design, build, operate and maintain and require a skilled workforce that can only be found in certain places like Finland, with expertise forged in the frigid Baltic Sea. 

Finland has built roughly 60% of the world's fleet of more than 240 icebreakers and designed half the remainder, Rizzi said. 

“It's very niche capabilities that they developed as a necessity first and then they have been able to turn it into geoeconomic leverage,” he said.

Russia has the world's largest fleet with about 100 vessels, including colossal ships powered by nuclear reactors. Second comes Canada, which is set to double its fleet to around 50 icebreakers, according to a 2024 report by Aker Arctic, a Helsinki-based icebreaker design firm.

“Our design and engineering work order books are pretty full at the moment and the near future looks promising,” said Jari Hurttia, business manager at Aker Arctic, as he describes rising interest in the firm's “unrivalled special competence which is not available anywhere else in the world.”

China currently has five compared to the U.S. three, and is rapidly building more as they expand their ambitions in the Arctic, said Marc Lanteigne, a professor at the University of Tromsø in Norway who teaches often at the University of Greenland in Nuuk.

“China is now in a position to develop indigenous icebreakers, and so the U.S. feels it must do the same,” he said.

Washington has to play catch up, and fast, said Sophie Arts, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund focused on Arctic security.

“President Trump has really bemoaned this lack of icebreakers, especially in comparison to Russia,” Arts said. The 2 of the 3 U.S. icebreakers are “basically past their life cycle already.”

So he turned to the undeniable expertise of the European Union's northernmost nation and the U.S.'s neighbor to the north.

“Both Canada and Finland are really, really vital to this,” Arts said. “Cooperation is what makes this possible ... the U.S. doesn't really have a pathway to do this on its own at this time.”

During his first administration, Trump prioritized the U.S. military's acquisition of ice-capable vessels, a strategy that the Biden administration followed up on by signing an agreement called the Ice PACT with Helsinki and Ottawa to deliver 11 icebreakers constructed by two corporate consortiums with Finnish designs.

Four would be built in Finland, while seven would be constructed in a Canadian-owned billion-dollar “American Icebreaker Factory” in Texas as well as a shipyard in Mississippi under joint U.S.-Canadian ownership.

Any mining of critical minerals would face high costs in the harsh conditions at sea and on land in Greenland. Investments there would take years if not decades to pay off, Lanteigne said. 

Even with adequate icebreakers, the price to build and maintain mining or defensive facilities — like those envisioned in the yet-unfunded $175 billion Golden Dome missile defense network linking detectors and interceptors in space and on the ground — would be enormous.

That means U.S. allies in the Arctic might still welcome more investment by Washington in Greenland.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement that she would be open to strengthening Arctic security including the U.S. Golden Dome program “provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity.”

While both the U.S. and the 27-nation European Union including Denmark and Finland have pledged to vastly increase investment in Greenland, it is clear who currently has the hard-power capability to actually reach the vast frozen territory roughly three times the size of Texas. 

“It's kind of absurd because I don't think Finland would scrap the deal with the U.S. as a response to threatening to invade Greenland,” Rizzi said. “But if Europe wants to exercise significant leverage to the USA, they could say ‘We're not going to give you any icebreakers and good luck reaching the Arctic, or projecting power there, with those two old ships that you have.'”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reminded world leaders Tuesday at Davos of the key EU-technology base for any Arctic endeavors. 

“Finland — one of the newest NATO members — is selling its first icebreakers to the U.S.,” von der Leyen said at the World Economic Forum. 

“This shows that we have the capability right here, in the ice so to speak, that our northern NATO members have Arctic-ready forces right now, and above all, that Arctic security can only be achieved together.”

She announced after an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday that the EU would surge defense spending in Greenland including an icebreaker.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Since coming to the United States 30 years ago from Mexico, Fernando Perez said U.S. immigration officers have stopped by his home numerous times, but he has never once answered the door. 

“There are rules and I know them,” said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day laborer from contractors and people renovating their homes. 

Over the decades it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution's Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government's forced entry into someone's home.

As a result, immigration officers have had to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.

But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people's homes without a judge's warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades. 

The change comes as immigration arrests nationwide soar under a mass deportation campaign by President Donald Trump's administration that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on. 




“But if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent — they are not paying the rent — that's the last straw,” he said.

Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.

It is unclear how broadly the memo's directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man's home in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Blumenthal said in a news release.

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the “physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.”

For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.

In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he didn't leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

ICE has tried what the agency called “knock and talks” to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.

More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game — a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations.

Since shortly after ICE was created in 2003, advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments have diligently spread the word that people should not open their doors for immigration officers unless they can show a warrant signed by a judge. 

They've held know-your-rights trainings for communities, passed out flyers and posted videos on social media to teach immigrants how to protect themselves. 

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School's Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo “quite disturbing.”

“Know-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it's sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,” he said. “They know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.”

In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door. 

“They send us bulletins, to not answer the door, to not answer any questions,” he said.

Another man said he learned that from TikTok.

Trump's border czar Tom Homan has been highly critical of groups providing the information.

“They call it ‘know-your-rights,'” he said last year on CNN. “I call it ‘how to escape arrest.'”

The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.

Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they're at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn't work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk. 

With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of U.S. citizens.

Arulanantham said agents' aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.

“This would just be another step down that path,” he said. “Obviously it will be more significant because it suggests you're not safe even in your own house.”

President Donald Trump has revoked his invitation to Canada to join the Board of Peace that was established at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland.

Trump made the surprise announcement in a brief “letter” posted on Truth Social late Thursday.

“Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,” he wrote to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

The president did not elaborate on what influenced his decision to revoke the offer, but it likely stemmed from Carney's defiant speech at the Davos summit earlier in the day.

“Canada and the United States have built a remarkable partnership in the economy, in security, and in rich cultural exchange,” Carney said while speaking from Quebec City. “But Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.”

The prime minister's statement came in response to Trump's words from the day before.

“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us. By the way, they should be grateful also, but they're not,” Trump said. “I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful — they should be grateful to us, Canada. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”

Adding further fuel to the strained tensions between the United States and Canada is Trump's rhetoric about acquiring Greenland, either forcibly or diplomatically. The Danish territory was a major topic of conversation between Trump and European leaders. Trump promised more details about a possible deal involving Greenland in the next two weeks.

Trump has also suggested that Canada become the 51st state of the U.S., a prospect that irks Carney.

Besides Canada, Trump has been critical of the NATO alliance. Despite finding some common ground on Greenland, Trump argued NATO should have perhaps sent its forces to protect the southern border from illegal immigrants.

“Maybe we should have put NATO to the test,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Invoked Article 5, and forced NATO to come here and protect our Southern Border from further Invasions of Illegal Immigrants, thus freeing up large numbers of Border Patrol Agents for other tasks.”

Canada was one of many nations that received Trump's invitation to join his Board of Peace. Carney previously said he agreed with the invitation in principle, but he remained hesitant to accept due to the mandatory $1 billion fee to become a permanent member.

TRUMP SINGLES OUT ‘UNGRATEFUL' MARK CARNEY DURING DAVOS SPEECH

Trump formally unveiled the Board of Peace at a Thursday morning signing ceremony in Davos. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Argentine President Javier Milei were among the 19 world leaders present for the signing of the board's founding charter. Carney departed before the event.

With Trump as its chairman, the Board of Peace is primarily designed to oversee the transition of power in post-war Gaza from Hamas to a Palestinian technocratic committee. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted Trump's offer to join the board, but he was notably absent from the signing ceremony. No Israeli representatives were present either.

Before they even began the process of interviewing more than a dozen people for their coaching vacancy, the Baltimore Ravens knew plenty about Jesse Minter.

Now he has the job.

The Ravens hired the 42-year-old Minter on Thursday, just over two weeks after they fired longtime coach John Harbaugh. Minter is a familiar face, part of both Harbaugh's coaching tree and his brother Jim's. Minter's first four seasons (2017-20) as an NFL assistant were with the Ravens, and he spent the past two years as defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers.

“Jesse was impressive throughout our incredibly thorough interview process,” owner Steve Bisciotti said in a statement. “He clearly understands the values, high expectations and history of the Ravens, and he has a great vision for the future.”

Minter was a big name on the coaching market, interviewing virtually with several teams — including the Pittsburgh Steelers, who are looking for a coach after Mike Tomlin stepped down last week — before landing in Baltimore. His task with the Ravens includes helping two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson get back on track after an injury-plagued 2025 season in which Baltimore missed the playoffs.

“This is an organization whose values, culture and tradition of excellence reflect everything I believe about the game of football and how it should be played,” Minter said in a statement.

Minter was scheduled to have a second interview with Cleveland on Thursday before informing the Browns he was dropping out of consideration.




Baltimore was viewed as a top job opening because of Jackson's presence and the organization's stability over the years. The Ravens certainly talked to plenty of candidates, including Minter, Joe Brady, Anthony Campanile, Brian Flores, Vance Joseph, Kliff Kingsbury, Klint Kubiak, Mike McDaniel, Matt Nagy, Robert Saleh, Jim Schwartz, Nathan Scheelhaase, Chris Shula, Kevin Stefanski, Anthony Weaver and Davis Webb. Stefanski was hired by the Atlanta Falcons and Saleh by the Tennessee Titans.

The Ravens decided to move on from Harbaugh after his 18 seasons at the helm, but Baltimore did a lot right during those years. Mike Macdonald, a former defensive coordinator under Harbaugh, has been a big success as Seattle's head coach, with the Seahawks playing for the NFC title this weekend.

Minter and Macdonald were on the same staff in Baltimore. Minter advanced to the role of defensive backs coach before taking the defensive coordinator job at Vanderbilt. He spent one season with the Commodores before taking over as Michigan's defensive coordinator under Jim Harbaugh and spending two years there. The 2023 Wolverines won the national title, then Minter went to the Chargers when they hired Jim Harbaugh as their head coach.

Minter now becomes the fourth head coach in the Ravens' 31-year history.

“Jesse is a strong leader who possesses a brilliant football mind and a spirit that will resonate with our players and fan base alike,” Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said in a statement. “Jesse comes from a football family, with success at every level of the sport, and we are confident that he is the right coach to lead the Ravens forward.”

The Ravens were the fifth team to fill a head coaching vacancy this offseason. Arizona, Buffalo, Cleveland, Las Vegas and Pittsburgh still have openings. 

The Chargers were fifth in the league in total defense this season, allowing 285.2 yards per game. They allowed a league-low 17.7 points per game in 2024. Jim Harbaugh said during his season-ending news conference last week that it was only a matter of time before Minter would get his chance to be a head coach.

“The product that Jesse has established as the head coach of the defense, that's so good that we know it's a matter of when. We've been preparing for that,” Harbaugh said.

The Ravens endured a tumultuous 2025 season marked by a 1-5 start and major injuries, from Jackson to defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike. Baltimore still went into a Week 18 showdown with Pittsburgh with a chance to win the AFC North.

Rookie kicker Tyler Loop's potential game-winning field goal on the final play sailed wide right, handing the division crown to the Steelers.

John Harbaugh, the NFL's second-longest tenured head coach, was out of a job days later. Harbaugh didn't stay out of work long. He was hired to the same position by the New York Giants last week.

Although Jackson remains Baltimore's centerpiece, for the past couple of seasons the defense has lacked the ferocity the organization takes pride in. Minter will attempt to improve that, and it remains to be seen who he'll bring in to coach Jackson and the offense.

Rick Minter, Jeese's father, has more than 45 years of coaching experience in the college and pro ranks, including 10 seasons as the head coach at the University of Cincinnati.

During his time at Cincinnati, Minter had future NFL coaches John Harbaugh, Tomlin and Rex Ryan on his staff, as well as Jimbo Fisher. Harbaugh and Tomlin have each won a Super Bowl, and Fisher won a national title at Florida State.

EXCLUSIVE — Vice President JD Vance told the Washington Examiner that the public hostility exhibited by European leaders regarding President Donald Trump's demands for Greenland is simply “posturing,” and that they've expressed more “reasonable” responses to the president's plan in closed-door discussions.

The vice president sat with the Washington Examiner for a half-hour interview while flying from Toledo, Ohio, to Minneapolis on Thursday morning. While speaking in Toledo, Vance largely reiterated the administration's points that acquiring Greenland would boost American national security interests and its critical minerals supply chain.

The Washington Examiner asked the vice president, whom Trump has tapped alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio to continue negotiations with Europe on a “framework” for a new Greenland deal following the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, how he and Rubio are game-planning the negotiations, given Europe's open hostility to Trump's demands.

“They've been incredibly hostile in public, and a lot of this is posturing, right? If you're a European leader, they have to seem like a tough guy against Donald J. Trump,” Vance responded. “So a lot of this, what we've seen, is more symbolic posturing for the Europeans. Behind the scenes, they're much more reasonable.”

The vice president added that, during private negotiations carried out by himself, Rubio, and other senior administration officials, European leaders readily “admit” that Greenland “is important to our shared NATO security alliance” and that both Russia and China have signaled designs to move on the island “over the next three to 15 years.”

VANCE: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL DISCIPLINE ICE AGENTS WHEN ‘JUSTIFIED'

“They've also acknowledged that, God forbid, something significant happened in Greenland, the United States would have to play the leading role in defending it,” he continued. “So there's a broad recognition that much of what we said about Greenland is actually true, and it's interesting to juxtapose the public posturing with the very reasonable private negotiations that we've had with the Europeans.”

“If Greenland were to fall into the hands of the Russians and the Chinese, something that even the Danes themselves have admitted could happen at least over the medium and long term, it would make our security weaker,” Vance suggested. “It would give them power projection abilities. It would make our missile defense weaker, and so these things all counsel in favor of us shoring up that area, making sure it's properly secure.”

Target once again finds itself in a precarious political balancing act.

The bullseye retailer's stores have been a flash point during the recent immigration enforcement activity in its hometown of Minneapolis, and the company has remained publicly quiet on the issue.

But on Thursday, human resources chief Melissa Kremer sent a memo to staff acknowledging "the stress many of you may be carrying." It came as armed federal agents detained thousands of people across the city, and residents protested the moves.

The company declined to comment on the memo.

Some of those encounters have occurred in Target stores and parking lots.

A spokesperson previously declined to comment when video clips that appeared to show an employee being detained and an in-store bathroom break for Commander Gregory Bovino went viral.

"Target does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency," Kremer said in this week's memo. "We're listening and working to de-escalate where possible."

The memo also mentioned new internal resources for workers about how to safely handle "disruption near our locations."

While Target spoke out publicly following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the company has more recently tried to avoid alienating either side of the political aisle on issues such as LGBTQ+ Pride and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

In addition to its corporate headquarters, Target has about 20 stores in the greater Twin Cities metro area and is one of the largest employers in the state.

Binance founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao said his business relationship with President Donald Trump's family has been "misconstrued" in the wake of his pardon. 

"There's no business relationships whatsoever," Zhao told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on Thursday in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

The former Binance CEO served four months in prison after pleading guilty in 2023 to charges he enabled money laundering during his time leading the company. Zhao was released in September 2024.

Trump's pardon in October 2025 drew attention to Binance's ties to World Liberty Financial, a crypto company run by the president's family.

The connection stems from a $2 billion investment in March 2025 by state-owned firm MGX of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, into Binance. MGX paid using USD1, a stablecoin created by World Liberty Financial.

Zhao stepped down as Binance's CEO in 2023 as part of the plea deal and $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. He remains a major shareholder.

"MGX is the investor. They choose USD1," Zhao told CNBC. "My request to them was they pay us in crypto. I don't want to deal with banks, really."

"Many people misconstrued that," he added.

Zhao told CNBC the company has since converted that investment out of USD1 in portions over time.

"Stablecoin is just a currency for payment. Just because I accepted that, it doesn't mean I invested in the issuer of that," he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported following the pardon that in addition to MGX's investment using USD1, Binance also helped build the technology behind the stablecoin, citing sources familiar with the matter.

"A lot of people say that he wasn't guilty of anything," Trump said, when asked later why he issued the order. "And so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people."

NBC News reported the week of Trump's pardon that Binance had recently hired lobbyist Charles McDowell's firm, Checkmate Government Relations. McDowell is a friend of Donald Trump Jr., the president's son.

Checkmate disclosed that it was paid $450,000 for work that included lobbying the White House and Treasury Department for "executive relief" and "financial services policy issues relating to digital assets and cryptocurrency."

"There is a lot of media saying that there is some deal in place to get me the pardon," Zhao told CNBC at Davos. "As far as I know, that does not exist at all."

CNBC has reached out to World Liberty Financial for comment.

Zhao told CNBC at Davos that he has still not spoken directly with Trump.

"The closest that I got to him was today when he was doing the Board of Peace session," Zhao said. "I was in the audience, about 30 to 40 feet away from him."

In a CBS "60 Minutes" interview in November, Trump affirmed that he did not know Zhao.

"I have no idea who he is," Trump said. "I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration."

Google rolled out a powerful new feature to AI Mode in Search this week. It's called Personal Intelligence, and it weaves together many of the company's existing services in a radical new way.

This was also launched recently in Gemini, Google's AI chatbot. Business Insider's Pranav Dixit tried it and was blown away. Here's his review:

Personal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook.

With my permission, Gemini can tap into my Google account — Gmail, Photos, Search history, YouTube, and more — and reason across all of it to answer questions the way a human assistant might, except this one has years of receipts on my life.

This is something I've wanted since AI-powered chatbots blew up in late 2022. Back then, I'd pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer. Then, the bot would immediately forget I existed, like a genius goldfish. Over the last few years, OpenAI and Anthropic have enabled their chatbots to connect to services like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. But Google has home field advantage: it already has the broadest view of what you've actually done, searched, watched, and saved.

Gemini's ability to connect the dots is scary-good, well beyond what ChatGPT or Claude can do. When I asked it for sightseeing ideas for my parents, who have already visited the Bay Area a few times, it suggested museums and gardens, correctly inferring they've already done hikes and trips to redwood forests.

When I asked Gemini how it knew, it told me it deduced this based on "breadcrumbs" left across my Google account: Family emails, photos of Muir Woods, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for "easy hikes for seniors."

This is so powerful that Google is already trying to preempt the freak-out. VP Josh Woodward said Google takes "steps to filter or obfuscate personal data" from the conversations we have with Gemini.

"We don't train our systems to learn your license plate number; we train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it," he wrote recently.

So, I asked it for my license plate number and it was able to locate it, based on photos of my car in Google Photos.

I also asked Gemini when my car insurance was up for renewal and it correctly told me, based on emails from AAA in my Gmail inbox.

When I asked it to help me plan an upcoming trip, it accounted for the fact that we're traveling with an infant — because it already knows we have a new baby. Of course it does.

This is the future every AI company keeps promising. Last year, Meta said its new north star wasn't "the metaverse" — that alternate VR universe the company is literally named after — but "personal superintelligence," an AI that "knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them."

One path to that vision: AI-powered glasses that can see and hear what you see and hear, turning everyday life into the raw material for an always-on assistant. To get there, Meta has poured billions of dollars into a hiring spree and into the data centers needed to run it all.

But Meta doesn't have a digital record of my life like Google does. I barely post on Facebook. I mostly swipe through Instagram Reels. WhatsApp is encrypted. And after Meta killed Supernatural, my favorite VR workout app, I have very little reason to use its Quest headset anymore.

Meta talks about "personal superintelligence" as a future goal. As far as I'm concerned, Google just shipped it.

In this article

A former official of U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration is planning a multi-billion-dollar data center project in a remote corner of Greenland, as hyperscalers scramble to build out capacity across the globe to keep up with the AI rollout.

The data center is aiming to be operational at 300 megawatts (MW) by mid-2027, before further expansion would see it hit 1.5 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2028.

While that's currently several times the power capacity of any active data center in the world, there are plans to build multiple 1 GW-plus facilities across the globe over the next two years as the race to develop AI infrastructure continues to gather pace.

The Greenland data center project will cost billions of dollars to complete and has binding commitments with investors to finance half of its initial phase of development and half of the final phase, Drew Horn, a senior aide to Trump's first-term vice president Mike Pence and CEO of GreenMet, a company that's offering strategic support to the project, told CNBC. 

The venture is eyeing a buildout in the Kangerlussuaq area, a small settlement at the end of a deep fjord on the southwest coast of the Arctic island, with an airport, he added.

Technical partners have been enlisted to help with the physical buildout, but the project has yet to secure land or approvals from the local authorities, Horn said. He declined to share the names of the other companies involved in the venture because the information isn't public yet.

Commercial opportunities in Greenland have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Arctic island has become the center of a geopolitical firestorm after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on acquisition talk. 

Critical minerals mining and freshwater reserves have been touted as potential prospects, though skeptics point to logistical challenges around tapping into them with Greenland's limited infrastructure.  

Data center deals hit a record $61 billion in 2025 amid a rush to build out the infrastructure needed to power energy-intensive AI workloads. Big tech firms, including Meta, OpenAI, Oracle, AWS, Microsoft and Google are investing huge sums into developing facilities across the globe. 

Work on plans for the Greenland data center project began a year ago, and Horn told CNBC it has secured technical partners to assist with construction, operation and supplying energy.

Committed financing, which is in the form of debt and equity, is contingent on the project meeting key milestones, including securing permits from local government, said Horn — who was also a senior advisor to both the energy and intelligence departments towards the end of Trump's first term.

Other former senior Trump employees also have stakes in GreenMet, which says on its website that it helps companies with government and private funding and strategic partnerships.  

George Sorial, who was an executive vice president and chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization until 2019, and Keith Schiller, who was a longtime bodyguard for Trump and director of Oval Office operations during the U.S. president's first term, helped set up the company in 2021 and remain shareholders.

"We are not actively involved with GreenMet or Greenland," Sorial told CNBC. "We are passive minority shareholders in GreenMet and have no management role in the company." Schiller had not responded to a CNBC request for comment as this story went live.

The GreenMet CEO has been developing relationships with officials in the Greenlandic and Danish administrations as he looks to advance the project. He met the Danish Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen on Wednesday, as part of a "continuing dialogue," to discuss the data center, Horn said. CNBC has approached Denmark's U.S. embassy for comment.

While officials on all sides have been supportive of the project, the "issue is not so much on the private side, it's on the diplomatic," Horn said, pointing to the geopolitical tensions surrounding the U.S. push to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

Tensions have cooled since Trump backtracked on plans to impose tariffs on several European nations over the issue, but questions still remain as negotiations around U.S. military and economic involvement in Greenland continue.

"Our effort, which is purely private, it succeeds only if we have the buy-in from the relevant affected parties and countries," Horn said.

"Larger corporate entities" will be taking the lead on the construction and development of the data center, but GreenMet will continue to be involved as an advisor as the project looks to secure government investment from nations including the U.S., Greenland, Denmark, and other NATO countries, Horn told CNBC. 

"We've spent about a year putting together everything from the power to the technology components, [and] we have a Greenlandic partner on the ground," Horn said. "Right now we're waiting on approvals from the Greenlandic side."

A big challenge for projects of this scale in Greenland is access to power. For the first phase of the project, which is targeting 300 MW power capacity, the plan is to use specialized barges carrying Liquefied Natural Gas to the fjord, Horn said.

The venture plans to build a hydroelectric facility — 70% of the island's energy comes from such facilities — to power the second phase, which would see the data center hit 1.5 GW capacity. Permits and approvals from the Greenlandic government are still pending for both the barges and the facility. Greenland's Ministry of Business has been approached for comment.

Horn argues that if local authorities greenlight the large hydroelectric facility, energy prices will make the project commercially viable long-term. 

There are some significant advantages to building data centers in an environment with low temperatures, analysts told CNBC.

"The biggest value sits in its resource profile, specifically in hydro for electricity generation and a 'free cooling' proposition given the lower ambient temperature," Noah Ramos, strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, told CNBC.

But there are hurdles the project will have to overcome. "Building in the Arctic is capital intensive; construction seasons are short, and the heat from the servers can melt the very ground the building sits on... specialized engineering is needed," Ramos said.

Nvidia is also touting a new generation of chips that require less cooling. "It's early days, but if future generations of chips are even more efficient in this regard, it could negate the need for expensive data centre build outs in places like Greenland," Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC.

Intel shares plunged more than 15% on Friday after the chipmaker issued lackluster guidance and warned of a supply shortage.

During a fourth-quarter earnings call with analysts Thursday, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company wouldn't be able to meet full demand for its products. He said production efficiency, or yield, is also below his targets. 

"We are on a multiyear journey," he said. "It will take time and resolve."

The chipmaker expects first-quarter revenue to range between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share to break even. That was below LSEG expectations for earnings of 5 cents per share and $12.51 billion in revenue. 

Over the last year, Intel shares have rallied more than double on hopes of a turnaround for the embattled American chipmaker, following investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia.

The company's foundry business has long underperformed competitors, which are profiting massively from the data center artificial intelligence boom. 

Investors were looking for clarity on foundry customers as the next momentum mover for the stock. The company's foundry business creates chips for other companies. 

CFO David Zinsner told CNBC that Intel expects customers for its next-generation 14A technology to appear in the second half of the year. 

But analysts at RBC Capital Markets warned that a "meaningful revenue contribution" from 14A customers may not pop up until late 2028. 

"We appreciate the recent excitement around opportunity for INTC but still don't see a clear path forward given further share loss, no AI strategy and unclear fab/packaging opportunities," wrote analysts at Jefferies.

Despite the soft outlook, Intel topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings and revenue expectations.

Ahead of the Super Bowl, you might be wondering which chain restaurant has the best boneless wings to chow down on while you watch the big game.

Boneless wings are one of the most popular options at chain restaurants on game day, and chains that specialize in chicken wings, such as Wingstop, are also experiencing significant growth.

The chicken chain has grown from 2,000 to 3,000 restaurants in the past two years, per the company, and saw a 10% increase in system-wide sales in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

We ranked boneless wings from five chain restaurants — Applebee's, Chili's, Buffalo Wild Wings, TGI Fridays, and Wingstop — based on taste and value.

I tried the same three flavors of wings from the five chains: Buffalo, garlic Parmesan, and barbecue.

At Buffalo Wild Wings, an order of 15 boneless wings, which included up to three different sauce flavors, cost $24.99, excluding tax.

Given that the chain is famous for its wings, I was surprised that the chain's boneless wings landed last in my ranking.

Some of the wings were meatier than others, but I thought Buffalo Wild Wings' wings were the smallest when compared to the other chains.

Still, I enjoyed the flavor of the boneless wings, particularly the classic Buffalo wings. They had a sweet buttery flavor without packing too much spice.

The wings had a slightly pungent garlic savoriness, but they weren't as flavorful as the ones I tried from the other chains.

The breading was crunchy and had a peppery flavor, but I thought it slightly overpowered the sauce.

Of the three kinds I tried from Buffalo Wild Wings, these were my favorite. The wings were sticky and sweet, thanks to the honey in the sauce, and paired nicely with the chain's creamy ranch.

The wings were juicy on the inside, which balanced nicely with the crunchy outer breading.

In some ways, these boneless wings reminded me of standard chicken nuggets.

Boneless wings are made exclusively from chicken breast, while nuggets are typically made from a blend of various chicken parts. These did taste better than most chicken nuggets I've had, though I wasn't blown away overall.

I'll go for the burger next time.

I ordered boneless wings from TGI Fridays in three flavors: Buffalo, garlic Parmesan, and apple-butter barbecue. I ordered them as part of the chain's combo platter, which lets you choose three appetizers.

At the TGI Fridays I visited in Massachusetts, the order cost $18.29, excluding tax, and came with eight of each flavor wing.

TGI Fridays doesn't seem to have its own house Buffalo sauce and instead douses its wings in Frank's Red Hot Buffalo sauce, a pretty standard grocery-store hot sauce.

I did enjoy the overall flavor, but these wings didn't bring the heat for me. Compared to the other Buffalo boneless wings I tried, these were just average.

The wings had a super crispy coating and were drenched in a savory, garlicky sauce.

The wings had a crunch when I bit in — which I didn't quite get with the Buffalo boneless wings — and paired excellently with the chain's ranch.

I could distinctly taste the apple butter in this sauce, which gave it a sweet, almost molasses-like flavor. Though the size varied, these wings also were slightly bigger and crunchier than the Buffalo wings.

The wings were reasonably thick, but the chicken and breading lacked seasoning or flavor on their own — the sauces provided the majority of the flavor, which wasn't necessarily a criticism but an observation.

Boneless chicken products like boneless wings, chicken nuggets, and tenders are having a moment right now.

However, Wingstop's senior director of culinary, Larry Bellah, told BI that the chain's bone-in traditional wings are still its most popular offering.

Bellah also said the five most popular sauce flavors at Wingstop are lemon pepper, Original Hot, hickory-smoked barbecue, garlic Parmesan, and hot honey.

I ordered 20 boneless wings, which allowed me to select up to three sauce flavors for $24.69, excluding tax.

They were smaller than the top two brands I tried, but they had a lot of flavor. Wingstop doesn't have a Buffalo sauce, but their Original Hot flavor is the chain's own spin on a classic.

They were buttery, with just the right level of spice.

I found the wings quite flavorful, but the Parmesan cheese stood out much more prominently than the garlic. The garlic flavor was subtle and almost overshadowed by the richness of the cheese.

The sauce had a bold, smoky flavor with a rich balance of sweet, tangy, and savory notes, and coated every square inch of the boneless wing.

Of all the sauces, this flavor paired best with the chain's ranch, which was creamy and mildly tart.

Though these wings were small, they were thick. I thought they were an excellent value. The chicken meat inside tasted high-quality and shredded apart with every bite.

Applebee's seriously delivered on flavor. However, the chain didn't clinch the win for me based on value.

I ended up ordering two separate orders of eight boneless wings, which cost $16.99 each, at my local Applebee's in Brooklyn. I also got another order of eight boneless wings as part of the chain's "2 for $2X" deal, which included an appetizer and two entrées for $30, excluding tax.

As of this past year, Applebee's also offers an Ultimate Combo appetizer platter, which would allow you to choose three different kinds of boneless wings in a smaller portion for $16.99 total — a much better value if you're looking to try multiple flavors.

In the end, I ended up paying more than at any other chain, so I could try multiple flavors by ordering them separately. Next time, I'll opt for the Ultimate Combo.

As the official grill and bar sponsor of the NFL, I expected the chain's boneless wings to be good — and they delivered.

Out of all the boneless Buffalo wings I tried, these were the spiciest and most flavorful. They paired well with the chain's ranch, which was tangy and creamy and perfectly balanced out the heat.

The outside of the wing was crispy and crunchy, and the garlic Parmesan sauce added a savory, nutty flavor to each bite.

The wings were perfectly balanced between sweet and smoky.

The wings were impressively large and packed with tender, juicy chicken.

When it came to flavor, Applebee's was exceptional. All three sauces I tried were well-executed and flavorful. However, the garlic Parmesan stood out as my favorite.

Its rich, creamy blend of nutty Parmesan and savory garlic created a bold and indulgent flavor that took the wings to another level. While the other sauces were delicious, the garlic Parmesan offered a perfect balance of crispy breading and zesty flavor that kept me going back for more.

I got 15 wings in three different flavors as part of Chili's popular Triple Dipper appetizer combo, which allowed me to select three appetizers for $17.89, excluding tax, at a Chili's in Massachusetts.

The chain had a successful 2025, marked by significant sales growth, increased restaurant traffic, and strong revenue growth. Executives say the viral popularity of its signature appetizer combo helped drive such growth.

Chili's also said the Triple Dipper and fried mozzarella "bricks," which have also gone viral for their lengthy cheese pulls, are attracting younger customers and getting them to come back more often.

The wings appeared to be baked in the Buffalo sauce rather than tossed in it after cooking.

The Buffalo sauce was sweet and slightly spicy, with a light buttery flavor. I tasted a strong citrus flavor, which I also enjoyed.

I was again impressed by the size of the wings and thought the savory punch of garlic really came through. The wings were moist yet crispy, and I couldn't get enough of them.

Unlike the others, which were almost dry to the touch, these boneless wings came completely drenched in the chain's house barbecue sauce.

The sauce was smoky with a slight sweetness, but they could have benefited from a little acid for some brightness.

They were full of chicken meat, which made this an incredibly filling appetizer to share among a few people at a Super Bowl party … or to keep all to yourself while catching the game.

For under $20, the Triple Dipper delivered incredible value, with a generous portion of high-quality wings that didn't skimp on flavor or size.

For me, it's no surprise this menu item has become such a hit.

Fully remote jobs aren't as easy to come by as they might've been during the pandemic remote work boom. But they're still out there.

 Recent data from FlexJobs, a jobs site for remote roles, shows the fields where these fully remote jobs are growing fastest.

"Workers want to work remotely," Toni Frana, career expert manager, tells CNBC Make It. Companies "know that it makes sense to offer work flexibility like remote work to help them attract and retain talent."

In FlexJobs' Remote Work Index, 85% of professionals called remote work the biggest factor that would make them apply to a job, ahead of competitive pay and benefits.

Analyzing more than 60 career categories, FlexJobs compared the total number of 100% remote job postings between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2025 to identify the 15 fastest-growing fields for fully remote jobs. FlexJobs defines a "fully remote job" as a professional-level role allowing someone to perform their job responsibilities entirely from home. Each field showed at least 19% growth in fully remote job postings in 2025.

FlexJobs' report notes the list "excludes long-time leaders in the remote space," like IT, customer service and project management roles in order to highlight emerging fields where remote work is quickly growing.

"There are remote opportunities but the competition for each of those remote roles is pretty high," says Frana. To boost their chances, workers applying for these positions should focus on learning in-demand skills for these roles and demonstrating their impact in prior roles on their resumes and in interviews. Particularly for remote roles, candidates also want to show they can "work really effectively as independently as possible with less manager oversight," Frana says.

Here are the 15 fields seeing the quickest growth in fully remote work, according to FlexJobs' report:

Happy Friday. With TikTok guaranteeing its presence in the U.S. (which we cover below), it looks like my screen time will remain far higher than it should be.

Stock futures ticked lower this morning. The market is coming off another winning day.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

As investors continue to breathe easier amid easing geopolitical and trade tensions, inflation data released yesterday gave traders another reassuring sign. The latest stats were in-line with expectations, though they were still above the level deemed healthy by the Federal Reserve.

Here's what to know:

Trump is taking JPMorgan Chase and its CEO Jamie Dimon to court. 

In a lawsuit filed yesterday, the president alleged that the bank's closure of his and related accounts in early 2021 was politically motivated. Trump told reporters yesterday that Dimon "debanked" him, saying that he's "not allowed to do what he did." Trump is seeking at least $5 billion in civil damages as part of the suit, which was filed in Florida state court. 

As CNBC's Hugh Son and Dan Mangan note, JPMorgan's closure of Trump's accounts followed the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and Trump's departure from the White House later that month. "While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit," JPMorgan said in a statement to CNBC.

Intel surpassed Wall Street's expectations on both lines for the fourth quarter, but the chipmaker offered soft guidance for the current quarter which sent shares sinking 13% in overnight trading.

CFO David Zinsner told CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos that the company's weak outlook was due in part to supply constraints. While Intel doesn't have the materials to meet seasonal demand this quarter, supply should improve in the next three-month period, he said. 

The stock's pullback follows a huge run: Shares of Intel have surged nearly 150% over the last 12 months. Trader excitement has been driven by investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia in the California-based company last year.

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

Big technology news last night: TikTok announced it officially formed a joint venture that will keep it operating in the U.S. Thanks to a law signed in 2024, the short-form video platform faced an effective ban in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company ByteDance divested from the company's American business.

Adam Presser — TikTok's head of operations and trust and safety — will become CEO of the venture, which the company said will operate as an "independent entity."  TikTok CEO Shou Chew will be a director, and Americans will comprise a majority of the seven-member board.

As CNBC's Dylan Butts reports, TikTok continued to dominate in the U.S. last year despite the potential ban. It was the second most-downloaded app in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2025, according to Sensory Tower data.

After Trump's market-moving announcement that he reached a "framework" of a deal with NATO over Greenland, European leaders are trying to get the nitty-gritty.

European parliament member Bernd Lange told CNBC yesterday that the European Union needed "greater clarity" on what the agreement entails and that "nobody knows" the details. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen similarly said he did not know the specifics of the framework, but that the island's sovereignty and territorial integrity were "red lines" that couldn't be crossed.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called out European leaders in a strongly worded Davos address. "Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost trying to convince the U.S. president to change," Zelenskyy said yesterday.

Between Davos and the Greenland deal framework, there's been no shortage of news to keep up with. Here are some stories you might have missed:

CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon, Hugh Son, Dan Mangan, Kif Leswing, Kristina Partsinevelos, Jonathan Vanian, Dylan Butts, Ashley Capoot, Samantha Subin, Hugh Leask, Kevin Breuninger and Lucy Handley contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

TikTok has just announced a new U.S. venture that will keep it operating there after years of concerns about its links to China. But even as it was nearly banned and faced scrutiny from officials, the short-video platform still dominated in 2025.

The app, owned by Beijing-headquartered ByteDance, was the second-most-downloaded app across Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store in the U.S. in 2025, according to Sensor Tower data, defying a near-ban in the market.

Another ByteDance app, CapCut, ranked fourth, with the video editing tool climbing three places from a year ago.

Other China-linked apps also had strong showings across U.S. app stores in 2025, with major e-commerce players like Temu and Shein thriving even as they were targeted by policy changes, Sensor Tower data showed.

Temu, which ran a high-profile Super Bowl ad campaign in 2024, fell from the top position that year, but still ranked in seventh place in 2025, even as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs upended its business model.

Although Shein did not rank among the top 10 most downloaded apps overall, it was the most downloaded app in the apparel shopping category in the U.S. in 2025.

Separately, OpenAI's ChatGPT was America's most downloaded app last year, as adoption of generative artificial intelligence continued to expand.

Sensor Tower's data shows that U.S. consumers continue to favor apps coming out of China, often synonymous with addictive algorithms, affordability, and convenience.

"2025 showed that these China-originated apps aren't just policy arbitrageurs, but are adaptive ecosystems with governance capabilities on both the demand and supply sides," Liang Chen, a Professor of Strategy & Entrepreneurship at Singapore Management University, told CNBC.

Before Thursday's announcement of the U.S. joint venture, TikTok faced months of uncertainty in 2025. The Supreme Court upheld a law in January that effectively banned the video-sharing app from U.S. app stores unless ByteDance divested from the platform.

The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April 2024, cited risks of the Chinese government accessing user data for surveillance or influence operations. 

Although TikTok briefly went dark in January, the law was never enforced. Upon taking office, Trump repeatedly extended the law's deadline as he negotiated a divestment deal.

The threat of a TikTok ban also drew increased attention to Chinese alternatives such as Xiaohongshu, known in English as RedNote.

Despite the uncertainty, not only did interest in TikTok's app hold steady, but it managed to expand its e-commerce business, TikTok Shop, which allows users to purchase products directly through videos and live streams. 

The company has said that, under the new joint venture plans, TikTok Global's U.S. entities will continue to manage certain commercial activities, including e-commerce and advertising. 

According to data from retail consulting firm Coresight, TikTok's U.S. revenues, including ad revenue, in-app purchases and commerce, rose 26.2% year over year to $13.9 billion, following 25.7% growth in 2024.

"TikTok's success in 2025 demonstrates a path to navigate geopolitical headwinds despite the continuously deteriorating U.S.-China relationship — a rare case of clever commercial strategy triumphing over politics," said Xiaomeng Lu, director of geo-technology at Eurasia Group. 

The app looks poised to close its deal with U.S. investors, with multiple Trump-Xi meetings planned throughout the year, she added. 

TikTok Shop competitors Temu and Shein also remained major players in the U.S. last year despite new tariffs and increased government oversight of labor practices, supply chains, and product safety. 

The most significant of these headwinds was the Trump administration's closure of the "de minimis" trade loophole on May 2 and the imposition of broader tariffs on imports from China. The "de minimis" rule had allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the United States duty-free.

Although Shein and Temu have moved their headquarters out of China in recent years, much of their operations and suppliers remain in the country.

Analysts said both companies adjusted to tariffs by negotiating lower supplier prices, absorbing some of the levy costs, and expanding supply networks beyond China, including in the United States.

Coresight estimates Shein's U.S. revenue increased 16.8% year over year to $14.6 billion in 2025. Meanwhile, Temu's gross merchandise values increased by 21.8% year over year to $27.4 billion.

"[Policy] shocks in 2025 didn't really make demand disappear. Rather, they proved that these platforms can adapt their logistics, merchant mix, and incentive design faster than consumer habits shift," said Singapore Management University's Chen. 

Analysts said the staying power of apps such as TikTok, Temu and Shein stems from their attention-driven platforms and algorithms.

"The success of Temu, Shein, and TikTok Shop fundamentally reflects a shift in demand generation: moving away from legacy marketing tactics like simple ad-spend and display campaigns to a continuous, attention-economy strategy," said Scott Miller, CEO of e-commerce consulting firm pdPlus. 

"Their growth shows that American consumers now discover products through highly engaging, viral, and personalized content, making demand creation a function of entertainment and constant digital presence rather than traditional top-down branding," he added. 

Those same algorithms and features have also drawn scrutiny from U.S. regulators. For example, officials have raised national security concerns over TikTok's recommendation algorithm, citing its potential for manipulation by the Chinese government. 

Regulators have also flagged data privacy and national security risks tied to Temu and Shein's data collection practices.

Despite those concerns, the apps have continued to capture the attention of U.S. users and shoppers. 

"American consumers overall don't really care an app's association with any specific country as long as they can find something they want at an affordable price," said Yao Jin, an associate professor of supply chain management at Miami University.

"[That] is exactly the competitive advantage of most China-originated apps."

Shares of Czech-based defense firm Czechoslovak Group (CSG) soared over 30% on its stock market debut on Friday, underscoring sustained investor interest in defense companies amid Europe's growing push for military sovereignty.

CSG, one of the world's fastest-growing defense firms, made its debut on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 

Shares rose as much as 32% in the session before closing the session up 31.4%.

The Prague-based company, which makes armed vehicles, ammunition and advanced defense systems, raised a total of 3.8 billion euros in its initial public offering. 

Euronext said the listing marked the world's largest defense IPO ever recorded, both in terms of amount raised and market capitalization.

"Today marks a historic milestone for CSG as we join the Euronext Amsterdam market and we welcome the confidence shown in us by investors," Michal Strnad, chairman of CSG, said in a statement.

"Becoming a publicly listed company demonstrates our commitment to high standards of transparency, disclosure and corporate governance and strengthens our ability to invest in innovation, expand our global reach and deliver on our mission to be a critical long-term supplier of advanced defence and industrial solutions to NATO states and Government partners worldwide," he added.

The listing comes after weeks of mounting geopolitical tensions, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to use military force to seize Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. 

In a surprise development on Wednesday, however, Trump said he had agreed to a framework of a future deal with respect to the self-governing Danish territory. 

In Europe, meanwhile, investors have continued to pile into defense stocks, fueled by a mix of European Union, national and private capital funding.

Strategists have cited Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the end of the U.S. defense umbrella in Europe as underpinning a so-called "mega-trend in the making."

In this article

The future of the booming obesity drug market won't hinge on drugs that deliver greater weight loss alone. 

Top executives from drugmakers big and small told CNBC that the next phase of the space will be defined by a broader range of treatment options and improved access for patients. Those were among the themes that emerged at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco during interviews with top brass from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and other drugmakers. 

"We really see the obesity market going from, in this year, a one-size-fits-all kind of idea to different medicines for different patients. We don't have a crystal ball to know how that all sorts out," Dan Skovronsky, Eli Lilly's chief scientific officer, told CNBC in an interview at the conference.

"But I think by presenting people with options, they'll pick for themselves with their doctors, and I think we want to have something for everyone," he continued. "And we're not done yet." 

Over the coming years, executives expect an expanding menu of obesity treatments that can be tailored to an individual patient's needs — from pills and less-frequent injections to combination regimens and drugs designed to preserve muscle mass while promoting weight loss. Some also expect the direct-to-consumer market to become an even larger slice of the market, while hoping that hurdles preventing patients from getting treatment continue to fall.

Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are widely credited with establishing the market through their weekly GLP-1 injections for obesity and diabetes, which have surged in popularity in recent years. The next chapter is already taking shape, with Novo launching the first GLP-1 pill for obesity earlier this month and Lilly preparing to bring an oral option of its own to market later this year. 

While those companies will play a critical role in how the space evolves, other players from pharma titan Pfizer to little-known upstarts could also enter the market — both threatening the two rivals' sales dominance and offering more treatment alternatives for consumers.

While access remains a challenge for many patients, the ability to get GLP-1s has improved notably over the past year. Both Novo and Lilly have slashed cash prices for their injections and struck deals with President Donald Trump in November that will, for the first time, introduce Medicare coverage for obesity drugs later this year.

More treatment options and wider access could boost the case for analyst projections that say the weight loss and diabetes drug market could be worth almost $100 billion annually by the end of the decade. 

In an interview at the conference, Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said the company and Lilly currently have around 15 million people combined who have obesity taking GLP-1s. There is still a "long tail" to reaching the 110 million that are reportedly suffering from the condition, along with those who are overweight, he added. 

In a May report, McKinsey said it expects a range of 25 to 50 million U.S. patients to use GLP-1s by 2030. 

Here's what executives say the future of the space could look like. 

Pills have not yet proven more effective than injections. 

Still, the consensus among executives is that oral options could expand the market, reaching entirely new patients. That may include people who are afraid of needles, as well as people who could benefit from existing injections but don't view their condition as severe enough to warrant a weekly shot.

In an interview at the conference, Doustdar said it could also include people who travel frequently and can't easily refrigerate injections. 

"There is so much aligned exactly with this market expansion story … because there is a huge number of patients that are simply not interested in losing weight at the cost of injecting themselves," Doustdar said. 

The "real growth" and uptake of the pills is going to come from primary care physicians, who write the majority of prescriptions for Americans and typically prefer pills to injections, said Ray Stevens, the CEO of obesity market hopeful Structure Therapeutics. 

He said he believes his company's GLP-1 pill, aleniglipron, will be the third to enter the market after Eli Lilly's and Novo Nordisk's. Structure's oral drug will enter Phase 3 trials this year. 

Daily pills can offer more flexibility to patients. For example, Stevens said a patient could cut a pill in half to mitigate side effects on a day when they have an important meeting to attend. 

Lilly's Skovronsky said pills will also serve as a way for patients to "deescalate their therapy" after taking injections. The company in December released data showing that patients who initially took Wegovy or Zepbound shots maintained the majority of their weight loss after switching to Lilly's pill. 

"They say, 'I've lost the weight, I've got this, so I can maintain this on my own with something less strong,'" Skovronsky said. 

Structure is also developing an oral drugs that targets amylin, an emerging form of weight loss treatment that mimics a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to suppress appetite and reduce food intake. Novo is developing a medicine called amycretin, which targets both GLP-1 and amylin to offer potentially enhanced weight loss. 

Stevens said combination regimens are "going to be the next phase of the field." 

For example, Structure hopes to combine its oral GLP-1 and amylin drugs to achieve even greater weight loss than one alone would, which he said will likely be "one of the best combos of the future." It's too early to say which patients would be the best fit for that regimen, but Stevens said it could achieve "good tolerability, really good patient experience and good efficacy." 

He said the company is already working on manufacturing the two ingredients together in a single pill, which is similar to what Novo's amycretin achieves. 

But he said combination regimens can also help treat certain obesity-related conditions better than one product alone. That could look like combining a GLP-1 with one of the existing treatments for fatty liver disease. 

"I feel like the winners are now starting to emerge for the monotherapy" treatments, he said. But Stevens said the treatment patients take will segment according to the other health conditions a person has on top of obesity, such as fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. 

Lilly's upcoming pill is an oral GLP-1, but Skovronsky said the company can see the potential for a pill that targets that hormone along with another called GIP, since that's a "preferred formulation." 

That's how tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Lilly's blockbuster obesity and diabetes injections, works. That drug has proven to be more effective than semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's rival injections, which only targets GLP-1. 

Skovronsky said, "we're working hard to create those medicines" in an oral form, but aren't ready to disclose any details. 

Pfizer inherited several experimental injections and pills with combination potential from its roughly $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera last year. 

But Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company is also developing an in-house oral drug that blocks the GIP receptor, which can significantly reduce side effects when combined with GLP-1. 

"I have very high hopes that it will also differentiate," Bourla said.

One biotech, Wave Life Sciences, also sees combinations as part of its broader strategy, its CEO Paul Bolno said in an interview at the conference. 

Wave is taking a different approach to weight loss, targeting how the body burns fat rather than suppressing appetite. The goal is to achieve comparable weight loss to GLP-1s, without the associated muscle loss, and with less frequent dosing of once or twice a year rather than weekly. 

That push comes amid growing focus on the quality of weight loss with next-generation obesity drugs, as GLP-1 treatments have raised concerns around muscle loss, side effects and patient drop-offs.

Wave has an experimental injection that uses RNA technology to lower levels of a protein called activin E – a liver-produced protein that slows fat burning. By reducing that protein, Wave believes the drug can increase fat loss, particularly harmful visceral fat, while preserving lean muscle mass. 

Bolno said the company is developing the injection, called WVE-007, as a monotherapy or a potential maintenance treatment that patients can switch to and take far less frequently after being on GLP-1s.

But he also sees the opportunity to combine the company's injection with GLP-1s to "continue to drive benefits." 

"We can double the weight loss on GLP-1s in combination," Bolno said, referring to what the company is seeing in preclinical research. 

He said adding Wave's injection on top of a GLP-1 won't make it more difficult for patients to tolerate the treatment regimen, so it makes the company's drug "very amenable to combination" options.

As for who can use Wave's injection, Bolno said it will work for any patient since "this happens to be a target that's actually in human genetics."

The future of the industry will likely also include drugs that can achieve even greater weight loss than the current treatments on the market. 

Lilly in December released the first late-stage data on an injectable drug called retatrutide, the highest dose of which achieved more than 28% weight loss at 68 weeks among patients who stayed on the treatment. Lilly will read out data on seven other Phase 3 trials on the drug this year. 

Dubbed the "triple G" drug, retatrutide works by mimicking three hunger-regulating hormones — GLP-1, GIP and glucagon — rather than just one or two. That appears to have more potent effects on a person's appetite and satisfaction with food than other treatments. 

Skovronsky said the drug could serve patients who need additional weight loss or have other severe health conditions on top of obesity, such as arthritis knee pain. 

Novo Nordisk is racing to catch up: In March, it agreed to pay up to $2 billion for the rights to an early experimental drug from Chinese drugmaker United Laboratories International. The newly acquired treatment is a clear potential competitor to retatrutide because it similarly uses a three-pronged approach to promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar.

The industry has made strides toward improving drug access for patients, and executives expect that will continue. The cash price of Novo's pill is already the lowest seen on the market, at $149 for the starting dose and up to $299 for the higher doses. 

GLP-1 injections are roughly $1,000 per month before insurance and without recent cash discounts.

Both Pfizer's Bourla and Lilly's Skovronsky said upcoming Medicare coverage of obesity drugs should also move the needle with coverage. 

"Once the government starts covering it in Medicare, it probably will become more and more uncomfortable for employers to not — it's that societal pressure," Skovronsky said. 

He also pointed to an "activation of consumers," where patients are starting to call their employers and ask why their benefits don't cover obesity drugs. 

Drugmakers, researchers and scientists are also generating more data about the benefits of obesity drugs for health-care spending, which could help spur more employer coverage, Skovronsky said. 

"So for employers, is there less absenteeism? Is there better productivity? Is there better medical costs?" he said. "The data's coming in, and we're seeing more and more of that." 

In terms of the direct-to-consumer channel, Skovronsky said it may become the "fastest-growing segment" of the space given the recent push for drugmakers to launch cash offerings. 

Lilly was among the first companies to launch a direct-to-consumer platform in 2024 offering its obesity drug Zepbound at a discount, and Novo followed more than a year later. 

Bourla estimated that the direct-to-consumer channel already makes up 30% of the obesity and diabetes drug market in the U.S. It could become closer to 90% or more of that market abroad, he added. 

When asked about what the broader market will look like by 2030, Structure's Stevens said he hopes access and affordability are no longer issues.

"I'm okay with the cost dropping because, to me, this has always been about volume and really trying to address a very large unmet need globally itself," he said.

The sudden collapse last fall of a string of American companies backed by private credit has thrust a fast-growing and opaque corner of Wall Street lending into the spotlight.

Private credit, also known as direct lending, is a catch-all term for lending done by nonbank institutions. The practice has been around for decades but surged in popularity after post-2008 financial crisis regulations discouraged banks from serving riskier borrowers. 

That growth — from $3.4 trillion in 2025 to an estimated $4.9 trillion by 2029 — and the September bankruptcies of auto-industry firms Tricolor and First Brands have emboldened some prominent Wall Street figures to raise alarms about the asset class.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in October that problems in credit are rarely isolated: "When you see one cockroach, there are probably more." Billionaire bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach a month later accused private lenders of making "garbage loans" and predicted that the next financial crisis will come from private credit.

While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven't lifted completely.

Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital, as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR, still trade well below their recent highs.

Private credit is "lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it's growing really fast, which doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one," Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. 

Private credit's boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient.

Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. 

But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector's competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes.

After all, it's the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. 

"The double-edged sword of private credit" is that the lenders have "really strong incentives to monitor for problems," said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay.

"But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road," she said.

De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it's difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said.

"This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it's not a public market," she said. "We're not entirely sure if the valuations are correct."

In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero.

Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report.

And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis.

Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.

After investment bank Jefferies, JPMorgan and Fifth Third disclosed losses tied to the auto industry bankruptcies in the fall, investors learned the extent of this form of lending. Bank loans to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs, reached $1.14 trillion last year, per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

On Jan. 13, JPMorgan disclosed for the first time its lending to nonbank financial firms as part of its fourth-quarter earnings presentation. The category tripled to about $160 billion in loans in 2025 from about $50 billion in 2018.

Banks are now "back in the game" because deregulation under the Trump administration will free up capital for them to expand lending, Moody's Zandi said. That, combined with newer entrants in private credit, might lead to lower loan underwriting standards, he said.

"You're seeing a lot of competition now for the same type of lending," Zandi said. "If history is any guide, that's a concern ... because it probably argues for a weakening in underwriting and ultimately bigger credit problems down the road."

While neither Zandi nor de Fontenay said they saw an imminent collapse in the sector, as private credit continues to grow, so will its importance to the U.S. financial system.

When banks hit turbulence because of the loans they made, there is an established regulatory playbook, but future problems in the private realm might be harder to resolve, according to de Fontenay.

"It raises broader questions from the perspective of the safety and soundness of the overall system," de Fontenay said. "Are we going to know enough to know when there are signs of problems before they actually occur?"

Silver prices rose above $100 an ounce ​for the first time ever on Friday, while gold hit another record en route ‌to $5,000/oz as investors pile into safe-haven assets amid geopolitical turmoil and on expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts.

Spot silver jumped 4.5% to $100.49 an ounce.

"Silver should continue to benefit from many of the same forces supporting gold investment demand," said Philip Newman, a director at Metals Focus.

"Additional support will come from ‌ongoing tariff concerns and still low physical liquidity in the London market."

The metal ​has surged more than 200% in the past year, also driven by ongoing challenges in scaling up refining of the metal and a persistent supply shortage in the market.

"Traders pushed steadily for and ‍achieved the milestone $100 print; investors will wait to see if it can sustain through the close or will there be profit-taking from recent speculators," said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader.

Spot gold was 0.8% higher at $4,976.49 an ounce, after ⁠touching a record of $4,988.17 earlier. U.S. gold futures for February delivery added 1.3% to $4,978.60.

"Gold's role as ‍a haven and a diversifier in highly uncertain economic and political times is making it a necessity for strategic ‌portfolios. It's ‌more than a perfect storm, which doesn't last, it's a sign of fundamentally changing times," Wong added.

Since the start of 2026, friction between the U.S. and NATO over Greenland, concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence, and continued uncertainty over tariffs have driven a surge in demand for safe‑haven assets.

Central bank buying and a ⁠broader move away from ⁠the dollar have also ​underpinned gold's rise. On the U.S. policy front, the Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady at its January 27–28 meeting, but markets still expect two further rate cuts in the second half of 2026

 As a non‑yielding ‍asset, gold is often favoured during periods of low interest rates. Gold hit significant milestones like $3,000/oz and $4,000/oz for the first time last year in March and October respectively. Platinum hit a record high of $2,749.2 an ounce and was last up 4% at $2,735.00. 

his metal is attracting ​investor demand as a cheaper alternative to gold, HSBC said, ‍adding that it expected a structural deficit in this market to widen to 1.2 million ounces this year.

Palladium, meanwhile, jumped by ​4.3% to $2,002.22.

As the first cohort to enter the workforce with AI tools at the ready, many Gen Zers are torn.

Some 68% of these young professionals are anxious about AI automation, while 58% use AI tools at least three to four times a week, according to new research from think tank Oliver Wyman Forum. Nearly half of Gen Zers also say AI has already changed the caliber or type of work expected from them.

The findings, released earlier this week, are based on survey responses from 300,000 consumers and workers collected over the past five years, including 45,000 adult members of Gen Z. The most recent survey was taken last year.

Today's youngest workers are leaning into AI more so than their older counterparts, who are less anxious about the technology and use it less often, the study shows.

Compared with boomers, for example, Gen Zers are 1.7 times more likely to participate in AI training and 2.3 times more likely to report a productivity increase from using AI at work.

Young workers have good reason to be on high alert. At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, the CEOs of Google DeepMind and Anthropic each said they're starting to see AI minimize the need for some junior roles at their companies.

Anthropic's chief, Dario Amodei, also said at the conference that he hasn't changed his prediction from May, when he warned that AI could erase half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years.

Meanwhile, economist Marc Sumerlin said in November that companies may pause hiring young workers as they await the benefits of AI, and that ultimately the technology could lead to fewer jobs for recent graduates. Already, some companies have cited AI directly or indirectly as a reason for layoffs.

The grim outlook comes as the unemployment rate for recent college graduates in the US remained elevated at 5.3% in the third quarter, according to the latest analysis from the New York Federal Reserve.

Some corporate leaders are more optimistic about AI's impact on Gen Zers' careers.

Earlier this month, Figma CEO Dylan Field said on the podcast "In Good Company" that AI skills give young professionals a hiring advantage and that the technology won't wipe out entry-level jobs.

Similarly, Reid Hoffman, the venture capitalist who cofounded LinkedIn, said in a video posted to his YouTube channel in June that young people should use their familiarity with AI as a selling point when seeking work.

Some Gen Z workers say AI is helping them advance faster in their careers than they likely would have otherwise.

Lindsay Grippo, 28, credits the technology for helping her practice big-picture strategic thinking when drafting newsletters, blog posts, and other copy for her editor role at Codeword, a New York-based digital marketing agency. She views the AI's output as if it's from a more junior creative.

"I'm assessing how well it meets a project's goals, similar to how my manager might review my work," she said. "It is training me to think like a more senior-level creative."

Kyle Monson, a founding partner at Codeword, said the agency hasn't changed its hiring plans in response to AI, and that young employees like Grippo seem to be among the most proficient users of the technology.

A 46-year-old Gen Xer, Monson sees AI fluency as an advantage for young workers that makes him jealous. When he started his career, he said he had to do a lot of grunt work, such as data entry and note-taking, before he could advance.

AI can now do those kinds of tasks, allowing junior talent to tackle higher-value assignments, which he described as those that require making judgment calls.

"That's when your career really starts to take off," said Monson.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sreeja Apparaju, a 24-year-old machine learning engineer at Snap living in New York. Business Insider has verified Apparaju's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

When I decided to pivot from finance to tech in the fall of 2022, a couple of things were working against me.

I was less than a year from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with a double major in computer science and economics, and some large tech companies had announced major layoffs before the end of the year. That made me nervous about the demand for new hires.

I also didn't have any tech internships to fall back on. The prior summer, I'd interned as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, but I realized that finance didn't feel like the right path; I was more excited about the kind of work happening in tech.

It felt like unfortunate timing to be searching for tech roles — but at least I didn't have to job hunt alone.

Given these challenges, I was fortunate to have the support of a close circle of four friends who were applying to many of the same software engineering roles. When one of us heard from a recruiter or HR professional, we'd share their contact information with the group.

That's how I connected with a Palantir recruiter. Within a week of applying, I received an online assessment and was scheduled for an interview. I didn't end up getting the job, but I'm confident that getting on the recruiter's radar helped boost my chances.

In job searching, there can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of others. In my experience, though, sharing what we knew and helping each other out made the process easier — and faster — for all five of us.

Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was the motivation I needed to keep pushing for a job offer. One landed a role at Amazon, and another joined Salesforce. However, by the end of 2022, I was still looking.

In early January 2023, I came across an opening at Snap Inc. — the company behind Snapchat — for a software engineering role. Snap had already been on my radar as a company I thought could be a good fit. The cousin of one of my friends in my job search circle worked there, and I immediately reached out to them, obtained their referral, and submitted my application within a couple of days of the role being posted.

However, February came around, and I still hadn't heard back from Snap. I decided to take action; I got on LinkedIn and searched for a recruiter at the company who specialized in hiring new graduates.

My goal was to reach out via email rather than a LinkedIn message. Since I didn't have a LinkedIn Premium account, I was limited in the number of characters I could use — and I worried that sending a short message would come across as superficial.

I eventually found someone who appeared to be the recruiter, but their email wasn't listed anywhere. However, I did have the email of my referral contact, so I decided to guess the recruiter's email address based on the same email format — a strategy that had worked for me in the past. If I guessed incorrectly, I'd get an error message, and then I'd try a different version.

I could have asked my referral for the recruiter's email, but I was already deeply grateful for their time and referral, and I felt uncomfortable asking for more.

Fortunately, it didn't take long for me to send an email that appeared to go through. It included my résumé and an expression of interest in the role.

Within a few days, I received a response from the recruiter and was given an online assessment to complete. Shortly after, I did my first interview — a one-hour technical and behavioral interview with an engineer.

That was followed by a final interview round, which included four one-hour technical interviews, a 30-minute Q&A session, and a 30-minute break between the third and fourth rounds — about five hours total in a single day.

By March, I had received and accepted an offer for the software engineering role. I started at Snap in August 2023 and am now a machine learning engineer.

One thing I like about Snap is that it's smaller than companies like Meta or Google, which means I'm given a lot of agency and independence on the projects I work on.

My top pieces of advice for other job seekers are:

I'm really glad I listened to my gut and decided to pivot to tech when I started to sense during my finance internship that it wasn't the right path for me, rather than continuing down the same road.

Additionally, I'd recommend leaning on others, whether that's friends or your broader network. Given the tough job market, I've found that many people are willing to help if you reach out to them.

Shares of Adani Group companies fell between 5 to 13% on Friday as court filings showed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to send summons to founder Gautam Adani and nephew Sagar Adani on charges of bribery and fraud.  

Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, chair of India's Adani Group and one of the world's richest people, was indicted with seven other men in New York federal court in November 2024 on charges related to a massive bribery and fraud scheme.

The SEC has approached a U.S. District Judge, Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, seeking permission to issue a legal summons to Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani and the executive director of Adani Green Energy, Sagar Adani, according to court filings. CNBC has reached out to Adani Group and the U.S. SEC for comment.

Shares of Adani Green Energy ended the session nearly 14% lower, while those of the flagship company Adani Enterprises closed 10.7% lower on Friday. Shares of Adani Power dropped 5.7%.

The Adani Group executives are charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about their company's compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption practices, as they raised more than $3 billion in capital to fund those energy contracts.

India's Ministry of Law and Justice has twice refused last year to deliver the summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani under the Hague Convention, the SEC told the court. "The Ministry appeared to suggest that the SEC lacks authority to invoke the Hague Convention or seek service of the Summonses," it said.

Adani and several other defendants are accused of having paid Indian government officials more than $250 million in bribes to obtain solar energy supply contracts worth more than $2 billion in profits.

"I'll just let it die."

It was nearly six in the morning on a Tuesday in mid-2023, and Jimmy Donaldson, better known to the world as MrBeast, had been up for hours sending a stream of frustrated texts about MrBeast Burger, his nearly three-year-old food venture.

The YouTuber was furious with his business partners over customer complaints of undercooked burgers, and tensions had reached a breaking point.

He was done.

"As long as I have no control, I couldn't care less about it," Donaldson, who is known to be exacting and kill projects he doesn't believe are up to snuff, texted a friend.

These texts — revealed as evidence in a legal battle between MrBeast and his partner Virtual Dining Concepts that could go to trial later this year — represent a stark departure from the grand ambitions Donaldson had described for the brand just six months earlier. They are part of thousands of pages of contracts, messages, and depositions that show how the partnership imploded and reveal a confrontational side of Donaldson far different from his polished, smiley persona on camera.

MrBeast Burger, a largely delivery-only venture that sells burgers and fried chicken sandwiches, was meant to be a cornerstone of a food empire that would "run circles" around Nestlé, Donaldson said in a text exchange with his cousin in December 2022.

"I want to go down the food rabbit hole and become a god in this space," he wrote. "The king of healthy food innovation."

By mid-2023, the promising fast-food endeavor had become a colossal headache for Donaldson.

"I was getting destroyed online, and it was impacting how people viewed me, and it made me chronically depressed," he later said of the experience in a deposition.

The MrBeast Burger saga provides a cautionary tale for independent creators about the potential downsides of handing over control to third parties, and to brands about working with influencers who insist on tight creative oversight.

Plenty of celebrity-brand deals have been fruitful, but for every Kim Kardashian and Skims partnership, there's a Kanye West and Gap flameout. Each partnership brings its own nuances and complexities, and "virtual dining" businesses like MrBeast Burger come with built-in risks.

MrBeast Burger's food is made by various "ghost kitchen" partners ranging from 7-Eleven and Red Robin to local mom-and-pops. That meant low overhead and few barriers to entry for the brand, but the potential for uneven food quality.

For social media creators, whose livelihoods depend on their relationships with fans, reputation is paramount.

"The inherent risk is, when you do these licensing deals, the creator's name is the product," said Keith Gelman, founder of entertainment marketing agency Talent Partnership Advisors, who has negotiated partnerships with celebrities including Snoop Dogg and Reba McIntyre. "The audience doesn't distinguish between the operator and the creator."

MrBeast and VDC came from different business and cultural worlds.

Donaldson was 22 when MrBeast Burger launched in 2020. He'd soared to internet fame through videos involving cash giveaways and stunts like being buried alive. His business was mainly run by family members, a close circle of friends, and his management team at Night Media.

VDC's founder, Robert Earl, is a British expat restaurateur and TV personality best known for founding Planet Hollywood before moving with his son into the virtual dining business. Often seen sporting colorful shirts, Earl is at home with movie stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. YouTubers like MrBeast were not in his orbit when his son signed the influencer for a burger partnership.

MrBeast Burger launched in 2020 with a bang.

Donaldson set up a pop-up version of the restaurant near his hometown of Greenville, North Carolina, where he slid wads of cash into burger bags and handed out free iPads. He posted a video of the event, which crossed 200 million views on YouTube — a marketer's dream.

"We were beyond slammed and ill-prepared for his incredible following and demand that ensued," Earl told Business Insider shortly after MrBeast Burger's launch. "It was beyond any expectation."

After selling over 1 million sandwiches in just a couple of months, the company expanded to over 1,000 restaurants in 2021.

Donaldson was giddy with excitement about the possibilities. Early on, he began musing about merging MrBeast Burger with his candy brand Feastables and going public.

He imagined a $10 billion IPO — and he wanted an even bigger stake in the business.

"I'll get my equity, everyone who built the channel will get their equity, and the investors will get sick returns," he wrote in a text in late 2022.

Despite a hot start, there were early signs of trouble.

Customer complaints about product quality — including undercooked burgers, soggy fries, and incorrect orders — began appearing on social media almost immediately.

The worst part for Donaldson: There was little he could do about it.

Many of the hundreds of restaurants that sold MrBeast Burger's food operated independently, which meant tracking down any mistakes was like playing a game of whack-a-mole.

The problems MrBeast Burger ran into are common for ghost kitchen brands with many locations, Rich Shank, a senior principal at the food-service consultant and research firm Technomic, told Business Insider.

"There's just a lot of variances and nuances in the ghost kitchen space that make it challenging," he said, including standardizing ingredients, cooking processes, and other factors that differ from kitchen to kitchen.

VDC used a variety of methods to monitor quality issues, including working with the guest feedback platform Tattle to analyze customer satisfaction. It hired a third-party firm, Intellishop, to send "mystery shoppers" to order from various MrBeast Burger locations and see what they delivered. At one time, about 5% of orders were coming back wrong, more than double VDC's target rate of around 2%, according to an email from VDC CEO Stephanie Sollers.

Sollers said in a deposition that incorrect orders were an unfortunate feature of "most restaurant businesses." For Donaldson, the complaints were personal.

"People were ridiculing me and saying I didn't care," Donaldson said in a deposition.

Donaldson's lawsuit compared his philosophy to that of Yankee great Joe DiMaggio: "There is always a kid who may be seeing me for the first time. I owe him my best."

Donaldson's solution was the same one he applies to his YouTube content: "obsess over it" until he figures out an answer.

He proposed to VDC that each restaurant could submit a photo of every item to verify its quality before sending it to customers, and he wanted to hire someone to make quality control their obsession.

That kind of micromanaging wouldn't be "operationally prudent" and would be "a very quick way of having your line cooks want to quit," Shank said.

Undercooked food was not the only source of tension in MrBeast Burger land.

Donaldson accused VDC in his lawsuit of having used his name, image, and likeness in social posts and trademarks without his consent. He also told associates he wanted a larger ownership stake to gain control over MrBeast Burger's destiny and get out of what he called in a text a "fucked deal."

In November 2022, Donaldson made the first in a series of attempts to acquire nearly all of the company from VDC.

The stakes were high. Tech billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya, an investor in MrBeast's company, said in a 2023 email that the creator's media business was a break-even proposition that had "some enterprise value but not much."

"The real value is using it as a platform to launch CPG and other kinds of companies," Palihapitiya wrote. "We need to own at least 80% of each company."

The problem: Donaldson's company only owned 50% of MrBeast Burger, and the newest deal he'd signed made that agreement indefinite.

The negotiations, which dragged on for months, led to the complete fracturing of MrBeast's relationship with VDC.

During one meeting with VDC, Donaldson banged a clothes hanger on the table out of frustration. In another, the YouTuber claimed Earl showed him a desk drawer of lawsuits to make the point that he wasn't afraid of being sued. (Earl denied this.)

"Let's throw a grenade in the room of VDC," Donaldson wrote in one text as negotiations continued.

In the background, Donaldson took other steps to try to seize control. His lawyers shot a letter to VDC alleging breach of contract, and his team changed the passwords on the MrBeast Burger social accounts, cutting off VDC's access.

"Robert is dead to me once the deal closes," he texted his cousin during the negotiations.

"Fuck those pieces of shit," he wrote to a friend.

In June 2023, his rage went from texts to tweets when he fired off a string of posts about MrBeast Burger that would become central to VDC's countersuit.

MrBeast tweeted that if he had the ability to shut down MrBeast Burger, he "would have done so a long time ago sadly." He added that sometimes when you're young, "you sign a shit deal."

After Donaldson's tweets, one VDC investor pronounced the venture "dead and buried." VDC's complaint called it "sabotage."

Amid the feud, MrBeast Burger's ghost kitchen revenue fell from around $64 million in 2022 to about $45 million in 2023, court documents said.

As the negotiations stalled, Donaldson hatched a new plan. The first step was to go to court and request termination of the partnership and a ban on VDC using his name or image.

In a series of text messages, he called it "the new giga brain play."

The full plan went something like this: Win the VDC lawsuit, make a deal with Burger King or McDonald's for MrBeast Burger 2.0, do $100 million in sales, and eventually be bought out for $300 or $400 million.

The result, he wrote, would be "a legendary dub" — online speak for "win."

In July 2023, Donaldson's company sued VDC, portraying the YouTuber as a victim seeking to escape an unfair contract that had tarnished his reputation as a philanthropic, family-friendly entertainer.

VDC fired back soon after with its own lawsuit, saying Donaldson had walked away from a promising deal and failed to meet various contractual obligations, including appearances and promos.

"But for Donaldson's opportunism, disparagement, and interference, MrBeast Burger would have continued its explosive growth," VDC's suit says.

The MrBeast Burger brand lost customers and market partners after Donaldson went scorched earth, Earl said in a deposition. A deal with Red Robin fell through, and a plan to distribute the burgers in supermarkets, which could bring in $500 million a year, never materialized, he added.

Donaldson's lawsuit said that VDC had earned millions from the endeavor, while the creator hadn't earned "a dime." Earl said in a deposition that Donaldson's mother and financial manager instructed VDC to reinvest the money in the business.

Donaldson, meanwhile, moved on. By the time of the lawsuit, his focus had turned to Feastables, the candy line he launched in 2022.

"I'm never giving up control of Feastables so I can always do what's best for my fans," he said in a July 2023 tweet contrasting the business with MrBeast Burger. "Harsh lesson to learn."

So far, it's been a winning strategy. Feastables generated over $200 million in 2024 and was profitable, according to investor materials from early 2025 viewed by Business Insider.

"I just obsess over the product," he said during a deposition when asked why Feastables had been successful.

Donaldson has taken more control of his company, Beast Industries. The company, now some 450 employees strong, is mostly centralized in Greenville. Donaldson made Silicon Valley vet Jeff Housenbold his in-house CEO and parted ways with his external management company.

In large part thanks to Feastables, Beast Industries was valued at about $5 billion in a 2024 capital raise.

Donaldson's plans for Beast Industries will again put control at odds with expansion.

His road map includes launching in new categories like mobile phones and financial services — with help from $200 million in fresh funding from a crypto company — that will require bringing on partners.

In investor pitch materials from early 2025, Beast Industries said its plan for Beast Financial was to partner with a "scaled fintech partner to white label a suite of products," tailored to MrBeast's audience and supported by financial literacy content. Partnership is simply a necessity for creators with big business ambitions.

"There's no way that a lot of these creators could just on their own build and run a hundred million or billion dollar brand," Eric Bogard, CEO of talent-firm UnderCurrent Management, which operates a product division called Viral Goods, told Business Insider. "You absolutely need a third party."

As for MrBeast Burger, it marches on amid the winding legal fight, long after Donaldson stopped promoting it. You can still order his Beast Style crinkle-cut fries and smash burgers from hundreds of ghost kitchens around the world — from Singapore to Switzerland — according to its website, which still features photos of a beaming Donaldson.

MrBeast's zombie brand lives on, even if it's dead to its creator.

Two things can be true of Tesla's Full Self-Driving: It's an impressive piece of technology, and it still doesn't go far enough.

FSD is Tesla's big bet. CEO Elon Musk and his most bullish investors believe that autonomy will help take Tesla's valuation to new heights.

Today, FSD (Supervised), as the name suggests, is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that requires constant human supervision. The promise is to advance FSD enough to make the system unsupervised — meaning the driver behind the wheel can take their eyes off the road or even fall asleep. Tesla gave a glimpse of this future on Thursday, launching Robotaxi rides in Austin without a safety monitor in the vehicle.

The gap between what the tech can do and what it can't is where my experience landed.

I recently demoed a 2025 Tesla Model 3 that came installed with FSD v14.2.1, the latest software version available at the time.

With my friend riding shotgun, I drove around the East Bay Area, taking the Model 3 through various road environments, including a university campus, parking lots, and the highway, on a clear Saturday afternoon.

FSD proved to be a highly capable driver — so much so that it has spoiled me into wishing that I didn't have to constantly babysit the system.

I drove the Model 3 for a few hours around Berkeley and Alameda. The drive was a little less than 100 miles through a wide range of driving conditions — highly dense urban streets, university roads, canyons, and the highway.

One was when FSD was cautious around pedestrians on Berkeley's campus. I recall a student who wasn't using the crosswalk but was close to it, walking across the road. FSD came to a rolling stop rather than an abrupt halt, which is exactly how I would've handled the situation.

The system also managed to navigate the university's roads and perform a three-point turn when I stopped the car and added a new destination.

FSD's "Mad Max" mode is impressive in the way it lane-changed around a few cars that were moving too slowly on the highway for my taste. Calling it "Mad Max" feels a little gratuitous, but I appreciate that a more urgent driving mode is available.

At no point did I need to disengage FSD or question the system enough to take over the steering wheel. Tesla FSD is a smooth and cautious driver.

My friend, who doesn't actively follow tech news or everything Musk says as much as I do, described the experience like being in a "spaceship." That wasn't necessarily a compliment from his end — he likes older cars — but it's exactly how Musk intended the Tesla experience to be.

I gained enough trust in FSD that I wanted to test the system's limits by closing my eyes while driving down University Avenue — a fairly busy thoroughfare in Berkeley.

The car kept driving for a bit, but I was inevitably warned to pay attention to the road.

As good as FSD is, the technology doesn't allow you to completely disengage mentally. It was like having an itch that's just not quite fully satisfied. The technology is — or at least feels — so, so close.

People who swear by FSD like to say that the system is a game changer, lifting the burden of driving off their shoulders.

I agree that driving can be a tedious chore. I immediately think about the drive between San Francisco and Los Angeles that I do a few times a year. It's about 400 miles and can easily be a 7-hour drive depending on traffic.

The problem isn't that it's hard in a problem-solving sense. The drive is mostly a straight shot. The problem is that I have to stay awake. I can listen to music, put on an entertaining podcast, or get 200 mg of caffeine from a can of Celsius, but the drive is so monotonous that I could easily doze off while on the 5 highway.

I obviously can't do that yet with Tesla FSD, which makes me wonder: How significant is the difference, really, between the cognitive effort it takes to manually drive from SF to LA than having to supervise an ADAS?

FSD feels like the burden of driving was just shifted away from my hands and feet to my attention.

Musk said an FSD (Supervised) is now capable enough for drivers to take their eyes off the road in certain conditions without triggering the warning system.

That would be useful only if Tesla were to take full responsibility when I get pulled over by the police.

A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

I'm likely spoiled because I know what full autonomy feels like.

I have constant access to Waymo. I've filed an entire story inside a robotaxi and used it several times to take me home after a night of drinking.

That's the bar I want Tesla FSD to reach and exceed: a system capable enough to let me sleep behind the wheel on any road, meaning no geofences, and one in which Tesla will take accountability for any issues that arise while FSD is unsupervised.

I'm also thinking about folks like David Moss, who said he broke a record for driving more than 11,000 miles on FSD without touching the steering wheel. Moss told me how FSD could be a life-changer for his father, who is legally blind and unable to drive. If Tesla's ADAS can reliably — and legally — put people like Moss' dad behind the wheel, I can see Full Self-Driving going from a nice-to-have to a need-to-have.

Tesla's decision to remove the safety monitor from some of its robotaxis suggests the company could be close.

For now, it's a tease.

India's largest airline, Indigo, that cancelled more than 2,500 flights within days last month causing massive disruptions, reported a 78% drop in profit in the December quarter, sending its shares down more than 3%.

The company, which reported results after market close on Thursday, made a provision of 5.8 billion rupees ($63 million) toward compensation following flight disruptions in December. 

The larger impact on its earnings, however, was from a one-time charge owed to the implementation of new labor code and forex losses, together amounting to about 20 billion rupees. 

The lack of progress on the U.S.-India trade deal has hurt investor confidence, contributing to capital outflows, and has weighed on the rupee, making it Asia's worst performing currency last year — down about 5%. 

The currency was last trading at 91.52 and experts predict it to slip further to 92 rupee per dollar level by end of March, which could spell more trouble for forex-exposed businesses including Indigo.

The March quarter for the airline is "expected to be weaker" despite a 10% rise in available seat kilometers, or ASK, according to a report by Jefferies on Thursday. ASK is a key metric for measuring passenger capacity.

The brokerage added that the airline will see a "moderation" in passenger revenue per available seat kilometer (PRASK) and increase in cost per available seat kilometer as the company "continues to add aircraft."

Jefferies maintains a buy rating on the stock with a target price of 6,140 rupees per share.

Airlines in India face pressure on both costs and revenue fronts as a majority of the airlines get nearly 65% of their revenue from domestic travel, for which passengers pay in Indian rupees, but most of the costs are in dollars.

Indigo is adding more capacity because they need to grow, but the next 6-12 months will be tough, as we expect the rupee to weaken further and fuel costs to rise, said Mark Martin, founder and CEO of aviation consulting firm Martin Consulting.

He told CNBC that Indigo may need to fly on more international routes to improve its dollar earnings. This was also hinted at in the company's earnings call, with the management saying that new seat additions will be skewed toward international routes.

Labor reforms in India, which have expanded the scope and eligibility of social security benefits for employees, also weighed on Indigo's earnings as it recognized one-time charges of 9.7 billion rupees. 

Several large Indian companies, such as Tata Consultancy Services and ICICI Bank, have reported a one-time hit on earnings due to the labor reforms during the December quarter. 

In November, the Indian government announced reforms, consolidating 29 separate labor laws into four comprehensive codes, walking a tightrope between balancing business interests and employee welfare.

Under these codes, fixed term or contract employees will now qualify for benefits available to permanent workers, including leave, medical, and social security.

However, this was not the only change in government regulation that impacted Indigo during the last quarter.

In November last year, government implemented flight duty time limitation norms under which airlines were mandated to operate fewer late-night flights and rest time for crew was increased from 36 hours to 48 hours.

In the first week of December, Indigo cancelled thousands of flights, blaming it on the changes to the pilot rest policy. Early December was the "the most challenging weeks" in Indigo's history, said Pieter Elbers, chief executive of the Indigo.

Last week, India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered the airline to pay a penalty of 222 million rupees in connection with the operational disruptions, which is part of the one-time provisions. 

Currently, Indigo is operating 2,100-2,200 daily flights, said Elbers, who had come under fire following the disruption in December, adding that the airline will be able to comply with the government's flight duty time limitation norms by February.

Indigo served 124 million customers in 2025, up 9% on year, according to its statement.

Amid the recent uproar over U.S. President Donald Trump's aim of annexing Greenland, it's easy to lose track of another geopolitical tension that's been raging on the European continent for nearly 4 years: the Russia-Ukraine war.

On Friday, Ukrainian, Russian and U.S. ambassadors will hold trilateral talks in the United Arab Emirates that will last until Saturday. 

Notably, Europe won't be involved in the meetings. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Thursday accused Europe of being "lost" and trying to persuade Trump to help them, rather than uniting for their own defense.

On another front, Denmark on Thursday signaled it was open to talks with the U.S. over its "Golden Dome" missile defense plan, which is part of the "deal" regarding Greenland that U.S. President Donald Trump had announced a day earlier.

But Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that he doesn't know what's in the agreement — a response shared by many analysts and political watchers.

Ed Price, senior non-resident fellow at New York University, told CNBC on Thursday that striking a deal "requires two people to tango," describing Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, as "a monologue not a dialogue."

Still, Trump walking back on his tariff threats on EU countries and toning down the rhetoric on Greenland has lifted markets globally, reviving talks of TACO — "Trump Always Chickens Out" — trade.

The U.S. president also signed his Gaza "Board of Peace" into being on Thursday — and withdrew his invitation to Canada to join the board, conceived as a means to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after a two-year war with Israel.  

There's a slight dip in the temperature around Greenland, but geopolitical heat persists elsewhere.

— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger, Anniek Bao, Lucy Handley and Hugh Leask contributed to this report.

Trump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Canada. The move comes after Canadian Prime Minster Mark Carney gave an address in Davos warning against economic coercion by the world's superpowers. Carney said last week he intended to join the board.

TikTok forms U.S. joint venture. This means the video-sharing app will be allowed to continue operating in the U.S. The new venture, which will run as an "independent entity," will be headed by Adam Presser, who has been serving as TikTok's head of operations and trust and safety. 

The Bank of Japan raises economic forecast. Economic expansion in the fiscal year ending March 2026 is expected to hit 0.9%, up from the 0.7% estimated in October. The BOJ also held interest rates steady. Meanwhile, inflation in December cooled, and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi dissolved parliament on Friday.

U.S. stocks extend gains. On Thursday, leading U.S. indexes climbed for a second day after Trump called off Europe tariffs. Asia-Pacific markets rose Friday, but tech stocks, such as SoftBank Group and Lasertec, fell after Intel shares plunged in extended trading.

[PRO] Stocks that look poised to surge. CNBC Pro screened for names that have been upgraded to buy or overweight by at least three more analysts since the end of last year. A major trading platform and Wall Street bank showed up on the list.

Nvidia's Huang to visit China as AI chip sales stall

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang plans to visit China in the coming days ahead of the mid-February Lunar New Year, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC. Huang is expected to attend an Nvidia company party in Beijing on Monday, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to speak about the trip.

The trip comes as questions persist over the U.S. chip giant's ability to sell in the Chinese market, which once accounted for at least one-fifth of revenue from Nvidia's data center business.

Chinese tech giant Xiaomi saw its shares pop over 2% in trading on Friday after it announced a stock buyback program worth up to HK$2.5 billion ($321 million). 

The repurchase plan comes as the electric vehicle and smartphone maker looks to reassure investors amid intensifying competition, rising component costs and recent product safety concerns. 

Despite Friday's gains, Xiaomi's shares are down over 8% so far this year, reflecting sustained pressure on its valuation.

The company has regularly repurchased shares in recent years, including 4 million shares for HK$152 million on Jan. 13.

Critics of stock buybacks argue that the practice can boost share prices without improving a company's underlying business. They say buybacks divert cash from other investments, such as employee pay, factory expansion, job creation and innovation.

Xiaomi's latest buyback begins Jan. 23 and will be executed on the open market, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals, according to a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange late Thursday. 

The Beijing-based firm is one of China's largest consumer technology companies, with businesses in smartphones, electric vehicles and smart home devices. 

Analysts say the stock has faced pressure recently as a looming memory chip shortage threatens to push up component costs for its consumer devices, particularly smartphones. 

"[The shortage] has caused margin compression for smartphone manufacturers and a number of independent industry forecasters have lowered their outlook for smartphones," said Dan Baker, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.

The memory shortage is only expected to worsen this year, as manufacturers continue to focus on the growing memory demands of the AI industry, diverting capacity from electronics manufacturers.

"2026 is going to be challenging not just for Xiaomi but for many Chinese [Original Equipment Manufacturers] as domestic Android players remain most vulnerable to chip shortages," said Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. 

Last year, Xiaomi's shares had also faced pressure following reports of accidents involving its vehicles that went viral on social media. More broadly, the company has been affected by an ongoing price war in China's EV market, which has weighed on margins across the sector. 

Regarding its EV business, Kyna Wong, a China technology analyst at Citi Research, said that investors had also been disappointed by Xiaomi's modest 550,000-unit vehicle delivery target for 2026. 

She added that margins on the company's vehicle sales are likely to trend down due to changes to Beijing's EV subsidy policies in 2026. 

Meanwhile, Xiaomi has been investing heavily in longer-term initiatives, including an internal semiconductor division. Last year, the company committed at least 50 billion yuan over the next 10 years, starting in 2025, to develop its own chips.

Xiaomi also plans to expand its electric vehicles business globally over the next few years, following the launch of its premium SU7 Ultra.

Elon Musk said Tesla will raise subscription prices for its Full Self-Driving software as it gets better, and it could cost more than $100.

The Tesla CEO said in an early Friday X post, "I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD's capabilities improve."

"The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD)," he said. 

Tesla's FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that aims to enable its cars to be fully self-driving.

Customers can currently buy the system for $8,000 on a one-time basis, per the vehicle's listing on Tesla's website. However, this option will no longer be available from February 14.

The executive was responding to a post about Tesla killing its separate Autopilot service in the US.

Most of Tesla's vehicles previously came with Autopilot as standard. The software included traffic-aware cruise control, which maintains a set driving speed and slows down automatically in response to traffic, as well as features like Autosteer, which allowed Tesla's cars to automatically follow lane markings.

As of Friday, Tesla now only offers Traffic-Aware Cruise Control as standard, according to the company's website.

The move attracted backlash from some Tesla fans on X, with several pointing out that rival brands like Toyota offer lane centering technology as standard on many models.

It comes as Tesla pushes to drive subscriptions for FSD, which Musk has described as a critical part of the company's future.

Adoption of the technology has been sluggish, with Tesla's CFO telling investors in October that only around 12% of Tesla owners are paying for the assisted-driving feature.

Boosting FSD subscriptions is also a crucial part of Musk's massive Tesla pay package. Getting to 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions is one of the key milestones the Tesla CEO needs to hit to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.

Tesla currently makes it clear that FSD requires driver supervision. The company announced Thursday that it had begun offering fully autonomous rides without a safety monitor in its robotaxi service in Austin, and Musk has said that he expects "unsupervised" FSD to massively boost demand for Tesla's vehicles.

The automaker has faced regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits over its rollout of FSD and Autopilot. The US's auto regulator launched an investigation in October following reports that Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD were running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.

Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

TikTok's US workers can finally breathe a sigh of relief.

The company announced Thursday that it has closed a deal to spin off parts of its US business in a new joint venture with an investor group.

"The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8, and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the US," the company said.

Adam Presser is leading the new venture, according to the company's announcement. Presser has worked at TikTok for nearly four years, most recently leading operations and trust and safety. The venture's seven-man, majority-American board includes TikTok's CEO Shou Chew.

The agreement should keep the US government off its back as TikTok's parent, ByteDance, now owns just under 20% of the new US venture. That ownership stake meets a divestment requirement set by a 2024 US sell-or-ban law targeting TikTok and other apps with owners based in countries like China, which the US has deemed a foreign adversary.

TikTok's new US owners include tech company Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, each of which owns 15% of the new venture. ByteDance will own around 20% of the entity, and affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will own around 30%, according to a December memo from Chew. Other investors include Michael Dell's family office and a venture run by the partners of growth investor Dragoneer.

What comes next is less clear.

While Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake will serve as managing investors in the new US joint venture, their focus will be on areas such as data security. Key commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will remain with ByteDance.

The company began splitting up its US staff into different legal entities in January based on whether their work would remain under ByteDance's purview, Business Insider first reported.

Following the announcement, President Donald Trump said in a Thursday night Truth Social post that he was "so happy to have helped in saving TikTok."

He said the deal had reached a "very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion."

The deal has been in the works for a year.  At the start of Trump's presidency, TikTok went dark for its 170 million US users, but came back online soon after when Trump promised to delay a ban.

Since then, he has been pushing back the divest-or-ban deadline, saying tech leaders like Elon Musk and Oracle's CTO, Larry Ellison, could buy the app. He also floated giving China a tariff reduction if it cut a deal on TikTok.

OpenAI has pulled in a billion-dollar month from something other than ChatGPT.

Sam Altman said in a post on X on Thursday that OpenAI added more than $1 billion in annual recurring revenue in the past month "just from our API business."

"People think of us mostly as ChatGPT, but the API team is doing amazing work!" the OpenAI CEO wrote.

OpenAI's API enables other companies and developers to embed its models into their own products, from internal productivity software to coding tools.

Many of Silicon Valley's high-profile startups rely on OpenAI's models as core infrastructure. Perplexity uses OpenAI's models to power parts of its AI search and answer engine. Harvey, one of the fastest-growing legal tech startups, is built on OpenAI's models to assist lawyers with research and drafting.

Altman's comments underscore how OpenAI's infrastructure business is emerging as a key growth engine, even as the company faces massive costs for computing power and data centers.

Those pressures have pushed OpenAI to look beyond consumer subscriptions.

Last week, the company said it is gearing up to test ads inside ChatGPT as it faces about $1.4 trillion in spending commitments over the coming years.

It's a notable shift for a company that once treated ads as taboo. Less than two years ago, Altman said advertising was a "last resort."

"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me," Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. "I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model."

Since then, Altman has struck a more open tone. In June, he said on OpenAI's podcast that he wasn't "totally against" ads, though he stressed it would need to be approached carefully.

Earlier this week, OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, raised the idea of "licensing models" that would let the company share in downstream sales if a customer's product succeeds.

"Let's say in drug discovery, if we licensed our technology, you have a breakthrough. The drug takes off, and we get a licensed portion of all its sales," Friar said in an episode of "The OpenAI Podcast" published Monday.

On January 13, the Maryland Office of Financial Regulation finalized regulations implementing Maryland's virtual currency kiosk statute. The rules establish a detailed framework governing the registration and operation of virtual currency kiosk operators and individual kiosks across the state, building on statutory requirements that apply beginning January 1, 2026.

The regulations convert the statute's registration mandate into prescriptive operational requirements. In addition to outlining registration mechanics, the framework places significant emphasis on consumer protection measures intended to address fraud risks associated with kiosk-based virtual currency transactions.

The finalized rules include several core components:

Putting It Into Practice: Maryland's finalized kiosk rules reflect a broader state-level trend toward treating virtual currency kiosks more like traditional money services infrastructure (previously discussed here). Companies operating across multiple states should also monitor whether other jurisdictions adopt similar kiosk-specific regulatory models in 2026.

Oops, something went wrong

Swiss banking giant UBS Group AG will open up crypto investing to some of its private banking clients, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg. 

Moves by UBS tend to align with the interests and demand from some of the world's wealthiest banking clients, because the bank is the world's largest wealth manager. It oversaw roughly $4.7 trillion worth of assets as of September for high net-worth and ultra-high net-worth clients.

The core business focuses on private banking and advisory services for wealthy individuals and their families, rather than mass retail banking.

UBS's clout grew significantly in 2023 when Swiss authorities forced the bank to merge with Credit Suisse after years of scandals had eroded confidence in the 167-year-old lender. In 2021, Credit Suisse experienced two big failures: A $5.5 billion loss after the Archegos Capital family office imploded, and a $10 billion loss when Greensill Capital supply-chain financing was frozen.

When the rushed deal was done, UBS saw its assets under management jump by roughly $1.5 trillion almost overnight.

The unnamed sources said the bank is still working on the final decision on how to roll out crypto access for clients. When it does roll out, the source said, crypto trading would be available to select clients in Switzerland to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum. After that, it might then be rolled out to the Asia-Pacific region.

The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading for $90,132 after having fallen nearly 5% in the past week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. And Ethereum has dipped to $2,967 after having sunk 10% since last week.

Switzerland has become one of Europe's more accommodating jurisdictions for crypto businesses. In November, the Swiss National Bank quietly increased its Bitcoin exposure.

And some U.S. firms saw Switzerland as a safe haven after two crypto-friendly U.S. banks were shut down in 2022—Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank. Swiss banks told Reuters at the time that there had been an uptick in inbound requests from U.S. companies looking abroad for banking partners.

AI CEOs Transformed Davos: The Stunning Tech Takeover of the World Economic Forum

DAVOS, SWITZERLAND — January 23, 2026: The World Economic Forum's annual meeting underwent a dramatic transformation this year as artificial intelligence executives and conversations dominated the Alpine gathering, fundamentally reshaping what has traditionally been a forum for global economic and political dialogue. The shift was immediately visible along the Promenade, where technology companies replaced traditional financial institutions in prominent storefronts, signaling a profound change in both the event's atmosphere and substantive discussions. This year's Davos meeting saw AI topics consistently overshadow traditional WEF pillars including climate change mitigation, global poverty reduction, and geopolitical stability talks, marking what many observers describe as a pivotal moment in the forum's five-decade history.

The physical transformation of Davos began with prominent storefront takeovers by technology giants. Meta and Salesforce established highly visible installations along the main promenade, creating immersive experiences that drew constant crowds of attendees. Meanwhile, AI company executives occupied center stage in both formal sessions and informal networking events, fundamentally altering the conversation dynamics throughout the week. These leaders didn't merely participate in discussions—they actively shaped the agenda with public criticisms of international trade policies, warnings about potential AI investment bubbles, and bold predictions about the industry's trajectory.

Observers noted that the traditional balance between public and private sector voices shifted noticeably toward technology leadership. Where previous forums featured equal representation between government officials and corporate executives, this year's conversations frequently centered on how AI development should proceed rather than whether it should be regulated. The change reflected both the technology's rapid advancement and the substantial economic influence now concentrated in the hands of AI companies and their leadership teams.

Session topics at Davos 2026 revealed the depth of this transformation. While climate change and poverty reduction remained on the official agenda, attendance and engagement metrics showed significantly higher participation in AI-focused discussions. Panel sessions exploring artificial intelligence ethics, development frameworks, and economic impacts consistently reached maximum capacity, while some traditional development sessions saw reduced attendance. This substantive shift extended beyond session selection to include the nature of conversations themselves, with AI safety, alignment research, and computational governance emerging as dominant themes where macroeconomic policy once prevailed.

While AI executives transformed Davos discussions in Switzerland, parallel developments in Silicon Valley highlighted the industry's extraordinary momentum. AI startup Humans& secured a $480 million seed funding round despite having no commercial product on the market—a development that would have been unthinkable just three years earlier. The company's founding team includes former employees from Anthropic, Google, and xAI, lending credibility to their vision for “social intelligence” artificial intelligence systems. This funding round represents one of the largest seed investments in technology history and signals investor confidence in AI's long-term potential despite current market uncertainties.

The Humans& funding exemplifies a broader trend in AI investment patterns. Venture capital firms increasingly prioritize founding team credentials and technological vision over traditional metrics like revenue or user growth. This shift reflects both the extraordinary capital requirements of AI development and investor belief that early positioning in foundational AI technologies will yield substantial returns as the market matures. However, some Davos participants expressed concerns about this approach, noting that similar investment patterns preceded previous technology bubbles.

The transformation of Davos conversations carries significant implications for the global AI industry. First, the increased visibility of AI executives at traditionally policy-focused forums suggests growing recognition that technological development cannot be separated from broader societal considerations. Second, the substantial funding flowing to pre-product AI companies indicates investor belief that current development cycles justify unprecedented risk-taking. Third, the public nature of policy criticisms from AI leadership marks a departure from previous corporate approaches to regulation, suggesting more direct engagement with governance processes moving forward.

Several specific developments emerged from Davos discussions that will likely shape the industry throughout 2026:

Technology analysts observing the Davos transformation note several important considerations. First, the shift toward AI discussions reflects genuine technological progress rather than mere hype—foundational models have reached capabilities that justify serious policy attention. Second, the physical presence of technology companies along the Promenade represents strategic positioning for influence, not just marketing. Third, the substantial funding flowing to pre-revenue AI companies indicates investor belief that current development windows create unique opportunities for first-mover advantages in what may become defining technologies of the coming decade.

Industry observers also highlight potential risks associated with these developments. The concentration of both conversation and investment in artificial intelligence could divert attention from other critical global challenges. Additionally, the substantial funding for companies without products raises questions about investment discipline and potential market corrections. Finally, the increased corporate influence on policy discussions at traditionally multilateral forums may complicate efforts to establish balanced governance frameworks that consider diverse stakeholder perspectives.

The 2026 transformation continues a longer-term trend of increasing technology presence at the World Economic Forum. Technology companies first gained prominence at Davos during the late 1990s dot-com era, though their influence diminished following the 2000 market correction. A second wave emerged during the 2010s with the rise of social media and platform companies, though these firms typically participated within broader business delegations rather than as primary conversation drivers. The current AI-focused transformation represents a third and more substantial wave, with technology executives not just attending but actively shaping both formal and informal agendas.

This historical progression reveals important patterns about technology's integration into global economic discussions. Initially treated as a specialized sector, technology has gradually moved toward the center of economic thinking as its transformative potential has become increasingly apparent across industries. The 2026 emphasis on artificial intelligence specifically reflects recognition that AI represents not just another technological advancement but potentially a fundamental shift in economic production, labor markets, and innovation processes—topics that naturally align with the World Economic Forum's mission to address global challenges.

The 2026 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos demonstrated how thoroughly AI CEOs transformed the gathering from its traditional focus on macroeconomic policy and global challenges to a technology-forward conference centered on artificial intelligence's development and implications. This transformation manifested physically through storefront takeovers, substantively through conversation dominance, and financially through parallel Silicon Valley developments like the record Humans& funding round. While the long-term implications remain uncertain, the Davos shift clearly signals artificial intelligence's arrival as a primary concern for global economic leadership—a development that will likely influence investment patterns, regulatory approaches, and technological development throughout the coming year and beyond. The AI industry's growing influence at traditionally policy-focused forums suggests we have entered a new phase in technology's relationship with global governance, one where technical development and societal consideration increasingly intersect at the highest levels of economic discussion.

Q1: How exactly did AI CEOs transform Davos in 2026?AI executives transformed Davos through physical presence along the Promenade, domination of session topics and attendance, public policy criticisms, and shifting conversation priorities away from traditional WEF focuses toward artificial intelligence development, safety, and governance discussions.

Q2: What was significant about the Humans& funding round mentioned in Davos discussions?The $480 million seed round for pre-product AI startup Humans& represents one of the largest seed investments in technology history and signals investor confidence in founding teams with strong research credentials from companies like Anthropic, Google, and xAI, despite the absence of traditional metrics like revenue or user growth.

Q3: Did traditional Davos topics like climate change disappear completely?Traditional topics remained on the official agenda but received significantly less attention and engagement compared to AI-focused sessions. Climate change and poverty reduction discussions continued but no longer dominated conversations as they have in previous years.

Q4: What are the potential risks of AI dominating global economic forums?Potential risks include diversion of attention from other critical challenges, excessive influence by corporate perspectives on governance discussions, investment patterns that may not reflect sustainable market fundamentals, and reduced diversity of viewpoints in policy formulation.

Q5: How does the 2026 Davos transformation compare to previous technology presences at the forum?The 2026 transformation represents a more substantial shift than previous technology waves. Unlike dot-com era or social media company presence, AI executives in 2026 actively shaped both formal and informal agendas rather than simply participating in existing discussions, reflecting the technology's perceived fundamental importance to economic futures.

AI CEOs Transformed Davos: The Stunning Tech Takeover of the World Economic Forum

DAVOS, SWITZERLAND — January 23, 2026: The World Economic Forum's annual meeting underwent a dramatic transformation this year as artificial intelligence executives and conversations dominated the Alpine gathering, fundamentally reshaping what has traditionally been a forum for global economic and political dialogue. The shift was immediately visible along the Promenade, where technology companies replaced traditional financial institutions in prominent storefronts, signaling a profound change in both the event's atmosphere and substantive discussions. This year's Davos meeting saw AI topics consistently overshadow traditional WEF pillars including climate change mitigation, global poverty reduction, and geopolitical stability talks, marking what many observers describe as a pivotal moment in the forum's five-decade history.

The physical transformation of Davos began with prominent storefront takeovers by technology giants. Meta and Salesforce established highly visible installations along the main promenade, creating immersive experiences that drew constant crowds of attendees. Meanwhile, AI company executives occupied center stage in both formal sessions and informal networking events, fundamentally altering the conversation dynamics throughout the week. These leaders didn't merely participate in discussions—they actively shaped the agenda with public criticisms of international trade policies, warnings about potential AI investment bubbles, and bold predictions about the industry's trajectory.

Observers noted that the traditional balance between public and private sector voices shifted noticeably toward technology leadership. Where previous forums featured equal representation between government officials and corporate executives, this year's conversations frequently centered on how AI development should proceed rather than whether it should be regulated. The change reflected both the technology's rapid advancement and the substantial economic influence now concentrated in the hands of AI companies and their leadership teams.

Session topics at Davos 2026 revealed the depth of this transformation. While climate change and poverty reduction remained on the official agenda, attendance and engagement metrics showed significantly higher participation in AI-focused discussions. Panel sessions exploring artificial intelligence ethics, development frameworks, and economic impacts consistently reached maximum capacity, while some traditional development sessions saw reduced attendance. This substantive shift extended beyond session selection to include the nature of conversations themselves, with AI safety, alignment research, and computational governance emerging as dominant themes where macroeconomic policy once prevailed.

While AI executives transformed Davos discussions in Switzerland, parallel developments in Silicon Valley highlighted the industry's extraordinary momentum. AI startup Humans& secured a $480 million seed funding round despite having no commercial product on the market—a development that would have been unthinkable just three years earlier. The company's founding team includes former employees from Anthropic, Google, and xAI, lending credibility to their vision for “social intelligence” artificial intelligence systems.

An inactive Ethereum whale has just re-entered the trading scene, withdrawing over $15 million worth of ETH in just a single day. Considering Ethereum's slow price growth over the past few months and the whale's sudden appearance despite being dormant for months, there could be a possibility of insider trading.

A sudden $15.14 million Ethereum transaction has caught the crypto market's attention, with the move either driven by insider knowledge or simple strategic positioning. According to data from blockchain analytics platform, Onchain Lens, the transfer shifted approximately 5,099 ETH from a dormant wallet address on Kraken into active circulation on Thursday, January 22. 

Based on on-chain records, the whale, identified by the address ‘0x761F2F,' has remained inactive in the market for more than three months. The last few times the whale was actively moving in the market were when it executed a series of stablecoin and HYPE transactions. The anonymous whale had initiated multiple million-dollar trades in UETH, USDT, and USDC. Meanwhile, the HYPE transactions were primarily token burns. 

After withdrawing 5,099 ETH from Kraken, Arkham Intelligence reported that the whale had transferred the ETH to Lido Finance, converting it into 5,100 STETH. While there is currently no evidence of insider trading, the timing of the transaction raises questions, especially given Ethereum's muted price action over the past few months and the mounting selling pressure from large scale holders. 

Typically, insider trading in crypto occurs when individuals with non-public information make large transactions ahead of major market events that could influence market price. Currently, there has been no spike in Ethereum's price, nor any major news that could suddenly affect its movements. In fact, ETH continues to trade lower, down by roughly 1.7% over the past 24 hours. Its daily trading volume is also down by 34.89%, signaling reduced confidence among traders and investors. 

While dormant large-scale players are suddenly re-entering the market, some active whales remain bullish on Ethereum's long-term prospects despite its ongoing downtrend. According to well-known market analyst Max Crypto, an anonymous whale has just opened a $202 million long position in ETH with 15x leverage. 

The scale of the trade is extraordinary considering Ethereum's recent volatility. It shows strong confidence in the cryptocurrency's future price action and its potential to overcome its ongoing downtrend. Notably, the position has a liquidation price of $2,495, meaning that if ETH falls to that level, the trade could be forcibly closed by the crypto exchange, resulting in substantial losses for the whale. 

Market participants are closely watching the whales' positioning, with some calling it a brave but chaotic bet. Others have even speculated that the position may have been taken based on insider information, fueling discussions about potential market moves and a possible bullish turnaround for ETH.

Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and serves as the foundational infrastructure for decentralized applications, smart contracts, decentralized finance, and non-fungible tokens. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a store of value and settlement layer, Ethereum operates as a programmable blockchain that allows developers to build and deploy applications without centralized intermediaries. This utility driven design makes Ethereum both a technology platform and a financial asset, which often causes its price behavior to reflect a blend of macro risk sentiment and internal network developments.

From a macro perspective, Ethereum remains sensitive to global liquidity conditions, real interest rates, and overall risk appetite. Periods of easing financial conditions and expanding liquidity tend to support higher valuations across crypto assets, while tightening cycles often pressure speculative positioning. Recent sentiment has been mixed as markets balance expectations around central bank policy, regulatory clarity in the United States, and ongoing discussions around Ethereum scaling upgrades and network efficiency. Headlines related to spot ETF flows, regulatory enforcement actions, or significant protocol upgrades can quickly shift sentiment and short-term positioning.

Ethereum maintains a strong correlation to Bitcoin, particularly during broad risk on and risk off phases. Bitcoin often leads directional moves, with Ethereum following at a higher beta. However, Ethereum can outperform during periods when attention shifts toward smart contract platforms and decentralized finance growth. Relative to other large cap altcoins such as Solana and XRP, Ethereum is viewed as more institutionally established, though it can lag faster moving narratives tied to transaction speed or payments focused use cases.

• Market has been in a large multi-year sideways range between the 4000 and 2300 area since December 2024.

• In August 2025, the market was able to bid above daily level 1, which also marked the top of this range near 4000, and printed new all-time highs (ATHs).

• However, the market was unable to accept above the 4000 level and subsequently, rotated back toward the 3800 to 4000 zone where buyers and sellers engaged in a prolonged battle between 3750 (bid block 1 high) and 4250 (offer block 1 low), forming offer block 2 in October 2025

• Buyers attempted to defend this region while sellers stepped down offers, eventually forcing long liquidation as price auctioned lower.

• In November 2025, buyers responded at the yearly VWAP, but sellers continued to apply pressure and prices rotated further down toward bid block 1, where buyers once again stepped in.

• Since November 2025, the market has balanced in a two-way auction between 3500 (daily level 2), and 2700 (daily level 3), with sellers defending at offer block 2 and buyers defending at bid block 1.

• Since the start of 2026, price has tested lower, crossed above the yearly VWAP to print new highs, and has since rotated back to chop around VWAP. The flatness of VWAP suggests indecision and ongoing balance.

Key levels to watch remain the top and bottom of the current balance range at 3500 and 2750, corresponding to daily levels 2 and 3.

• Without volume and velocity at the edges of 3500 and 2750, expect continued two-way balanced auction within the range.

• Price is likely to rotate around range mid and VWAP as both buyers and sellers remain responsive rather than initiative.

• Flat VWAP would continue to signal market indecision and acceptance of current value.

• A test of 3500 accompanied by increasing volume and pace would increase the probability of a breakout attempt.

• Acceptance above 3500 could open a move toward 3800 and potentially extend to the 4100 area.

• Responsive sellers are expected at offer block 2, which may slow or cap upside momentum.

• If sellers begin holding below range mid and VWAP, it would suggest that downside control is developing.

• An approach toward 2750 with expanding volume and speed on the tape would increase the likelihood of a breakdown.

• A failure at daily level 3 could result in price auctioning lower toward the 2250 area (daily level 4).

• Buyers are expected to respond at bid block 1, potentially leading to another period of balance.

Ethereum remains technically balanced while macro forces continue to dictate broader risk sentiment. Flat VWAP and sustained two-way trade suggest the market is waiting for a catalyst, whether from liquidity conditions, regulatory clarity, or renewed institutional flows. A decisive move beyond the current range will likely require both technical acceptance and supportive macro alignment, making patience and level awareness critical in the weeks ahead.

Crypto researcher Axel has provided insights into why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices are still crashing. This comes as BTC continues to see a supply overhang, which threatens to put more downward pressure on crypto prices. 

Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Prices Are Still Crashing

In a research report, Axel noted that anomalous exchange inflows accompanied the BTC breakdown below the $90,000 zone as sellers prepared in advance. The market is also still at risk of further selling pressure as the 1.0 level of the short-term holders' SOPR is now acting as a resistance rather than support. As such, there is a possibility that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices will decline further. 

Further commenting on Bitcoin netflows into exchanges, Axel noted that between January 20 and 21, almost 17,000 BTC flowed into exchanges, coinciding with BTC dropping to as low as $87,000, while Ethereum and Solana prices also dropped. The crypto researcher explained that these anomalously high values followed a period of predominantly negative netflow in the first half of this month. 

In the context of the falling Bitcoin price, Axel stated that such a spike is more likely to reflect supply preparation than neutral transfers. In other words, the breakdown below $90,000 appears to be structural rather than emotional. Meanwhile, Bitcoin netflow returned to neutral levels yesterday, but the accumulated inflow still creates a supply overhang, which could lead to further declines in the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. 

Axel noted that a signal of improvement would be if netflow turns negative again amid rising prices, which could indicate that the overhang has cleared. However, with the short-term holders' 7-day SMA SOPR below 0.996, the crypto researcher suggested that BTC faces increased selling pressure on every recovery as these holders look to sell at breakeven. He added that a reversal trigger could be confirmed if the SOPR breaks above 1.0 from below, with the 7-day SMA holding unity for three to five days to filter out false spikes after the selloff. 

Why A Break Above $100,000 Looks Unlikely For Now

In its latest research report, on-chain analytics platform Glassnode explained that a Bitcoin rally above $100,000 looks unlikely for now as the supply overhang persists. They noted how this overhang supply above $98,000 remains the dominant sell-side force capping short to mid-term rebounds. 

Alluding to the Unspent Realized Price Distribution metric, Glassnode noted that the recent BTC rally has partially filled the prior air gap between $93,000 and $98,000, driven by redistribution from top buyers into newer market participants. 

However, the unresolved supply overhang is expected to likely cap attempts above the $98,400 short-term holders' cost basis and the $100,000 level. A meaningful and sustained acceleration in demand momentum is said to be required for a clean breakout above $100,000 to occur.

Anas is a crypto native journalist and SEO writer with over five years of writing experience covering blockchain, crypto, DeFi, and emerging tech.

US prosecutors have formally dropped their case against former OpenSea manager Nathaniel Chastain following an appeals court reversal that dismantled what was once positioned as the first NFT insider trading prosecution in American history.

According to sources, the Justice Department announced Wednesday it would enter a one-month deferred prosecution agreement before dismissing the indictment with prejudice.

The decision closes a chapter that began in June 2022 when Chastain was arrested and charged with wire fraud and money laundering for using confidential information to purchase NFTs before they were featured on OpenSea's homepage.

The case attracted widespread attention as prosecutors attempted to apply traditional financial crime statutes to emerging digital asset markets.

Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton, a former SEC chair, told the federal court that prosecutors would not retry the case given Chastain had already served three months in prison and agreed not to contest forfeiture of 15.98 ETH worth $47,330. 

“The interest of the United States will be best served by deferring prosecution of this matter and not retrying the case,” Clayton wrote in the court filing.

The collapse stems from a July 2024 appeals court decision that found the trial jury received flawed instructions. 

The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that jurors were improperly told they could convict Chastain based solely on unethical behavior rather than actual theft of property with commercial value. 

Judge Steven Menashi wrote last year August that the lower court erred by allowing conviction even if the information Chastain used lacked tangible value to OpenSea.

The appeals panel sharply criticized jury instructions that permitted conviction based on violations of “broad notions of honesty and fair play,” warning such standards could criminalize nearly any deceptive act. 

The court found the featured NFT data was not monetized by OpenSea and was not treated internally as a valuable asset, making it too “ethereal” to qualify as property under federal wire fraud statutes.

Chastain was convicted in May 2023 after prosecutors accused him of exploiting his role to buy dozens of NFTs shortly before they appeared on OpenSea's homepage between June and September 2021.

After tokens were featured and prices increased, he sold them at two- to five-times profit using anonymous wallets. The government alleged he made over $57,000 through the scheme.

US Attorney Damian Williams had described the case as a warning to digital asset markets when announcing charges. “NFTs might be new, but this type of criminal scheme is not,” Williams said. 

“As alleged, Nathaniel Chastain betrayed OpenSea by using its confidential business information to make money for himself.“

The conviction came after a week-long trial, with prosecutors charging wire fraud rather than securities fraud since NFTs have not been legally classified as securities. 

More than 300 defense attorneys had filed letters supporting dismissal, arguing that treating confidential business information as property would “criminalize a broad swath of conduct.“

The dropped prosecution aligns with a broader shift in federal crypto enforcement under the Trump administration. 

As reported by Cryptonews earlier today, a Cornerstone Research report found the SEC initiated just 13 crypto-related actions in 2025, down 60% from 33 in 2024 and the lowest level since 2017. 

The agency has dismissed multiple high-profile cases including those against Coinbase, Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland DRW.

The SEC also closed its investigation into OpenSea in February 2025 after issuing a Wells notice in August 2024 that alleged the platform functioned as an unregistered securities marketplace.

🌊 The SEC has officially ended its investigation into NFT marketplace @OpenSea, according to the company's founder, @dfinzer.#SEC #OpenSeahttps://t.co/OtOT6c3WMd

At that time, OpenSea founder Devin Finzer called the closure “a win for everyone who is creating and building in our space.“

For now, Chastain will not face supervision by US Pretrial Services and can seek return of the $50,000 fine and special assessment paid following his conviction.

Notably, the global NFT market cap currently stands at $2.56 billion, down 6.72% in the last 24 hours with total sales volume reaching $3.68 million, according to CoinGecko data.

The figure represents an 84.78% decline from the market's peak of $16.82 billion in April 2022, when digital collectibles were among the hottest assets in crypto and the Chastain case was first unfolding.

The confession arrived on LinkedIn, of all places. Lichtenstein, 38, didn't sugarcoat his past. “Ten years ago, I decided that I would hack the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world,” he wrote. His startup was struggling financially. Stealing seemed easier than earning. It wasn't.

“This was a terrible idea. It was the worst thing I had ever done,” Lichtenstein admitted. “It upended my life, the lives of people close to me, and affected thousands of users of the exchange. I know I disappointed a lot of people who believed in me and grossly misused my talents.”

The numbers are staggering. In 2016, Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, executed a scheme that drained 120,000 bitcoins from Bitfinex. At today's prices, that haul exceeds $10 billion. The couple pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy in 2023, a year after federal agents arrested them at their Manhattan apartment.

Prison changed Lichtenstein's trajectory. He became an informant, helping the government recover the stolen cryptocurrency and consulting on additional crypto investigations. The experience surprised him.

“When I was a black hat hacker, I was isolated and paranoid,” he wrote. “Working with the good guys, being part of a team solving a bigger problem felt surprisingly good. I realized that I could use my technical skills to make a difference.”

His 60-month sentence took him through some of America's toughest federal facilities. To stay sharp, he devoured math textbooks in prison libraries. Earlier this month, authorities transferred him to home confinement.

Lichtenstein isn't the first convicted hacker to seek redemption through legitimate security work. Kevin Mitnick, once the FBI's most-wanted computer criminal, built a respected career as a penetration tester and security consultant after his release. He ran his own firm until his death in 2023.

The path forward won't be simple. Lichtenstein acknowledges as much.

“Now begins the real challenge of regaining the community's trust,” he wrote, making his pitch to potential employers. “I think like an adversary. I've been an adversary. Now I can use those same skills to stop the next billion-dollar hack.”

Whether the cybersecurity industry will embrace a reformed billion-dollar thief remains an open question. His technical credentials are undeniable. His ethics, less certain.

Insider Brief

Coinbase is moving early to confront  the rise of large-scale quantum computers, a risk that still sits years away but could upend the foundations of blockchain security.

The crypto exchange said in a company blog post that it is forming an independent advisory board to assess how advances in quantum computing could affect blockchains and to provide guidance to developers, users and institutions long before the technology becomes practical. The move reflects growing concern that the cryptographic systems protecting today's digital assets may not remain secure indefinitely.

Coinbase said the new Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain will bring together leading researchers in quantum science, cryptography and distributed systems to evaluate risks, publish position papers, and respond to major scientific developments as they occur. The company framed the effort as part of a long-term security strategy rather than a reaction to any immediate threat.

If they can be built at sufficient scale and reliability, quantum computers are expected to solve certain mathematical problems far faster than classical machines. Those capabilities could have wide effects across industries such as finance, healthcare, materials science and national security. For blockchain systems, the concern is that many of these systems rely on cryptographic techniques that could eventually be weakened or cracked by quantum algorithms.

Most major blockchains today use elliptic-curve cryptography to secure wallets and verify transactions. According to Coinbase, these systems remain secure against current computers, but a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could one day undermine them. Preparing for that possibility requires years of advance planning, new cryptographic standards, and coordination across the industry, the company said in the post.

The advisory board is intended to operate independently and to provide public-facing analysis rather than internal advice alone. Coinbase said the group will publish assessments of the state of quantum computing, issue recommendations for developers and organizations, and provide timely guidance following major breakthroughs in the field.

The board includes researchers whose work spans quantum theory, applied cryptography, and blockchain security. Members include Scott Aaronson, a leading theorist in quantum computing; Dan Boneh, a specialist in modern cryptography and blockchain research; and Justin Drake, who focuses on the long-term security of blockchain networks.

Other members include Sreeram Kannan, founder of EigenLayer; Yehuda Lindell, who leads cryptographic research at Coinbase; and Dahlia Malkhi, an expert in resilient distributed systems.

Coinbase said a key role of the group is to provide independent insight rather than promotional endorsement. The board's work will be made public and aimed at the broader blockchain ecosystem, not just Coinbase products.

The first output from the advisory board is expected in the coming months, when it plans to release a position paper establishing a baseline assessment of quantum risk and outlining early steps toward resilience. That paper is intended to serve as a reference point for developers and organizations that are beginning to think about post-quantum security, according to the post.

The advisory board is one part of what Coinbase described as a broader post-quantum roadmap. Some measures are already being implemented. These include updates to how Bitcoin addresses are handled and changes to internal key management systems to align with what the company described as the strongest protections available today.

At a research level, Coinbase said it is working to support post-quantum cryptographic schemes within secure multiparty computation systems. These approaches aim to distribute cryptographic trust across multiple parties, reducing the risk that a single compromised key could expose assets. One example cited by the company is ML-DSA, a type of digital signature scheme designed to remain secure even against quantum attacks.

The company also highlighted the importance of independent oversight as quantum computing research accelerates. Rather than waiting for standards bodies or regulators to mandate changes, Coinbase said it wants to help shape industry understanding of the issue early, when there is still time to migrate systems gradually.

Some fear massive consequences for financial markets.

When the biggest and "safest" investments in the world start to get questioned, it's necessary to take a hard look at what the idea of "safety" actually means.

On that note, if major foreign holders in the European Union reduce their exposure to U.S. Treasuries as a result of the Trump administration's constant barrage of controversial actions at home and abroad, Bitcoin (BTC +1.39%) could well end up in the conversation as an alternative store of value. But the coin's recent track record suggests a far less flattering first reaction is also probable, so let's examine what's most likely to happen if a real Treasury sell-off ends up playing out.

Image source: Getty Images.

Before we get into Bitcoin specifically, we'll first need to set the stage. U.S. Treasuries are the bonds issued by the U.S. government, and they anchor pricing across global finance. The Treasury market is among the largest in the world, with nearly $30 trillion in marketable debt outstanding, and policymakers, as well as central bankers, watch its liquidity closely because disruptions can and do ripple into other markets.

Foreign investors hold about $9.4 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities in total. That puts foreign holdings at roughly 31% of that marketable stock.

If foreign selling ever accelerates due to irritation with the U.S., or a lack of confidence in its economy or its leadership, all of which are risks that are currently in play, the near-term impact is usually that the stock and crypto markets pivot to being risk-off, meaning that investors pull capital from higher-risk assets and reallocate their capital to safer ones as quickly as they are able. So let's take a look at what that would do to Bitcoin.

If there's a genuine Treasury sell-off, the bullish scenario is that some investors will want an asset outside any one country's control, and Bitcoin becomes a beneficiary of that preference. In theory, that would channel capital away from fiat currencies like the dollar. The channeling process could take quite a while, though.

The bearish scenario is far worse. Bitcoin's correlation with the U.S. stock market can and does spike sharply from time to time, especially in times of crisis. Thus, the most likely immediate outcome of a true U.S. Treasury sell-off is that Bitcoin would drop sharply, and take a long period to recover.

Over an even longer horizon, perhaps on the order of a couple of years, Bitcoin could still benefit massively if global diversification away from the U.S. dollar continues. So in closing, take this risk seriously. If it happens, it won't be pretty, but those who buy the blood, as I plan to do, will probably be better off for it eventually.

The US Department of Justice has formally closed its case against Nathaniel Chastain, the former OpenSea executive at the centre of the first insider trading prosecution involving non-fungible tokens. 

Prosecutors will not pursue a retrial after his conviction was overturned last year.

In a filing submitted to a Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, prosecutors said they had reached a one-month deferred prosecution agreement with Chastain. 

Once that ends, charges will be dismissed.

Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton, who also previously served as SEC Chair, noted in a letter to the court that the government's decision factored in Chastain's partial completion of his original sentence. 

The former OpenSea manager served three months in federal custody and had to forfeit 15.98 ETH, valued at roughly $47,000, which prosecutors claim represented the proceeds from his NFT trades. 

Chastain also agreed not to challenge that forfeiture.

According to Clayton, “the interest of the United States will be best served” by ending the prosecution at this stage, rather than seeking a retrial.

Chastain was initially convicted in May 2023 of wire fraud and money laundering after federal prosecutors accused him of using advance knowledge of which NFT collections would be spotlighted on OpenSea's homepage to purchase them in secret before flipping them for profit.

The jury found that Chastain used anonymous wallets and burner accounts to make at least 15 such trades between June and September 2021, earning around $57,000 from the scheme. He served his time later that year while preparing to appeal.

But in July 2025, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, siding with Chastain's defence team, which had long argued that the NFT placement data he accessed didn't meet the legal threshold for “property” under federal wire fraud statutes.

The appellate court ruled that the jury had been misdirected, effectively convicting Chastain for ethical lapses rather than for fraud tied to misappropriated property with clear commercial value to his employer. 

Judge Steven Menashi, who was overseeing the case, concluded at the time that deceptive behaviour alone does not constitute criminal fraud without a demonstrable property interest at stake.

Chastain was later released from court supervision and is now eligible to seek the return of the $50,000 fine and $200 special assessment he paid after his 2023 conviction.

At one point, prosecutors also looked into whether OpenSea itself might be on the hook for Chastain's conduct.

However, it later concluded that the company had acted swiftly to investigate the misconduct, requested Chastain's resignation, and cooperated with investigators throughout.

Since late 2024, the US regulatory agencies have steadily backed away from their most aggressive crypto cases, as they pivoted away from their regulation-by-enforcement approach under new leadership.

For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission ended its yearlong investigation into OpenSea last year, which had stemmed from the same events. 

The commission had issued a Wells Notice against OpenSea, alleging that OpenSea was offering NFTs as unregistered securities. However, after the change in agency leadership and priorities, the case was dropped.

As the crypto market faces uncertainty and continues in a consolidation phase, market expert Sam Daodu has issued a report examining the potential for XRP, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) to emerge as frontrunners if a new altcoin season arises in 2026. 

XRP, ETH, And SOL Price Forecasts

Daodu began his analysis by pointing out that Bitcoin's (BTC) dominance is currently hovering around 59%, alongside an Altcoin Season Index reading of 55. These indicators suggest that 2026 could herald a substantial rotation towards altcoins, mirroring significant shifts experienced during cycles in 2016-2017 and 2020-2021.

The expert outlines several bullish scenarios for each. For XRP, he envisions a potential surge past the $6-$8 range if exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows maintain a monthly average exceeding $400 million and RippleNet continues to expand its influence in global banking. 

ETH, on the other hand, could see itself climbing toward $12,000-$18,000 if Layer 2 (L2) adoption unlocks broader usage and ETF inflows rebound. 

Daodu highlights that active addresses are at cycle highs, indicating organic demand that may translate to higher prices once institutional sentiment shifts positively.

For SOL, the outlook is similarly optimistic. Solana might rocket to the range of $500-$800 if its transaction finality of 150 milliseconds and low fees attract a new wave of applications. Additionally, the rise in ETF filings could lead to significant capital inflows.

Potential Risks Ahead 

In more stable scenarios, Daodu suggests that XRP might consolidate between $2.50-$3.50 if institutional adoption progresses steadily without dramatic catalysts. 

He also speculates that Ethereum could trade within the range of $5,000-$9,000, benefiting from consistent demand driven by staking yields and decentralized finance (DeFi) growth.

Meanwhile, Solana might trend between $200-$350, assuming that developer growth and retail adoption continue at their current pace without major breakthroughs. 

However, Daodu cautions that XRP could fall below $1.50 if demand for ETFs wanes or if regulatory uncertainties arise. Similarly, ETH could fall below $2,500 if scalability issues arise or if regulatory challenges become more pronounced. SOL could drop below $100 if outages persist or if it faces increased competition from other Layer 1 platforms.

What AI Models Anticipate

AI predictions provide additional insight into the expected performance of these altcoins. For XRP, forecasts vary significantly, with ChatGPT estimating a range of $0.80-$3.00, while Grok presents a more bullish outlook with a target of $1.50-$6.00. 

Ethereum's AI predictions show a range of $3,000-$9,000 from ChatGPT, while Gemini anticipates a high of $7,000-$18,000 through increased tokenization. 

Lastly, Solana's predictions range from $120-$350 from ChatGPT to a more optimistic $300-$800 from Gemini, depending on the growth of consumer applications.

XRP was trading at $1.93 at the time of writing, down 2% in the previous 24 hours. ETH traded at roughly $2,952, while SOL traded at $128, both experiencing comparable declines during the same time period.

LAS VEGAS (FOX5) — Las Vegas Valley businesses are accepting Bitcoin as payment as the cryptocurrency continues to grow in popularity, from restaurant chains like Steak and Shake to small businesses like a juice bar in the southwest valley.

At Cane Juice Bar and Cafe on Rainbow near Windmill, district manager Tyler Peterson serves fresh pressed sugar cane juice. It can be paid for with cash, card or Bitcoin.

“It's been about 8 months now that we've had Bitcoin implemented as a payment,” Peterson said. “Bitcoin is getting very popular with mainstream people, not just the people that are actually into things like cryptocurrencies… it's just something to help us move forward.”

Peterson said customers who normally wouldn't know about his shop come in specifically to use Bitcoin.

“Absolutely, yeah. I get calls all the time. People come in, they inquire and they ask me if we're accepting Bitcoin,” Peterson said. “So actually some customers we have generated off of accepting Bitcoin… That Bitcoin map is helping us out a lot.”

Jeremy Querci, a Bitcoin consultant with Sovreign, said businesses accepting Bitcoin range from medical practices to juice bars to children's play places. Querci explained paying with Bitcoin is simple and requires just a few taps on a phone.

“At the time of checkout, you say you want to pay in Bitcoin and the business can bring up a QR code that you scan with your phone with any Bitcoin app,” Querci said. 

“It's one of those things where it's going to get easier and easier to use. It's the future,” Peterson asserted. 

In November, Square enabled roughly 4 million merchants across the US to accept Bitcoin payments with zero processing fees through 2026. Businesses can avoid credit card processing fees, which average 2.5 to 3.5 percent, by using Bitcoin.

People can find businesses accepting Bitcoin through Bitcoin maps or through Cash App.

An address poisoning scam is one in which bad actors send small amounts of crypto from wallet addresses that are similar to those frequently used by the victim, in hopes that the victim will accidently send funds to the scammer's address in future transactions, according to the report.

Trends on ethereum that suggest that such a campaign may be underway include a record-breaking surge in transactions and active addresses at a time when bitcoin activity has been trending lower, a large share of the transactions being worth less than $1, and low transaction fees that make it inexpensive for attackers to send out their small payments, per the report.

“This transaction trend is often associated with ‘address poisoning' scam campaigns,” the Citi analysts said, per the report.

Blockchain data firm TRM Labs said in July 2024 that an attack in May 2024 at the Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin, which led to the theft of coins valued at upwards of $300 million, may have involved an address poisoning scam.

“While the exact cause of the attack remains unknown, potential vectors include stolen private keys or address poisoning — a tactic wherein attackers send tiny amounts of cryptocurrency to a victim's wallet to create fake transaction histories, potentially confusing users into sending funds to the wrong address in future transactions,” TRM Labs said at the time.

FBI Denver said in April 2024 that it had seen criminals creating cryptocurrency tokens that impersonate well-known tokens but have no value and using those impersonation tokens to send to victims as part of an address poisoning attack.

“Because of the way cryptocurrency wallet software truncates addresses, the first few alphanumeric characters and the last few alphanumeric characters might be identical to a familiar address; however, the middle alphanumeric characters in the address will be different,” the agency said in a press release. “Impersonation tokens increase the likelihood that address-poisoning attacks will work against both experienced and newer cryptocurrency users.”

Scientists studying rare rocks buried deep beneath central Australia have uncovered how one of the world's most promising new sources of niobium came to be. Niobium is a critical metal used to strengthen steel and support clean energy technologies, and its origins are tied to dramatic geological events that unfolded more than 800 million years ago.

The research, led by Curtin University, shows that these newly identified niobium-rich rocks formed during the early stages of a massive continental breakup. At the time, Earth's ancient supercontinent Rodinia was beginning to pull apart, creating deep fractures in the crust.

How Tectonic Forces Brought Metal to the Surface

According to the study, molten rock rich in niobium rose from deep within the Earth through long-standing fault zones. These pathways opened during a period of tectonic stretching and rifting that eventually split Rodinia apart. The molten material solidified into rare igneous rocks known as carbonatites, locking valuable metals into the crust.

Lead author Dr. Maximilian Dröllner, from the Timescales of Mineral Systems Group within Curtin's Frontier Institute for Geoscience Solutions and the University of Göttingen, said the discovery offers new insight into how rare, metal-rich magmas reach the surface.

"These carbonatites are unlike anything previously known in the region and contain important concentrations of niobium, a strategic metal used to make lighter, stronger steel for aircraft, pipelines and EVs and a key component in some next-generation battery and superconducting technologies," Dr. Dröllner said.

Pinpointing an 800-Million-Year-Old Geological Event

By examining drill core samples, the research team used several isotope-dating methods to determine when the rocks formed. Their results show the carbonatites were emplaced between 830 and 820 million years ago, during a key phase of continental rifting before Rodinia fully broke apart.

"Using multiple isotope-dating techniques on drill core samples, we found that these carbonatites were emplaced between 830 and 820 million years ago, during a period of continental rifting that preceded the breakup of Rodinia.

"This tectonic setting allowed carbonatite magma to rise through fault zones that had remained open and active for hundreds of millions of years, delivering metal-rich melts from deep in the mantle up into the crust."

Reconstructing Half a Billion Years of Earth History

Curtin co-author Professor Chris Kirkland, also from the Timescales of Mineral Systems Group, said the study highlights how advanced analytical techniques can untangle extremely complex geological timelines.

"Carbonatites are rare igneous rocks known to host major global deposits of critical metals such as niobium and rare earth elements. But determining when and how they formed has historically been difficult due to their complex geological histories," Professor Kirkland said.

"By analyzing isotopes and using high-resolution imaging, we were able to reconstruct more than 500 million years of geological events that these rocks experienced.

"This approach allowed us to pinpoint when the carbonatites formed and separate those original magmatic events from changes that happened later in the rocks."

The findings were published in Geological Magazine under the title 'Multi-method geochronology and isotope geochemistry of carbonatites in the Aileron Province, central Australia'.

This is the most complete skeleton yet of our ancestor Homo habilis

A partial skeleton dating back more than two million years is the most complete yet of Homo habilis, one of the earliest known species in our genus

By K. R. Callaway edited by Andrea Thompson

The bones of the Homo habilis skeleton found in found in the Lake Turkana Basin of Kenya.

A skeleton found in the Lake Turkana Basin area of northern Kenya is the most complete set of remains ever found of Homo habilis, a species that was one of the earliest members of the Homo genus and lived more than two million years ago. Its large brain and flat face—attributes found in today's humans—have long set the species apart from earlier hominins such as Australopithecus africanus. A new study analyzing the uniquely complete skeleton, however, suggests H. habilis' body looked much less modern.

The analysis of the bones, published on January 13 in the Anatomical Record, affirms previous assumptions about the species, such as that H. habilis had long and strong arms that were more similar in proportion to those of apes than to those of modern humans. Additionally, H. habilis was small—perhaps even smaller than Lucy, a 3.2-million-year-old hominin specimen known for her tiny size.

“A finding like this does give hope,” says William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. “It's been tough with Homo habilis, as there are very limited, scrappy remains. It shows us that hard work in the field, and constantly looking for them, reaps important dividends.”

Some of the skeleton's teeth were first found in the sediments of Lake Turkana by Arbollo Aike of the Koobi Fora Research Project in 2012. Over the next couple of years, the study authors followed a trail of bone fragments downslope for several meters, discovering more teeth and a series of larger bones from the upper body. The fully excavated skeleton includes a nearly complete set of lower teeth, both collarbones, both upper arm and forearm bones, and fragments of the shoulder blades and pelvis.

Analyzing the bones took more than a decade, study co-author Ashley Hammond said in a statement. First researchers had to ascertain that all the bones came from the same individual and that the individual was from the H. habilis species. “Fortunately for us, the teeth are one of the most diagnostic parts of the skeleton for identifying hominin species,” says study co-author Carrie Mongle, an assistant professor of anthropology at Stony Brook University.

Still elusive is the build of H. habilis' lower body. The pelvic fragment found with the new skeleton suggests the species might have been able to walk more upright than earlier hominins, Mongle says. Still, more information about the lower body is needed to learn exactly where the species fits into the evolution of humanlike posture and gait.

Because H. habilis is one of the earliest members of our genus, understanding more about this species helps to shed light on the evolution that led to our own, researchers say.

“This study underlines how crucial individual fossil discoveries can be,” says Rebecca Wragg Sykes, an honorary archeology researcher at the University of Cambridge and the University of Liverpool in England, who was not involved in the study. “Just a few new fragments can transform our view not only of that species but [of] their evolutionary context, too.”

The Strychnos alkaloids have long been regarded as landmark targets for chemical synthesis due to their captivating architectures and notorious biological properties. However, the design of approaches that access multiple family members in an asymmetric, concise and atom-economical fashion remains an important challenge. Here we show that thiophene S,S-dioxides (TDOs) offer a modular, rapid entry to Strychnos natural products via inverse electron demand Diels–Alder cascades. We demonstrate that exceptional levels of stereocontrol can be achieved in asymmetric TDO cycloadditions, affording tricyclic indolines of utility in medicinal chemistry research and enabling the stereoselective synthesis of eight Strychnos alkaloids by the shortest routes described so far, including a synthesis of the iconic family member brucine. Using a machine-learning approach, computational studies provide insight into the source of stereoinduction and reveal an intriguing and unexpected spontaneous cheletropic extrusion of SO2.

The Strychnos indole alkaloid natural products have long excited the scientific community, not least because of their potent biological properties and architectural complexity (Fig. 1a). Robinson infamously said of the flagship member of the family, strychnine, that “for its molecular size, it is the most complex substance known”1, and the landmark synthesis of this natural product by Woodward et al.2,3 inspired the design of many synthetic approaches to these alkaloids4,5,6. In addition to the structural challenges, such endeavours have also been stimulated by their potential biological applications, such as the identification of alstolucines B and F as candidates for the re-sensitization of taxanes in multidrug-resistant cancers7. However, synthetic approaches that are asymmetric, sufficiently concise to produce useful quantities of natural product and also sufficiently flexible to enable the ‘collective' synthesis of multiple family members are rare. Additional demands of synthesis ideality, such as the avoidance of protecting groups and the minimization of waste8,9, impose further challenges that continue to limit the wider exploitation of the family. In this context, the six-step racemic synthesis of strychnine by the Vanderwal group10 and the collective asymmetric synthesis of six indole alkaloids by MacMillan et al. (including a twelve-step asymmetric approach to strychnine)11 represent pioneering contributions, with recent elegant approaches having also been described by the Zhang and Snaddon groups12,13.

We questioned whether an entry to the Strychnos family might be designed to meet the stringent demands of contemporary synthetic chemistry, specifically a modular, asymmetric strategy that would enable the construction of the Strychnos core in a handful of steps, and thereby access multiple natural products in a scalable, straightforward manner. We recognized that the polycyclic indoline core of the alkaloids is an attractive motif for ring formation via cycloaddition, in which an indole precursor would serve as an electron-rich 2π component. This concept was exploited by Vanderwal and co-workers using tethered Zincke aldehydes (Fig. 1b)10,14, and also by the Boger and Padwa groups via [3 + 2] cycloadditions with tethered carbonyl ylides15,16. However, these elegant strategies suffer from drawbacks, including the need for harsh reaction conditions when employing aromatic cycloaddition partners such as oxadiazoles (for example, heating at 180 °C for 48 h (ref. 15)), the use of hazardous diazo compounds for carbonyl ylide synthesis16 or the formation of racemic products10 that necessitate late-stage chromatographic resolution15.

We hypothesized that thiophene S,S-dioxides (TDOs, Fig. 1c)17 could address these limitations. These heterocycles are in many ways ‘ideal' diene substrates for inverse electron demand Diels–Alder (IEDDA) reactions as they are non-aromatic and should therefore exhibit enhanced reactivity compared with traditional substrates such as pyrones or tetrazines, while still having the benefits of electron deficiency, an intrinsically s-cis constrained diene and a powerful entropic driving force that renders the cycloaddition irreversible (that is, the loss of SO2 through cheletropic extrusion). However, the deployment of TDOs in target-oriented synthesis is surprisingly rare, with applications so far being restricted to aromatic carbocycles such as the relatively simple illudalane triterpenes, the antiplatelet agent beraprost and the indoline core of the dictyodendrins18,19,20. We questioned whether these underexploited dienes could also be used to assemble the saturated carbocycles found in the Strychnos core, and whether we might simultaneously develop asymmetric TDO cycloadditions, which would render the collective synthesis enantioselective.

Three complementary TDO-based approaches were envisaged to access the Strychnos core, which vary strategically in the order of synthetic events (Fig. 1c). First (Path I), tryptamine could undergo alkylation with side chain 1 suitable for downstream completion of the targeted natural products, followed by addition–elimination (substitution) reaction with a halogenated, chiral TDO 2a to give intermediate 3. The TDO in 3 would react with the tethered indole via a stereoselective intramolecular IEDDA–SO2 cheletropic extrusion pathway to form tetracycle 4 after partial reduction of the intermediate dienamine cycloadduct 5. Further functionalization of 4 would afford the Strychnos natural products. As an alternative, we considered intermolecular approaches such as Path II, in which temporary protection of the tryptamine side-chain nitrogen atom precedes intermolecular cycloaddition with TDO 2a to give diene 6; cleavage of the nitrogen atom protecting group should then lead to intermediate 5 by intramolecular substitution of the TDO-derived halogen atom, thereby converging on Path I. Finally (Path III), we considered the direct cycloaddition of N-protected tryptamine with TDO 2b to form adduct 7. TDO 2b would necessarily feature a disposable substituent (X), which is essential to prevent heterodimerization of the thiophene ring system in the course of its oxidation17. Subsequent to the cycloaddition cascade, deprotection and cyclization of the tryptamine side chain in 7, cleavage of the superfluous substituent X and N-alkylation with side chain 1 would also afford advanced intermediate 4. Here we describe the realization of all three strategies, which culminated in a collective asymmetric synthesis of eight natural products of the Strychnos family. In doing so, we also established asymmetric intermolecular cycloadditions of TDOs, accessing tricyclic indoline scaffolds that are of particular interest for medicinal chemistry applications. Computational studies revealed the source of the stereoselectivity observed in both the intra- and intermolecular IEDDA reactions, and suggested that the intramolecular TDO cycloadditions may benefit from an entropic driving force, where cheletropic extrusion of SO2 occurs in a spontaneous manner along the cycloaddition pathway without the formation of a discrete intermediate [4 + 2] cycloadduct.

With a view to developing an asymmetric route to the Strychnos family, we first addressed the development of hitherto unrealized asymmetric TDO cycloadditions. Investigations began with intermolecular [4 + 2] cycloadditions between indoles and enantioenriched thiophene S,S-dioxides (prepared by peroxyacid oxidation of the corresponding thiophene21) equipped with inexpensive, readily available chiral substituents. We found that the reaction of indole (8a, Table 1, R1, R2, R3 = H) with a TDO substituted with an acyl camphorsultam group22 (9a, R4 = 5-Cl) in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C afforded tricycle 10a as a single diastereomer in high yield. The stereochemistry of 10a was established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, which revealed the indoline ring junction to possess the absolute stereochemistry required for the natural stereoisomers of the Strychnos alkaloids. This method was tested on a range of substituted indoles and showed broad functional group tolerance of both electron-rich (for example, methoxy) and electron-poor substituents (for example, ester, nitro and nitrile) at various positions around the indole ring, as well as useful functionalities such as boronic esters and halides and substitution of the nitrogen atom. All tricyclic products were isolated as single diastereomers in good-to-excellent yields (10b–10m, 68–93%). Variation of the thiophene S,S-dioxide was also well tolerated, including a bicyclic TDO (10n–10p, 54–68%). With a view towards the proposed intermolecular cycloaddition approach to the Strychnos alkaloids, we also evaluated the use of 3-substituted indoles in this chemistry. These reactions were also successful, albeit requiring higher temperatures to effect the cycloaddition due to the steric demand imposed by the additional indole substituent, affording cycloadducts 10q and 10r in 90% and 91% yields, respectively, again as single diastereomers.

Having established highly selective, asymmetric intermolecular TDO cycloaddition reactions, we turned to apply them to the synthesis of the Strychnos alkaloids, exploring both the intra- and intermolecular routes. We first tested an intramolecular (tethered) cascade towards akuammicine (Fig. 2a). A key issue was whether the excellent stereocontrol imparted by the camphorsultam group in the intermolecular cycloadditions would be maintained in an intramolecular setting. In the event, the reaction of TDO 9a with amine 11 (prepared by the N alkylation of tryptamine with known side chain 1223) at room temperature, followed by warming to 80 °C, afforded a single diastereomer of the IEDDA cycloadduct 13. This intermediate dienamine was reduced in situ using acetic acid and sodium cyanoborohydride24,25,26 to afford diastereomers 14 and 14′ in a 1:1.4 ratio and 68% overall yield from 9a (see Supplementary Table 1 for details). The adverse selectivity of this step likely derives from the preferred delivery of hydride to the less-hindered concave face of the intermediate iminium ion24,25,26. To complete the synthesis of akuammicine, the camphorsultam amide was subjected to methanolysis27 to give the corresponding ester 15 (67%), with the camphorsultam moiety recovered in high yield. Heck cyclization28,29 of 15 proceeded to afford (–)-akuammicine in 75% yield in four steps from tryptamine (six steps in the longest linear sequence (LLS) that includes assembly of the side chain 12). This represents the most concise and atom-economical assembly of akuammicine described so far. An intermolecular cycloaddition approach to 13 (corresponding to Path II in Fig. 1c) could also be achieved by tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection of the side-chain amine in 11 (95%). Reaction of the resulting carbamate-protected indole with TDO 9a gave an intermediate cycloadduct that upon treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), followed by basic work-up to trigger cyclization of the free amine onto the dienoyl chloride, also afforded dienamine 13 in 75% yield (see Supplementary Section 2.2 for details).

The poor selectivity observed in the reduction of the dienamine cycloadduct 13 prompted us to test the alternative intermolecular asymmetric cycloaddition strategy (Path III in Fig. 1c). We identified 4-bromo-TDO 9d (as used in the synthesis of 10p, Table 1) as a potential candidate for this route as its bromine substituent would protect the corresponding thiophene from unwanted dimerization during oxidation17 and would also likely be removed under mild conditions later in the synthesis. We found that intermolecular cycloaddition of N-Boc-tryptamine 16 with 9d (used directly from the oxidation of thiophene 17) afforded a single diastereomer of dihydrocarbazole 18. In situ addition of TFA effected Boc deprotection, and subsequent addition of the tryptamine side-chain amine onto the dienoyl motif upon basic work-up gave a single diastereomer of the pyrrolidine product 19 in 57% yield (from 17). We found that the allylic bromide resident in 19 could then be selectively cleaved by hydrogenolysis without reduction of the adjacent alkene; attachment of the vinyl iodide side chain 12 to the debrominated product 20 smoothly afforded 14, thus converging on the intramolecular cycloaddition route, but now with complete control of the stereochemistry at the three contiguous stereocentres within the tetracycle. Including the previously implemented endgame, this alternative synthesis of (–)-akuammicine proceeded in seven steps in the LLS (20% overall yield). Four additional natural products (lagumicine, alstolucines B and F, and echitamidine) were synthesized from akuammicine using established chemistry30, while (–)-norfluorocurarine was prepared from 14 by initial reduction to aldehyde 21 with diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBALH) (69%), followed by Heck cyclization (74%).

Pyrrolidine 20, prepared via the intermolecular cycloaddition route, also provided access to strychnine (Fig. 2b). The alkylation of 20 with side chain 22 (69% yield from 19), followed by para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protection11 of the indoline nitrogen atom gave tetracycle 23 (81%). From here, exhaustive reduction with DIBALH afforded diol 24 (76%), Heck cyclization–lactol formation of which proceeded smoothly to afford the PMB-protected Wieland–Gumlich aldehyde (57% yield). This was converted into (–)-strychnine via deprotection of the PMB group, followed by treatment with malonic acid, acetic anhydride and sodium acetate (50% over two steps)11. Overall, the synthesis of (–)-strychnine was completed in ten steps via this intermolecular cycloaddition route (LLS, including the synthesis of side chain 22), which represents the most concise asymmetric approach reported so far (see Supplementary Information for details of the intramolecular TDO cycloaddition approach, which proceeded in seven steps LLS from tryptamine, but with inferior stereocontrol).

Despite the rich history of the Strychnos alkaloids, there is one family member that has thus far eluded chemical synthesis: brucine. This dimethylcatechol analogue of strychnine has been known for over 200 years, and has been employed by chemists as a chiral resolving agent since Fischer's seminal report in 189931; its catechol derivative has been used as a chiral ligand in asymmetric catalysis32. The challenge for any synthesis of brucine relates to the highly electron-rich nature of the indoline ring, which confers sensitivity towards oxidation and electrophilic degradation. To implement the TDO cascade approach to brucine, we first required N-PMB-5,6-dimethoxytryptamine 25 (Fig. 2c). Due to the aforementioned instability issues, precedents for the synthesis of highly oxidized tryptamines are not well documented, but after extensive investigation we found that 25 could be accessed by Larock indole synthesis33,34 from iodoaniline 26 and alkyne 27, which afforded 25 in good yield (61% over two steps). The successful progression of 25 towards brucine proved possible only via the intramolecular TDO cascade: alkylation of 25 with side chain 22 proceeded uneventfully (92%), but due to the reduced stability of the 5,6-dimethoxyindole, the cycloaddition with 9a benefited from a lower reaction temperature (70 °C) and a longer reaction time, affording 28 after reduction of the intermediate dienamine (28% yield from 25, 1.3:1 diastereomeric ratio (d.r.)). A similar endgame sequence to that employed in the synthesis of strychnine then accomplished the total synthesis of (–)-brucine in nine steps LLS from commercial 2-iodo-4,5-dimethoxyaniline. Attempts to implement the alternative intermolecular TDO cascade proved unsuccessful, with complex mixtures observed under the cycloaddition conditions, presumably reflecting the challenge of deploying a highly electron-rich indole.

To better understand the basis of the remarkable levels of asymmetric induction imparted by the TDO camphorsultam side chain in the inter- and intramolecular cycloadditions, we performed quantum mechanics (QM) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by MACE machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to model the cycloaddition step35. MLIPs ‘learn' the high-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PES) from QM calculations, effectively mapping atomic positions to energies and, often, forces with an accuracy comparable to QM and efficiency comparable to simple empirical force fields36,37.

We first explored the facial selectivity of the intermolecular cycloaddition reaction of TDO 9a with indole at the CPCM(MeCN)-DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-TZVP//CPCM(MeCN)-B2PLYP-D3BJ/def2-SVP level of theory (353 K/1 M, Fig. 3a). Interestingly, we found that the preferred pathway involves a stepwise cycloaddition via TS1, proceeding through a series of shallow energy minima before yielding the experimentally observed product diastereomer 10a (Fig. 3a, right). In contrast, the alternative diastereomer was found to form via a concerted cycloaddition pathway, in which the transition state (TS2) is 3.3 kcal mol−1 higher in energy (Fig. 3a, left). The favoured pathway via TS1 initially leads to Inter1 (Gibbs free energy of reaction ΔG° = +10 kcal mol−1), which undergoes a low-barrier cyclization (TS3, activation energy ΔG‡ = 14.4 kcal mol−1) to form the [4 + 2] cycloadduct Inter3. Exergonic extrusion of SO2 via TS4 (ΔG‡ = 12.6 kcal mol−1) affords the observed product 10a.

The free-energy profiles were computed at the CPCM(MeCN)-DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-TZVP//CPCM(MeCN)-B2PLYP-D3BJ/def2-SVP level of theory (353 K/1 M). c, MLIP-MD simulations revealed a concerted asynchronous [4 + 2] process involving a short-lived intermediate (Inter′) and a dynamic stepwise extrusion of SO2. \({\bar{{{r}}}}_{\mathrm{CS}}\), mean of the two C–S bonds. d, Time evolution of the C–C and C–S distances after Inter4. Median (Mdn) values of the C–C and C–S bond lengths (\({r}_{1}^{\mathrm{CC}}\), \({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CC}}\), \({r}_{1}^{\mathrm{CS}}\) and \({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CS}}\)) are shown as solid lines, with the shaded regions representing the interquartile range (IQR; that is, the first to the third quartile) across trajectories. Inset: distributions of time gaps between the formation of \({r}_{1}^{\mathrm{CS}}\) and \({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CS}}\), and between \({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CC}}\) and \({\bar{r}}_{\mathrm{CS}}\). The dashed lines indicate mean values of 32 and 69 fs, respectively. MLIP-MD was trained using the MACE architecture35, with the CPCM(MeCN)-B2PLYP-D3BJ/def2-SVP level of theory used as the ground-truth method (Supplementary Section 4.1.2).

We were curious to understand the energy difference between TS1 and TS2 (2.7 kcal mol−1) as both exhibit stabilizing hydrogen bonding and no obvious steric hindrance. Distortion interaction analysis38 indicated that the higher energy of TS2 compared with TS1 arises from the greater distortion of the TDO 9a (3.2 kcal mol−1 higher in TS2, see Supplementary Section 4.6, and Supplementary Fig. 11). Although this increased distortion is partially compensated by a stronger interaction energy in TS2, the net result is that the electronic activation energy of TS2 remains 2.7 kcal mol−1 higher than TS1.

The intramolecular cycloaddition cascade of the tryptamine–TDO adduct 29, which features a simplified N-methyltryptamine side chain, was found to proceed via a shallower stepwise pathway (Fig. 3b). This held true regardless of which face of the TDO the tethered indole occupies, with an intramolecular hydrogen bond forming between the indole N–H and the sultam SO2 group seeming to favour TS5, which leads to the experimentally observed diastereomer, over TS7 (difference in activation energies ΔΔG‡ = 8.3 kcal mol−1). The PES of the resulting intermediate Inter4 is shallow, such that the second C–C bond formation occurs via a low-energy transition state (TS6, ΔG‡ = 1.7 kcal mol−1). Beyond TS6, an unexpected, spontaneous extrusion of SO2 leads directly to the dienamine product Inter5 (Fig. 3b). Attempts to locate the expected SO2-bridged [4 + 2] cycloadduct (analogous to Inter3) were unsuccessful. Intrigued by this finding, we explored the dynamics of the [4 + 2] mechanism through downhill MD simulations using an MLIP (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Section 4.5 for further details). For this study, 500 trajectories were initialized from TS5 at 353 K and propagated downhill for 5 ps in the direction of either the reactant or product states. Half of the trajectories reverted to the reactant state, while the remainder progressed towards the product state (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Among the latter, 159 trajectories successfully reached the product, while the remaining 91 were trapped at Inter4. These trajectories revealed a highly asynchronous dynamic stepwise process for the cycloaddition reaction, with one C–C bond substantially advanced in the TS5 region (\({r}_{1}^{\mathrm{CC}}\) ≈ 1.84 Å) compared with the other C–C bond (\({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CC}}\) ≈ 3.0 Å). At TS6, the second C–C bond formation has progressed (\({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CC}}\) ≈ 2.44 Å) and a transient sulfur-bridged [4 + 2] cycloadduct (Inter′) is observed in which the C–S bonds remain intact. However, as the system progresses towards the product state, the C–S bonds elongate and SO2 is extruded. The asynchronicity of this process is evidenced in the evolution of the relevant C–C and C–S distances with time (Fig. 3d, t = 0 being TS5). The average time gap between the formation of the two C–C bonds (defined as bond lengths <1.6 Å) is 748 ± 491 fs, ranging from 109–2,459 fs. At around 700 fs, as the second C–C bond starts to form (\({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CC}}\) shortening to 1.6 Å), the C–S bonds begin to elongate, with \({r}_{1}^{\mathrm{CS}}\) lengthening more than \({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CS}}\). The time gap between the cleavage of the C–S bonds averages 33 ± 13 fs (ranging from 4–80 fs); this elongation continues until SO2 is extruded.

Cascade (or domino) reactions and telescoped synthetic procedures offer useful means to increase the efficiency of target-oriented synthesis. Thiophene S,S-dioxides offer an excellent opportunity to engineer such events as their ability to undergo cycloadditions that are rendered irreversible by the in situ extrusion of SO2 offers a direct means to construct cyclohexadienes. However, TDOs have rarely been exploited in synthetic contexts, and their use in asymmetric cycloadditions has not been reported. Here, TDOs equipped with a cheap, common chiral camphorsultam side chain have been shown to offer efficient, stereoselective and general access to polycyclic indolines, where the cycloaddition step proceeds under remarkably mild conditions (0 °C) for indoles that are unsubstituted at the 2- and 3-positions. The observation that these cycloadditions proceed with exceptional stercocontrol (>20:1 d.r.) suggests that TDOs offer a mild and general method for polycyclic indoline synthesis. Application of this chemistry to various tryptamine derivatives provides an entry to the Strychnos alkaloid framework, which enabled the asymmetric synthesis of eight Strychnos alkaloids via the most concise routes reported so far. This includes the historic natural product brucine which, despite being known since the early 1800s, had yet to succumb to total synthesis.

Key to the wider application of TDOs is an understanding of the basis of their reactivity and selectivity in asymmetric cycloaddition reactions. Computational studies using QM calculations and MD simulations driven by MLIPs provided insight into the source of stereocontrol imparted by the camphorsultam side chain in both inter- and intramolecular cycloaddition pathways, and also revealed highly asynchronous cycloaddition pathways or even stepwise ‘Michael addition' mechanisms for the reaction of the TDO with the indole substrate, along with spontaneous extrusion of SO2. This results in sound principles for the design of further reactions exploiting TDOs as dienes. Overall, these studies demonstrate that TDOs offer broad potential for application in the synthesis of structurally complex architectures across synthetic and medicinal chemistry.

To a stirred solution of trifluoroacetic anhydride (64.3 ml, 463 mmol, 10.2 equiv.) at 0 °C was added H2O2 (30 wt% in H2O, 16.3 ml, 160 mmol, 3.5 equiv.) dropwise. The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 15 min. To the resulting mixture at 0 °C was added (5-chlorothiophen-2-yl)[(3aS,6R,7aR)-8,8-dimethyl-2,2-dioxidotetrahydro-3H-3a,6-methanobenzo[c]isothiazol-1(4H)-yl]methanone (16.4 g, 45.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv.). The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 14 h before it was concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was recrystallized from CHCl3–MeCN (3:1) to afford compound 9a (15.7 g, 40.1 mmol, 88%) as a light-yellow solid.

To a stirred solution of 11 (217 mg, 0.64 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) in MeCN (26 ml) at room temperature was added 9a (250 mg, 0.64 mmol, 1.0 equiv.). The resulting mixture was stirred for 14 h before additional 11 (261 mg, 0.77 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) was added. The resulting mixture was warmed to 80 °C and stirred for 40 h before it was cooled to 65 °C and AcOH (0.55 ml, 9.61 mmol, 15.0 equiv.) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 15 min at 65 °C, and then NaBH3CN (401 mg, 6.38 mmol, 10.0 equiv.) in MeOH (6.5 ml) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at 65 °C for 30 min before it was cooled to room temperature, quenched by the slow addition of a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (20 ml) and then diluted with water (10 ml) and CH2Cl2 (20 ml). The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 30 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with water (50 ml) and brine (50 ml), dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography (silica gel, pentane–Et2O 9:1→3:1) afforded compound 14 and its C3a epimer 14′ (276 mg combined mass, 0.44 mmol, 68%, 1:1.4 d.r.) as a brown foam, along with recovered tryptamine 11 (240 mg, 0.71 mmol). These diastereomers could be separated for the purposes of characterization and the subsequent reduction of 14.

To a stirred solution of Boc-tryptamine 16 (1.00 g, 3.84 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) in CHCl3 (19.0 ml) at room temperature was added 9d. The resulting mixture was warmed to 80 °C and stirred for 23 h, before it was cooled to 0 °C and TFA (9.0 ml) was added. The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 2.5 h before it was cooled to 0 °C, quenched by the slow addition of a saturated aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (200 ml) and then stirred for 20 h. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 50 ml), and then the combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography (silica gel, pentane–EtOAc 9:1→4:6) afforded compound 19 (585 mg, 1.10 mmol, 57% over two steps) as a yellow foam.

To a stirred solution of indole (0.2 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (0.1 M) at 0 °C was added thiophene S,S-dioxide (0.1 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred for 38 h before it was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the crude material, which was purified by flash column chromatography using pentane–EtOAc eluent.

Charge transfer across interfaces constitutes the rate-determining step in electrochemical systems. Sluggish kinetics triggers side reactions and hazardous surface morphologies, as represented by dendritic/dead lithium (Li0) in Li-metal batteries (LMBs), especially under ultrafast charging (UFC). Here we report an approach to accelerate interfacial charge transfer by redesigning the solvent molecular structure into a distinctive planar coordination of lone-pair electrons (LPEs) with alkaline cations (Li+ or Na+). This planar-aligned electron channel (PAEC) greatly strengthens the coupling between LPEs and Li+, promoting Li+/Li0 redox reaction kinetics and reversibility. The designed electrolyte dramatically enables stable cycling of industrial 2 Ah Li||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells at an ultrahigh rate of 4 C, achieving 100% full charge within 15 min at a charging power density of 1,747.6 W kg−1. We establish a link between the solvation electronic structure and charge-transfer dynamics, highlighting a potential strategy for electrolyte design under extreme electrochemical conditions.

Climate and atmospheric changes are impacting forest function and structure worldwide, but their effects on tropical forest diversity are unclear. Nowhere is the scientific challenge greater than in the Andes and the Amazon, which together include the world's most diverse forests. Here, using 406 permanent plots spanning four decades of intact lowland and montane forest dynamics, we test for long-term change in species richness and assess the influence of climate and other variables. We show that, at a continental scale, species richness appears stable, but this masks substantial regional variation. Species richness increased in Northern Andean and Western Amazon plots, yet declined in the Central Andes, Guyana Shield and Central-Eastern Amazon. Overall, warmer, drier and more seasonal forests lost species, while those at higher elevations, in less fragmented areas and with faster rates of tree turnover experienced increases. Region-specific drivers, particularly precipitation seasonality and demographic factors, modulated these trends. The results highlight the diverse ways in which Amazon–Andes forests are changing and underscore the critical need to preserve large-scale ecosystem integrity to maintain local tree diversity. By doing so, Northern Andean forests in particular could serve as an important refuge for species increasingly displaced by climate change.

The Andes and the Amazon are crucial for carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and climate regulation1,2,3,4,5. However, climate change and land-use change are threatening the stability of these ecosystems and the services they provide5,6,7,8,9,10. Over recent decades, temperatures have increased in this region, precipitation patterns have become more extreme and variable, deforestation has expanded and forest fires have become more frequent7,11,12,13,14,15. Under these increasingly stressful conditions, plant species have two feasible short-term responses to survive: (1) migrate—shift their distribution range in response to changing environmental conditions, or (2) acclimate—utilize their physiological tolerance to maintain function under the new conditions. If species do not manage to migrate or acclimate, their populations will decrease and eventually they may go extinct16.

The response of plant species to climate change could lead to changes in forest structure, composition, diversity and species richness at the local scale17,18,19. The Andes and other tropical mountains are undergoing a process of thermophilization, where higher-elevation forests are incorporating new lower-elevation species that expand their ranges upslope, and current low-elevation species are increasing in relative abundance20,21,22,23. However, lower-elevation forests face the possibility of biotic attrition (a net loss of species), as there is no species pool from even hotter areas able to migrate and fill the new thermal niches24,25,26. While the wet tropics have been suggested to have the highest rates of plant extinction, based on literature reviews27 and model predictions28, we do not know whether this translates into consistent losses of local richness within the different regions in the Andes–Amazon area.

Despite widespread threats across the Andes–Amazon area, climate change and other large-scale disturbances are not distributed evenly across space7,9,29. Moreover, geographical features—such as increased topographical variation, which may provide a potential advantage for species persistence by offering more suitable environmental conditions—are also unevenly distributed30,31.

At the local scale, stressors, such as increasing temperatures and declining rainfall, have been related to mortality-driven compositional shifts, particularly in steep elevational gradients21,30,32,33. Baseline temperature and precipitation regimes have also been shown to relate to the probability of plant species suffering thermal or drought damage34,35. Fragmented areas are also vulnerable to diversity losses, while increasing fire frequency reduces regeneration and species richness13,36,37. However, although several mechanisms have been shown to drive changes in (neo)tropical forest diversity, most studies so far have been limited to local or regional scales and/or lack long-term assessments of tree richness and diversity at consistently monitored sites. Indeed, long-term compositional changes have often been estimated using modelling approaches and have rarely been addressed using field data (but see refs. 33,38).

Here we use 406 long-term floristic plots, measured for different time periods since 1971 across 10 countries in South America to estimate the magnitude and direction of tree richness change through time and to identify their drivers. Across this vast space, ranging from −17 to 8.5 latitudinal degrees and −80 to −47 longitudinal degrees, we explore the change in richness through time for the combined area and independently for each of six predefined regions (based on their geomorphological and biogeographical history and contemporaneous geoecological features), as we hypothesize that different regions are responding in different ways, forced by different drivers. Using consistent methods to identify the spatial distribution of diversity change and the factors that contribute to it at a larger scale is crucial to understanding the current status of the Amazon and Andean forests, predicting future patterns and informing conservation efforts. With this comprehensive plot compilation and a set of climatic and structural variables, we intend to answer the following questions. First, using the complete dataset, we ask: (1) How is tree species richness changing across the Andes–Amazon area? Is there an overall decline? and (2) How are changes in richness related to baseline climate, climate change, landscape context and forest structure?

We predict an overall stability of richness, with local increases and declines balancing each other out. However, we expect the change in richness to be associated with several large-scale variables. In particular, we expect a more pronounced decrease in richness in warmer, drier forests at lower elevations given the thermophilization trend where species are ‘migrating' towards higher elevations that usually tend to be colder and wetter. Similarly, we predict a richness decline in forests that are becoming warmer or drier as dealing with this climate becomes physiologically more challenging. We also expect a decrease in species richness in forests with high fragmentation due to the reduced source of colonizers and habitat connectivity. A summary of all the predictors tested and our hypothesized relationships with species richness change is presented in Table 1.

Then, analysing each of six predefined regions separately, we ask: (3) Does the change in tree richness exhibit the same trend in the different regions of the Andes–Amazon area? and (4) Which of the selected predictors explain the change in species richness for each region?

We expect to find a longitudinal gradient in diversity change across the six Andes–Amazon regions driven by the most pressing stressors in each region. In particular, we hypothesize (a) an increase in richness in the Andes as a consequence of thermophilization and a decrease of richness in the Amazon, particularly in the drier and warmer Central-Eastern regions (Guyana Shield, Central-Eastern Amazon and Southern Amazon), due to biotic attrition; (b) temperature will thus be a crucial factor in the Andean trends, while precipitation could be more important in the Amazon; and (c) landscape integrity will have an important role in the more degraded Southern and Central-Eastern Amazon regions

Half of our plots (203) declined in richness, and 146 increased. Richness change varied widely across plots (range −1.95% to +3.3% per year) but had no consistent direction at the Andes–Amazon scale (bootstrapped mean richness change 0.036, mean confidence interval (CI) −0.09 to 0.16, mean t statistic 0.579, mean P value 0.56, degrees of freedom 179) (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We found a negative relationship between richness change and longitude (slope −2.39, adjusted R2 = 0.047, P < 0.001). At −64.5°, which coincides broadly with the transition between the Eastern and Western Amazon, the change in richness shifts from positive (West) to negative (East) values (Fig. 1). There was no significant relationship with latitude.

Source data

In the bivariate regressions with the complete dataset, we found that maximum temperature, precipitation seasonality and precipitation seasonality change had significant negative relationships with richness change (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1; see predictor description in Table 1). Temperature change exhibited a hump-shaped relationship with richness, decreasing slightly where temperatures cooled and more markedly where warming was faster. Annual precipitation, stem abundance change, landscape integrity, elevation and identification effort change had positive significant relationships (Fig. 2). The bootstrapped regressions corrected for spatial bias in plot location supported the representativity of the overall trends found as slope direction and significance coincided for most of the variables (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). The regression with annual precipitation, although always positive, was on average not significant in the bias-corrected analysis, and the one with landscape integrity was typically positive but not significant, probably because of the confounding effect of decreasing tree cover with elevation in the Andes.

Solid lines represent statistically significant regressions (P ≤ 0.05). Shaded ribbons around lines represent 95% CI. For extended statistical results, see Supplementary Table 1.

Source data

When predicting richness change, we observed significant interactions between precipitation seasonality and its change, precipitation seasonality and annual precipitation, and annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality change (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). Species richness declined with increasing precipitation seasonality, but this decline was steeper for less seasonal forests. Species richness in less seasonal forests increased with annual precipitation. We found marginal support for an interaction between the temperature variables, suggesting that warmer forests experiencing further warming lost more species, whereas cooler forests even showed a slight increase in richness.

Richness change was directional in five of the six regions (Fig. 3). Species richness significantly increased in the Northern Andes and Western Amazon, while the Central Andes, Central-Eastern Amazon and Guyana Shield experienced significant declines. Although the Southern Amazon did not show a significant trend, the mean change was negative and included some of the most extreme negative values. The direction of these changes coincided across the other diversity indices tested (Supplementary Table 4), although the significance of the change was more variable because different indices reflect slightly different aspects of diversity change (Supplementary Note 1).

We used a multigroup piecewise structural equation model (SEM) analysis to identify the relationship between the predictor variables and the richness change directly and indirectly. This SEM (Fig. 4) showed a good fit to the data (Fisher's C = 4.232, P = 0.375). The individual R2 for the component models were 0.18 (mortality), 0.27 (stem abundance change) and 0.30 (species richness change). Complete model results are presented in Supplementary Table 5.

Both panels are part of the same SEM, but for easier interpretation, they show general and region-specific relationships separately. a, Significant relationships constrained across the study area, with arrowhead colour indicating negative or positive effects.

For standardized effect sizes of all variables, see Supplementary Table 5.

Source data

Many of the relationships between climate and environmental variables with stem abundance change and mortality rate were constrained (indicating a similar effect) across regions (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3). For stem abundance change, five out of eight variables were constrained, with two of these being significant; for mortality, four out of the eight variables were constrained, with two of them significant. For richness change, 5 out of 11 variables were constrained, with 4 being significant.

Regarding the intermediate factors mediating indirect effects, mortality rate had a significant negative effect on richness in the Central Andes, and stem abundance change had a significant positive effect on richness change in all regions. We computed the indirect effects that the predictors had on richness change mediated by the structural variables when each path coefficient was significant (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).

Only significant (P ≤ 0.05) direct effects are shown. Indirect effects were calculated by multiplying the significant (P ≤ 0.05) standardized coefficients within each of the possible three indirect pathways (via stem abundance change, via mortality rate, and via mortality rate × stem abundance change) and then adding them. The transparency of the bar represents the effect path, with direct effects being opaque and indirect effects transparent. The bar colour indicates the sign of the effect (red is negative, blue is positive). Region colours are shown in the top line for coherence with Fig. 4. For extended results, including specific P values, see Supplementary Tables 5 and 6. For standardized effects of each predictor variable for each region, see Supplementary Table 7.

Source data

Maximum temperature had a total negative effect on richness across regions, while precipitation had a general positive effect. Precipitation seasonality had a strong negative effect in the Andes but positive in the Southern Amazon. Temperature change had a very small negative effect in the Central Andes, Western Amazon and Central-Eastern Amazon. Precipitation change had a large positive effect in the Guyana Shield. Precipitation seasonality change was variable, having a large negative effect in the Northern Andes and Southern Amazon but a positive effect in the Central Andes. Stem abundance change had a positive effect in all regions, while mortality had a negative effect. Landscape integrity had a strong positive effect in the Southern Amazon, weaker positive effects in other regions and a negative effect in the Central Andes. Change in identification effort had a positive direct effect in all regions except the Southern Amazon, while the time frame had very small positive effects in five regions and a negative effect in one region.

We found no overall trend in species richness change across 406 forest-dynamics plots distributed across the tropical Andes and the Amazon. However, this large-scale result masks important regional variations, with richness increasing in the Northern Andes and Western Amazon, while decreasing in the Central Andes, Central-Eastern Amazon and Guyana Shield. This masking or obscuring issue has been raised for global estimations of diversity change based on local trends, and some even question the relevance of these large-scale averages39,40,41. In any case, the absence of a significant overall trend in richness change may also indicate a temporary disequilibrium between current environmental conditions and large-scale vegetation responses42, which should not be misinterpreted as resilience. Lag effects could occur on the leading edge, where trees slowly colonize newly suitable habitats, delaying potential richness gains. Alternatively, lags at the trailing edge could indicate a temporary persistence of species, artificially inflating current richness estimates42. Lowland areas of the Amazonia are expected to experience greater lags due to the long migration distances required to remain at equilibrium with their optimal conditions43. By contrast, mountain regions are thought to have an extinction debt, allowing temporary species accumulation44,45.

Across the Amazon, current tree diversity patterns are largely shaped by seasonality, with higher diversity found in the wet, aseasonal forests of the Western Amazon and lower diversity in the drier, seasonal forests of the Eastern regions46. Our findings on species richness change align with this longitudinal gradient, revealing negative trends in the Eastern regions and positive trends in the Western regions. We first discuss these large-scale patterns, followed by the regional findings that help explain these trends.

Hotter, drier and more seasonal forests and those getting warmer and more seasonal are losing species, but forests with more trees and higher landscape integrity are gaining them. Over the past 40 years, more than 90% of our plots (368/406) have experienced warming with a mean rate of 0.028 ± 0.018 °C per year (321/406 during the individual monitoring periods). Faster-warming forests in the Central-Eastern and Southern Amazon (0.05 ± 0.02 °C per year) are losing species at a higher rate than forests experiencing more moderate warming. In addition, forests in warmer areas within the Andes–Amazon area are also losing more species (Fig. 2). This pattern reflects the contrasting conditions and biotic responses of the Andes and Amazon forests and, supported by the higher rate of species accumulation with increasing elevation (Fig. 2), provides further evidence for thermophilization in the region21,30,47. This phenomenon is also supported by the temperature interaction, where the impact of heating in driving species richness loss depends on the baseline temperature, with hotter forests being more sensitive to a given rate of heating. Nevertheless, most of the forests in the Central Andes that experienced slight cooling (50/76) also showed negative trends in species richness (29/50), probably influenced by a decline in precipitation and an increase in seasonality in all of these plots (29/29). This trend indicates that precipitation change modulates richness responses to temperature.

Rainfall declined in 39% of plots, but its influence was minor relative to that of precipitation seasonality, which increased in 88% of the plots. Forests that are more seasonal—and especially those becoming more seasonal—showed declines in species richness17, with the strongest negative effects in currently less seasonal or wetter forests (that is, higher annual precipitation; Extended Data Fig. 1). These results agreed with findings from the Andean mountain tops, where seasonality across the latitudinal gradient is strongly linked to richness changes, with more aseasonal peaks near the Equator showing richness gains38. While we did not find a latitudinal trend across the study area (Fig. 1), we observed differences between the Northern and Central Andes, which we discuss in detail below.

The more individuals recorded in a census, the larger the gain in the number of species (Fig. 2), as expected because more species from the regional pool have a chance to recruit. This pattern extends beyond individual plots, as forests in less fragmented landscapes (higher landscape integrity), surrounded by more contiguous forest, are more likely to show increases in species richness. By contrast, forests that become more isolated from surrounding fragments tend to experience a decline in species richness36,48,49.

The Western Amazon and Northern Andes are gaining species, while the Central Andes, Guyana Shield and Central-Eastern Amazon are experiencing species loss (Fig. 3). According to the SEM, the processes driving changes in tree density and mortality rates are similar across the Andes–Amazon area (Fig. 4). Generally, mortality rates rose in more seasonal and fragmented forests, while stem abundance declined in warming forests and in forests experiencing higher mortality rates. The relationship between richness change and environmental variables revealed many region-specific drivers, with some variables having opposite effects in different regions, highlighting the context-dependent processes in our vast study area.

The relationship between stem abundance change and richness change was positive across regions. This means that a greater decline in the number of individuals in a plot (in proportion to the initial number) was associated with a more negative change in species richness, and vice versa. Changes in individual abundance are crucial for enabling compositional change, as more recruits increase the likelihood of detecting new species from the local pool50. However, the entry of new species does not necessarily imply a shift in composition outside the existing regional pool, and species loss could reflect local extinctions or shifts within the same pool. Further analysis is needed to determine whether these species are new or are part of the regional pool. All regions showed a negative trend in stem abundance, with the Eastern Amazon (Guyana Shield, Central-Eastern and Southern Amazon) experiencing sharper declines than the Western Amazon and the Andes, which showed higher variability. This is contrary to the results of previous research showing an increase in stem density across 50 Amazonian plots from 1979 to 200251. Although this discrepancy may simply reflect the differing sample sizes and geographical extents of the studies, it could also indicate a recent change in the stem density trend driven by rising temperatures.

Mortality directly affected only the Central Andes, with its effects on other regions mediated through stem abundance change. Thus, the hypothesized disturbance effect of mortality in promoting the colonization of new species is probably limited to the Central Andes.

Across regions, warmer and drier areas are linked to lower rates of richness change. Regional temperature gradients, particularly elevation gradients in the Andes, play a crucial role in richness change. We found an increase in richness in the Northern Andes, which agrees with the reported compositional change caused by the thermophilization process in the area21,30,52 and with research showing a warming-related increase in mountain-top diversity38,44. The encroachment of lower-elevation, warm-adapted species, which would initially be rare in the community, would lead to a potentially temporary increase in the number of species supported by the extinction lag of cold-adapted species that cannot tolerate the new conditions and will eventually become locally extinct53,54. We expected that both Andean regions would share the same pattern; however, the Central Andes showed a decline in richness. Our results suggest that the faster-warming Northern Andes region14 could be more suitable for range shifts than the more moderate—and even cooling—Central Andes (Extended Data Fig. 2). The most important factor determining the richness change in the Northern and Central Andean regions was change in precipitation seasonality, having a negative effect in the Northern Andes and a positive effect in the Central Andes. Across the Andes, precipitation and its seasonality are highly variable, being affected by local orography, orientation and cloud cover14; however, on average, the Central Andes are drier and more seasonal than the Northern Andes, and they are also becoming drier and more seasonal at a faster rate (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 8). We hypothesize that migrating lower-elevation species, particularly those distributed in the Western Amazon, are more likely to succeed expanding into higher elevations of the wetter and less seasonal Northern Andes than in the Central Andes. The Central Andes probably pose a greater barrier from water-related physiological stress (particularly when compared with the Western Amazon) than the Northern Andes. Furthermore, the negative relationship between richness and landscape integrity in the Central Andes probably results from the confounding effect of decreasing tree cover with elevation.

The Western and Central-Eastern Amazon presented a very similar breakdown of driver effects. In both regions, changes in stem abundance were the primary ecological drivers, with minor indirect effects from climate variables, largely mediated by the change in stem abundance. In these regions, forests that are warmer, drier or becoming warmer or drier exhibited declining richness, as these conditions reduce the number of individuals. The Central-Eastern Amazon is drier and is warming faster than the Western Amazon, which could explain the overall richness decrease in the Central-Eastern Amazon as opposed to the increase in the wetter Western Amazon.

In the Southern Amazon, where there was no significant trend in richness change, and in the Guyana Shield, which showed a negative trend, precipitation and its seasonality played predominant roles. In the Guyana Shield, dry forests—and particularly those becoming drier—experienced the greatest species losses. In the Southern Amazon, which is highly seasonal, there is evidence that forests that were more seasonal at baseline tended to gain species; however, increases in precipitation seasonality were associated with richness declines. Nevertheless, in the Southern Amazon (the area with some of the most fragmented forests), landscape integrity exerted the strongest direct effect on richness change: forests embedded within larger, contiguous forested areas tended to gain species, whereas more fragmented forests tended to lose them.

Landscape integrity also had a negative relationship with mortality rate across all regions, indicating that higher landscape integrity supports tree survival, thereby increasing tree abundance, which, in turn, positively impacts richness. This agrees with previous findings on the damaging effects of deforestation and/or degradation in surrounding forests, underscoring the importance of preventing forest fragmentation to support biodiversity conservation55. It also highlights the conservation priority of the Western Amazon–Northern Andes corridor, which appears to be the most feasible pathway for range shifts that could support species persistence.

This study provides a comprehensive assessment of tree richness change in the Andes–Amazon forests using long-term field data. However, we acknowledge that we are working in one of the most diverse and dynamic areas of the planet56, and, as such, there are limitations to our analyses. First, the dataset lacks a historical baseline, so initial conditions may be influenced by uncertain processes39. To minimize bias, we used strict plot selection criteria, excluding plots with any sign of fire or large disturbances and directly including identification effort change and time between censuses as predictors in our analyses. The change in identification effort positively influenced richness change across regions: as more individuals are identified, we encounter more species. Monitoring time had only a small effect on species richness change, where shorter intervals capture more noise relative to the signal than longer intervals.

Second, climatic and environmental data extracted from global databases add uncertainty, especially in topographically complex areas like the Andes. At an even finer scale, it is impossible to know the real climate experienced on the forest floor by each individual tree; further investment in microclimate monitoring in these structurally complex forests is crucial to improve our understanding of climate change effects. Third, we are including only trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 10 cm and are ignoring the potential contribution of smaller size classes to changes in diversity. Finally, there are multiple factors not accounted for in the study that can have important roles in diversity trends. For example, it was beyond the scope of this study to evaluate the roles of past forest history, including Indigenous management, in current richness trends, nor did we evaluate the potential role of biotic pressures (for example, herbivory and pathogens), nor that of conservation efforts and compensation mechanisms, including carbon and biodiversity benefits. Further research should address more complex compositional questions, such as evaluating the taxonomic and functional identities of species being lost or recruited, and whether this indicates that the Andes–Amazon is undergoing taxonomic homogenization, functional homogenization or both.

In conclusion, across the study area, hot, dry and seasonal forests and those becoming warmer and more seasonal are losing species, while forests with higher tree density and higher landscape integrity are gaining them. Our large-scale findings emphasize the critical role of temperature and temperature change in shaping tree richness in the Andes–Amazon area. However, at the regional level, precipitation and its shifts in distribution and annual amounts play more important and region-specific roles, outweighing the influence of temperature57.

This study highlights the uneven impact of changing environmental conditions on tree diversity across different tropical forests, as well as the varied importance of climate and environmental variables across the different regions and scales. Our results underscore the key role of the Northern Andes as a refuge for tree species facing increasingly unsuitable climatic conditions in the Amazon. Finally, our findings highlight the tight relationship between preserving tree abundance and preserving diversity, emphasizing the enormous threat posed by land-use change, which indiscriminately reduces both tree abundance and regional species diversity.

We combined permanent plot data from ForestPlots.net58 (https://forestnet.com/) and from the Madidi project (https://madidiproject.weebly.com). Plot establishment and resurveys were performed by well-trained field teams that followed a detailed protocol that included geolocating plot boundaries, marking subcorners with permanent polyvinyl chloride tubes, taking tree subplot and coordinate data, tagging trees with numbered aluminium tags, and noting and painting the point of measurement. Post-field quality control was carried out by database managers and the field team leader. We selected all plots within the study area (Andean or Amazonian country in areas lower than 4,000 m above sea level (a.s.l.)) that had been censused at least twice. We did not include plots located in the Chocó and the Northern Venezuela regions because of insufficient sample sizes to represent these areas. To avoid the confounding effects of successional trends on diversity change, we included only plots in forests that were undisturbed or had experienced disturbance at least 50 years prior (identified as equivalent to long-term successional forest). For the same reason, we excluded plots that had been recorded on ForestPlots.net as swamp or seasonally flooded forests or as having a history of fire or of large disturbances. We also excluded plots that had been flagged for having taxonomic identification issues.

We obtained curated datasets for each census and plot. For each plot, we selected the first and the last census. Hereafter, we refer to these two censuses as ‘initial' and ‘final'. We ensured that plot area and location exactly matched on both censuses and that the plot sampling strategy was standardized across time. For instance, we excluded palms when they were not measured in every census.

To standardize methodologies, we removed from the dataset subplots (delimited sections within a plot) in which the protocol required a minimum tree DBH greater than 10 cm for inclusion. We also removed all individuals smaller than 10 cm DBH and those belonging to the families Cyclanthaceae and Araceae. Species taxonomic identification was carried out in the field and in the herbaria where reference collections with vouchers are deposited. Any change in an individual's identification was applied across all censuses. To minimize the impact of the change in identification effort (the proportion of individuals identified to species level) between censuses, we restricted our analyses to plots that (1) had more than 50% of the tree individuals identified to species level in the initial census, (2) had a difference in the proportion of identified individuals between first and last census smaller than 10% and (3) had at least 50% of the recruits in the final census identified to species (when there were more than 20 recruits). In some instances, this meant using the next-to-last census within the plot as the final census. The change in the percentage of individuals identified to species level is used in the model as a predictor to account for the potential confounding effect of this factor.

We used the taxonomic name resolution service (TNRS) tool59 (https://tnrs.biendata.org) and R package60 to standardize species names. We manually verified matches with an overall score <0.9, and ‘unclear' and ‘not found' matches. We looked for potential explanations such as spelling errors in the Tropicos (https://www.tropicos.org) and WFO (https://wfoplantlist.org/plant-list) lists, and we either manually modified the accepted name for these species or used only their genus ID if there was no clear option. As the treatment of morphospecies was not curated or standardized across the dataset, we converted any morphospecies codes into ‘Genus indet' format to group morphospecies into genera across the dataset. See the ‘Unidentified species and morphospecies' section for an overview of the process of integrating morphospecies into the analyses.

Given that the plot size varied widely, we grouped plots that were less than 0.5 ha in area if they had other plots within a 7-km radius with no indication of large differences (that is, similar elevation, forest type, soil classification and so on). For quantitative metadata values, such as the time between censuses, we used the mean. We will refer to these plot groupings as ‘plots', given that they are treated as a single unit. We also reduced the size of our biggest plots (plot areas of 25 and 9 ha) by selecting two 1-ha subplots on opposite corners and treating them independently. We then eliminated plots that had intervals of less than 4 years between the two selected censuses, because we considered this time elapsed to be too short to provide mid-to-long-term diversity change information. The time elapsed between the initial and final censuses was used in the model as a predictor to account for its potential confounding effect.

Finally, after preliminary exploration of plot distributions, we removed plots with ten or fewer species in either the initial or final census, as adding or removing even a single species could produce extreme percentage changes (±10%).

After the selection process, our dataset compiled information from 406 plots (or grouped plots) covering ~420 ha (range 0.25–3 ha, mean plot size 1.04 ± 0.26 ha) with a cumulative monitoring time of 4,847 years (range 4.01–44.2, mean 11.94 ± 8.01 years). The earliest census dates were from 1971, and the latest were from 2021 (Supplementary Fig. 4).

We divided the study area into six regions roughly following previous studies61,62,63,64. The division between the Northern and Central Andes was drawn at the border between Peru and Ecuador64. Supplementary Fig. 5 shows the relative floristic similarity of our plots and regions.

We calculated species richness as the number of fully identified species in each plot and census (SP). We calculated the change in species richness (% yr−1) as richness change = (((SPinitial − SPfinal)/SPinitial) × 100)/time; where SPinitial and SPfinal are the richness in the initial and final censuses, respectively, and time is the time interval between the initial and final censuses (in years). Palms (family Arecaceae) were included in the analyses (when included in both the initial and final censuses) as their exclusion did not have a significant effect on the results (Supplementary Fig. 6).

To test whether there was a significant change in richness through time, we used two-sided t-test analyses on richness change both for each of the regions independently and for the combined database. Given that the number of plots was unevenly distributed among the regions, to avoid sampling bias in the combined dataset analysis, we randomly sampled 30 plots per region and carried out a two-sided t-test with this subset. We repeated this process 1,000 times and obtained the averages of the t-test means and P values.

To assess potential linearity issues in the relationship between changes in the number of individuals and species richness, we calculated the change in species richness after rarefying both the initial and final censuses to the minimum number of individuals observed in either census (that is, whichever is lower) (package vegan). The correlation between the resulting rarefied richness change and the non-rarefied estimate (r = 0.74, P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 7) supports the use of richness change and stem abundance change as independent variables (see ‘Predictor variables' section) in the subsequent analyses.

Additional diversity indices and their change through time for each region were calculated using the vegan R package65 and tested in the same way as richness change (Supplementary Note 1).

Despite the considerable identification efforts by all research groups involved in this project, many tree individuals remain unidentified (Indet indet), identified only to the genus level (for example, Ocotea indet) or classified as morphospecies (for example, Ocotea sp1, Ocotea sp2 and so on). These morphospecies codes were maintained through the multiple censuses and retroactively changed to a full species name in the database if one was given; however, the morphospecies criteria were not standardized across plots, nor were they curated. Because there is no obvious way to address these issues, we decided to (1) apply the restrictive selection criteria in terms of identification effort explained above, (2) exclude the unidentified individuals from the dataset, (4) use the genus-level information for the morphospecies (as their classification is not standardized across the dataset) and (4) exclude individuals identified only to the genus level from the species-level analyses. Consequently, some changes in species diversity are not captured due to these exclusions; however, we speculate that such unreported changes are probably caused by a small number of individuals that recruit or die without being identified across multiple censuses and are unlikely to be dominant members of the community.

To support the use of species-level data despite potential issues such as mistakes, changes in botanists and changes in the species concept through time, we calculated the change in genus richness in the same way as the change in species richness (but using the individual's genus-level information, thus including morphospecies). Then, we calculated the correlation between the rate of change in proportional genus and species richness for the combined dataset (r = 0.711) (Supplementary Fig. 8) and for each region independently (Supplementary Table 9). Given the reasonably high correlation between the genus- and species-level richness change, we decided to continue working at the species level. Despite the challenges of working at this scale, we believe it was important to use this very valuable information and to try to address its shortcomings instead of reducing the available information by working at the genus level.

To characterize the average climate and changing patterns for the Andes–Amazon area, we downloaded climatic data from TerraClimate66. We selected this product for its temporal resolution (monthly from 1958 to 2020), its spatial resolution (~4 km) and the availability of data for maximum temperature and annual precipitation. We used the ‘climateR' package67 to download the TerraClimate monthly data from 1979 to 2020 (inclusive) for each of our plot locations based on their coordinates. We restricted the time series to post-1979 because of the higher uncertainty in earlier years. For each year, we used the monthly data to calculate the maximum ‘maximum temperature' (°C), the sum of annual precipitation (mm) and the seasonality of precipitation (using monthly cumulative precipitation, coefficient of variation (CV) = 100 × (standard deviation/mean))68. For each plot, we used the data between 1979 and the year of its final census; for example, if the censuses are in 2000 and 2015, the climate variables provide information from 1979 to 2015. This way, we include any lagged effects of climate on forest dynamics, but we do not include post-census climate events that are not relevant in the database. For each plot, we estimated the mean values for the relevant time period to use as the baseline climate. For the same time period per plot, we performed a linear regression of the variable over time and used the slope as the annual rate of change. We show the relationship between the baseline value and the annual change for these variables (Supplementary Fig. 9). We also calculated the change of each variable in the complete 1979–2020 time period for reference.

To characterize the geography and structure of the area where each of the plots is located, we extracted elevation and landscape integrity from available datasets.

We downloaded and mosaiced the elevation rasters from the SRTM 90-m Digital Elevation Database v.4.1 from CGIAR-CSI69 and extracted the elevation values (m a.s.l.) for our plot locations.

We obtained tree cover data from the Global Forest Cover Change (GFCC) Tree Cover Multi-Year Global 30-m resolution raster70 via Google Earth Engine71. Tree cover is expressed as the percentage of pixel area covered by trees in 2015 (0–100%). We calculated the mean landscape integrity (%) as the mean tree cover for a radius of 50 km around each of the plot locations.

We calculated stem abundance change as the annual rate of proportional change in tree abundance per plot. To calculate this, we first computed the number of live individuals for each plot and census. To calculate the change in the number of individuals, we subtracted the initial from the final number of individuals, divided by the initial number of individuals, and multiplied by 100. Then, to calculate the annual rate of change in the proportional number of individuals, we divided this number by the time elapsed between the censuses. Due to species accumulation curves, this variable is crucial in determining richness change, and, as such, it is treated as an endogenous variable in the SEM.

We calculated the mortality rate (% yr−1) per plot using the ref. 72 equation together with the ref. 73 interval-length correction:

where n0 is the number of stems at the start of the census interval, ns is the number of stems that survive that interval and t is the census interval length.

To account for a potential change in the identification effort (for example, a large increase in individuals identified to genus level only), we calculated the change in the percentage of individuals per plot that were identified to species level in each plot (that is, the change in the percentage of identified individuals). We also included the time frame (years) between the initial and final censuses as a sampling variable. We show the total change in species through time per plot in Supplementary Fig. 10.

Further descriptors of each variable in each region can be found in Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 8.

To investigate the relationship between the predictors and richness change separately for the entire Andes–Amazon area, we performed linear regressions between each of the variables specified above (Table 1) (including census time frame) and the richness change per plot (annual rate of percentage change in richness) for the combined dataset. We explored second-order polynomial relationships for all variables and compared them with linear regressions using analysies of variance. Only temperature change (%) had a better fit using polynomial regression. Mortality rate was log transformed to better fulfil linear model assumptions. To assess the potential interference of spatial bias in the dataset, we bootstrapped each individual linear regression 100 times using random sets of 30 plots per region at each time, and we compared the direction of the slopes and their significance with those obtained from the complete dataset.

Finally, we performed regression analysis with interacting climate variables and richness change. In all cases, model residuals were checked to verify the fulfilment of the linear model assumptions.

To evaluate the effect of the multiple variables directly on the richness change and indirectly via their effect on the stem abundance change and mortality rate, we performed a multigroup piecewise SEM (piecewiseSEM package)74,75 where the regions were the groups. This analysis evaluates the relationships for the combined dataset and each region separately to constrain coefficients with homogeneous effects across regions, leaving the remaining variables to vary freely. The standardized coefficients referred to as the ‘effects' of one variable on another should be interpreted as their relative influence on the mean of the response. We excluded elevation because of the high correlation with maximum temperature (Supplementary Fig. 11) as the piecewise framework is unable to integrate correlated errors in its estimates. The SEM was estimated using three component linear models whose response variables were (1) mortality rate, (2) stem abundance change and (3) species richness change (Supplementary Fig. 12). We tested for normality, heteroscedasticity and the variable importance factor of each of the three component models to verify that the model assumptions were met, and that the inclusion of other variables with moderate correlation (Supplementary Fig. 11) did not create multicollinearity issues (variance inflation factor <4). The structure accounted for both the direct effect of mortality rate on changes in species richness—reflecting its role as a disturbance force that opens space and provides light for recruitment—and the indirect effect of mortality through its influence on changes in stem abundance, acting as a demographic force. Mortality rate was untransformed in order to facilitate the interpretation of results. Changes in identification effort were included only as a predictor of richness change, but not of stem abundance change or mortality rate, as there is no causal connection between these variables—an observation supported by the directed separation tests (P > 0.05) automatically performed in the piecewise analyses (Supplementary Table 10). We maintained this relatively simple partitioning of indirect paths to balance intrinsic uncertainty, the number of predictor variables, and a reduced sample size per region when applying the multigroup approach.

To estimate the indirect effects for each predictor and region, we multiplied the standardized path coefficients for each significant path (for example, maximum temperature → stem abundance change → richness change), considering paths via stem abundance change, mortality rate, and the longer combined path through stem abundance change and mortality rate. We computed these indirect effects only when each path coefficient was significant (P ≤ 0.05). Then, we added the indirect effects obtained by the three potential pathways and added them to estimate the total indirect effect of each predictor on richness change for each region. The direct effects are the standardized coefficients for the path between each predictor and the richness change for each region.

Our experiences contain countless details that may be important in the future, yet we rarely know which will matter and which will not. This uncertainty poses a difficult challenge for adaptive decision-making, as failing to preserve relevant information can prevent us from making good choices later on. One solution to this challenge is to store detailed memories of individual experiences that can be flexibly accessed whenever their details become relevant. By allowing us to store and recall specific events in vivid detail, the human episodic memory system provides exactly this capacity. Yet, whether and how this ability supports adaptive behaviour is poorly understood. Here we aimed to determine whether people use detailed episodic memories to make decisions when future task demands are uncertain. We hypothesized that the episodic memory system's ability to store events in great detail allows us to reference any of these details if they later become relevant. We tested this hypothesis using a novel decision-making task in which participants encoded individual events with multiple features and later made decisions based on these features to maximize their earnings. Across 5 experiments (total n = 535), we found that participants referenced episodic memories during decisions in feature-rich environments and that they did so specifically when it was unclear at encoding which features would be needed in the future. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental adaptive function of episodic memory, showing how its rich representational capacity enables flexible decision-making under uncertainty.

Guinea-Bissau will implement a universal birth-dose policy for the Hepatitis B vaccine in 2027.Credit: Enrique Lopez-Tapia/Nature Picture Library/Alamy

Public health authorities in Guinea-Bissau say that they have suspended a controversial US-funded hepatitis B vaccine study that has raised questions about who has authority over clinical research conducted in Africa. At a press conference held today, officials from Guinea-Bissau's ministry of health said that the study was being suspended pending a technical and ethical review by its national public health institute. The announcement followed weeks of conflicting statements as to whether or not the trial would proceed. 

“There has been no sufficient coordination in order to take a final decision regarding the study,” said Quinhin Nantote, the minister of public health for Guinea-Bissau. “Faced with this situation, we decided to suspend it.” 

The meeting, convened by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), comes after an official with the organization signalled last week that the trial would not proceed. In an e-mail to Nature today, officials at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a prominent funder of the research, said that the study was still on track, leaving the trial's status still uncertain.

“The study is proceeding as planned and we continue to work with our partners to finalize the study's protocols,” wrote Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the HHS. 

The continuing row shines a spotlight on long-standing tensions for clinical research trials in Africa. African scientists say that the Guinea-Bissau study shows how political pressure, funding interests and fragmented oversight can push local health priorities aside.

The hepatitis B vaccine trial was designed by researchers at the Bandim Health Project (Projecto de Saúde) out of the University of Southern Denmark, and funded in part through a US$1.6 million research grant from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, part of the HHS. The study aims to randomize 14,000 newborns in Guinea-Bissau starting in early 2026 to either receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth or not, before the country's planned universal birth-dose vaccine policy begins in 2027.

The Bandim researchers have said that the study is a chance to investigate whether the vaccine has broader effects on infant health outcomes.

But several scientists have argued that by randomizing newborns to not receive the vaccine, the trial denies a safe and life-saving intervention to infants in Guinea-Bissau, which has a hepatitis B prevalence of about 19%. The immune systems of newborns are immature and about 90% of people infected at birth go on to develop chronic, lifelong infections which may lead to liver disease and early death.

Researchers who oppose the study argue that it is structured in a way that increases the likelihood of detecting harm from the birth dose, even if that harm is not real or clinically meaningful. “They're trying to use African children to prove a case for reducing vaccines in the US,” says Seye Abimbola, a professor of health systems at the University of Sydney in Australia, who researches decolonizing global health. “That's problematic.” The United States removed its own recommendations for a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine earlier this year.

Bandim Health did not respond to Nature's request for comments on the study design. Hilliard at the HHS said that the research “is based on the highest scientific and ethical standards”.

United States Customs and Border Protection is paying General Dynamics to create a prototype of “quantum sensors” alongside a “database with artificial intelligence” designed “to detect illicit objects and substances (such as fentanyl) in vehicles, containers, and other devices,” according to a contract justification published in a federal register last week.

“This database and sensor project will integrate advanced quantum and classical sensing technologies with Artificial Intelligence and ultimately deploy proven concepts and end products anywhere in the CBP environment,” the justification document reads. “Under this requirement, CBP will take additional steps to enhance its ability to detect, and thus, significantly reduce the harms of illicit contraband entering the United States of America, thus bolstering national security.”

The document redacts the name of the company developing the prototype; however, contract details included in the federal register entry reveal that the justification is for a $2.4 million General Dynamics contract that has been public since December 2025.

CBP and General Dynamics did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment.

CBP's request for a prototype of “quantum sensors” with an AI database—which comes amid a widespread push within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “to support the adoption and scaling of AI technologies,” according to a strategy memorandum published last year—involves a real and growing area of scientific and technological research.

Last week's justification does not get into detail about which methods its “quantum sensors” would use or what information the AI database would store and analyze. However, it does provide hints about detection methods the agency has considered.

The document claims that CBP conducted market research from April through October of 2025. In July, CBP published an information request seeking a vendor for exactly 35 handheld "Gemini” analyzers, sold by Thermo Fisher Scientific, which are designed to identify unknown chemicals and narcotics.

DHS has also tested the Gemini in previous years, according to reports published in 2021 and 2023. The July request—which notes that the devices would be used to identify substances like fentanyl, ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, diazepam, and MDMA—makes no mention of artificial intelligence or a database.

“The detection equipment will be used by CBP Officers in non-intrusive testing to detect a wide range of narcotics, controlled substances, unknown substances, and general organic materials,” the request reads, noting that the agency “continues to seize an increasing number of opioids at the nation's borders.”

The July request for information claims that the Gemini analyzers use “Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),” which measures how much infrared light a sample absorbs, and “Raman spectroscopy,” which measures how light scatters off the surface of a sample when a laser is directed at it.

Last week's contract justification says that the agency found an American company that creates a “handheld analyzer” for identifying dangerous chemicals but claimed it “cannot detect fentanyl.” It's unclear whether this was referring to Gemini or one of the more than 10 other devices DHS tested in 2021 and 2023. But when reached for comment, Thermo Fisher Scientific said that its Gemini analyzers “are designed to detect fentanyl.”

It's also unclear whether the General Dynamics prototype may use FTIR or Raman spectroscopy. But a 2024 working paper about a laboratory-based fentanyl-detection method (unrelated to CBP, General Dynamics, or Thermo Fisher Scientific) notes that “portable Raman spectrometers” and other handheld devices—though convenient, fast, and inexpensive—can “struggle with detection of fentanyl” and may be prone to “false-positive and false-negative results.”

While it remains ambiguous what exactly last week's justification was referring to with its mention of “quantum” sensors, there are fentanyl detection methods based in quantum chemistry. The 2024 paper, for instance, explains how “quantum dots” and fluorescent dye can be used to detect fentanyl and 58 of its analogues.

Matthew Webber, an engineering professor and molecular science researcher at the University of Notre Dame and one of the coauthors on the 2024 paper, tells WIRED that the “quantum dots” are an artificially made, graphene-based nanomaterial. When combined with a fluorescent dye and a synthetic molecule that acts like a “basket,” Webber says, there's visible and quantifiable fluorescence. When a few micrograms of fentanyl are added to this mixture, Webber says, it sticks to the quantum dots and “outcompetes” the fluorescent dye, causing a loss of fluorescence.

Webber notes that all fentanyl-related lab research is conducted in a “super-controlled environment,” and never entails large quantities of fentanyl for legal, practical, and safety reasons. He emphasizes the sensitive nature of discussing fentanyl research, and says that labs like his never have bags of fentanyl laying around, an incorrect impression some people may have.

When asked about CBP's request for an “AI database” accompanying the quantum sensors, Webber says that AI could potentially help with matters like “spectral deconvolution.”

“If you have signals coming from multiple agents within a mixture, the eye may not be able to see to deconvolve the spectra into individual components, Webber says. “But there's potentially AI-based specialty convolution frameworks that could be powerful in that context.”

In other words, since new street drugs can constantly move the goalposts of detection, an AI-based system that processes images and recognizes patterns may catch fentanyl in situations where a human could miss it.

Microsoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, Forbes reported on Friday.

Many modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is enabled by default. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off. 

But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft's cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.

The case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects' hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker. 

A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year. 

Apart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft's cloud infrastructure — something that has happened several times in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.

“It's 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a post on Bluesky. “Microsoft's inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”

2026 looks to be a bad year for gamers' wallets.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new leak from tech YouTuber der8auer claims that Nvidia is ending a program dubbed "OPP", purportedly an incentive scheme used by Nvidia to ensure that at least some of its graphics cards were sold to consumers at MSRP by AIBs like Asus and others.

By way of historical background, the creator said in his YouTube video that Nvidia's GPUs were previously being sold for way above the suggested retail price for the last few generations, and consumers were starting to notice and complain about it. So, the company instituted the OPP program, which, according to de8auer's sources, is some sort of cash back for participating AIB partners. Although the techtuber does not know what OPP stands for, this is how it allegedly works: board partners sell some models at MSRP and then report that back to Nvidia, after which the GPU manufacturer would give them a rebate on the cost of the chip and the memory of that particular GPU they sold.

According to der8auer's leak, Nvidia apparently stopped this program a few days ago. The sources did not say the reason behind the move, although it is easy to surmise that it's caused by the ongoing memory crisis. We've reached out to Nvidia for comment. There were rumors late last year that the company no longer bundled VRAM with the GPU chips that board partners ordered, but Nvidia refuted this at CES, telling HardwareLuxx [machine translated], “No changes on how Nvidia is handling the memory allocation.”

If the OPP program is indeed real, it seems that the continuous increase in memory pricing is making it difficult even for Team Green, with its record revenues fueled by the boom in AI infrastructure build-out, to sustain the GPU and memory subsidy that allows board partners to at least sell some models at MSRP.

Aside from the end of the “OPP,” der8auer also touched on the recent RTX 5070 Ti news. Another YouTube channel, Hardware Unboxed, was told by an Asus representative that the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB have been discontinued or marked as end-of-life (EOL). Asus refuted this a few hours later, saying that “Certain media may have received incomplete information from an Asus PR representative regarding these products,” and that “Asus has no plans to stop selling these models.”

However, industry sources reportedly told the tech tuber that Nvidia is prioritizing the RTX 5080 over the RTX 5070 Ti for its GB 203 supply. Both GPU models use the same chip, but since the GB 203 has a high yield rate, it's been rumored that the GPU manufacturer wants to maximize its profits and prioritize the more expensive RTX 5080. Because of this, some say that the supply for the 5070 Ti will be heavily cut and that it's going to be shifted towards the 5080.

Nevertheless, that does not mean we expect to see RTX 5080 prices to drop. In fact, the opposite has been true in recent days, with prices for different RTX 5080 models from various AIBs showing an increasing trend on Amazon. And with demand for both memory and AI chips remaining strong, we don't expect gamers and their wallets to get a reprieve anytime soon.

New year, new Startup Radar.

We're back with our regular spotlight on early stage startups sprouting up in the Seattle region. For this edition, we're featuring Axel AI, DrunR, Eluum, and profileAPI.

Read on for brief descriptions of each company — along with pitch assessments from “Mean VC,” a GPT-powered critic offering a mix of encouragement and constructive criticism.

Check out past Startup Radar posts here, and email me at [email protected] to flag other companies and startup news.

Founded: 2024

The business: A self-described “reasoning layer” for retail media sales teams that aims to translate messy data into commercial narratives and proposals. The idea is to help sales teams spend less time on manual analysis and preparation. The bootstrapped company officially launched its MVP at CES and NRF 2026 earlier this month.

Leadership: CEO and co-founder Bobby Figueroa previously founded Gradient, another Seattle-based commerce insights company that was acquired by Criteo. He was also an exec at Amazon. Axel's leadership and advisory team includes former sales and advertising leaders at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

Mean VC: “You're targeting a real friction point — sales teams juggling fragmented data with limited time to craft a compelling narrative. The pedigree helps, but long-term success will hinge on whether your product drives actual revenue lift, not just cleaner decks. I'd focus on embedding directly into the sales team's existing workflow — don't make users open another tool, make yours the one that quietly does the heavy lifting behind the scenes.”

Founded: 2024

The business: A nutrition app that provides personalized guidance based on users' goals and preferences, particularly while dining out or ordering food online. DrunR is running a closed beta in Seattle with restaurants and users, including people using GLP-1 medication. The startup is part of the WTIA Founder Cohort 13 program.

Leadership: Founder and CEO Yaya Ali is a financial analyst at Perkins Coie and previously worked for King County and Amazon. He also has food operations experience. David Greene, the company's CTO, is a software engineer at Capital One and previously worked at Moody's.

Mean VC: “The intersection of nutrition, personalization, and GLP-1s is timely — especially as eating habits shift alongside new weight-loss drugs. The challenge will be making the app feel essential day-to-day, not just ‘nice to have' after a restaurant meal or clinic visit. I'd zero in on a high-frequency use case — something that keeps users opening the app daily, not just when they're thinking about dinner.”

Founded: 2024

The business: A new take on social media with a product that helps people organize their personal memories, stories, and digital artifacts into one user-controlled system. Built on community-driven moderation and works across different platforms. The bootstrapped company is onboarding early users and plans to launch a MVP later this year. 

Leadership: CEO and co-founder Bilkay Rose was a VP at tax software company Avalara and a director at Clearwire. Other co-founders include CTO Dale Rector, who spent three decades at Microsoft, and Jennifer Gianola, also a former exec at Avalara. 

Mean VC: “The concept taps into a real emotional need — people are overwhelmed by digital clutter and increasingly skeptical of algorithm-driven feeds. The key will be showing how your platform earns daily use without relying on dopamine loops. I'd push to define a sharp use case first — memory curation is broad, so lead with one thing people urgently want to preserve, then expand once you've earned their trust.”

Founded: 2024

The business: A business data layer for developers building AI-native chat, copilot, and agentic tools for go-to-market. Its platform tracks more than 10,000 signals across more than 10 million companies and 500 million professionals. The company, which was previously a sales AI agent product called Truebase, has raised $2 million in funding. 

Leadership: Founder and CEO Wissam Tabbara has sold two startups and spent more than six years at Microsoft in the 2000s. 

Mean VC: “The shift from product to platform is smart — selling infrastructure to power GTM copilots has stronger upside than building another agent. But you'll need to show that your data isn't just broad, but relevant and timely enough to drive meaningful in-app decisions. I'd focus on becoming the plug-and-play GTM brain — make integration dead simple, and let other tools build magic on top of your stack.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning to visit India in mid-February, his first visit to the country in nearly a year, TechCrunch has learned. The visit comes as New Delhi prepares to host a major AI summit expected to draw top executives from Meta, Google, and Anthropic.

India is hosting its first major AI event — the India AI Impact Summit 2026 — in New Delhi between February 16 and 20, bringing together global technology leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei alongside key Indian business figures like Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, per the summit's website. Altman is not currently listed as a confirmed attendee.

But TechCrunch has learned that OpenAI is separately planning to host closed-door meetings on the sidelines of the summit in New Delhi, where Altman is expected to be present. The company is also hosting an OpenAI event in New Delhi on February 19, with venture capitalists and industry executives invited, one person familiar with the matter said.

Altman's visit has not been publicly announced and plans could still change, the sources said.

Several other U.S. companies are also planning side events around the summit week. Anthropic is hosting a developers' day in Bengaluru on February 16, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Nvidia is also set to hold an evening event in New Delhi during the summit week, people familiar with the plans told TechCrunch. (The GPU maker did not respond to requests for comment.) The cluster of events underscores how global AI firms are seeking to engage India's enterprise customers, startup ecosystem, and developer community.

The trip would mark Altman's first visit to India in nearly a year, after he traveled to the country in February 2025. Altman had previously said he planned to return later in 2025 following OpenAI's August announcement of a New Delhi office, but that trip did not take place.

Altman's visit also comes as India has emerged as a key growth market for American AI companies. In recent months, Anthropic announced an office in Bengaluru and named former Microsoft India managing director Irina Ghose as its local head, while Google and Perplexity have struck partnerships with Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, respectively, to bundle premium AI subscriptions for millions of telecom users.

OpenAI has been expanding its India presence in recent months, hiring across enterprise sales, technical deployment, and legal roles focused on AI regulation. The company is currently listing openings in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. India has emerged as ChatGPT's biggest market by downloads and second largest by users. Still, OpenAI has faced challenges converting that demand into paid subscriptions, introducing a lower-priced “ChatGPT Go” plan last year priced under $5 and offering it free for a year to drive uptake.

Altman is expected to meet key tech executives, startup founders, and government officials during the trip, the sources said, as OpenAI looks to expand ChatGPT's enterprise adoption while still broadening its reach as a mass-market product. The company has been engaging with multiple sectors in India, including education and media, the people added.

OpenAI is also looking at India as a potential base for infrastructure expansion, the sources said. Last year, both Google and Microsoft announced multibillion-dollar investments in India to expand their AI and cloud footprint. But India's data-center ambitions face constraints, including uneven power availability, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating costs for cloud providers.

Still, the Indian government is hopeful that the upcoming summit will cement India's status as a destination for large-scale AI investment. The country's IT minister said in a recent interview that the event could help attract as much as $100 billion in investment. The federal government is also pushing domestic startups to build smaller models for local use cases, eventually reducing reliance on U.S.-based systems.

OpenAI, India's IT ministry, and the AI summit's organizers did not respond to requests for comment.

Anbernic, the company that has brought us a mountain of retro gaming handhelds over the last several years, is ready to get into high-end peripherals with a controller built for the cross-section of hypochondriacs and gamers. Not only does this controller have a built-in screen, but it also has heart rate sensors inside each controller grip, helping you identify when you're getting a little too into the game you're playing.

Keeping with its typical naming conventions, Anbernic is calling its first pro-level controller the RG G01. The RG in Anbernic's nomenclature stands for “retro gaming,” though there's little about this controller that recalls past screen-based control schemes like the old spaceship-shaped Sega Dreamcast controller. Anbernic's gamepad uses two sensors on either side of the controller grips to measure heart rate and alert you if you may be playing too hard. This data shows up on a 2.5-inch IPS LCD screen shoved in the center of the gamepad. Don't worry, that screen has uses other than just telling you if you need to calm down after a grueling session of Battlefield 6.

Is this controller solving some kind of problem with gamers having heart-related health incidents? A 2023 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology looked at patients at the Mayo Clinic's genetic heart rhythm clinic from 2000 to 2022 and found that heart-related medical incidents when gaming were extremely rare for people with genetic heart conditions. A controller like this may be able to help you if you're concerned your heart rate is impacting performance. On the whole, the RG G01 suggests it's more fun to watch your ECG (electrocardiogram) pump along while you try to not get stomped in your next Call of Duty match.

You already expect a high-end controller to have Hall effect or TMR (tunneling magnetoresistance) joysticks, though Anbernic is going a step further. It's packing the RG G01 with Purple Kirin inductive joysticks, which use capacitive sensing. This measures a small electric current to detect movement and convert that into digital signals that the controller uses for movement. Unlike Hall effect, this type of stick doesn't use any magnetic fields to detect stick orientation. The RG G01 has a touted 1,000Hz polling rate in both wired and 2.4GHz wireless modes, meaning it's a fast controller for those who detest any latency in their controls.

Otherwise, Anbernic's new controller sports many of the same high-end features we're used to, like 6-axis gyroscopes that are compatible with systems like Nintendo Switch 2. It also has two-stage trigger locks for when you want a full analog trigger or a rapid-fire sensation for first-person shooters. The back buttons are programmable with macros that could prove useful for fighting games. If you don't find the screen all that appealing, the clear plastic shell lets you see the haptic rumble motors in action.

Honestly, it's that small detail alone that sold me on the RG G01's appeal, far more than the odd heartbeat sensor. It will come in white, gray, and yellow color schemes and should work on PC, Switch, Android, and iOS. The controller is “coming soon,” though as for price, it's anyone's guess. Anbernic's only other controller, the RG P01, sells for $18. The RG G01 will likely cost more, though we doubt it will be anywhere near as expensive as Nintendo's own $90 Switch 2 Pro gamepad.

One of our favorite budget headsets just got cheaper


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 remains a recommended budget gaming headset and earned a four-star rating in our review back in 2022. The headset is currently available at just $19.99 over at Woot, the Amazon-owned daily deals website. With a launch price of $59.99 this headset usually sells for around $30-$40, but for a limited period you can grab one at its lowest price ever provided you have an Amazon Prime membership.

Featuring a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, the Arctis Nova 1 is compatible with a wide range of devices, including PC, PS5/PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and more. It comes with custom high-fidelity 40mm drivers with a frequency response of 20 - 22,000 Hz and an impedance of 36Ω. These are the same drivers that SteelSeries uses on the more premium Nova 3 and Nova 7 headsets.

All-time low price 

The Arctis Nova 1 is an excellent analog headset for gaming, chatting, streaming, and listening to music. It comes with a lightweight design, fully-retractable mic, and support for a wide range of gaming devices.  

In our testing, we found the headset to offer great sound during gaming sessions, particularly when paired with SteelSeries' Sonar audio software suite, which offers 360-degree spatial audio and a gaming-oriented parametric EQ. The built-in bidirectional ClearCast Gen 2 noise-canceling microphone comes with a fully-retractable design and a flexible arm for easy positioning. While the mic isn't the best when it comes to noise isolation, you can tune it using SteelSeries' dedicated software with an EQ and a handful of noise-reduction features, including AI-powered noise-cancellation.

As for the design, the Arctis Nova 1 comes with a plastic headband, an adjustable elastic headband strap, and height-adjustable rotating earcups. Weighing at just 236g/0.52lbs, wearing the headset for long periods should not be a concern. Additionally, the “AirWeave” earcups feature memory foam cushions covered in a breathable mesh fabric that offer a comfortable fit for your ears.

At $19.99, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for their first gaming headset, a reliable backup, or even a solid gift for a gamer. It delivers comfort and good sound quality well above what you'd expect at this price.

We've all been there. We lost some part of our digital life, perhaps because we accidentally deleted it or a system failed us in some way. Well, a professor in Germany lost a large amount of work recently after changing his settings with OpenAI's ChatGPT, writing about it this week in Nature. But social media users don't seem very sympathetic. In fact, they're now repeatedly dunking on him for using AI in the first place.

Marcel Bucher, a professor of plant sciences at the University of Cologne, writes that he signed up for a paid ChatGPT plan two years ago and found the AI tool tremendously useful.

“Having signed up for OpenAI's subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, I used it as an assistant every day — to write e-mails, draft course descriptions, structure grant applications, revise publications, prepare lectures, create exams and analyse student responses, and even as an interactive tool as part of my teaching,” wrote Bucher.

He acknowledged that ChatGPT, like all large language models, could be inaccurate, but liked it because it could remember the context of conversations, and he valued the “continuity and apparent stability of the workspace.” Then he tinkered with the settings for data consent.

From Nature:

But in August, I temporarily disabled the ‘data consent' option because I wanted to see whether I would still have access to all of the model's functions if I did not provide OpenAI with my data. At that moment, all of my chats were permanently deleted and the project folders were emptied — two years of carefully structured academic work disappeared. No warning appeared. There was no undo option. Just a blank page. Fortunately, I had saved partial copies of some conversations and materials, but large parts of my work were lost forever.

Bucher went on to explain that he initially thought it was a mistake and assumed that he would be able to recover his years of data. He reinstalled the app, tried different browsers, and tinkered with more settings. But nothing worked. He then tried to contact OpenAI but was predictably met with an AI agent, which couldn't help him. He eventually was able to contact a human, but they couldn't help him either. The data was gone.

Again, this is the kind of story that would've likely elicited some sympathy in another era. But here in 2026, when AI is often seen as a slop machine for generating wrong answers and child sexual abuse material, there are more than a few people who will revel in someone losing all their AI chats.

“Amazing sob story: ‘ChatGPT deleted all the work I hadn't done',” one Bluesky user wrote.

“Maybe next time, actually do the work you are paid to do *yourself*, instead of outsourcing it to the climate-killing, suicide-encouraging plagiarism machine,” wrote another another. Others floated the possibility that the essay in Nature wasn't even written by Bucher.

“This is the dumbest shit I've read in a quite a while,” a Bluesky user wrote. “(But, in his defense: there is no particular reason to assume that the guy who published this actually wrote it himself.)”

Bucher did make the point that he was being encouraged to use AI in his work, and there's validity to that complaint. Large institutions are telling their workers to incorporate AI more often under the theory that it's some kind of inevitable future:

We are increasingly being encouraged to integrate generative AI into research and teaching. Individuals use it for writing, planning and teaching; universities are experimenting with embedding it into curricula. However, my case reveals a fundamental weakness: these tools were not developed with academic standards of reliability and accountability in mind.

If a single click can irrevocably delete years of work, ChatGPT cannot, in my opinion and on the basis of my experience, be considered completely safe for professional use.

It remains to be seen whether generative AI will truly transform the workplace in ways that actually matter, especially as workers are more skeptical and bosses try to insist on its use. Whatever happens, there will likely be plenty of AI skeptics around to celebrate when someone loses a bunch of work.

Among PC enthusiasts, Lian Li's reputation for blending functionality with aesthetics has established them as an industry leader.

This review examines the RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU, representing Lian Li's most sophisticated approach to power supply design. Would this cutting-edge design earn it a spot in our list of best power supplies? The RS1200G introduces a rotatable AC power receptacle, a world-first innovation that fundamentally rethinks PSU orientation and cable management. This mechanism allows the modular cable connectors to exit from either the rear or left side of the chassis, adapting to different case architectures. The implementation appears more versatile than competing solutions, though it introduces its own compatibility requirements. Complementing this mechanical innovation is an optional magnetic USB hub that can mount directly to the PSU, expanding connectivity options for modern systems.

The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU arrives in a sizable cardboard box with a predominantly black theme and blue accents. The unit itself dominates the front side, establishing immediate visual recognition. Protection is substantial, with the PSU enclosed in a protective pouch and surrounded by dense foam packaging inserts designed to withstand shipping stresses.

 




The bundle is comprehensive, exceeding typical PSU inclusions. Beyond the standard AC power cable and mounting hardware, Lian Li provides a magnetic USB hub capable of mounting anywhere within the chassis or directly on the PSU. Two USB cables accompany the hub, offering users a choice between internal motherboard header connection or rear panel USB routing. A specialized backplate with a cable routing notch enables clean exits when necessary. Magnetic cable organizers are included to replace traditional zip ties, offering repositionable cable management. Cable combs arrive pre-attached to select cables, with additional units included for user customization. Finally, Lian Li includes some basic cable ties as well.

All cables utilize an all-black aesthetic with black connectors and wires. The cables employ a flat, ribbon-line construction that simplifies routing in tight spaces. The ATX 24-pin and PCIe 12V-2x6 cables receive premium treatment with per-wire sleeving and factory-installed combs. The cable configuration proves conservative for a 1200W unit, providing one 12V-2x6 connector and five 6+2 pin PCI Express connectors distributed across four cables. The unit's maximum output rating at 40 degrees Celsius and the number of connectors hint that it is not a platform meant to be severely stressed.

The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU measures 150mm in length, barely exceeding standard ATX dimensions. This compact form factor is remarkable for a 1200W unit. The matte black chassis paint job demonstrates excellent finishing quality, with smooth surfaces free from manufacturing defects.

The design philosophy diverges dramatically from conventional PSU architecture. Modular cable connectors populate virtually every side of the chassis, enabled by the rotatable AC power receptacle. This receptacle represents the unit's defining feature, allowing users to shift modular cable connectors between rear and left-side positions. The implementation permits direct cable routing to the motherboard panel's backside in compatible cases. This appears more sophisticated than competing solutions, as users maintain orientation control based on case requirements. Cases supporting side cable routing can utilize that configuration, while traditional cases can employ rear routing.

A significant limitation exists. The 24-pin connector location inverses relative to other connectors depending on AC receptacle orientation. When standard connectors exit rearward, the 24-pin exits left. When standard connectors exit left, the 24-pin exits rearward. This necessitates cases always accommodate at least the 24-pin connector routing behind the motherboard, effectively eliminating universal compatibility.

 




The right side is perforated, as rotational capability means this surface can become the front depending on AC receptacle positioning. The fan finger guard integrates directly into the chassis, displaying a unique geometric cutout pattern mixing squares and rectangles. The rear side, which alternates with the left depending on inlet orientation, incorporates a specialized slot for the USB hub. When positioned here, the USB hub draws power directly from the PSU without requiring a SATA connector.

 




The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU employs a Hong Hua 135mm fan utilizing a fluid dynamic bearing engine. FDB designs represent optimal acoustic-to-reliability balance, maintaining low operational noise at elevated speeds while delivering strong mean time between failure figures. The fan specification includes a high 2300 RPM maximum speed, though the unit's zero-RPM mode means extended periods of fanless operation while the system is idling.

 




The PSU originates from Sirfa, a Chinese OEM whose designs have graced numerous mid-to-top tier power supplies over the past two decades. Sirfa's experience shows in the platform's assembly quality and component selection, though some choices reflect cost optimization rather than absolute premium positioning.

The input filtering stage provides adequate protection with four Y capacitors, two X capacitors, and two filtering inductors. Most filtering components mount on a vertical daughterboard, optimizing spatial efficiency and freeing the AC receptacle for movement. Two rectifying bridges are installed on a substantial heatsink immediately following the filtration stage.

 




The APFC circuitry employs two SRC60R608BS MOSFETs and a diode, positioned on a large heatsink spanning the PCB edge. One encased inductor and two EPCOS (TDK) capacitors totaling 1210 μF comprise the passive components. The total capacitance is massive and EPCOS component quality is top-tier. These German-manufactured capacitors offer superior thermal and mechanical stress resistance compared to most alternatives but are very costly and we rarely see their products even in top-tier units.

 




In the primary stage, two SRC60R095BS MOSFETs form a half-bridge primary inversion topology. These components are on a separate heatsink positioned after the APFC bulk capacitors. Heatsink dimensions are generous, providing substantial surface area for heat dissipation even under sustained high-power operation.

 




The secondary stage utilizes eight Infineon 10N04NM6 MOSFETs distributed across two vertical daughterboards, generating the primary 12V rail through synchronous rectification. The absence of dedicated heatsinks for these components hints their exceptional efficiency characteristics. DC-to-DC converter circuits on another vertical daughterboard generate the 3.3V and 5V rails from the primary 12V output.

 




Secondary side capacitors originate entirely from Teapo, a reputable Taiwanese manufacturer. While Teapo lacks the prestige of premium Japanese manufacturers like Nippon Chemi-Con or Rubycon, they maintain solid reliability records and appropriate specifications for this application. This represents a pragmatic compromise between cost and quality for a unit with a 10-year warranty.

For the testing of PSUs, we are using high precision electronic loads with a maximum power draw of 2700 Watts, a Rigol DS5042M 40 MHz oscilloscope, an Extech 380803 power analyzer, two high precision UNI-T UT-325 digital thermometers, an Extech HD600 SPL meter, a self-designed hotbox and various other bits and parts.

The Lian Li RS1200G PSU achieves average nominal load efficiency of 90.0% with 115 VAC input and 92.0% with 230 VAC input, measured across the 10% to 100% load range. These results comfortably satisfy 80 Plus Gold and CLEAResult Gold certification requirements. The unit received Cybenetics Platinum certification based on average efficiency calculations, though efficiency dips at maximum load prevented higher certifications from the other two certifying bodies. Lian Li markets this as Gold-certified, likely avoiding internal competition with their premium product lines.

Efficiency peaks near 40% load and maintains fairly good stability across most operational ranges. Very low load efficiency remains good, an important characteristic for modern systems spending significant time in idle states. The fan initiates rotation when load exceeds approximately 300 Watts but maintains very low speeds up to 800 Watts. Beyond 900 Watts, fan speed increases substantially though it still remains below half maximum capability.

During elevated ambient temperature testing, the Lian Li RS1200G PSU exhibits notable efficiency degradation. Average nominal load efficiency drops to 88.4% with 115 VAC input and 90.3% with 230 VAC input. Signs of thermal stress emerge at maximum load, though they remain within acceptable operational parameters. This is a product rated for maximum output at 40°C and, although it can reach its maximum output at a higher temperature, the signs of stress are apparent.

Fan behavior shifts considerably under thermal stress. Activation occurs earlier, engaging at approximately 250 Watts load. The fan maintains slow rotation up to 600 Watts, after which speed increases progressively until reaching maximum at 90% load. Maximum load operation produces significant noise levels, though this represents expected behavior for a compact, Gold-certified 1200W unit under thermal stress. Internal temperatures remain within acceptable operational levels throughout testing.

The Lian Li RS1200G demonstrates outstanding power quality performance. Maximum ripple measured 26 mV on the 12V rail, 14 mV on the 5V rail, and 14 mV on the 3.3V rail, all substantially below industry safety limits and representing excellent performance considering test conditions and massive power output capability. Voltage regulation proves equally impressive, maintaining 0.9% on the 12V rail, 0.7% on the 5V rail, and 0.6% on the 3.3V rail. These figures indicate exceptional power quality across all voltage outputs under varying load conditions.

During our thorough assessment, we evaluate the essential protection features of every power supply unit we review, including Over Current Protection (OCP), Over Voltage Protection (OVP), Over Power Protection (OPP), and Short Circuit Protection (SCP). OCP activates at 126% on the 3.3V rail, 128% on the 5V rail, and 112% on the 12V rail. OPP triggers at 110% during hot testing. These protection thresholds are exceptionally sharp, particularly for an ATX 3.1 certified unit.

The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU represents genuine innovation in power supply design, addressing cable management challenges through mechanical ingenuity rather than incremental improvements. The rotatable AC inlet provides unprecedented installation flexibility, adapting to diverse case architectures while maintaining compact ATX dimensions. This feature alone distinguishes the RS1200G from conventional offerings, though it introduces specific compatibility requirements that potential buyers must carefully evaluate. The 24-pin connector placement creates an inherent limitation. Cases must accommodate behind-motherboard routing for at least the primary ATX cable, eliminating compatibility with chassis lacking appropriate cable management provisions. This restriction is not insurmountable but requires careful case selection, potentially limiting the RS1200G's appeal to builders with existing incompatible cases.

 




The magnetic USB hub adds practical value for builders requiring additional connectivity and cable management. Direct PSU mounting eliminates SATA power requirements when positioned in the dedicated slot, simplifying cable management. Alternative mounting locations throughout the chassis provide flexibility for specific layout requirements. This feature addresses modern system connectivity demands elegantly, though its utility varies significantly based on individual build requirements. Cable configuration proves conservative for a 1200W unit. One 12V-2x6 connector and five 6+2 pin PCIe connectors accommodate most GPU requirements but may prove limiting for some top-tier builds. Flat ribbon cables with magnetic cable organizers simplify routing in constrained spaces, representing thoughtful attention to practical installation concerns.

Electrical performance proves exceptional across all metrics. Voltage regulation maintains sub-1% deviation across all rails, demonstrating precise control under varying loads. Ripple suppression achieves outstanding results, particularly given the unit's 1200W output capability and compact form factor. Protection circuits respond with sharp precision, balancing safety with practical operational requirements. The OCP threshold is rather conservative but this unit is certified to handle ATX 3.1 transients. Efficiency results merit recognition. Cold testing efficiency of 90.0% with 115 VAC and 92.0% with 230 VAC comfortably exceeds Gold certification requirements, with Cybenetics awarding Platinum certification based on average efficiency calculations. Hot testing reveals significant but predictable efficiency degradation to 88.4% and 90.3% respectively, with thermal stress signs at maximum load, even though the figures remain within acceptable parameters.

 




Thermal management proves adequate though not exceptional. The compact 150mm chassis and overall topology, although paired with a 135mm fan and good heatsinks on the primary side, create inherent cooling challenges at maximum power output. The fan remains inactive or operates at minimal speeds under moderate loads, contributing to excellent low-load acoustics. High load operation produces significant noise levels, particularly under elevated ambient temperatures when the fan reaches maximum speed. Overall, the thermal control circuitry is very reasonably programmed and responsive.

Component selection demonstrates pragmatic engineering. EPCOS APFC capacitors and Infineon MOSFETs represent premium choices in critical high-stress positions. Teapo secondary capacitors occupy a middle ground between economy and premium Japanese alternatives, appropriate for the 10-year warranty period but not representing absolute top-tier specification. This mixed approach balances cost optimization with reliability requirements.

 




Pricing positions the RS1200G at approximately $180, representing premium positioning justified by innovative features and solid electrical performance. Competition exists from conventional high-wattage units offering lower pricing but lacking the RS1200G's distinctive capabilities. Value assessment depends heavily on individual compatibility requirements and appreciation for the rotational design innovation.

The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU succeeds in delivering meaningful innovation beyond incremental specification improvements. Exceptional electrical performance, comprehensive protection features, and thoughtful accessory inclusion demonstrate engineering competence. The unit's performance at maximum load suggests the platform may be a little stressed at 1200 Watts, although it can deliver its maximum power output under adverse circumstances if necessary. Case compatibility limitations represent the primary concern, requiring careful evaluation before purchase. For builders with compatible cases seeking innovative solutions and exceptional power quality, the RS1200G merits serious consideration despite its premium pricing.

Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters, summarises its mechanisms and intent quite succinctly: “This is the path that Viktor Orbán took in Hungary, where you use the power of the state to ensure that the media is compliant, that outlets are either curbed and become much less willing to be critical, or they are sold to owners who will make that happen."

- Do something wildly unacceptable- Media writes an article declaring the action is indefensible- Those involved complain publicly about the unfair nature of the story; their supporters back them up- Next time to avoid controversy media writes a slightly more fair storyIt doesn't even require state power because technically in the US they cannot. There is clearly threat of power kicking journalists out of the  pentagon is a clear example. But it's much more about creating a permission structure through public airing of grievances.

The net effect is that when Trump says "we are going to fix housing prices by deporting fifty million people" the Times writes that while the policy may not work it does seem like Trump is trying to tackle the rising cost of housing.

Counter to what? Most news sources are owned by people who support this administration's positions, and are glad they don't have to do this whole charade of pretending to care about the truth or normal people.

The Biden administration slow-rolled prosecution of Trump for his crimes because they wanted to court moderates and republicans. That failure enabled Trump to run again from somewhere other than prison."If only the dems had run Romney for president, then they would have won" is not serious.

IIRC, Biden hemmed and hawwed on border environment until like a couple months before the election, when he issued some executive orders that actually had an impact. But that was too little, too late.> Harris promised to have a republican in her cabinet. She campaigned with Liz Cheney. Did republican voters suddenly jump on board? No.Except that was misunderstanding "republican voters" and the energy Trump was tapping into. Getting Liz Cheney on board was just Dem elitists trying to ally with the dying and unpopular elitist wing of the Republican party.I'm talking about something far more radical than some warmed over 2000s centrism: jettison the much of the social-justice activist baggage and co-opt some of Trump's populist appeal, like his rejection of neoliberalism and support for effective border enforcement.

You recall incorrectly. The Biden admin was trying to push congress to pass a bi-partisan immigration bill. It was torpedoed by Trump when he wasn't even in an elected position on the basis that it would help his campaign run on Biden's "immigration failures".Here is some reading for you so you don't have to depend only on what you recall:

- trying to appeal to the "center" instead of going the other way and channelling the more radical elements' rage against Trump. I believe Bernie would have beaten Trump as the nominee. Yes, the GOP would have painted him as a "Communist destroying the American Way of Life", but they did that to Harris anyway so being centrist gave the Dems nothing.- not focusing on prices and jobs from day one, in simple terms the average uneducated worker could understand, and mostly, trying to say "things are good/better" which may have been true, but everyone else thought they were not when they went to buy eggs- Biden trying to stay in for a second term instead of bowing out at the start

It sounds a lot like you actually agree; those are all reasons why every Democrat constituent should be livid with the party "establishment". Instead, any time this point is brought up, people respond instantly with the "it's not a 'both sides' issue" thought-terminating cliché. In this case, one person says, "Okay, but obviously the other people shot themselves in the foot" and the response is "I disagree, here's how they shot themselves in the foot".

reply

I think so. Something more in the Sanders direction would have been way better, though with a keener eye towards not alienating working-class folks (like putting a massive student loan forgiveness plan front-and-center did), with Trump's rejection of free-trade dogma, and jettisoning the social justice activism that loses rural areas and many working-class voters.

reply

"Both sides" itself is also often a thought-terminating cliche. It is always important to look at the larger context these points are being made in.Here, the original comment was taking individual Republican voters to task for supporting this performatively-cruel societally-destructive con man with a proven track record. This is something that every individual Republican voter directly did, while Democrat voters did not do and would not have ended up doing [had Harris won]. Harris, for all of her faults and would-have-been letdowns, did not openly run on a platform of destroying our society. Reasonable people can disagree with her policies, but she appeared to be poised to at least lead the country rather than deliberately divide us.But the comment responding to that then tried to equate that blame to "both sides", going so far as to use the word "collectively" to try and bootstrap personal responsibility from the (obviously terrible) actions of the Democratic party.So no, that is not an equal criticism in the context of criticizing Republican voters who actively voted for overt evil! The many failings of the Democratic party is something that definitely needs to be discussed, but not in the context of the much larger and more serious problems in the Republican party. Rather, bringing it up here seems like yet another instance of the only-Democrats-have-agency fallacy.(I presume the downvotes without comment are just the same old fascism supporters who hate my framing because it clashes with the lies they tell themselves about what they voted for. The funny part is I'm no friend of the Democratic party either - I'm a libertarian who actually believes in many of the issues Trump abuses to rabble-rouse. But my country called, so I swallowed my own independent individualist pride and answered that call rather than falling for the siren song of destructionist grievance politics)

Racism, misogyny, etc form the main structure of this dynamic, because they are straightforward categories that can be quickly judged. Even without any societal history of racism, it's too easy to adopt a 90% rule that white -> ingroup, and nonwhite -> outgroup. Since this categorization system now has "predictive power" [1], it becomes worth augmenting it with more rules and exceptions. A non-white person can become "one of the good ones" by "acting white". A white woman can remain ingroup-accepted by "knowing her place", or can become part of the outgroup by actively rejecting the heteronormative role(s) (eg declaring herself a lesbian).After this stews for a while, gaining more and more "predictive power" (aka confirmation bias), there becomes a tacit rule that anybody not nodding in full agreement with the Party mantras is also in the outgroup. Essentially everyone "good" must be supporting this particular leader and repeating the litanies of a narrow Overton window - if you're not onboard, then the simple answer is you're not "good" and therefore not worth listening to at all - even if you're merely trying to point out how they are not going to get what they themselves claim to want.The end result is basically a self-reinforcing cult that goes off the rails of all reason, and here we are.[0] it's understandable that people reject criticisms of policies that come from a place of judging them with different values.

That said, I think "Trump's voters are all assholes" is a talking point NOT of liberal voters, but of the Democratic party, because it conveniently avoids any discussion of policy, particularly where the party and its typical voters may differ.Trade is a good example.  The bipartisan consensus since Clinton has largely been that unfettered trade is good.  However, if you work in manufacturing, or are in a labor pool that competes with former manufacturing workers (or workers who might have chosen a career in manufacturing, or mechanical engineering, or processing engineering), then there are certainly some drawbacks to consider.To be clear: I do not in any way endorse Trump's policy.  I am not trying to discount "owning the libs", or violent racism, certainly both motivators for a good chunk of the MAGA camp.  I am saying that it is worth considering policy issues that may have convinced people to vote for him.  Especially if you separate campaigning from implementation.  Trump's foreign policy has been intervention-heavy, but his rhetoric was frequently isolationist.

I agree with what you said, that's definitely a talking point meant to maintain a feeling of righteousness while avoiding self-reflection.I disagree with distinction between the "Democratic party" and "liberal voters," if anything, I'd say it's the opposite. By and large, I'd expect the professionals of the party to not be so stupid to use "Trump's voters are all assholes" as a talking point (even if they think it). IMHO, it's a talking point of extremely polarized liberal voters, who are letting their emotions get the better of them, and themselves thinking and acting in a more Trump-like manner.Both the party and its voters seem extremely reluctant to think about their role in this, and seem to prefer to continue to make the same mistakes, hoping luck or other-side incompetence brings them a better result next time. It's so stupid.

Tesla has discontinued Autopilot, its basic driver-assistance system, as the company tries to boost adoption of a more advanced version of the technology that it calls Full Self-Driving (Supervised).

The decision comes as the company faces a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in its largest U.S. market, California. A judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD for years. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.

Autopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves. 

Tesla's online configuration site now states new cars now come standard with only Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It's not clear if current customers are affected.

The decision comes one week after the company said that starting on February 14, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software's capabilities improve.

Musk believes that Tesla's newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though texting while driving is illegal in almost all states. 

On Thursday, Tesla rolled out the first robotaxi versions of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company's driving software and are still followed by the company's cars for supervision.

Tesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla's chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” required for Musk to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. Tesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s after talks broke down between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant's then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on all of its vehicles in April 2019.

Across the decade-plus of Autopilot's existence, Tesla struggled with communicating the software's capabilities. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters, summarises its mechanisms and intent quite succinctly: “This is the path that Viktor Orbán took in Hungary, where you use the power of the state to ensure that the media is compliant, that outlets are either curbed and become much less willing to be critical, or they are sold to owners who will make that happen."

- Do something wildly unacceptable- Media writes an article declaring the action is indefensible- Those involved complain publicly about the unfair nature of the story; their supporters back them up- Next time to avoid controversy media writes a slightly more fair storyIt doesn't even require state power because technically in the US they cannot. There is clearly threat of power kicking journalists out of the  pentagon is a clear example. But it's much more about creating a permission structure through public airing of grievances.

Democrats, too. They, collectively, made decisions that allowed a guy like Trump to win, twice. They screamed about the risks every day, but that was only a campaign tactic.

Instead they just treated it as a regular election, where the goal was to eek out a victory for their partisans.When when you say your opponent is a fascist, it's time to tell your partisans to be quiet, and expand your tent massively.> This is precisely the thing they voted for.Come on, that's obviously false.

The Biden administration slow-rolled prosecution of Trump for his crimes because they wanted to court moderates and republicans. That failure enabled Trump to run again from somewhere other than prison."If only the dems had run Romney for president, then they would have won" is not serious.

IIRC, Biden hemmed and hawwed on border environment until like a couple months before the election, when he issued some executive orders that actually had an impact. But that was too little, too late.> Harris promised to have a republican in her cabinet. She campaigned with Liz Cheney. Did republican voters suddenly jump on board? No.Except that was misunderstanding "republican voters" and the energy Trump was tapping into. Getting Liz Cheney on board was just Dem elitists trying to ally with the dying and unpopular elitist wing of the Republican party.I'm talking about something far more radical than some warmed over 2000s centrism: jettison the much of the social-justice activist baggage and co-opt some of Trump's populist appeal, like his rejection of neoliberalism and support for effective border enforcement.

- trying to appeal to the "center" instead of going the other way and channelling the more radical elements' rage against Trump. I believe Bernie would have beaten Trump as the nominee. Yes, the GOP would have painted him as a "Communist destroying the American Way of Life", but they did that to Harris anyway so being centrist gave the Dems nothing.- not focusing on prices and jobs from day one, in simple terms the average uneducated worker could understand, and mostly, trying to say "things are good/better" which may have been true, but everyone else thought they were not when they went to buy eggs- Biden trying to stay in for a second term instead of bowing out at the start

It sounds a lot like you actually agree; those are all reasons why every Democrat constituent should be livid with the party "establishment". Instead, any time this point is brought up, people respond instantly with the "it's not a 'both sides' issue" thought-terminating cliché. In this case, one person says, "Okay, but obviously the other people shot themselves in the foot" and the response is "I disagree, here's how they shot themselves in the foot".

reply

I think so. Something more in the Sanders direction would have been way better, though with a keener eye towards not alienating working-class folks (like putting a massive student loan forgiveness plan front-and-center did), with Trump's rejection of free-trade dogma, and jettisoning the social justice activism that loses rural areas and many working-class voters.



"Both sides" is also often a thought-terminating cliche. It is always important to look at the larger context these points are being made in.Here, the original comment was taking individual Republican voters to task for supporting this performatively-cruel societally-destructive con man with a proven track record. This is something that every individual Republican voter directly did, while Democrat voters did not do and would not have ended up doing [had Harris won]. Harris, for all of her faults and would-have-been letdowns, is not a piece of human trash who openly ran on a platform of destroying our society. Reasonable people can disagree with her policies, but she appeared to be poised to at least lead the country rather than deliberately divide us.But the comment responding to that then tried to equivocate that blame to "both sides", going so far as to use the word "collectively" to try and bootstrap personal responsibility from the (obviously terrible) actions of the Democratic party.And no, that is not an equal criticism in the context of criticizing Republican voters who actively voted for overt evil! The many failings of the Democratic party is something that definitely needs to be discussed, but not in the context of the much larger and more serious problems in the Republican party. Rather, bringing it up here seems like yet another instance of the only-Democrats-have-agency fallacy.(I presume the downvotes without comment are just the same old fascists trying to protect their own egos by continuing to lie to themselves about what they voted for. The funny part is I'm no friend of the Democratic party either - I'm a libertarian who actually believes in many of the issues Trump abuses to rabble-rouse. But my country called, so I swallowed my own independent individualist pride and answered that call rather than falling for the siren song of destructionist grievance politics)

And I a key point is: rejection of Trump is not an endorsement of the Democrats, let alone a full-throated one. A Trump-like Democratic power grab is just as unacceptable to many people, and putting voters in the position of choosing between two unacceptable power grabs to not a recipe for resounding electoral success. It's likely a recipe for failure.

That said, I think "Trump's voters are all assholes" is a talking point NOT of liberal voters, but of the Democratic party, because it conveniently avoids any discussion of policy, particularly where the party and its typical voters may differ.Trade is a good example.  The bipartisan consensus since Clinton has largely been that unfettered trade is good.  However, if you work in manufacturing, or are in a labor pool that competes with former manufacturing workers (or workers who might have chosen a career in manufacturing, or mechanical engineering, or processing engineering), then there are certainly some drawbacks to consider.To be clear: I do not in any way endorse Trump's policy.  I am not trying to discount "owning the libs", or violent racism, certainly both motivators for a good chunk of the MAGA camp.  I am saying that it is worth considering policy issues that may have convinced people to vote for him.  Especially if you separate campaigning from implementation.  Trump's foreign policy has been intervention-heavy, but his rhetoric was frequently isolationist.

I agree with what you said, that's definitely a talking point meant to maintain a feeling of righteousness while avoiding self-reflection.I disagree with distinction between the "Democratic party" and "liberal voters," if anything, I'd say it's the opposite. By and large, I'd expect the professionals of the party to not be so stupid to use "Trump's voters are all assholes" as a talking point (even if they think it). IMHO, it's a talking point of extremely polarized liberal voters, who are letting their emotions get the better of them, and themselves thinking and acting in a more Trump-like manner.Both the party and its voters seem extremely reluctant to think about their role in this, and seem to prefer to continue to make the same mistakes, hoping luck or other-side incompetence brings them a better result next time. It's so stupid.

1. "Defends" suggests some level of explanation and justification; the White House did not present any here.2. "AI image showing arrested woman" could mean a fully-generated image of a woman, rather than editing an image of an existing person under law enforcement control to disguise the actual facts. The first one would be bizarre, the second one is much more problematic.

Financial injections helped Intel in 2025, but what about supply constraints in 2026?

Intel reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2025, closing the year with $52.9 billion in revenue, its weakest annual result since 2010. Despite earnings declines both in Q4 and for the whole year, Intel says that its earnings in the fourth quarter exceeded expectations as demand outstripped supply, due to the ongoing AI buildout.

Furthermore, the company reports a GAAP net loss of $300 million in 2025. Compared to its staggering $18.8 billion loss in 2024, this can be framed as a breakthrough. However, this is not quite yet a turnaround, as the result came with important caveats.

"We exceeded Q4 expectations across revenue, gross margin, and EPS even as we navigated industry-wide supply shortages," said David Zinsner, chief financial officer at Intel. "We expect our available supply to be at its lowest level in Q1 before improving in Q2 and beyond. Demand fundamentals across our core markets remain healthy as the rapid adoption of AI reinforces the importance of the x86 ecosystem as the world's most widely deployed high-performance compute architecture."

In Q4 2025, Intel earned $13.7 billion in revenue, unchanged from the previous quarter and down 4% year-over-year (YoY), as the company's shipments were constrained by wafer supply from its own fabs and TSMC. Due to strong competition and unfulfilled demand, the company reported a GAAP loss of $600 million for the quarter, as gross margin declined to 36.1%, compared to 39.2% a year earlier. For the full year, revenue was $52.9 billion, essentially flat compared to 2024, but gross margin improved to 34.8%.

However, Intel's near breakeven result was made possible by roughly $20.4 billion in external financial injections, including $2 billion from SoftBank, $4.46 billion from Silver Lake (for a 51% stake in Altera), $5 billion from Nvidia, and $8.9 billion from the U.S. government. Even with external funding, Intel still ended the year in the red, but without the injections, its losses would have deepened.

Taking a closer look at different business units, performance varied across business segments. The Client Computing Group (CCG) posted $8.2 billion in Q4 revenue, down both sequentially and YoY, its operating income declined to $2.2 billion as operating margin dropped to 27%. While client CPU demand in Q4 was traditionally very strong, Intel deliberately redirected constrained internal wafer capacity toward higher-margin data center products, thus increasing reliance on externally sourced wafers for client processors, which hit margins of the CCG business unit badly.

 




Meanwhile, this strategy benefited the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI), which posted $4.7 billion in Q4 revenue, up 15% sequentially and 7% YoY. Operating income surged to $1.3 billion, lifting margins to 26.4%, a dramatic improvement from 8.6% a year earlier and the best result for DCAI in quarters. Again, Intel had to acknowledge that demand for Xeon processors exceeded supply and expects this imbalance to persist into 2026 due to demand from the AI segment.

Intel Foundry generated $4.5 billion in Q4 revenue, up 6.4% sequentially, supported by growing shipments of Intel 3-based Xeon 6 CPUs, Intel 4-based Arrow Lake, and (to a minimal degree) early Panther Lake wafers. EUV-based processes now account for over 10% of foundry revenue, up from less than 1% in 2023. However, as usual, the foundry business posted a $2.5 billion operating loss due to a mix of factors, including ongoing capacity investments and the early ramp-up of Intel's 18A.

 




Looking ahead into the first quarter, Intel forecasts revenue of $11.7 billion – $12.7 billion, which is down from the same quarter a year ago.

 




The prediction stems from continued supply constraints and the lack of buffer inventory that Intel sold in Q3 and Q4 2025. As a consequence, Intel will sell whatever it can get throughout the first quarter of 2026, something that inevitably hits margins, and they are projected to decline to 32.3% (as it will be harder to get as many of the premium SKUs out as possible). The good news is that the company's management expects supply conditions to improve starting in Q2.

A database containing 149 million account usernames and passwords—including 48 million for Gmail, 17 million for Facebook, and 420,000 for the cryptocurrency platform Binance—has been removed after a researcher reported the exposure to the hosting provider.

The longtime security analyst who discovered the database, Jeremiah Fowler, could not find indications of who owned or operated it, so he worked to notify the host, which took down the trove because it violated a terms-of-service agreement.

In addition to email and social media logins for a number of platforms, Fowler also observed credentials for government systems from multiple countries as well as consumer banking and credit card logins and media streaming platforms. Fowler suspects that the database had been assembled by infostealing malware that infects devices and then uses techniques like keylogging to record information that victims type into websites.

While attempting to contact the hosting service over the course of about a month, Fowler says the database continued to grow, accumulating additional logins for an array of services. He is not naming the provider, because the company is a global host that contracts with independent regional companies to expand its reach. The database was hosted by one of these affiliates in Canada.

“This is like a dream wish list for criminals, because you have so many different types of credentials,” Fowler told WIRED. “An infostealer would make the most sense. The database was in a format made for indexing large logs as if whoever set it up was expecting to gather a lot of data. And there were tons of government logins from many different countries.”

In addition to the 48 million Gmail credentials, the trove also contained about 4 million for Yahoo accounts, 1.5 million for Microsoft Outlook, 900,000 for Apple's iCloud, and 1.4 million for .edu academic and institutional accounts. There were also, among others, about 780,000 logins for TikTok, 100,000 for OnlyFans, and 3.4 million for Netflix. The data was publicly accessible and searchable using just a web browser.

“It seemed like it captured anything and everything, but one thing that was interesting was that the system seemed to automatically classify each log with an identifier, and these were unique identifiers that didn't reappear,” Fowler says. “It seemed like the system was organizing the data automatically as it went for easier searching.

Though Fowler emphasizes that he did not determine who owned or used the information and for what purpose, such a structure would make sense if the data were being queried for cybercriminal customers paying for different subsets of the information based on their scams.

There is a seemingly endless flow of mistakenly unsecured and publicly accessible databases online that expose sensitive information for anyone to access. But as data brokers and cybercriminals amass ever greater troves, the stakes of potential breaches only grow. And infostealing malware has added to the problem by making it simple and reliable for attackers to automate the collection of login credentials and other sensitive data.

“Infostealers create a very low barrier of entry for new criminals,” says Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at security firm Recorded Future. “Renting one popular infrastructure, we've seen costs somewhere between $200 to $300 a month, so for less than a car payment, criminals could potentially gain access to hundreds of thousands of new usernames and passwords a month.”

Analysts say 'tailwinds' are the reason Toto shares are up. That's also how Toto's signature Washlet product line dries your derrière.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Toilet manufacturer Toto has seen its shares soar at their most rapid pace in five years, as it benefits from AI memory market tailwinds. The Japanese sanitaryware maker might be one of the most unlikely beneficiaries of the AI boom. However, its ceramics expertise is useful in semiconductor manufacturing. Specifically, according to the Japan Times, Goldman Sachs analysts are crediting the 11% stock surge yesterday to Toto's electrostatic chucks used in NAND chipmaking.

 




Best known for its Washlet-branded cleansing toilets and heated toilet seat accessories, Japan's Toto has smartly invested and diversified into businesses related to the semiconductor and display supply chain. Its ceramics expertise makes it a surprisingly natural fit for the development of these products. Moreover, this isn't something new to Toto; it has been mass-producing the aforementioned electrostatic chucks since way back in 1988.

Toto's chucks are used to hold silicon wafers in place during chipmaking, while minimizing contamination. Over the years, analysts have charted this once side-gig for Toto ramping up to contribute over two-fifths of its operating income, based on March 2025 figures compiled by Bloomberg. It looks like investors are positive and eager to see an update to these figures, as everything the AI industry touches turns to gold, for now.

The Goldman analysts quoted by the Japan Times say that Toto is likely to see “significant profit growth,” as they raised the rating of the firm from neutral to buy. Ratcheting up their hopes, they see a tight supply-demand environment in the memory industry as a tailwind for Toto. Indeed, Toto is also said to expect the current wave of AI data center construction to boost its electrostatic chuck business.

Interestingly, the source name checked a few other unlikely Japanese companies that are benefitting from the AI boom. An MSG seasoning maker also makes chip-insulating films, for example. Meanwhile, cosmetics brand Kao's expertise in facial cleansers has an unexpected twin: the company also makes cleaning agents for semiconductor wafers.

A new entity has been created that will allow ByteDance to sell a majority stake in the U.S. operations of TikTok to a group of investors outside of China, according to new reports from the New York Times and Bloomberg. It moves a deal one step closer to completion, following years of uncertainty over whether the app would be banned in the U.S., though TikTok was quick to note that this isn't a final deal to sell the company.

The entity will be called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, according to a press release from TikTok, and the major investors include Oracle, the UAE investment firm MGX, and the investment firm Silver Lake, which will own more than 80% of the company, according to the New York Times. Michael Dell is also involved, according to the Times.

The press release announcement notes that the new joint venture “will retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data. The content recommendation algorithm will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment.” It's not entirely clear what that means, but obviously there are concerns that Trump and the U.S. government will tinker with the platform to make it more MAGA friendly.

Congress passed a bipartisan law in 2024, signed by President Joe Biden, that required TikTok to be sold to U.S. interests or be banned in America over national security concerns. The first deadline for the sale/ban was Jan. 19, 2025, but President Trump extended that until April. And then Trump signed an executive order extending it yet again until June. When June rolled around, that was extended again until September. After they blew through that deadline, it was extended again to January 22.

Trump had no authority to just keep extending the deadline, but he did it anyway, which seems to be a theme of this presidency. He had initially tried to ban TikTok during his first term, but that got tied up in the courts and fizzled out. Trump then pulled a 180 while campaigning for the presidency in 2024, insisting that he liked TikTok because it was popular with young people and he had a lot of supporters there who could help him win the election.

It's entirely possible that this news is in many ways another headfake, given the fact that we've heard about a “done deal” many times since President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second time in January 2025. Back in October 2025, we heard the same thing. A month earlier, there was a big announcement that a “framework” for a deal had been reached.

And when Gizmodo reached out to TikTok on Thursday after the New York Times first broke the news, our email asked about a finalized deal. “I saw your question and want to call out that ‘deal to sell' isn't accurate framing. Please see language used in the press release,” a spokesperson for the company wrote.

People with obesity and high blood pressure may face a higher risk of dementia, according to a new study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

Dementia is a growing global public health challenge, with no cure currently available. People with dementia experience a severe decline in mental abilities, like memory, thinking and reasoning.

The most common forms of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and mixed dementia. Dementia is a progressive brain disease that causes nerve cell damage that worsens over time, affecting memory, language, problem-solving and behavior.

"In this study, we found high body mass index (BMI) and high blood pressure are direct causes of dementia," said study author Ruth Frikke-Schmidt, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Chief Physician at Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark. "The treatment and prevention of elevated BMI and high blood pressure represent an unexploited opportunity for dementia prevention."

The researchers analyzed data from participants in Copenhagen and the U.K. and identified a causal link between higher body weight and dementia.

The researchers were able to establish a direct causal link between high BMI and dementia because they used a so-called Mendelian randomization design that mimics a randomized controlled trial. In the Mendelian randomization study design, common genetic variants causing high BMI are used as proxies for BMI altering medications. As active drug versus placebo is randomly assigned due to the randomization process in drug trials, and as BMI-increasing genetic variants versus neutral variants are randomly assorted from parents to offspring, the effects on the disease endpoint will be clear and not affected by confounding factors.

Therefore, this strategy enabled the researchers to establish a direct causal link between high BMI and risk of dementia.

Much of this increased dementia risk appeared to be driven by high blood pressure, suggesting that preventing or treating obesity and high blood pressure could help reduce dementia risk.

This study shows that high body weight and high blood pressure are not just warning signs, but direct causes of dementia. That makes them highly actionable targets for prevention."

Ruth Frikke-Schmidt, Copenhagen University Hospital

"Weight-loss medication has recently been tested for halting cognitive decline in early phases of Alzheimer's disease, but with no beneficial effect. An open question that remains to be tested is if weight-loss medication initiated before the appearance of cognitive symptoms may be protective against dementia. Our present data would suggest that early weight-loss interventions would prevent dementia, and especially vascular-related dementia," she continued.

For more than a century, oral insulin has been considered a "dream" therapy for diabetes, hindered by enzymatic degradation in the digestive tract and the absence of a dedicated intestinal transport mechanism. Consequently, many patients must rely on daily insulin injections, which can significantly reduce their quality of life.

A research team at Kumamoto University, led by Associate Professor Shingo Ito, has developed a breakthrough drug-delivery platform using a small-intestine-permeable cyclic peptide known as the DNP peptide, enabling efficient oral delivery of insulin.

The researchers established two effective approaches to facilitate the intestinal absorption of insulin:

Unlike previous oral insulin approaches requiring very high doses (often over ten times that of an injection), this platform achieved a pharmacological bioavailability of approximately 33–41% relative to subcutaneous injection. This result demonstrates a substantial reduction in the amount of insulin needed for oral administration and marks a key step toward practical clinical use.

"Insulin injections remain a daily burden for many patients," said Associate Professor Shingo Ito.

Our peptide-based platform offers a new route to deliver insulin orally and may be applicable to long-acting insulin formulations and other injectable biologics."

Shingo Ito, Associate Professor, Kumamoto University

The study was published in the international journal Molecular Pharmaceutics on November 24, 2025. The team is now progressing toward translational studies, including evaluations in large animal models and human intestinal systems.

By analyzing bowel movement frequency in more than 268,000 people, researchers uncover how thiamine-processing genes shape gut motility, link constipation and diarrhea to shared biology, and point to new therapeutic possibilities for IBS and related disorders.

A recent study in Gut focused on identifying genes and mechanisms involved in gut motility to uncover how vitamin B1 processing influences bowel movement frequency (stool frequency, SF) and identifies potential treatment targets for common digestive disorders that affect millions of patients worldwide.

Gastrointestinal (GI) motility refers to the coordinated muscle contractions that move food, liquids, and waste through the digestive system. This process, known as peristalsis, is controlled by the enteric nervous system and modulated by signals from the brain.

Proper digestive motility is essential for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. This complex process is regulated by interactions among the gut-brain axis, the immune system, and the gut microbiome, with additional influences from diet, exercise, and medications.

Disrupted motility underlies irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), other gut-brain interaction disorders, and severe conditions like chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Even though these are common disorders, clinicians experience significant challenges in their treatment, primarily due to a lack of understanding of their root causes. By studying the genetics of gut motility, researchers hope to identify new treatment targets that go beyond symptom management.

Researchers believe that a comprehensive understanding of the genetics of gut motility could help identify new treatment targets. A previous study developed a unique strategy that focused on measurable disease traits, such as gut motility, to identify genes affecting gut function in IBS patients.

Gut motility can be precisely measured by colonic transit time; however, this method is not practical for large-scale genetic studies needed to discover new genes. In contrast, the current study used a more accessible measure of stool frequency (SF), which estimates how often people have bowel movements.

While SF is not a perfect stand-in for gut motility, it correlates with colonic transit time and captures the full range of motility problems, from constipation to diarrhea. A previous proof-of-study tested this approach by analyzing SF genetics in five European populations. This study successfully identified biological pathways and cell types that control gut contractions. The current study aimed to expand the research by using larger datasets, including an East Asian biobank, to enable broader genetic insights.

The current study analyzed questionnaire data from 268,606 people across six biobanks, five European ancestry groups, and one East Asian group. SF ranged from 0.98 to 1.42 bowel movements per day across the different populations. IBS prevalence followed a U-shaped pattern, with constipation predominant IBS at one end of the frequency spectrum and diarrhea predominant IBS at the other.

In the European meta-analysis, a total of 7,879,955 genetic variants were analyzed, yielding 3,083 significant genetic markers at 12 independent genomic locations, including two that had never been linked to SF. Separate analyses by sex did not reveal any additional genetic signals.

Genetics accounted for about 7 percent of the variation in SF among Europeans. A significant genetic overlap was observed with 164 conditions spanning digestive, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurological, and psychiatric domains. SF also showed genetic connections to various pain-related traits.

Combining all 268,606 participants in a multi-ancestry analysis revealed 479 significant markers across 18 genomic locations. Together, these corresponded to 21 independent genetic signals, including 10 newly identified loci, nearly doubling the number previously linked to stool frequency. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed bidirectional causal effects between SF and diverticular disease, while also showing that SF has causal effects on IBS, but IBS does not causally influence SF. Hemorrhoids were found to have a negative causal effect on SF, suggesting a protective effect against higher stool frequency. A total of 21 genetic locations were identified along with 197 protein-coding genes.

Fine mapping determined specific genetic variants that influence GI motility. The analysis pinpointed three specific genetic variants with high confidence: rs12407945 in Europeans, and rs2581260 and rs12022782 in the multi-ancestry analysis.

The top variant affects SLC35F3, a gene that transports vitamin B1 into cells, influencing expression in the brain and digestive tract and potentially integrating central and enteric nervous system control of motility. The second variant links to hemorrhoids, but its mechanism remains unclear. The third affects XPR1, a phosphate exporter also linked to blood pressure. Phosphate export by XPR1 is essential for converting thiamine into its biologically active form, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Other notable genes include KLB, which regulates bile acid metabolism and colonic transit, and COLQ, which controls gut nerve signaling and is associated with diverticular disease risk.

SLC35F3 transports thiamine into cells, while XPR1 exports phosphate needed to activate it. Analysis of 98,449 participants confirmed that higher thiamine intake was associated with higher SF in observational dietary data, with the effect depending on which gene variants a person carried. This suggests these genes regulate how the body uses vitamin B1 to control gut motility rather than acting through a single organ or pathway.

Drug signature analysis computationally prioritized 831 compounds that could speed up or slow down gut motility based on gene expression patterns. These could be further explored for better treatment opportunities, but have not yet been tested experimentally in this context.

This genetic analysis of SF reveals new insights into how the gut controls motility. The study uncovered a surprising role for vitamin B1 metabolism in gut motility. This discovery opens possibilities for dietary or drug interventions targeting thiamine pathways.

Because SF is a questionnaire-based proxy for motility, and dietary thiamine intake was assessed observationally rather than through intervention trials, the authors emphasize the need for mechanistic studies and clinical validation. Many existing medications, particularly cardiovascular drugs, could be repurposed to treat IBS and other gut motility disorders, but further experimental and clinical investigation is required.

FIFA has raised the bar for women's club football by unveiling a record-breaking prize pool for the first-ever FIFA Women's Champions Cup. The 2026 champions will earn USD 2.3 million, the highest single payout in the history of the women's club game, as the new intercontinental tournament makes its debut in London.

In total, nearly $4 million will be distributed among the six participating clubs based on performance. The two losing semifinalists will each receive USD 200,000, while Auckland United FC (New Zealand) and Wuhan Chegu Jiangda WFC (China PR), eliminated in the earlier rounds, will earn USD 100,000 each.

FIFA Secretary General Mattias Grafström said the prize structure reflects the organization's belief in the rapid growth of the women's club game and its commitment to making long-term, meaningful investments that elevate competitions worldwide.

The tournament will bring together the champion clubs from each confederation to determine the first women's intercontinental club champion. The final stage will take place in London, with the semifinals scheduled for Jan. 28, at Brentford Stadium.

ZURICH — FIFA will pay $2.3 million in prize money to the club that wins the first Women's Champions Cup at Arsenal's stadium next week.

The total fund detailed on Friday by FIFA will share $3.9 million among the six continental champions. The final stages in London are a warmup for a planned full Women's Club World Cup in 2028.

 European champion Arsenal will play ASFAR of Morocco after Gotham from the United States plays Corinthians of Brazil in back-to-back semifinals on Wednesday at the home of Premier League club Brentford.

The final at Arsenal's stadium on Feb. 1 will follow a third-place game at the same venue.

The champion gets $2.3 million and the beaten finalist $1 million, with $200,000 paid to each of the losing semifinalists.

Two continental champions already eliminated in earlier rounds — Auckland United from Oceania and Wuhan Chegu Jiangda representing Asia — each get $100,000.

The prize money is “a clear statement of the belief in women's club football and the players, teams and competitions driving its continued rise,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafström said in a statement.

Arsenal got more than 1.5 million euros ($1.8 million) in prize money for winning the UEFA Women's Champions League last season.

 FIFA paid $1 billion among 32 teams in the men's 2025 Club World Cup. That tournament in the United States was backed by Saudi Arabian money to ensure influential European clubs got the prize money they sought to agree to take part.

Arsenal will be one of the four competing teams in a few weeks time after winning the Champions League in 2025 David Ramos/Getty Images

The winners of the inaugural Women's Champions Cup will earn $2.3million (£1.69m; €1.95m), FIFA announced on Friday.

The global football organisation said on top of the “highest single payout ever awarded in women's football”, the second-placed team will earn $1million and the third and fourth-placed sides will earn $200,000 for participating in a prize pot totalling $6m.

The maiden intercontinental tournament — between January 28 and February 1 — will see the best club from each confederation (UEFA, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL) in a calendar year compete over two semi-finals and a final.

This year, Gotham FC (United States) will face SC Corinthians (Brazil) while Arsenal will take on ASFAR (Morocco) before the winners of each tie compete for the title at the Emirates Stadium in London. The champions of the federations representing Oceania (Auckland United FC) and Asia (Wuhan Chegu Jiangda WFC) were eliminated in the earlier rounds and will receive $100,000 each.

“Our focus is clear,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom said in a release on Friday. “To continue investing in, growing and elevating women's club football at every level – ensuring that opportunity, visibility and value keep pace with the exceptional performances seen on the pitch.”

The promised prize money is only $200,000 shy of the $2.5m awarded to the winners of 2025's global seven-a-side tournament that featured clubs such as Manchester United, Manchester City, winners Bayern Munich and San Diego Wave. By contrast, the women's Champions League winners last year won €350,000 ($412,417), though money was also given out in the group stages.

The Champions Cup is set to take place annually in the other three years of the Club World Cup cycle, of which the first edition will be held in 2028.

Public transportation systems across the U.S. are “poised to get” a $100.3M assist from the federal government as Congress considers “directing more money to transit agencies” in cities that are hosting this year's FIFA World Cup games, according to Michelle Kaske of BLOOMBERG NEWS. The allocation is included in a bipartisan appropriations bill that “would fund spending on defense, transportation, housing, education and health” through FY2026. The legislation also includes $94.3M for public transit needs in and around L.A for when it hosts the 2028 L.A. Olympic. The U.S. House is set to approve the appropriations bill on Thursday before it heads to the US Senate next week. Congress has until Jan. 30 to pass spending measures and avoid a government shutdown. According to legislation, the exact amount of funding each transit agency receives will be “calculated by stadium seating capacity and the number of matches in each host city” (BLOOMBERG NEWS, 1/22).

CITY IMPACT: KC2026 President Pam Kramer said, “We know that any base camp here will be an impact.” She added, “There are lots of factors, but we think that the base camps can be not only an economic impact, but there's a cultural opportunity here.” In K.C., Pete Grathoff noted Kramer “likened the World Cup base camps to spring training where teams stay for two months at a city in Florida or Arizona, and fans come to see the players.” But at the World Cup base camps in K.C., “more than fans are expected.” Kramer said, “For the base camps, there will be families of players, coaches, staff. In some cases, there will be sponsors, certainly the embassies, I think with base camps aside, with Argentina playing here, and their massive fan following, I think they will have several representatives from their embassies, several consul generals, counselors on the ground here in Kansas City” (K.C. STAR, 1/22).

HELPING HAND: USA TODAY's Marcus Smith noted FIFA President Gianni Infantino confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump will co-present the World Cup winner's trophy on July 19. Infantino said, “I will give it together with the President of the United States, the host country. Nobody can touch this trophy.” Smith noted it is a “sacred tradition” (USA TODAY, 1/22).

Inclement Weather Has Canceled Shows This Weekend. Here's What's Already Rescheduled.

Emma Ruby

Audio By Carbonatix

U.S. Sen. John Cornyn took a break from the campaign trail Thursday afternoon to join Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson and local and federal law enforcement leaders at the Dallas Police headquarters for a conversation on public safety during this summer's FIFA World Cup games. 

The One Big Beautiful Bill, which Congress passed last July, included a $625 million appropriation for security during the World Cup, and Cornyn stated that he believes Texas will receive around $100 million of that funding. The money will be used to reimburse costs taken on by local law enforcement agencies during the games. 

 

According to Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux, the funds will be key to covering overtime hours worked by Dallas and Arlington police officers during the region's nine games. The funds can also be used for equipment needs, though it was unclear from Thursday's briefing which technologies the departments may need. 

The Department of Homeland Security announced a separate federal funding package in January to develop drone surveillance programs and counter-drone technologies ahead of the games, something Rick Burkhead, a regional safety liaison with FIFA, described as “a concern.” 

Cornyn — perhaps not that far off from the campaign trail after all — emphasized that the funding is a crucial step in affirming the federal government's support of local law enforcement efforts. 

“To me, our support for our law enforcement agencies is non-negotiable. I know there are some who say we should defund the police, or we should abolish ICE, or we should interfere with law enforcement officers enforcing the laws of Congress,” said Cornyn. “I think that's absolutely wrong.” 

Present at Thursday's briefing was Christina Foley, special agent in charge of the United States Secret Service. Foley will serve as the federal coordinator for the Dallas matches, communicating between local and federal law enforcement agencies. Five departments within the Department of Homeland Security will be active in monitoring security threats throughout the World Cup, Foley said. 

What are those threats, specifically, you ask? So did the media members present on Thursday. Mums the word.

Millions of soccer fans are expected to visit Dallas for the World Cup, which Johnson touted as an “incredible opportunity to market our neck of the woods to the world.” But details were also few on whether local law enforcement leaders are communicating with federal immigration officials about plans to ensure that international visitors are not affected by President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. 

Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department stopped issuing visas to immigrants from 75 countries, including several that have already qualified for the North American games. Officials have stated that the pause will not affect tourist visas for those hoping to enter the U.S. for the World Cup. 

Still, the American Immigration Council has warned that public arrests by ICE agents, fast-changing federal policy, and altercations like the shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent may have a chilling effect on those who are willing to travel to the U.S. for the games. 

When asked how North Texas officials were preparing for this summer's intersection of international visitors and ICE's presence, Cornyn described Trump's federal immigration policy as part of the “mandate” he received from voters, said ICE's being in North Texas “should not be a problem at all,” and moved to the next question.

There's a new highest-paid player in women's soccer. It's Trinity Rodman, the Washington Spirit star—and she's staying in the National Women's Soccer League. 

This is a “monumental and game-changing moment” for the sport, Rodman said of her deal—worth around $2 million a year through 2028. It's also a game-changing moment for the business of women's soccer in the U.S. 

The National Women's Soccer League is only 13 years old. Women's professional leagues have come and gone in the U.S., compared to Europe and globally where soccer is a much more established sport. Top-tier players have often left the U.S. to play abroad, where they can earn significantly bigger salaries (the previous top-paid player was in Barcelona). Depending on the player, however, it can be a trade-off with the brand opportunities in the U.S. market. Meanwhile, American soccer has struggled with pay equity and the U.S. Women's National Team's famous lawsuit. 

The NWSL spent the past few months figuring out how to keep Rodman in the league. The Washington Spirit, which is owned by billionaire Michele Kang, wanted to keep her. But they weren't allowed to throw money at Rodman, due to the league's salary cap rules. After months of back-and-forth, the league debuted a new “high-impact player” rule that allowed teams to pay extra for star players, determined by both on-field ability and commercial potential. There's still some uncertainty regarding this rule; the players' union has objected to it, saying it was not negotiated and violated their collective-bargaining agreement. ESPN reports that while the rule's ultimate form is still up in the air, Rodman's contract is still a contract and will be honored. 

In many ways, it's been a challenging year for women's sports. Hyper-growth comes with growing pains; cracks in the foundation appear. The WNBA is currently operating without a contract with its players, who demand a greater share of the league's revenue. Its 30th season is set to kick off in May—if both sides can come to an agreement in time. 

While we wait for a resolution that will support the continued growth of women's basketball, in women's soccer Rodman's contract can set a new standard. If the investors who see so much financial potential for women's sports want to realize those outcomes, they'll need the best players in the world. For now, the NWSL has figured out how to hold onto its best. That's not just good for Rodman—it's good for the players who come after her and for every stakeholder who wants to see this sport thrive.

MANCHESTER – World Cup ticket prices are at exorbitant levels yet fans are still queueing up in their millions to attend soccer's biggest tournament.

There is a such an over-demand for the event being staged in the United States, Canada and Mexico this year that FIFA president Gianni Infantino said the governing body would need to hold a draw to allocate tickets to fans and acknowledged that prices would likely be even higher on resale platforms.

“In 100, almost 100, years of World Cup history, FIFA sold around 50 million tickets in total," Infantino said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. "Now for this World Cup in four weeks (on sale), we have the request for 1,000 years of World Cups at once. This is unique. It's incredible.”

It could also lead to a lot of disappointed fans being driven to resale sites where tickets are being listed for multiples of their face value. 

On FIFA's own resale marketplace, a ticket for the final was being listed for as much as $230,000 this week. FIFA does not resell tickets or set prices on the platform, but can cash in for a second time by taking a 30% cut from any sale.

Addressing the issue in Davos, Infantino said that in the U.S. it was “perfectly legal to resell tickets on resale platforms. ... So we have to of course allow that."

He said all 104 matches at the World Cup would be sold out, meaning “tickets will probably be resold at even higher prices.”

Soccer fans have reacted with outrage to the pricing strategy for this year's tournament. FIFA is asking for up to $8,680 per ticket, but after criticism said it would offer a selection of $60 tickets for every game to the 48 national federations participating. 

Costs can be even more exorbitant through sellers trying to make a massive profit on the secondary market. 

Resale sites are commonplace in the U.S. and tickets can go for well in excess of their original price. NBATickets.com hosts the official resale marketplace for the NBA where sellers determine whatever prices they want, with fees applicable.

Sellers also set their own prices on FIFA's marketplace and enormously inflated listings further highlight the spiralling costs of the tournament for fans, while the governing body stands to make even more money, having already sold tickets at face value. 

The list price for a category one ticket for the final at MetLife Stadium on July 19 is $8,680, but that is subject to change as dynamic pricing will be utilized at a World Cup for the first time. 

The lowest list price for an equivalent ticket on FIFA's marketplace this week was $16,000 - almost twice as much. 

If sold at that price it would be worth $4,800 to the non-profit organization, based on it taking a 30% cut. 

A fan group, Football Supporters Europe, already has accused FIFA of a “monumental betrayal” over its pricing and is also critical of its resale platform. 

Ronan Evain, executive director of FSE, told The Associated Press he believed “a significant proportion of tickets that are sold and put on the resale platform are there just for profit.”

Other resale sites are also listing World Cup tickets. 

FIFA says its platform provides a safe and secure way for fans to resell tickets. 

At the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, the governing body took a lower cut from resales, charging both the buyer and seller the greater of a 5% fee or 2 Qatari Riyals ($0.50). It was also in control of setting resale prices, which could be higher or lower than face value. 

That policy has changed this time around. 

In a statement to the AP, FIFA said it was a “reflection of the treatment of the secondary market for tickets (in the U.S. and Canada), which has a distinct legal treatment than in many other parts of the world.

“We are focused on ensuring fair access to our game for existing but also prospective fans. FIFA resale fees are aligned with North American industry trends across various sports and entertainment sectors.”

There was outcry last month when FIFA announced its latest general release of tickets priced from $140 to $8,680. 

FIFA defends its pricing model, saying it “reflects the existing market practice for major entertainment and sporting events within our hosts on a daily basis, soccer included.” 

Speaking at Davos, Infantino went further. 

“We were hammered. I was hammered, I should say, because of the ticket prices because they are so expensive,” he said. "The main critics were from Germany and and England of course.

“Now number one in ticket requests is U.S., number two Germany and number three England because everyone wants to come and to participate."

MLS

Inter Miami's club motto is an aspirational call to action that the club's co-founder, Jorge Mas, often points to as the foundation of the MLS side's ambition. “Freedom to dream” is plastered throughout Inter Miami's training facility in Fort Lauderdale. It's on the club's jerseys and Mas himself repeats it publicly.

After Inter Miami won the MLS Cup final in December, Mas told Apple TV that the team's success was “based on dreaming.” The club's first MLS title was a dream come true for the Cuban-American billionaire. But Mas has another dream that will be significantly more difficult to accomplish.

Last week when Inter Miami kicked off 2026 MLS preseason, Mas told reporters that seeing the club and Lionel Messi compete in South America's Copa Libertadores is still on the table. How viable that is, however, is certainly up for debate. There are many hurdles that a North American club must bypass in order to gain access to CONMEBOL's premier club competition.

Mas knows this, but that hasn't stopped him from, well, dreaming about that possibility. “It's a dream,” Mas said when asked about how serious he is about pushing MLS into the Copa Libertadores.

“Dreams come true, right?” he continued. “I have had conversations with CONMEBOL and with (president) Alejandro (Domínguez) about looking into participation in the Copa Libertadores. There are precedents because Mexican clubs have played in the Libertadores before.”

Liga MX teams not only participated in the Copa Libertadores, they competed at a high level for nearly a decade. From 1998 to 2016, Mexican clubs were part of the Copa Libertadores field, which pitted Liga MX sides against some of South America's biggest and most successful clubs. Cruz Azul, Chivas de Guadalajara and Tigres all reached the Libertadores final.

Cruz Azul lost to the dynasty that was the 2001 version of Boca Juniors. Chivas succumbed to Brazil's Internacional in 2010 and Tigres finished runner up to Marcelo Gallardo's 2015 River Plate. Yet in hindsight, the ways in which Mexican clubs earned the right to play the Libertadores makes their return to the modern-day tournament nearly impossible to envision.

To summarize, in 1998 the Mexican Football Federation (FMF) successfully lobbied CONMEBOL to allow two Liga MX teams to participate. First, Liga MX teams were matched against two Venezuelan sides, traditionally the weakest Libertadores participants, in a pre-Libertadores playoff. That process later became the InterLiga tournament, which was an eight-team Liga MX qualifying competition that was staged in the U.S. The top two teams qualified for the Copa Libertadores. Both methods were time consuming and would eventually clash with domestic league calendars.

Mas said last week that the MLS Cup winner and Liga MX champion were “perhaps deserving of a slot” in the Copa Libertadores. That's quite the fast track considering the aforementioned qualifying process. Furthermore, and according to Concacaf president Victor Montagliani, FIFA shut the door on the prospect of the Copa Libertadores including North American teams.

In December of 2023, Montagliani told Spanish-language outlet TUDN that FIFA had rejected a petition from FMF that sought to reintroduce Liga MX's Copa Libertadores participation.

“The confederations are working together to create another competition, but regarding the Libertadores, we have a request from Mexico to play in it,” Montagliani said. “We spoke with FIFA, and we sent a document back to the FMF that was denied; it was not authorized. Concacaf didn't authorize either because we have our own official competition. It wasn't authorized because we have ours, which is the path to the Club World Cup.”

That official competition is now the Concacaf Champions Cup. And as Montagliani noted, the tournament provides the winners with a direct berth to the now expanded 32-team Club World Cup. On Thursday, a Concacaf source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Athletic that the confederation's position remains unchanged. CONMEBOL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mas, though, does have a joker in his deck. Messi is Inter Miami's captain and remains a massive draw for both live audiences and corporate sponsors. Messi has never played in the Copa Libertadores. At 38, his opportunities to do so are limited. And while Messi signed a contract extension in October that should see him in pink through the 2028 MLS season, that's still a short window in which to introduce such a seismic change. In the meantime, Inter Miami has reloaded its squad with an aim to win the Champions Cup, something that must surely excite Concacaf.

That is a more realistic objective than advocating for an invitation to the Copa Libertadores. Mexican clubs have long dominated Concacaf tournaments, so it was understandable that they would want to test themselves against stronger competition. Inter Miami, however, has been soundly defeated in its two appearances in the Champions Cup.

In 2024, Inter Miami reached the quarterfinal round but was eliminated by Monterrey 5-2 on aggregate after two legs. A berth in the 2025 semifinals ended with an embarrassing 5-1 aggregate loss to the Vancouver Whitecaps. Mas' desire to play an official competition in South America is a cart-before-the-horse situation. Inter Miami is a global success as a brand, and it exceeded expectations at last summer's FIFA Club World Cup. A well-earned win over Porto in Atlanta and a draw against Brazilian giant Palmeiras in Miami were noteworthy. Tournament football can create moments of magic. Inter Miami, though, has yet to prove itself beyond the continental U.S.

The Copa Libertadores would be a bridge too far.

“Personally, I would love to play in the Libertadores,” Mas said. “I've said it before. I say it publicly, I say it within (MLS). I know these are matters between Concacaf and CONMEBOL, but I believe that if we can somehow continue to grow football hemispherically through the participation of North American and Mexican clubs, the competition would be better for it.”

A Brazilian club has won eight of the last 10 Copa Libertadores finals and seven consecutive titles. An all-Brazilian final has become the norm. Financially-restricted MLS teams would enter the tournament at a massive disadvantage. Even the most ambitious MLS club does not have the spending power of Brazil's richest teams, or the overall talent level of South America's most competitive clubs.

Instead, Inter Miami has scheduled preseason January friendlies against Peru's Alianza Lima, Colombia's Atlético Nacional and Ecuador's Barcelona SC. All three clubs are prominent South American brands and traditional Copa Libertadores participants. Nacional won the tournament in 2016. These exhibition matches will be an opportunity to leverage Messi's popularity in South America and get a taste of CONMEBOL competition.

One can appreciate Mas' freedom to dream and his insistence that MLS clubs can play a bigger part in international club football. But not all dreams come true. Sometimes one's reality is rooted in the fine print.

Trinity Rodman didn't just sign a contract this week—she rewrote the economic ceiling of women's soccer, especially in the United States. The 23-year-old forward agreed to a new three-year deal with the Washington Spirit through 2028 reportedly worth more than $1 million per year, instantly making her the highest-paid player in NWSL history and among highest-paid women's soccer players in the world.

For collectors, moments like this matter. Salary breakthroughs tend to coincide with broader visibility, league-wide change, and a player crossing from star into market reference point. In Rodman's case, the deal didn't just reward performance, it helped force structural change, prompting the NWSL to introduce a new “High Impact Player” mechanism (quickly nicknamed the “Rodman Rule”) that allows teams to spend up to $1 million over the cap to retain truly elite talent. That's the kind of milestone that anchors an era.

Rodman's rise has been fast, loud, and largely uninterrupted. Drafted No. 2 overall by the Spirit in 2021 at just 18 years old, she became the youngest player ever selected in the NWSL draft and immediately justified the gamble. That same season she won NWSL Rookie of the Year and U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year, while delivering an extra-time assist in the NWSL Championship to help Washington lift the title.

By 19, she already held playoff records, and in 2022 she signed a reported $1.1 million extension that briefly made her the league's highest-paid player at the time. Even before this latest contract, the Spirit had effectively built around her as a franchise face: high-energy winger, defensive pest, transition threat, and marketing centerpiece rolled into one.

Internationally, Rodman has quickly become one of the defining figures of the U.S. women's national team's transition period. Since her senior debut in 2022, she has earned 47 caps with double‑digit goals and assists while helping the USWNT win the Concacaf W Championship, three straight SheBelieves Cups, the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup, and Olympic gold at Paris 2024.

Armed with speed, physicality, pressing, and highlight-reel finishes, her game translates cleanly to big moments and global broadcasts. Even after a recent back-injury layoff, her return to national-team camps under Emma Hayes has reinforced that she's viewed as a long-term pillar, not just a supporting piece.

Rodman's story also resonates beyond soccer. As the daughter of NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman, she entered the spotlight early, but made a point of carving her own path. She chose soccer over basketball, turned pro instead of playing college soccer at Washington State, and reached franchise-player status before turning 24. That blend of legacy, independence, and early success has helped push her into mainstream awareness.

Now, the numbers match the narrative. With club salaries historically topping out in the mid-six figures—nd even global stars in Europe often sitting below the $1 million mark—Rodman's deal stands as a genuine market reset. An NWSL winger in her early prime now sits at or above the club salary level of Ballon d'Or winners and Champions League icons.

For collectors, that's the signal. Contracts don't make careers, but they crystallize them. And Trinity Rodman's new deal feels like the moment her story, status, and market finally aligned.

This past September, United States Women's National Team's (USWNT) 21-year-old star Alyssa Thompson signed a contract to transfer from the National Women's Soccer League's (NWSL) Angel City FC to Chelsea FC in England's Women's Super League (WSL).
Thompson's move comes amid a growing wave of USWNT players heading overseas. In recent years, starting center back Naomi Girma and defender Emily Fox have also made the jump to European clubs.
So what is driving this trend?
One major factor is money. The NWSL operates under a $3.5 million team salary cap, while the WSL does not currently enforce such a cap. When Girma transferred to Chelsea, she became the most expensive women's soccer player in history, with the club paying $1.1 million to acquire her from the NWSL's San Diego Wave. Previously, when soccer icons Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan played for Lyon in 2013 and 2017, respectively, they reportedly earned more in a single month than many NWSL players made in an entire season.
European leagues also offer prestige and increased competitive opportunities. The WSL provides multiple high-profile competitions including the Football Association Challenge Cup, the League Cup and the UEFA Women's Champions League. For many American players, the Champions League remains the most coveted club trophy in the world. By comparison, the NWSL has only recently introduced additional competitions—and those tournaments have yet to gain widespread traction.
International experience is another draw. The NWSL is largely composed of American players whereas European leagues feature rosters filled with international talent. Competing with and against players from different countries can help athletes develop their game and better prepare for major international tournaments such as the FIFA Women's World Cup and the Olympics.
Why now?
While American players moving abroad is not new, the pace of these transfers has accelerated in recent years largely due to changes in the U.S. Soccer Federation's relationship with the NWSL.
Before 2022, many USWNT players were signed as “federation players” under U.S. Soccer contracts, making them the highest-paid athletes in the league. This system encouraged national team players to remain in the NWSL, as all USWNT players during the 2015 and 2019 World Cup cycles were based domestically. In effect, playing in the NWSL was closely tied to national team opportunities.
Now, players are free to sign wherever they choose. Five starters from the most recent Olympic roster are currently playing abroad. USWNT head coach and former Chelsea Women's head coach Emma Hayes has even faced criticism for the growing migration of players to Europe—though she has emphasized that the decisions ultimately rest with the athletes.
What does this mean for the NWSL?
The NWSL is still widely considered the top professional women's league in the world, and viewership and popularity have continued to rise over the past year. However, the departure of elite players like Girma and Thompson raises concerns about whether the league's overall quality and star power could decline over time.
There is a harsh reality to acknowledge: Women's soccer is still not among the most widely followed sports in the United States. If you ask a random person to name a women's soccer player, they will likely mention household names like Alex Morgan or Hope Solo who are now retired or no longer active at the top professional level. Among current players, the most recognizable names tend to come from recent U.S. national team and Olympic rosters such as Mallory Swanson, Trinity Rodman and Sophia Wilson. While all three currently play in the NWSL, they have also attracted strong interest from top European clubs, reflecting the growing global demand for elite American talent.
In response, the NWSL has begun taking steps to retain top talent after European clubs pursued Rodman. To keep Rodman in the NWSL, the league introduced the High Impact Player Rule (HIP), now commonly referred to as the “Rodman Rule.” This policy allows teams to spend an additional $1 million beyond the salary cap to sign or retain elite players who meet specific criteria, such as national team minutes or high rankings on year-end lists like ESPN's Top 50.
However, the NWSL Players Association has already challenged the rule, arguing that it violates the league's collective bargaining agreement and federal labor law. The union has instead advocated for raising the overall salary cap.
What's the bottom line?
The bottom line is that many of these top-performing athletes are not paid at a level that reflects their talent, workload or impact. Outside of a small group of high-profile stars, many NWSL players earn salaries that are barely a livable wage. To put the gap into perspective, the minimum salary for an NFL rookie is approximately $840,000, while Rodman earns roughly $275,000 annually from her NWSL contract. Even Morgan, widely considered one of the most recognizable women's soccer players in the world, earned around $250,000 per year in league salary at her peak. For many of these top athletes, a significant portion of their income comes from off-field endorsement deals—an opportunity that is far less accessible for lesser-known players, further widening the financial gap within the sport.
Despite these challenges, the NWSL continues to look ahead. The league plans to expand by three teams by 2028, signaling confidence in long-term growth. With the rising popularity of women's sports, the league may continue to thrive, but the loss of star players could have a greater impact than many expect.

Trinity Rodman is staying in the National Women's Soccer League.

The US Women's National Team star became the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world Thursday as she signed a new contract with the Washington Spirit.

According to ESPN's Jeff Kassouf, the three-year deal is worth $2 million annually, “a world record.”

“First off, it's amazing, but it's also relieving to finally have pen to paper, signed, confirmed,” Rodman said on SportsCenter Thursday evening. “I'm staying with the Spirit, so it is a relief, but I'm just thrilled. Very blessed. Very excited.”

Rodman entered free agency at the end of last season, but the process of re-signing her created league-wide issues. European teams — which do not have salary caps — attempted to lure the 23-year-old abroad, competing with an NWSL salary cap that would have limited Rodman's earning potential.

The NWSL rejected an earlier deal between the Spirit and Rodman, saying that it went against the spirit of the league's rules. The National Women's Soccer League Players Association filed a grievance before the NWSL created a “High Impact Player” rule, allowing teams to go above the salary cap for a certain caliber of player.

“It's been a roller coaster of emotions through it because there's one side of wanting to be paid well, wanting to stay in the US and represent my country, but also there's the other aspect — the other piece — of we want to get a lot more players paid this and continue to raise the bar for that," Rodman said. “Again, celebrating me, but at the same time, it's a big moment for soccer as a whole and another stepping (stone) for another opportunity for somebody else and hopefully numerous people around the league.”

La Liga

Real Madrid should arguably be looking at centre-back Nico Schlotterbeck; could Rodrygo be a solution on the left? Getty Images

Last summer, Xabi Alonso's ascension to the role of Real Madrid head coach felt natural. 

A popular former player and a promising young coach, the ex-Madrid, Liverpool and Spain midfielder spoke with a confidence and clarity that seemed, along with his impressive spell at Bayer Leverkusen, as if it would demand respect.

But managing Madrid is a different beast, and less than eight months after his appointment, Alonso was gone before his project had a chance to get off the ground.

There were myriad problems behind the scenes, including issues when it came to convincing some of the bigger names in the squad to adapt to his system. But Alonso also struggled with his fair share of injuries, inheriting a squad with notable issues when it came to recurring fitness problems.

Speaking in the wake of Alonso's sacking last week, sources close to Carlo Ancelotti's former coaching staff at Madrid, who asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships, said they saw “no solution right now” to the side's situation.

They said what the team really needs is a radical overhaul in the summer, financed by the sale of a big player such as Vinicius Junior or Jude Bellingham. They identified right-back, centre-back, right-winger and, above all, central midfield as the most urgent positions that need addressing, and suggested several other players to move on.

Laying out Madrid's squad on paper, those problem areas become clear to see. Despite a 6-1 rout of Monaco in the Champions League on Tuesday, they started with two midfielders (Federico Valverde at right-back and Eduardo Camavinga at left-back) in defence.



While the team looks well-covered at centre-back at first glance, persistent injuries to David Alaba and Antonio Rudiger have left them light. Eder Militao has also suffered another big setback, tearing his left hamstring after last season's anterior cruciate ligament injury (his second in two seasons). That leaves 20-year-old Dean Huijsen — himself battling calf issues — and 22-year-old academy graduate Raul Asencio bearing most of the responsibility at the heart of defence.

At right-back, it is another case of poor availability, with neither Trent Alexander-Arnold nor Dani Carvajal able to string together more than five consecutive starts this season before injury has struck. 



Further forward, the concerns are tactical. There is a feeling that Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga cannot dictate the rhythm of games in which Madrid control possession. Sorely missing the pinpoint distribution of Toni Kroos at the base of midfield, Madrid are struggling to open up tighter contests.

In attack, with both Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo preferring to play on the left, Madrid could do with a right-sided forward to ease expectations on 18-year-old Franco Mastantuono as he finds his feet in Europe, even after an impressive performance in that Monaco win, in which he scored his first goal in the competition.

All the while, the club's stance remains firm. The Athletic reported in the Transfer DealSheet on Tuesday that Madrid do not intend to make any signings this month, as they do not see any viable options available at a fair price. They are also strong in their belief that this squad is good enough to fight for La Liga and the Champions League.

But if they were to decide to shake things up, where would they need to start?

Though Madrid's midfield is packed with technically gifted and athletic midfielders with their best years ahead of them, it sometimes lacks an orchestrator to set the tempo and stamp authority on meandering games.

In end-to-end contests, dominant physical players often thrive. Away to Athletic Club, for example, who were happy to press high up the pitch, spaces opened up in midfield for Madrid's powerful box-to-box midfielders to exploit. Flanked by Bellingham and Valverde, Tchouameni and Camavinga anchored the midfield and covered ground effectively to win second balls and keep their team on the front foot.

But many of Madrid's opponents in La Liga are happy to sit deep and deny those runners space to arrive into, demanding a different type of midfielder — one who is good on the ball in tight spaces and incisive in their forward passing — to help break down stubborn defensive shapes.

Alonso trusted Arda Guler with that role, and while the 20-year-old Turkey international rewarded the coach's faith with a series of bright, creative performances on the ball, racking up seven assists in La Liga, problems emerged out of possession. As an attacking midfielder, Guler often lacked the defensive awareness to play a deeper central role and left gaps when deployed in a 4-4-2 formation.

Here they are against Celta Vigo. With Tchoaumeni pulled over to the left after a quick switch of play, Guler drifts over to help, but leaves the run of Ilaix Moriba untracked in behind.



The solution, then, is to find that player who can do it all — sit deep, control the flow of possession, cover position and snap into tackles. But how many of those midfielders are out there, ready to come in and make a difference right away?

On paper, the player within the squad best suited to such a role would be Tchouameni. According to data from SkillCorner, the France international is one of the best at retaining the ball under pressure. As we can see from the scatter plot below, Dani Ceballos also ranks strongly, but the eye test tells us the Spaniard does not quite move the ball on quickly enough, or have the physical capabilities to lock down such a demanding defensive role.

There is a yearning for a Kroos-like player, but such a combination of press resistance, along with an ability to distribute the ball at speed and with accuracy over large distances, will prove difficult to find.



Some other profiles have been discussed internally. AZ's Kees Smit is an elusive midfielder with a knack for wriggling his way out of tight situations with the ball at his feet, but at 19 years old, he would need time to settle. At Crystal Palace, Adam Wharton is excellent at moving the ball forward quickly and incisively, but is a risk-taker who may not fit the mould. Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez has shown he can command the tempo of games from a deeper role, but the Argentina midfielder would likely come with a sizeable price tag.

With Manchester City's Rodri and Martin Zubimendi of Arsenal firmly off the market, it will not be an easy search.

Madrid have struggled to name a consistent back four this season, largely due to injuries in the centre of defence and at right-back.

As we can see from the graphic below, only left-back Alvaro Carreras has played more than 75 per cent of the available game time, while neither Alexander-Arnold nor Carvajal have managed more than 500 minutes across all competitions.



With both Rudiger and Alaba struggling for fitness, it makes sense to start succession planning for left-sided centre-backs to provide competition for Huijsen.

In that regard, Borussia Dortmund's Nico Schlotterbeck seems a sensible option. The 26-year-old Germany centre-back is vastly experienced, with close to 150 Bundesliga starts, and is renowned for his progressive ability on the ball. His long-range passing is excellent — no centre-back in Europe's top five leagues has completed more per game since the start of last season — while he loves to fizz the ball through the lines with sharp, disguised passes into midfield.

As reported in The Athletic's latest Transfer Radar, Dortmund are still pushing for a contract extension for Schlotterbeck, but are yet to reach an agreement. Madrid would have to tread lightly around a previous meniscus tear, but he represents the kind of proven quality who could elevate the centre of defence.

Once again, Madrid's conundrum on the wings is all about each of their starting wide players — Vinicius Jr,  Rodrygo and Mbappe — preferring to play on the left.

Mbappe has settled into more of a striker's role, rotating in and out of the No 9 position to devastating effect. But questions remain over the future of Vinicius Jr — who was one of the players booed at the Bernabeu during their 2-0 win against Levante at the weekend — and Rodrygo, usually the player shifted over to the right to give the front three more balance.

As we can see from the graphic below, Rodrygo has been more lively from the left throughout his Madrid career, generating more combined expected goals (xG) and expected assists (xA) per 90 minutes from that flank, while attempting far more take-ons (7.4 vs 4.2 per 90) on his favoured side.

It suggests that, should Vinicius Jr leave, Madrid's replacement could lie within their ranks.



But that would leave the right side looking light, with only two natural wide players in Mastantuono and Brahim Diaz available to step up.

It could be an opportunity to look for a prime-age winger to rotate with Brahim while Mastantuono develops. Roma's Matias Soule is two-footed, creative, hard-working and likes to drop into those pockets of space where Nico Paz may roam next season if he returns from Italian side Como. Wolfsburg's Mohamed Amoura is lightning-quick and a fine finisher, a player who works hard to harass from the front and ensure that high-pressing systems do not fall apart.

It is in Madrid's nature to target the biggest names in international football, but spreading their funds across the team and recruiting those all-important players — the unflappable holding midfielder, the commanding left-footed centre-back, the energetic right-sided winger — could help fix some of the gaps that have emerged in their superstar squad.

It was not long ago that it looked like Casemiro would be leaving Manchester United in disgrace, ushered out the back door and out of European football for good, consigned to history as one of the club's worst transfer errors. Instead, he is set to leave with his head held high, showing that, contrary to Jamie Carragher's brutal assessment, the football never left him after all.

United's announcement on Thursday that Casemiro is set to leave the club in the summer when his contract runs out was perfectly timed, a rare case of the Red Devils getting something right. It came after one of the Brazilian's best displays of the season against Manchester City, when he received a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd and heard his name reverberate around the stadium. 

And it came as speculation was growing about whether or not the club would trigger his one-year contract extension, which was threatening to become a distraction from the pursuit of that all-important top-four finish. Now Casemiro has plenty of time to look for a new club and United have more time to begin their midfield rebuild and target players who are approaching their prime years.

It means that the Brazilian can focus on finishing his up-and-down United career on a real high and get the farewell he deserves for fighting his way back into the team and proving everyone wrong...

Casemiro had an enormous impact on United when he arrived from Real Madrid in August 2022. The team had lost their first two games of the season to Brighton and Brentford - getting hammered 4-0 by the Bees - and he instantly beefed up their midfield and sprinkled the squad with his win-at-all-costs mentality, honed from his eight years at the heart of Madrid's multiple Champions League-winning machine.

He was fundamental to United finishing third in the Premier League, reaching the FA Cup final and winning the Carabao Cup, which he celebrated on the Wembley pitch with just as much gusto as any trophy he had won with Madrid. Indeed, in an interview with AS last year Casemiro described the 2022-23 campaign as his best performance on an individual level of his entire career.

But playing over 50 games in a season took its toll on his body and the following campaign he looked like he was struggling to keep up with the pace of the Premier League while he also suffered two injuries. The rest of the squad was also obliterated by injuries and by the end of the campaign Casemiro was either asked to anchor an inexperienced midfield or play at centre-back, a position he had never previously played.

It was when playing at centre-back that Crystal Palace ran riot over United at Selhurst Park, hammering them 4-0. Casemiro was badly exposed by Michael Olise and that was when Carragher tore into the Brazilian on Sky Sports by saying: "I always remember something when I retired: 'Leave the football before the football leaves you'. 

"The football's left him at this top level. He needs to call it a day at this level of football and move. A man of that level should not be going through what he's going through now, he needs to call it a day."

Casemiro was then dropped from the squad for the FA Cup final. He was expected to leave that summer, especially if a club from Saudi Arabia came calling. No acceptable offers came in, however, and the Brazilian made a decent start to the following campaign. But it all unravelled again when he made a mistake leading to a goal against Liverpool and was hauled off at half-time by Erik ten Hag for 20-year-old debutant Toby Collyer.

The Brazilian didn't start another league game under Ten Hag for six weeks. Interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy did lean on the veteran heavily in his four games in charge after Ten Hag was sacked, but Ruben Amorim seemed to also write off the player, making him an unused substitute for 12 games in a sequence of 15.

Casemiro returned to the team against Tottenham, but only after an injury crisis afflicted Kobbie Mainoo and Collyer. And the coach gave a typically honest but brutal assessment of the player when speaking to TNT Sports Mexico around that time. He said: "We understand that Casemiro has other things nowadays. The intelligence he has, understanding the game, understanding where the ball is going to fall but we're in a league that I can see, even in European competitions, the difference in intensity is big. And so, I feel that this team also needs players with a very high intensity."

But once Casemiro got a run of games he began to prove his coach wrong and locked down his place in Amorim's line-up for the crucial stage of the season, playing a pivotal role in the run to the Europa League final. He contributed to three of the goals in the incredible extra-time comeback win over Lyon and scored in the semi-final first leg against Athletic Club. He also earned a recall to the Brazil squad under Carlo Ancelotti, his old boss in Madrid.

He has remained unmovable this season, starting 19 of United's 22 league games. And whenever he has not started, the team has badly suffered, losing against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup, Brighton in the FA Cup and Manchester City, Brentford and Aston Villa in the Premier League. He has contributed four goals and an assist from holding midfield and was outstanding in United's first win at Anfield in a decade and most recently against City.

In October Amorim hailed Casemiro for digging in to reclaim his place in the team. He said: "He fought and he worked and now he's back in the national team. He gives a lot of experience, he is an example for everyone. We understand that football can change really fast. You just need to work. You're going to play if you do the right things."

But that does not mean that United are wrong to be letting Casemiro go in the summer. He turns 34 next month and is among the club's highest-paid players. Reports of his actual salary vary from £325,000 per week to £375,000 per week, although he has been subject to a 25 percent reduction in his wage like every other player in the squad in the three seasons United have failed to qualify for the Champions League. The Athletic estimates that between his £70m transfer fee from Real Madrid and his salary over four years, he has cost the club a total of £119m.

Extending his contract by a year would have meant on the same terms as his initial agreement, costing the club between £16.5m and 19.5m annually. That figure would rise even more in the event United qualified for the Champions League. It has been reported that when Sir Jim Ratcliffe found out about Casemiro's salary, he raised the alarm and effectively used it as an example of the club's avarice before he arrived. 

In an era where Ratcliffe has taken away free lunches from employees and made up to 450 people redundant in order to save costs, Casemiro's salary was increasingly hard to justify. United sources have stressed that Casemiro's departure will enable additional capacity to invest in strengthening the squad as the club continues to build towards regular and sustained success.

Even with Casemiro's impressive resurgence, it is hard to not argue that United signing him in the first place smacked of desperation. The right thing to do now is to build for the future and target players who can lead United's midfield for the next decade, players such as England international Elliot Anderson and Palace midfielder Adam Wharton or Brighton's Carlos Baleba, who was a target last summer.

Casemiro said: "I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life" and he has also left his mark on the club. He might have been a stop-gap solution and an expensive one at that, but the Brazilian has brought a lot of joy to United fans and given them many moments they will never forget.

He took the club back into the Champions League, helped deliver a first trophy in six years and then reversed his own decline to give them some semblance of stability. Now he has four months left and United fans should savour them as it will not be easy to replace a player of his experience or with his utter refusal to throw in the towel.

The LEGO Group are building towards 2026 in serious style. Teaming up with FIFA ahead of the next World Cup, the iconic toy brand have pulled together a proper meeting of footballing immortals to celebrate the reveal of the LEGO Editions FIFA World Cup Official Trophy — and the vibes are exactly what you'd hope for.

Ahead of next summer's tournament, LEGO will roll out a dedicated product portfolio celebrating the biggest stage in the game, starting with the most iconic symbol of them all. Launching in March 2026, the LEGO FIFA World Cup Official Trophy is the first-ever, officially licensed 1:1 LEGO replica of world football's ultimate prize. Built from an impressive 2,842 pieces, it's designed as a centrepiece — something to build, display and obsess over as the tournament approaches.

A post shared by SoccerBible (@soccerbible)

A hidden scene sits inside the upper globe, revealed via a pullable slip, featuring the 2026 World Cup logo and an exclusive branded minifigure holding a miniature version of the trophy itself — a subtle nod to every fan's dream of lifting it one day. Beneath the base, a printed plaque lists every World Cup winner since 1974, grounding the set firmly in football history.

Even the gold matters. Two different finishes — drum-lacquered bricks and moulded gold pieces — combine to give the trophy its unmistakable sheen. It's also the first LEGO set ever to use this volume of gold-coloured elements, underlining just how special this one is meant to be.

And what better way to show it off than with the help of Roberto Carlos, Cafu, Iker Casillas, Sami Khedira and Marco Materazzi. Five winners. Five different journeys to the summit of world football. 

A post shared by SoccerBible (@soccerbible)

In a behind-the-scenes video, the legends are given their first look at the LEGO trophy set, and the reactions do not disappoint. There's laughter, disbelief, and that familiar glint in the eye that only comes from remembering what it feels like to lift the real thing. Stories spill out naturally — moments from finals, the weight of the trophy, the noise of the crowd — all refracted through a playful, nostalgic lens.

Naturally, things get competitive. Roberto Carlos and Cafu waste no time arguing over who gets to take the trophy home, before all five icons are handed personalised sets of their own. Beyond the jokes, though, there's a genuine sense of reflection. On childhood dreams. On football as a form of immortality. And on why a LEGO World Cup trophy might just be the perfect bridge between generations of fans.

As Roberto Carlos puts it: “Winning the FIFA World Cup was one of the most incredible moments of my life, and I'll never forget what it felt like to hold that trophy.

Cristiano Ronaldo is again being backed to break into Hollywood once the day comes to hang up record-shattering boots as a footballing GOAT. At 40 years of age, the Portuguese superstar has already dipped his toe into the movie industry. He could fully take the plunge at some stage, with fellow ex-Manchester United star Giuseppe Rossi billing CR7 as a perfect Joker for the Batman franchise.

Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo has offered no indication that he will be heading into retirement any time soon, with many backing the evergreen frontman to play beyond the end of his contract at Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr in 2027.

A day will come when the all-time great has to walk away, with various new career paths set to open up in front of him. Club ownership has been mooted, while plenty are tipping one of the most recognisable celebrities on the planet to try his luck on the big screen.

With a cameo appearance set to be made in the next Fast & Furious blockbuster, Rossi has told OLBG why Ronaldo could go on to much bigger things in Hollywood - with a spot in the DC Universe up for grabs.

Rossi said: “He's made for LA, man. He'd be perfect for LA. That's an interesting thought. I think he has the aura. He's got the fans. I think it would be an easy transition for him. He likes the spotlight so why not take advantage of it and go into a world that's kind of similar to professional sports and see how it goes. I'm very curious to see him as an actor. He would definitely be the villain in something. Let's make him the Joker in the next Batman maybe?”

Another former Premier League star, ex-Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Emmanuel Petit, has already speculated on how Ronaldo could one day challenge for an Oscar. The World Cup-winning Frenchman told Hochgepokert: “Could Cristiano Ronaldo end up being a huge movie star? Definitely. The surprise is why we don't see many more sports people in movies. We see rappers, we see influencers, we see so many well known people going into film but not sports people. Why?

“We are entertaining people as well. In sport, we have the character for that. I know that Eric Cantona has been doing that, Vinnie Jones, David Ginola, as well as Frank Leboeuf, have done that. Why can't more do that?

“I'm happy for Ronaldo. I think he has the charisma and the aura. Ronaldo is the most famous person on social networks. Can you imagine if he was in the middle of big Hollywood stars? 

“He would have nothing to prove to those guys. He can say, ‘I know you're a big star, but I am Cristiano Ronaldo. I am probably one of the best players in football history. I am a billionaire. I won everything I could win in football. So who are you?'

“The Oscars? One day. Honestly, you can make a movie on his life. I have never seen someone stronger than him mentally. This guy is the most powerful human being I've ever seen mentally.”

A move to the United States as a player has been speculated on for Ronaldo, with the world desperate to see him pair up with eternal rival Lionel Messi at MLS Cup winners Inter Miami. Not everybody, though, is convinced that would be a wise move.

Speaking to betting site BOYLE Sports, ex-Colorado Rapids striker Kevin Doyle has said: “I think it's a couple of years too late for Cristiano Ronaldo in MLS, I think the moment has passed. He picked Saudi Arabia, which would have been the perfect time to go.

“I know he's going to the World Cup at 40, if you play in the World Cup you can play in MLS, but maybe only for six months or so. I think making it just Messi vs Ronaldo would be a circus act. They're trying to make it a serious league and not just based on two players. I don't think it would be a good thing for the league, but let's see what happens.”

Ronaldo would be welcomed to Los Angeles if he opened himself up to a move, with South Korean superstar Son Heung-min already plying his trade in California, but it remains to be seen whether Tinseltown becomes a permanent base for CR7.

Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations when it comes to the US-shaped problem

Could European countries really decide to boycott the World Cup this summer? It is an astonishing question to be asking in 2026 and an indictment of the bind in which, as Donald Trump sows confusion around a potential annexation of Greenland, the world's most popular sport finds itself. But the idea is at least seeping into the mainstream and senior figures are asking what, in a worst-case scenario, it would take for football to meet the moment.

Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations. As the Guardian reported this week, an anniversary party for the Hungarian FA on Monday became the forum for unofficial discussions among national association heads about how a unified approach to the US-shaped problem might take shape.

While flexibility is essential in a volatile, fast-moving situation, there is an acceptance that no one can afford to be asleep if the time for action comes.

That is why there is a growing belief that Europe's governing bodies, whether led by individual federations or by Uefa itself, must cohere behind a common position – or at least prepare one. Sources have described a tightening of unity since Trump, whose suggestion on Wednesday he will not take Greenland by force – and later that there was the outlines of a deal – must surely be treated with caution.

While some federations are understood to have been relatively unbothered by the spectacle of Trump receiving a peace prize from the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in December, choosing in certain cases to find a funny side, the gravity of current events is lost on no one.

The tight bond between Infantino's leadership and the Trump administration means European football cannot look away. There is a consensus that Fifa has chosen to politicise itself; that could bring consequences if the US president intensifies his designs on a territory that belongs, indisputably, to a Uefa member in Denmark.

Then there is the precedent of recent history. Russia was quickly frozen out of international competition after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, essentially because other countries refused to compete against them. Why should the US be treated differently if it sent in the troops, and why should its part in the World Cup be indulged into the bargain?

Some key figures expect military aggression would be the breaking point for Uefa and the federations it covers. In the event Trump's latest pronouncements stand the test of time, it means any whispers about a boycott will remain hushed for now. It remains a far-flung prospect.

None of Europe's FAs are in a rush to go public with a stance and plenty may follow their governments' positions. The question is whether that would be enough for those who feel football has a unique opportunity to assert itself.

The French sports minister, Marina Ferrari, said on Tuesday, in response to calls from elsewhere on the political spectrum, that the country has no plan to boycott but added the caveat “as it stands now”. But the German minister for sports, Christiane Schenderlein, deflected any decision making to “the competent sports associations”.

There are certainly some within football's corridors of power who feel a stand could be made while politicians prevaricate. Trump has wedded himself to the World Cup project since his first term, naturally making mention of his own hard work in steering the bid when it succeeded in 2018.

The prospect of visible, palpable damage to his latest big moment would not be easy for the president to stomach. Perhaps, if Uefa and its federations flexed their muscles, Infantino could even feel compelled to engage in far-reaching diplomacy with his friend around the Greenland problem.

Some within Uefa would strain at the leash to see Infantino put in his place. Football's biggest governing bodies endured a high-profile falling-out in May over Infantino's conduct around the Fifa congress in Paraguay, although it was quickly smoothed over in public. More moderate forces close to the organisation may not favour incendiary moves this time, with the future of global football facing enough uncertainty, but the sport has been planted in uncharted waters and could find it needs to swim hard.

The hypotheticals continue but they cannot be purely dismissed as such. Recent events have underlined that football's leadership must be agile and the message is hitting home. Initiatives such as the hugely popular petition in the Netherlands, urging a boycott of the World Cup, suggest public sentiment would be supportive of decisive action if the unthinkable came to pass.

The pitch may quietly have been rolled. The enduring hope is that, for reasons in which football is unpleasantly enmeshed, it never needs testing out.

Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports on new details about why President Donald Trump wants control of Greenland on ‘Special Report.'

France's sports minister addressed questions about whether the country would consider boycotting the 2026 FIFA World Cup in response to the U.S.'s recent "framework" deal for control of part of Greenland. 

French Minister of Sports, Youth and Community Life Marina Ferrari told reporters this week the country has "no desire" to skip the cup, which takes place in North America this year.

"As it stands now, there is no desire from the ministry for a boycott of this great competition," Ferrari said. "Now, I will not anticipate what could happen, but I have also heard voices raised from certain political blocs. I am one who believes in keeping sport separate [from politics]. The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport."

Far-left French politician Éric Coquerel has called for the U.S. to be stripped of World Cup hosting rights and has suggested a boycott by France.

"Seriously, one imagines going to play the World Cup in a country who attacks its ‘neighbours,' threatens to invade Greenland and rides rough shod over international law?" Coquerel told reporters.

Trump announced on Truth Social Wednesday that the framework for a deal has been made for the U.S. to gain control of parts of Greenland.

"Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region," he wrote.

"This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations," Trump wrote in the post. "Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland."

During a speech at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Switzerland Thursday, Trump seemed to indicate that he would not use force to seize Greenland.

Despite similar calls for sanctions in response to Trump's foreign policy, the U.S. has not been penalized by any major sports bodies for its recent intervention in Venezuela either. 

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has responded to calls to exclude the U.S. and its athletes from the upcoming Winter Olympics over the intervention in Venezuela. The committee ruled out any penalty on the U.S.

"As a global organization, the IOC has to manage a complex reality. The IOC has to deal with the current political context and the latest developments in the world," the IOC said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. 

"The ability to bring athletes together, no matter where they come from, is fundamental to the future of values-based, truly global sport, which can give hope to the world. For this reason, the IOC cannot involve itself directly in political matters or conflicts between countries, as these fall outside our remit. This is the realm of politics."

One of women's soccer's biggest names is remaining in the United States and is becoming the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world in one fell swoop.  

Trinity Rodman agreed to a new contract with the NWSL's Washington Spirit to keep her with the team through 2028. It comes with an annual salary of over $1 million, her agent Mike Senkowski of Upper 90 Sports Group told ESPN.

“I've made the DMV my home and the Spirit my family, and I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,” Rodman said in a statement. “I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed. We're chasing championships and raising the standard, and I can't wait to keep doing that with my teammates and the best fans in the NWSL.”

Rodman had been a free agent since the end of 2025 when her contract expired, and there was an ongoing saga to try to sign the star to a new deal. 

Rodman, the daughter of Bulls great Dennis Rodman, was sought after by some of the biggest clubs across the globe. 

ESPN previously reported that teams — namely in England — made offers to Rodman that the Spirit would have struggled to match due to the constraints of the NWSL's salary cap. 

The Spirit and Rodman attempted to get creative to make a deal work in November by backloading a four-year deal worth over $1 million per year, but commissioner Jessica Berman stepped in to cancel the contract. 

Berman said that the deal “violated the spirit of the league.”

In an attempt to keep Rodman in the NWSL, the league's board of governors approved a new rule dubbed the High Impact Player rule, allowing teams to spend up to $1 million over the cap on contracts for star players who meet specific performance and marketability criteria. 

“Trinity is a generational player, but more importantly, she represents the future of this club and the future of women's soccer,” Washington Spirit Michele Kang said in a statement. This agreement reflects our belief that elite talent deserves elite commitment. At the Spirit, we are building something enduring: a club that competes for championships every year, invests in excellence and creates an environment where world-class players can thrive long-term. Trinity choosing to continue her career in Washington is a powerful statement about what we are building here.”

Rodman was selected second overall in the 2021 NWSL Draft at 18 years old and has become one of the biggest names in the league and for the U.S. Women's National Team.

Years ago, Valentin Vacherot would sometimes turn up at ATP Challenger events to simply watch his half-brother Benjamin Balleret compete.

The two Monegasques would hit a few balls together in the evening before Vacherot, still a schoolboy at the time with no real thoughts of turning professional, headed back to his studies. Tennis was something he enjoyed rather than something he chased, but today, the roles have reversed. It is now Balleret watching from the side of the court, guiding the 27-year-old Vacherot as he competes among the ATP Tour's elite.

“He was just playing tennis for fun,” Balleret told ATPTour.com, reflecting on Vacherot's teenage years. “He was going to school and playing from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. with his coach. He did this until he was almost 18 years old. I would bring him to some Challengers in Italy to just watch my matches. It wasn't serious, not really professional.”

What once felt like a casual introduction to life on Tour has evolved into one of the most compelling coach-player partnerships, built not solely on contracts but on family and belief. It is a relationship that made global headlines in Shanghai in October last year, when Vacherot stormed through qualifying to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in series history (since 1990).







Ironically, Vacherot began that Shanghai run as the No. 204 player in the PIF ATP Rankings — the exact career-high ranking Balleret reached during his own playing days. Now 43, Balleret admits he never achieved the success he hoped for as a player, but the lessons learned have become central to his effectiveness as a coach.
Before committing full time to Vacherot in 2022, Balleret built a strong coaching resume, guiding Gilles Muller to a career-high World No. 21 and working with Pierre-Hugues Herbert across a four-year spell that included three Grand Slam doubles titles. Those experiences helped shape a philosophy rooted in consistency rather than quick fixes.
“Every player, every human is different,” Balleret said. “Some things for me as a coach are important: work, respect… It doesn't matter who you coach, this has to be there. [You have to] work hard, respect and trust each other. Then everything outside of that, you have to adapt to every player.”

After Vacherot completed four years of college tennis at Texas A&M — where he played alongside his cousin Arthur Rinderknech, whom he later defeated in the Shanghai final — the brothers formally joined forces. What followed were seasons of steady progress, difficult losses and continued emotional investment.
“Sometimes it was difficult because it took time before what happened in Shanghai,” Balleret explained, referring to the sacrifices. “Because he's my brother, it was even more difficult when you don't have the results you want, when you feel like you're losing so much and you think that you shouldn't lose, some bad losses.
“But we never stopped believing, working and trusting each other — that's more important. Then Shanghai happened… I think everybody talks enough about this, but it was really unreal to go until the end.”

Coaching a family member presents its own challenges, particularly when the emotional lines between success and disappointment are thinner. For Balleret, learning when to step back as a brother and when to step in as a coach has been key to sustaining both the relationship and the results.
“I think it's even easier sometimes to tell things to your brother,” Balleret said. “The most challenging part is the emotional part. When we win, I try to not be overwhelmed with the win because it's also my brother and I'm so happy for him. It's the same for a loss. Sometimes it's difficult when you have a bad loss and not to be at the bottom, so I try to be really honest with him.
“I have this thing where I know him very well, better than almost everyone. So this has helped me, of course. But we're also not spending 24 hours together… We try to spend quality time together. It's pretty easy going. For most of the day, I'm his brother and not his coach.”
Shanghai also represented validation for a wider support team that had been carefully assembled over several seasons.
“Val and I, we tried for three years to put together a team that would help him reach his goals,” Balleret said. “That's why he's working with a fitness coach, Julien, his physio, Antoine, the mental coach, Isabelle. Also his girlfriend, Emily… We try to work all together and for all those people also, not only for Val and me.
“I'm so happy that Shanghai happened and that everybody's rewarded with all the work in the dark. We were working in the shadows for so many years. Now Val is more in the spotlight, everybody's more in the spotlight. We're not looking for the spotlight, but you just feel good reaching the goal and being there with the top players and playing every week against those players.”

Vacherot showed the Shanghai title was no one-off. He quickly rose inside the world's Top 40, reached the quarter-finals in Paris two weeks later and arrived at the 2026 Australian Open — his main-draw debut in Melbourne — as the 30th seed.
So where do they go from here? For Balleret, the focus remains unchanged.
“For this year, the goal for Val is to play the best players and to try to improve every week,” Balleret said. “Maybe he will play this guy and lose to this guy, but what can you improve to beat this guy next? That will be the main challenge this year for Val and I.”
More than 10 years after a young Valentin once watched from the stands without expectation, the tables have fully turned. Balleret is no longer the one being observed. Instead, he is the steady presence behind the scenes, guiding his half-brother through the brightest moments of a career that, not long ago, felt like nothing more than a game.

Teaming up with Nick Kyrgios, the two starred inside ANZ Arena by winning from three match points down against a team that has shared two mixed doubles titles together. Facing Desirae Krawczyk and Neal Skupski, the wild card pairing prevailed with a 6-7 (6), 6-4 [12-10] victory.“It was a lot of fun. My goodness,” reacted Fernandez. “I keep hearing how the crowd here in the AO is very rowdy, it's a party, and finally I have the chance to experience it, and I also get the chance to kind of compare it to the US Open. It's just very electric.“I was just excited to play the next point. I totally forgot the score sometimes and just enjoyed my time with them.”

Mixed doubles presents the former Grand Slam singles finalists an additional opportunity to leave the Happy Slam, well happy. Fernandez went down in her singles and doubles openers, while Kyrgios—who decided ahead of the tournament that he wasn't ready for best-of-five sets in singles—lost a tight doubles match with injured tour bestie Thansai Kokkinakis.“I have obviously played some amazing matches at AO, but that's got to be one of my favorite ones,” declared Kyrgios. “Like, 9-6 down, 7-3, realistically, tennis players, you don't always believe you can come back. But I was like, ‘Look, if we're just one at a time, maybe we can do it.'”The idea of joining forces initially came up in the opening week of the 2026 season when Fernandez and her father were having a light-hearted conversation.“We said, ‘Wouldn't it be cool if Nick and I, we played doubles together?' We were just talking like that, jokingly a little bit. And I feel like my dad took the initiative.“Nick was nice enough to say, yes. I immediately sent the message, and it was just kind of started off that way. Great that it worked out.”

Kyrgios shared following his exit with Kokkinakis that he doesn't know what comes next as it relates to his tour schedule. For now, expect the 30-year-old to stay present and enjoy the opportunity in front of him.“That atmosphere out there was special, and no other sport can really mix the two and create that energy. So I think it's super competitive,” he said.“The crowd, they were amazing all day, all night. They stayed, hung around. It was amazing. I'm really excited for our next round.”

The youngest player in the Top 100, 18-year-old Iva Jovic, dealt out the biggest upset of the tournament so far with a 6-2, 7-6(3) third-round defeat of No. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini.

The result put No. 29 seed Jovic into the second week of a major for the first time at just her sixth attempt. It's also her first win over a Top 10 player in four meetings. Two of the American teenager's three previous losses had come against Paolini, at Indian Wells and the US Open last year.

"I've been wanting this one for a while now," Jovic said in her on-court interview. "Had a couple of tough losses. I'm so happy to get through that barrier and get that win today."

In her press conference, Jovic revealed that she had been given some "very attentive tips" from former ATP World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in a conversation the previous day to incorporate into her game.

"Just to open up the court a little bit better, to not rush into the shots all the time, find some more width," she explained. "So I tried to do that, and it ended well. So I'm just going to try to keep listening to Novak."

Jovic, the daughter of a Serbian father and Croatian mother, is still closely connected to her roots. She visits Serbia annually, both the capital of Belgrade and the southern town of Leskovac, where she has extended family. The link to one of Serbia's greatest athletes of all time is a natural one -- though she still finds it surreal.

"It's pretty insane," she said. "You always think about those moments where you're going to meet your idols a little bit, and I think sometimes for certain people it can be a little bit deflating if they are maybe not as nice or as open as you anticipated. I think that happens a lot of times where you kind of see, oh, wow, that's definitely not how it looks like on TV.

"I think he's almost even kinder and even more attentive outside the cameras than what he's portrayed. It was amazing. I mean, he's so intelligent and smart and really wants to help the younger generation. So I'm really grateful to have that advice."

Djokovic's pointers were evident in Jovic's relentless, side-to-side offense in a dominant 37-minute first set. It forced Paolini to over-press in response -- she tallied 13 unforced errors and just four winners in the opener -- but the two-time major finalist made Jovic battle hard in the second. Paolini adjusted her tactics, pumping high balls to Jovic's backhand and extending the rallies. Jovic served for the match twice at 5-4 and 6-5, but was unable to close the deal.

But despite those setbacks, it was younger player who got on the front foot in an impeccable tiebreak, taking the lead with sweetly-timed backhands down the line and reaching match point with a bold return winner -- her 20th of the match.

"I tried to focus on what I was doing earlier in the match," Jovic said. "Being really aggressive and controlling the play. I think when I served for the match, I got a little too passive -- so I told myself to go out swinging and it helped in the tiebreak."

The result continues a rapid rise for Jovic, who was ranked No. 191 this time last year. She captured her first title on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz in Guadalajara last September, and started 2026 in fine form by reaching the Auckland semifinals and Hobart final. Her record this year is already 10-2, and she'll have the opportunity to extend that further against Yulia Putintseva in the fourth round.

MELBOURNE, Australia—When preparing to play one of the biggest tennis matches of your life, it doesn't hurt to get some advice from a 24-time Grand Slam champion.Iva Jovic revealed a chat with Novak Djokovic helped inspired the 18-year-old into a maiden Top 10 victory over Jasmine Paolini, conquering the No. 8 seed, 6-2, 7-6 (3).“He gave me some very attentive tips for my game and something I can try to incorporate into this match that I just played,” Jovic said in her post-match press conference on Friday, “so that was one of the things in the forefront of my mind, because I think when Novak gives you some advice, you follow it!”Jovic, a Serbian-American born in Torrance, California, first met Djokovic during last year's Wimbledon Championships, the chance meeting facilitated by USTA coach Kathy Rinaldi.

“We were practicing on the indoor courts at Wimbledon and he just walked in to a court close to us. His son was playing, and Kathy was like, ‘Let's go up to him right now!' I was like, ‘Kathy!'” Jovic laughingly recalled during the 2025 US Open.“He just wished me luck and told me to keep working,” she added. “It was kind of just a little bit of an introduction. I met Jelena there too, and his sons were playing. It was just so cool. There was nothing super specific said but just the way he talks, he has a thing about himself where you can tell that he's great. Not even seeing him on the tennis court, he has that presence, which is super cool.”In the midst of playing his 21st Australian Open main draw, Djokovic was more specific this time in talking to Jovic, who is playing her second.“It was just to open up the court a little bit better, to not rush into the shots all the time, find some more width,” Jovic explained.“So, I tried to do that, and it ended well. So I'm just going to try to keep listening to Novak.”

You always think about those moments where you're going to meet your idols a little bit, and I think sometimes for certain people it can be a little bit deflating if they are maybe not as nice or as open as you anticipated...I think he's almost even kinder and even more attentive outside the cameras than what he's portrayed! Iva Jovic on meeting idol Novak Djokovic

The teenager, who attracted a substantial gaggle of Serbian reporters and ended her press conference by taking questions in Serbian, was building towards a big result like this for several months. She won her first WTA 500 title in Guadalajara in September and kicking off the 2026 season with a runner-up finish at the Hobart International. She's yet to drop a set in Melbourne, but even if she's earned it, there's still something surreal about getting advice from your idol.“It's pretty insane,” admitted Jovic, who is closing in on a Top 20 debut. “You always think about those moments where you're going to meet your idols a little bit, and I think sometimes for certain people it can be a little bit deflating if they are maybe not as nice or as open as you anticipated.  I think that happens a lot of times where you kind of see, ‘Oh, wow, that's definitely not how it looks like on TV.' I think he's almost even kinder and even more attentive outside the cameras than what he's portrayed!“I mean, he's so intelligent and smart and really wants to help the younger generation. So, I'm really grateful to have that advice. Hopefully I'll speak with him more.”

On an early idol trajectory of her own, Jovic will play former world No. 20 Yulia Putintseva for the chance to reach a first Grand Slam quarterfinal—another potential goal achieved by the youngster so early into the new season.“You never know how the year is going to start,” Jovic admitted. “Obviously I had my hopes to start well and win a lot of matches, but you just never know when everything is going to click. It's really nice to be getting good results this early in the season, and hopefully I can keep going and winning some more.”And perhaps Djokovic will be watching.

On Thursday, 40-year-old Stan Wawrinka became the oldest man to reach the third round of the Australian Open since Ken Rosewall in 1978, while 37-year-old Marin Cilic showcased his own longevity by notching his 599th tour-level win, drawing level with Goran Ivanisevic for the most victories by a Croatian man in the Open Era.

And then there was 38-year-old, record 10-time champion Novak Djokovic, cruising into the third round in straight sets on Rod Laver Arena. All three featured in the Australian Open draw as far back as 2007, and their remarkable staying power has emerged as one of the defining talking points of the tournament's opening week in Melbourne.

On Friday, World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka was the latest star to weigh in on her admiration for the trio.

“These guys are legends, G.O.A.T.s, especially Novak,” Sabalenka said. “He's been developing his game his whole career. Right now, he's really relevant with young boys. He's playing incredible tennis. I feel like it depends on your physicality, of course, mentality, your approach to tennis. He's very healthy, fit. He's really focused. Yeah, at this age he's playing incredible tennis.

“I feel like there is no age anymore in sport. It depends how you approach everything and if you have a smart team around you. I feel your career can be extended for I don't know how many years.”



At 27, Sabalenka is herself at the peak of her powers. The top seed lifted the trophy in Melbourne in 2023 and 2024 and reached the final again in 2025. But could she still be competing a decade from now?

“I'm not sure,” Sabalenka said. “I cannot say anything because you never know. You don't know what's waiting for you tomorrow. Ideally for me, I would love to, I don't know, maybe have kids at 32 or something. But knowing me, I know that I love to accept tough challenges, so I feel like even after having kid, I would love to challenge myself, like coming back and see if I still have it, just to challenge myself.

“So probably we're going to see me being that grandma on tour trying. Hopefully I'll be pushing these young girls. Let's talk about that in 10 years. That's a long time.”

MELBOURNE, Australia—When it comes to blending tennis and fashion, Aryna Sabalenka is ready to return serve.Just days ago, the world No. 1 expressed interest in bringing her own haute couture eye to the tennis court after Naomi Osaka debuted an eye-catching Robert Wun ensemble for her Australian Open matches.“I would definitely do some cool entrance like red-carpet entrance, but I think I would style myself a bit differently,” she said on Wednesday.Now partnered with elite fashion brand Gucci, Sabalenka, who, like Osaka, is also sponsored by Nike, teased a fashion show of her own after booking her spot in the second week.“Well, Gucci is bold and expressive. I think it's the best fit,” Sabalenka said after edging past good friend Anastasia Potapova, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (7), donning a pair of Gucci sunglasses for effect.

After 100 matches at Grand Slam level, Carlos Alcaraz has compiled a record that places him in rarefied air.


The Spaniard, who advanced to the Australian Open fourth round Friday with a win against Corentin Moutet, owns an 87-13 record at the majors, equalling Bjorn Borg for the best start through 100 matches in the Open Era. 


Alcaraz has surpassed legends, including Rafael Nadal and fellow ATP No. 1 Club member John McEnroe, who both went 86-14 across their first 100 major matches. The World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings is setting a standard that some of the sport's greatest names did not reach as quickly. 

Most wins after 100 major matches in the Open Era

Novak Djokovic, a record 24-time major titlist and 10-time champion in Melbourne, went 79-21 across his first 100 Slam matches, while Swiss Roger Federer went 80-20. Alcaraz's great rival Jannik Sinner played his 100th major match (81-19) last year at Wimbledon, coincidentally against the Spaniard in the championship match. The Italian won that clash.


At just 22 years old, Alcaraz is a six-time major champion who this fortnight is chasing more history. Should he claim his maiden Australian Open title, Alcaraz would complete his Career Grand Slam and become the youngest player to achieve that feat.


Alcaraz's journey at the Slams began four years ago at Melbourne Park, where the then-No. 141-ranked qualifier earned a milestone first major victory against Botic van de Zandschulp. In 2022, Alcaraz captured his maiden major crown at the US Open and with that victory, he became the youngest World No. 1 in PIF ATP Rankings history.


One of 29 members in the prestigious ATP No. 1 Club, Alcaraz has already secured a memorable milestone with his latest victory Down Under. Yet the Spaniard is chasing a bigger prize, aiming to leave Melbourne with the trophy in his luggage for the first time.

2025 WTA Newcomer of the Year Victoria Mboko will face World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the fourth round of the Australian Open after both won tense third-round matches.

Victoria Mboko's Australian Open breakthrough now carries her into a fourth-round meeting on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz with World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The 19-year-old No. 17 seed sealed a second-week berth regrouped after failing to convert three match points in the second set of an eventual 7-6(5), 5-7, 6-3 win over No. 14 seed Clara Tauson in the third round on Friday, a win that puts her through to the fourth round of a Grand Slam event for the first time in her career in her fourth main draw played.

Simultaneously, two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka was navigating her own tough test inside Rod Laver Arena to reach the second week in Melbourne for a sixth year in a row. Up against Anastasia Potapova, Sabalenka found herself reeled in from a 7-6(4), 4-0 lead -- and eventually, saved four set points in the second-set tiebreak to win 7-6(4), 7-6(7).

Mboko did not come close to losing a set in each of her first two matches of her Australian Open debut and looked on course to do the same against Tauson. After edging out an opening set tiebreak after being ahead by a break of serve twice, Mboko came from an early break down to build a 7-6(5), 5-3 lead. 

But Tauson found her best tennis in the next games -- most crucially, when she was one point from defeat three times serving down 5-4. Five games in a row went to the Dane to not just earn her the second set, but an early break in the third. 

Mboko later said "self-belief" was what helped her get over the finish line in 2 hours and 19 minutes. She broke back immediately, the start of a four-game run of her own, and hammered back-to-back backhand winners to clinch the match from 30-30 in the final game.

"I had so many chances in the second set but I have to give credit where its due, she was playing incredible tennis, so I just had to lock in in the important moments," Mboko said afterward. "When you have those chances like that, and you're up in the match, and you have opportunities to finish but don't take it, it can be very discouraging. But that's why there's a third set, and I was able to regroup, find my groove again, and get it done. ... I really fought hard today."

With the loss, Tauson drops to 0-3 in her career in Australian Open third rounds.

In two previous matches against Potapova, Sabalenka surrendered just seven games in four sets played. And after the tightest set between the two so far in a 1 hour and 4-minute opener, she won 16 of the first 19 points in set two. 

"She played incredible tennis. I was always on the back foot, and to be honest, there are days where you just have to be there, to fight and try your best to put the ball back," she said. "Even though emotionally I was all over the place, I was able to still fight for every point ... and I'm just super happy that I was able to get this win. It was such a fight and I really enjoyed it.

"I was just trying to calm myself down, which wasn't working well today, but at the same time, I was trying to figure out how to connect my body. It seemed like everything was working separate. My brain was somewhere else, my arms were going one direction ... and I was looking to put pressure on her, to try to let her play basically, and somehow, magically, I was able to get this win."

Sabalenka has now made the fourth-round or better at the last 13 Grand Slam events she has contested dating back to a third-round loss at Roland Garros in 2022.

Ousting the sport's elite is never meant to be easy, but Botic van de Zandschulp has repeatedly shown he possesses the belief, and the game, to trouble the very best on the biggest stages.

The 30-year-old Dutchman will look to tap into that giant-slaying pedigree again on Saturday, when he faces record 10-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic in the third round at Melbourne Park. It is a daunting assignment, but not an unfamiliar one for Van de Zandschulp, who has beaten ATP No. 1 Club members Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal within the past two years — and holds a recent victory over Djokovic himself.

“It's always nice to play one of the best of the game. It's a nice matchup as well, I know I can play well during them and I've proved it in the past,” Van de Zandschulp told ATPTour.com in Melbourne. “I know what I'm capable of… It gives you a confidence boost when you see those names in the draw. Of course you are scared, but further into the tournament when I have some matches in, I feel I can beat a lot of players.

“Matches like these against Novak, if you can enjoy it during it, it's a really nice occasion.”

Van de Zandschulp prevailed in his most recent Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Djokovic last year at Indian Wells, a match he remembers vividly. Entering the main draw as a lucky loser, the Dutchman produced a clinical deciding-set performance to spring the upset.

“I didn't feel great at that time, but now I am feeling a little bit better tennis-wise,” Van de Zandschulp said, reflecting on their Indian Wells clash. “Hopefully that helps me… Here in Australia, it's one of his favourite tournaments, one of his favourite courts, so it will be a different test. He was struggling there [in Indian Wells]. The conditions were tough: pretty hot, pretty bouncy.”

Djokovic is far from the only superstar Van de Zandschulp has tested — and toppled — in recent seasons. He stunned Alcaraz in the second round of the 2024 US Open and, two months later, famously brought Nadal's storied career to a close at the Davis Cup Finals.

Each victory offered a different form of validation, reinforcing his ability not only to match the sport's elite shot for shot, but also to manage the moment and the magnitude of the occasion.

“Beating Alcaraz over five sets is not an easy task, but beating him 3-0 was something I couldn't imagine before stepping on court,” Van de Zandschulp said. “[Beating] Rafa was also pretty special because it's not often in tennis you know who you are going to play a month in advance.

“I found out that it was going to be his last tournament and that we were going to play Spain in the quarters. If he was going to play, I would be the one to play him, so I thought a lot about the match when usually you don't have time to. That was, mentally, the toughest match for me.”



When Van de Zandschulp walks onto Rod Laver Arena this weekend, it will mark his third consecutive year competing on the iconic stage. He fell to Jannik Sinner and Alex de Minaur in first-round encounters in the past two editions of the hard-court major. Those were experiences that, while bruising, have helped remove the novelty of the occasion.

Now, the Dutchman is back in the Australian Open third round for the first time since 2022, having dropped just one set en route after victories over 27th seed Brandon Nakashima and Shang Juncheng.

“I'm really happy about it. It's been a while since I won a match here,” said Van de Zandschulp. “The last two years, I had some tough draws with Sinner and De Minaur in the first round. But I'm playing some good tennis again - I started the season pretty well.

“It's good I already played there [Rod Laver Arena] as it's nothing new, but it's still going to be a huge challenge.”





Part of that renewed confidence can be traced back to a more settled offseason — a rarity in recent years. With Davis Cup commitments stretching deep into November, Van de Zandschulp has often had limited time to reset physically and mentally.

“The last couple of years, we have played Davis Cup in November, so the offseason has been pretty tough, pretty busy,” he added. “Now I already had three weeks off, five weeks practice, so I think that did me pretty well, especially for the mind, being at home a little bit longer. I really enjoyed my offseason and have started fresh.”

Against Djokovic on his most decorated stage, Van de Zandschulp will once again arrive as the underdog. Yet history suggests that is a role he knows how to embrace.

Dr. Mark Kovacs has known Frances Tiafoe since he was 12 years old. Kovacs, with the USTA at the time, worked with a group that included Tiafoe, Reilly Opelka, Taylor Fritz, Stefan Kozlov and Michael Mmoh.

Fifteen years ago, Tiafoe and the rest of the group were not competing on the world's biggest stages like they are today. They were putting in the hard yards on and off the court, dreaming of eventually being where they are today.

“Great person, super friendly with everyone, has an unbelievable heart, loves the game of tennis, loves to practise, loves to train, loves to be out on court, and loves to watch tennis as well,” Kovacs told ATPTour.com of Tiafoe. “He's the same person and I've worked with him in the purest form. It wasn't at the Grand Slams. It was on back courts, no one around, grinding for hours, working on your game, working on your fitness, doing all those types of things.

“That's sort of the same environment we're trying to create again. It's like, ‘Hey, this is the pure love for the sport'. Commit to what you're great at, work on the details, be as consistent and deliberate as we possibly can.”





Already a two-time US Open semi-finalist and a 2019 Australian Open quarter-finalist, Tiafoe on Friday evening will play sixth seed Alex de Minaur inside Rod Laver Arena, the No. 1 court at Melbourne Park. On this big occasion, Kovacs is by Tiafoe's side again.

They have kept in touch over the years, while Kovacs, known for his high-performance and performance physiology work as well as sports technology consultancy, has helped many clients across different sports and industries.

At the end of last season, Tiafoe was making changes and reached out asking if Kovacs could help, even just for a reset during the preseason. Kovacs “wants the best” for Tiafoe, so he happily obliged.

“As things went along, he asked me if I'd be willing to take more of a serious role and sort of help him on the journey,” Kovacs said. “And obviously, I had to think about it. I've got a lot of things that I do. 

“But I gave him a handful of non-negotiables and said, ‘Hey, if you're willing to do these things, then let's do it'. He was willing to do these things. And I said, ‘Hey, if you're fully committed and ready to go all in, and try to get this done, then so am I'.”

According to Kovacs, their collaboration has been “great so far”. Tiafoe has been doing everything he has asked.  

“He's got great ability. We all know he could play tennis at a high level,” Kovacs said. “Now it's about, ‘Can he take care of the little details on a daily basis?'”

An example for Team Tiafoe is time. Being on schedule is of the utmost importance, and Kovacs has integrated something he saw done in another sport into Tiafoe's daily routine.

“I worked in the NBA for a few years. There's a fine system in the NBA if you're late. I have the same policy,” Kovacs said. “We abide by a fine system, all of us on the team. So it's consistent. It's not just for the player, it's for the coaches, it's for everyone else. So things like that, if you're late, there's a dollar amount that's attached to it.”

Kovacs and company have worked on changing certain habits and several things they are working towards to allow Tiafoe to perform the best he can on court.

“There's a combination of things, and most of the time, it's on things that he wants to do to get the end goal, and I'm just giving him some steps along the way,” Kovacs said. “If you really want to get these outcomes, these are the deliberate processes that we have to go through. And we're really not focused on outcome at all. It's all about daily process, daily improvement. and setting a consistent standard that we all can live to. The entire team is accountable. It's not just him.”

Something that has been working well has been Kovacs and Tiafoe's communication. Because they have known one another for more than half of Tiafoe's life, they are able to cut to the chase.

“I can speak to him very differently than even I can speak to maybe other players I've worked with in the past, if we don't have the same relationship,” Kovacs said. “And he can speak to me in a different way as well. He doesn't have to bide his time, be cautious about what he says, how he says it. He knows we're all here for a very simple purpose and we're working together to try to see if he can achieve it.” 

Tiafoe will put his efforts to the test against De Minaur, one of the toughest competitors in the sport in what promises to be a raucous atmosphere, an environment in which the 29th seed has long thrived.

“I want him to enjoy it. This is why you do this,” Kovacs said. “I tell him every day, ‘You chose this life. You made the decision to be a professional tennis player… Go out there, have as much fun as possible while following the plan, while staying on the course, while doing the things that you've been trained to do'. So that's what we want.”

Hamilton reflects on Ferrari's 'remarkable' journey at Maranello launch

Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history'

Ahead of the manufacturer's first season in F1 as a works team, Audi are set to launch their own Driver Development Programme.

Audi have announced the launch of their Driver Development Programme ahead of the manufacturer's first season as a works outfit in Formula 1, with the initiative set to be directed by former F1 driver Allan McNish.

Identified as a key part of the team's strategy to build a competitive Formula 1 team by investing in young talent on and off the track, the programme will scout and support promising young drivers from karting and junior formula series, providing a clear path to the top echelon of motorsport.

Members of the Driver Development Programme will receive world-class training and mentorship as part of a bespoke programme, covering various aspects from on-track performance and driving and engineering development, through to human performance and media and marketing.

McNish brings a wealth of experience to his role with the programme. Along with his racing background – which includes an F1 stint with Toyota in 2002 and three 24 Hours of Le Mans victories – the Scot has worked in team management roles and has held a long-standing relationship with the Audi brand.

“To be entrusted with finding the cornerstones of the future Audi Revolut F1 Team is a great honour and a responsibility I am very passionate about,” said McNish. “This brand is built on a history of 'Vorsprung durch Technik', and that philosophy must apply to our young drivers as much as to our cars.

“We are not just looking for raw speed; we are looking for the resilience, intelligence, and team-driven mindset that defines a future Audi champion. Our goal is to build a pathway that turns potential into precision and performance on the world stage.

“I am thrilled to begin this work and identify the first generation of talent to join this ambitious project."

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal of Audi, added: “Investing in the champions of tomorrow is a key pillar of our Formula 1 strategy. The Audi Driver Development Programme is a clear statement of our long-term commitment to youth and our ambition to be competitive.

“With Allan McNish, we have a director who not only has an incredible track record in motorsport but also embodies the spirit and dedication of our operations. Under his leadership, this programme will be integral to our vision for 2030, our goal of building a winning team and shaping the future of Audi in Formula 1."

The news comes after Audi unveiled their 2026 F1 car, the R26, at an immersive launch event in Berlin.

Hamilton reflects on Ferrari's 'remarkable' journey at Maranello launch

Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history'

Mercedes have unveiled the first images of their 2026 challenger, featuring a new livery in their iconic colours.

Mercedes have revealed the first images of their 2026 challenger, which features a revised livery in their iconic silver and black colours.

The Silver Arrows, who fought back to finish second in the Teams' Championship last year, will run an unchanged line-up of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli this season.

The W17, like all its rivals, will be smaller, narrower and lighter than its predecessor as it has been designed and built to sweeping new aerodynamic regulations.

“Formula 1will undergo significant change in 2026, and we are prepared for that transition," said Team Principal and CEO Toto Wolff.

"The new regulations demand innovation and absolute focus across every area of performance.

"Our work on the new car, and the long-term development of the Power Unit and advanced sustainable fuels with Petronas, reflects that approach.

"Releasing the first images of the W17 is simply the next step in that process.

"It represents the collective, sustained effort of our teams in [their Power Unit base in] Brixworth and [chassis base in] Brackley. We will continue to push hard in the months ahead."

Mercedes will join the rest of the teams in Spain next week for the five-day Barcelona Shakedown.

The eight-time world champions will then host a season launch event with their drivers, senior personnel and the W17 on February 2.

Afterwards, the squad will then head to Bahrain for official pre-season testing, with two three-day tests planned for teams to refine their cars and start to chase performance.

Harry Styles fans knew they were going to get a new music video on Friday (Jan. 23) for “Aperture,” the singer's latest single, but what they didn't realize beforehand was that they were going to get the tracklist to his upcoming album, too.


	While waiting for the visual to premiere at noon ET, fans with the video's countdown pulled up on YouTube noticed that the filler image kept changing. One by one, the titles of all 12 songs on Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally popped up, styled in the form of a circular spiral.

	











	With minutes left to go before the “Aperture” music video went live, the final track name — “Carla's Song” — appeared, completing the design. 


	According to the graphic, “Aperture” won't just serve as the lead single off of Styles' fourth solo LP — it will also be the opening number on the tracklist. Other intriguing titles include “American Girls,” “Season 2 Weight Loss,” “Pop” and “Dance No More.”




	Though fans got to hear the house-inspired, dance-inducing “Aperture” on Thursday (Jan. 22) and watch its music video the next day, they'll have to wait until March 6 to hear Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally in full. The One Direction alum's next project will come more than three years after his last full-length, Harry's House, dropped in 2022 and spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. 


	“It just became really obvious that it was music that was meant to be played loud,” Styles said of making Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally in a recent interview with John Mayer. “That is when it feels its best … I hope that people will kind of road test it in a couple different ways and see how their album experience kind of shifts.”


	See the full Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally tracklist below.

He also said that instead of feather boas, he wants his fans to show up to his tour in their dancing shoes.

Harry Styles' new album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, is coming this spring — but will there be any featured artists joining him on the dance floor?


	According to the British pop star, no. In an interview with Capital Breakfast on Friday (Jan. 23), Styles managed fan expectations by revealing that — like all three of his prior solo albums — HS4 won't include any special guests. “There are no collabs on this album,” he said, choosing not to beat around the bush when asked about it point-blank. 

	











	He added with a shy grin, “Just me.”


	The musician's answer may not come as a surprise, as Styles has never been one for including duets on his albums. His 2017 self-titled debut, 2019's Fine Line and 2022's Harry's House were all strictly solo works, and all of them reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200. 


	The interview comes hours after the release of Styles' first single in years, “Aperture.” The house-inspired track marks the first taste fans are getting of Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, which is due out March 6.


	Elsewhere in the interview, the One Direction alum spoke about having to “fall in love with music all over again” during his three-year break from the spotlight after feeling burned out from his Love On Tour, as well as gushed about his lifelong love of Shania Twain, who will be joining him on a few dates of his recently announced Together, Together tour.












	And while Styles' fans have shown up to his shows in sparkles and feather boas in the past, the Grammy winner told Capital Breakfast that this time around, “I just want them to come ready to dance.” 


	“I want them to come ready to be with their friends, close their eyes, open their eyes, dance, let it go and be whatever and whoever they are in that moment,” he said. “And I think it's going to be fun and I'll be right there with them.”


	Watch Styles' full interview on Capital Breakfast below.

EXCLUSIVE: The Walking Dead star Ross Marquand (who plays Aaron in the hit AMC series) is leading horror-thriller Unknown Company, which has wrapped production and is now moving into post-production. 


	Set in the final days of World War II, the film follows a small unit of American soldiers sent behind enemy lines to locate the wreckage of an unidentified object. The mission quickly becomes a psychological and moral reckoning, forcing the men to confront fear, loyalty, and the consequences of the unknown. Above and below are first-look stills.


	Directed and produced by Vincent Talenti (Transformers: War for Cybertron) and written by Gavin Hignight (Gundam: Requiem for Vengeance), the film also stars Hugh Scott (Deadpool), Zak Steiner (Euphoria), Mace Coronel (That '90s Show), and Kevin Brooks (Glowzies), with Sarah Hay (Flesh and Bone) and Nolan North (Uncharted).

	“Unknown Company is a story about what it means to be human in the face of the inexplicable,” said Talenti. “The supernatural is grounded in real human stakes: relationships, regrets, and the brutal context of a world at war.”

	The Civil Right Division of the Department of Justice was created in 1957 to act as the federal government's independent investigative and enforcement mechanism for civil rights law in the United States. The office oversaw landmark cases such as Brown v. Board of Education, the enforcement of voting rights for Black Americans in the desegregated South, and the investigation into the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. 


	The division may have investigated Floyd's murder in Minneapolis in 2020, but in the wake of Renee Good's killing there earlier this month, it is now more concerned with those protesting ICE's brutal, ostensibly unconstitutional conduct in the city. The Civil Rights Division's new mission is the direct result of Donald Trump retaking office, after which it cut staff and reoriented itself to focus less on the rights of the underrepresented, and more on the president's retribution agenda, the exclusion of transgender athletes from sports, and supposed slights against white, Christian Americans.

	











	Upon his reelection, Trump nominated attorney and former Fox News talking head Harmeet Dhillon to serve as assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. Dhillon, who worked as a legal adviser for Trump's 2020 campaign, moved quickly to purge the division of senior officials and dismiss a slew of ongoing cases — many focused on police brutality and law enforcement misconduct. In a series of memos, Dhillon outlined that the division would be shifting its priorities to “Keeping Men out of Women's Sports” and “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling.” 

	











	It was “really hard to write transition memos feeling like they were just going to go in the trash,” a former employee of the Civil Rights Division tells Rolling Stone. The former employee, who was granted anonymity to speak more freely about their experience, described the frenetic shuffling of staffers between departments and agencies amid the administration's early DOGE cuts and mass firings.

	“I think of the people that I worked with who filed complaints [to the DOJ] and were looking for help from the U.S. government, and just kind of completely disappeared on them,” they say. “It's particularly impactful when [it's] the U.S. government. When you're a person facing discrimination, and you'll go anywhere for help, and somebody actually answers, and then all of a sudden you never hear from them again.” 


	Many of the cases handled by the Civil Rights Division had been ongoing for years. Others were confidential, as the department tends to keep active investigations under wraps until they determine a finding is in the public interest. The staffer recalls that in one instance, they had been instructed to investigate a viral post on X “as if it was a complaint we'd receive from a citizen.” 


	Dhillon's management of the division was thrust back into the national spotlight this month after the DOJ refused to open an investigation into the killing of Renee Good, a Minneapolis mother of three who was shot and killed in her car by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Shortly after her murder, the Justice Department indicated that it would not launch a probe into the incident, with sources telling CBS News that the division's criminal section was explicitly ordered not to pursue an investigation into Good's killing — sidelining them from a case they would have typically pursued under past administrations. Instead, sources within the department told multiple outlets that the DOJ had begun investigating Good's widow, Becca Good, on allegations of impeding a federal officer and ties to activist groups. Dhillon, a prolific social media poster, boosted unfounded claims on social media that Good was associated with “Antifa”, and statements from Trump describing Good as a “professional agitator.”

	Stacey Young, founder and executive director of Justice Connection, a network of DOJ alumni, and a former senior attorney in the Civil Rights Division, tells Rolling Stone that Dhillon's management of the division — which mirrors the administration's affinity for bold declarations on television social media — is undermining the work of the department. 

	











	“They're all about clicks and PR,” Young says. “You're seeing Harmeet Dhillon not just prematurely announce investigations on social media, but threaten individuals and entities on social media.” 


	“To use the DOJs incredible power and influence to threaten people online,” she adds. “I mean, it's hard for the division to maintain any kind of integrity when its leader is willing to engage in that conduct.”


	Earlier this month, half a dozen Minnesota federal prosecutors resigned over the DOJ's  handling of Good's case. The departures included Joseph H. Thompson, who had spearheaded the state's case against a widespread network of social services fraud that has become a flashpoint in the administration's anti-immigrant messaging. 


	“When you lose top leaders in offices like that, not only do you lose their own institutional knowledge and expertise, but it's extremely destabilizing to the rest of the office,” Young explains of the mass exodus taking place throughout the Justice Department. “Some of the top folks in that U.S. Attorney's Office, and in the Civil Rights Division — you lost almost the entire leadership structure [and] that's going to crush morale among those who stay, and degrade the work that office will do going forward.” 


	As reports of ICE misconduct continue to emerge from Minnesota, — including the beating and mistreatment of detained individuals, racial profiling, and the snatching of citizens and other individuals with legal status — the focus of the DOJ is set on the actions of anti-ICE protesters.


	On Sunday, Dhillon announced a DOJ investigation into a protest held at a church in the Twin Cities area. A group of activists — along with former CNN host Don Lemon, who was covering the protest — interrupted a service at the Cities Church in St. Paul. Around 40 individuals chanted and paraded around the interior of the church, where Pastor David Easterwood — acting field director of the St. Paul ICE office — preaches. 


	The protesters chanted “ICE out!” and “David Easterwood, out now!” They then left the church and marched to a nearby alley. Right-wing commentators were quick to label the protest an instance of domestic “terrorism,” and Dhillon appeared on conservative streamer Benny Johnson's show and announced that the Civil Rights Division was investigating the incident as a potential hate crime, and was looking into charging protesters under the FACE Act and the KKK Act of 1871. 

	











	The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) is a 1994 law that prohibits the use of force or intimidation against individuals seeking abortion care, exercising their religious rights in a place of worship, as well as vandalism and destruction of reproductive clinics or places of worship. The Enforcement Act of 1871 — known as the KKK Act — prohibits certain forms of conspiracy to violate the civil rights of individuals. 


	“Whenever anyone conspires to violate the protected civil rights of American citizens, the Klan Act can be used to bring a conspiracy charge,” Dhillon told Johnson. 


	In a post on X, Dhillon directly warned Lemon that he was “on notice.” 


	“A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws! Nor does the First Amendment protect your pseudo journalism of disrupting a prayer service,” she wrote. 


	Looking to “social media to find violations” is an “absurd way to try to enforce civil rights laws,” Young, the former Civil Rights Division attorney, tells Rolling Stone. “Going about doing the division's work by social media is clownish.” Young adds that Dhillon's plans to use the FACE and KKK acts against the protesters would be a “novel use” of the laws, and that given the nonviolent nature of the protest, it was not an incident that “you'd usually see in a case the Civil Rights Division would pursue.”

	Regardless, the administration is plowing ahead. Attorney General Pam Bondi added in a separate post that “attacks against law enforcement and the intimidation of Christians are being met with the full force of federal law.If state leaders refuse to act responsibly to prevent lawlessness, this Department of Justice will remain mobilized to prosecute federal crimes and ensure that the rule of law prevails.” 


	Trump — long a critic of Lemon's — amplified calls for his arrest on Truth Social, writing that participants in the protest were “troublemakers who should be thrown in jail, or thrown out of the Country.” As of Thursday, the administration has announced the arrests of three people who participated in the protest. Despite the incident being a peaceful demonstration, members of the administration — including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel — have described it in various instances as a “riot” or an “attack” on the church. The DOJ tried to bring charges against Lemon, as well, but a federal magistrate judge rejected the move, citing First Amendment protections for Lemon in his role as a journalist.

For moviegoers of a certain age, child star Corey Feldman has remained an object of endless fascination. From early roles in “Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter,” “Gremlins,” and “The Goonies” to his collaborations with Corey Haim in “The Lost Boys,” “License to Drive,” and “Dream a Little Dream,” he was ubiquitous in theaters and on cable TV in the 1980s — Jordan Peele called him one of the greatest teen icons of all time. As an adult, however, Feldman entered a decades-long stint in the tabloid wilderness, working as an actor only intermittently after struggles with addiction and the trauma of alleged abuse as a child in the film industry.

Feldman was a legitimately great actor with both dramatic (“Stand by Me”) and comic (“The ‘Burbs”) chops, but in the 1990s and beyond he became known less for his talent as a thespian than for his bizarre forays into pop music and for “Corey's Angels,” a group of attractive young women who lived in his house and served as his backup band. Feldman claimed they were aspiring actors and singers he was supporting; to the outside world it sometimes looked as though Feldman was exploiting them or even serving as a kind of amateur cult leader. Feldman's frequent assertions of his own abuse and exploitation when he was younger only served to complicate the issue.

 










Documentarian Marcie Hume is one of those people who always found Feldman to be an intriguing figure, and in 2016 she began filming him for what would ultimately become “Corey Feldman vs. the World,” a riveting feature documentary that follows Feldman and his “angels” on tour. Hume was given incredible access to Feldman for around a year, and the film that resulted from it is astonishing — riotously funny, deeply troubling, and provocative in the complex questions it raises about celebrity, power, money, sex, abuse, and how they're all intertwined.

Hume adopts a vérité approach that largely lets Feldman speak for himself — there's no editorializing, and there doesn't really need to be given that Feldman's life and personality are so dramatic that a straightforward presentation of the facts is plenty wild. Whatever your preconceived notions about Feldman are, Hume's film will expand and challenge them; the movie's greatness lies in its ability to capture all of Feldman's contradictions and self-destructiveness, empathizing with him without soft-pedaling his sins.

It's a major piece of work and one of the great celebrity documentaries of recent years. Following the film's independent release online last month (it's currently available for purchase and rental on iTunes), IndieWire spoke with Hume via Zoom about the challenges not only of making the movie but of getting it out into the world — especially given Feldman's animosity toward it in spite of the fact that the film lets him tell the story almost entirely in his own words. 

 










This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

IndieWire: What were the origins of this documentary, and what was your prior relationship to Corey Feldman and his work?

Marcie Hume: I had a deep, visceral fascination and reaction to Corey, seeing him pursuing his music and making these self-produced videos. It was just jaw-dropping and unreal watching him try to establish a different type of career as somebody that many of us had grown up seeing in the limelight in a time when fame was very different. He was a pop icon at 13 when there were just a handful of famous teenagers. 

I made contact with his management and met with him and filmed a sizzle reel for a TV show that didn't sell. It took me quite a while to get from there to the documentary, because that was not as exciting or enticing to Corey and his management as a TV show. But then my film [“Magicians: Life in the Impossible”] came out, and I think they saw that I could make and finish a movie. I was invited to come film Corey's wedding in Las Vegas, so I packed up my gear and drove there, and that was the first thing I filmed for the documentary. I just kept filming from there and kept getting invited to his house and gigs and everything else you could imagine.

What were the initial conversations like with Corey about the parameters of the documentary as it started to become a real thing?
 










It was a very long process. He's learned not to trust people, so I just tried to be very friendly and open with him. He did try to establish control over everything, but that was really difficult when you're on the road in an RV or a bus with all of these people wanting to live their own lives. It was an incredibly frenetic environment. As we developed more of a rapport, he didn't really tell me what to do. But what's so fascinating, and what I've had to think so much more about, is what it is to have no control over telling your own story. Because seeing his reaction to the movie, over which he has zero control, it's quite extreme. And it has forced me to think about the idea of having no control over your own story and how scary that must be.

Yet in a sense you are letting him tell his own story, as much as possible. There's not a lot of manipulation.

We did let him tell his own story, and so much of the movie is from his own point of view. It was crucial to show his perspective and how it's the foundation of the world that he created and why these women are with him on tour and why things fall apart. I think to make a simple takedown or a simple vindication of him would have been the wrong thing to do, because the movie is about the ecosystem that produces someone like Corey, about the industry that made him and used him, and the fans that mock him. But also, you see firsthand the ideas that he expresses himself, and you as an audience have to grapple with what is going on inside this man's mind. It's down to the audience to decide. I cannot make a judgment about what is happening psychologically with him.

 










Corey isn't only a victim and he isn't only a villain, and you have to sit with the fact that he can be harmed and also harm others. And he can be sincerely trying to tell the truth and also distorting the truth. And we all have those contradictions — maybe not to the same degree, but we all want to behave a certain way and we all fail to behave the way that we want to all the time. That might be one of the biggest themes of the movie: how much nuance and depth and contradiction can you accommodate in your view of the world? There's no easy answer to any of it.

Tell me a little about the actual logistics of shooting Corey and the angels on tour. Are you riding the bus with them? Do you have any kind of crew, or is it just you and your camera?

I would come in for about a week at a time and stay on the RV, or the bus — there were a couple of different tours. I had my own bunk where I slept with my Canon 5D and my mic attached because I wanted to be ready at any moment to just take off the lens cap and start rolling. I have a filmmaking partner named Star Rosencrans who filmed when I was in New York or otherwise unavailable, and Bryan Donnell filmed one or two days with me. But other than that, it was just me and my 5D shooting Corey for about a year, which was the only way it could have happened. There wasn't room for anyone else either physically or personality-wise.

 










It's been several years since you shot with Corey, so how long did it take you to go through the footage you had and find a shape for it?

The footage sat there for a few years while I was looking for help and support. Eventually I found [editor and producer] Adam Franklin, who was already a Corey enthusiast. During the pandemic he had the time to sit and watch down all of the footage — and there was a lot of footage because I rolled as much as I could. We started talking about a structure and really staying squarely in Corey's point of view, until the aperture started to open to the perspectives of other people on tour. And honestly, that aperture continues to open for me now as I meet and talk with the women. 

Adam was almost supernatural in his ability to craft the story and let the humor come out without ever being mean or unfair. We had a lot of screenings where we tried to find the balance between the fun and joy and humor of the movie and the dark subject matter that made its way in.

When did your relationship with Corey start to fall apart?

In 2017 he decided he was going to make his own documentary, and that's when he started to decide that he had no use for me. He asked me if he could have my footage, and I said, “I'm sorry, Corey, but I've spent so much time and almost all my money on this movie. I didn't take other work to do this. I can't just give you my footage.” I felt genuinely bad about it, because I have extraordinary empathy for him. When you're a documentarian, your empathy finds corners that it wouldn't in an average everyday relationship with someone. But I knew I could not give him my footage, and that was the last time I heard from him or spoke with him. He told Phil, his music manager, that he did not want to be involved in the movie. But I had invested so much time and money and effort and I knew it could be a great movie, so I had to finish it. It was extraordinarily hard to find the resources to actually finish it, but obviously we eventually did.

 










When it was finally done I called Corey, and I could tell he was really freaked out that the movie was done. I thought there was a very good chance that he would like most of it because it is very much his point of view and who he is. I said to him, “Look, I have to cover the point of view of other people. The women are in this. I know this is going be difficult, but I'm really excited to show you this. There's so much in it of your struggles and your perspective.”

He came over to watch the movie, and we did not get a chance to talk about it. He left before we had a chance to talk, and then the day before the premiere, we received a cease and desist.

But the movie is out there, so has he actually been able to do anything to hurt it?

It was up on Amazon and now it's not. Apparently Amazon errs on the side of extreme caution, so they have not put it back up even though there's no danger, which is a real shame. We're working on that and I would like it to be back up there. But otherwise I guess all has been fine. His claims are completely outrageous and baseless, but it's very much his way of dealing with the world. You see it in the movie, how he copes with things he doesn't like.

My mind was so blown by the documentary that I'm honestly a little surprised people aren't talking about it more, and it's why I wanted to talk with you — I really think it deserves to find a huge audience, and that people will love it if they find it.
 










I think we need to treat this moment we're in in the industry as an opportunity to do things differently. I could never get attention on this film in the right way, and it blew my mind because to me I had a subject that was just so inherently intriguing and entertaining. I think some people really just don't like Corey and find him hard to watch, and some I just couldn't get to engage with the movie. All I knew was that I was going to get the movie out, no matter what. But it would be impossible to count the hurdles along the way. I truly wouldn't know where to begin. This film almost killed me, and it's still killing me because I'm trying to get people to pay attention, and it's very difficult. 

I think in this moment we're only going to be getting more “no's” from the industry at large, so we need to find ways as filmmakers to make sure that we're going to get our movies out anyway. I don't mean to be Pollyanna about it. It's going to get harder, but there are only so many people who know how to really make a movie and get it done. So if you're one of those people, it's your time to shine. Really figure it out and keep that light alive.

While the general way Nihon Falcom's Trails games work has been pretty set in stone for a while—take jobs to help people out, learn about the world and those people and the problems of both while you do it, see the overall narrative progress as villains swoop in to do their thing—the longtime RPG developer still likes to play with structure. 

Last year's The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II instituted a rewind feature for Van Arkride and his Arkride Solutions crew that had you replaying sections of the game in order to avoid failure, injury, or even character death that had been baked into the narrative. Trails Into Reverie split the game up not just into acts with an intermission, as is the usual setup, but also broke you into separate paths with different parties, all converging on the same spot eventually and occasionally interacting with each other, sometimes without even knowing this was happening. And then there was Trails In The Sky The 3rd, a game that did away with the openness and the jobs of the first two games in the series in favor of a highly experimental setup based on memories and the experiences of the characters in your party, as everyone trapped in an alternate dimension was forced to look inward to fight the figurative and literal demons that manifested from it.

The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon is effectively Daybreak III despite the naming convention, as it's the third game in the Calvardian portion of the saga—the latest country in the continent of Zemuria for Falcom to zoom in on. It plays nearly exactly like its predecessors, only now Falcom has added even more bells and whistles to the action-oriented “Field” combat that lets you, without pause, fight enemies in an action RPG style instead of in a turn-based format, if you so choose: you can now briefly slow down time to deliver a series of big hits in a row to stronger foes and larger groups of enemies so that these action-oriented battles go by more quickly, and there's also a charge meter that lets you deliver devastating, powerful blows to rip through even the game's “A-level” monster threats. In the “Command” battles—the turn-based ones—you can now use some of your built-up ability meter to set yourself up for back-to-back turns by a single character, and there are additional support opportunities from allies who aren't in your party to extend combos and dish out more damage per turn. Otherwise? It's more Daybreak, which is also the setup that the recent remake of Trails In The Sky FC is based on. If those games felt good in your hands, then this one will, too.

Trails Beyond The Horizon, of course, would share DNA with the preceding Daybreak games, in cast and in location and in general gameplay, but Trails Into Reverie and Trails In The Sky The 3rd get more than just a little shine and callbacks here, as well, in terms of structure and themes. Trails Beyond The Horizon borrows the multi-party, multi-path structure of Reverie, and brings back Sky The 3rd's protagonist, the “Heretic Hunter” Kevin Graham, as well as his struggles with being a cleaner for the exceptionally powerful and seemingly all-knowing Septian Church. Trails Beyond The Horizon also gleefully borrows the penchant of both games to turn previous villains into uneasy, unlikely allies in the present in a way that lets you get a better sense of who they are and how they can be different—a perfect fit for the Trails subseries that focuses on those characters who straddle the line between lawful and chaotic, who live in the gray by choice or because society has forced that upon them.



What results is a game that is not just about building relationships in the way previous Trails games—especially the Daybreaks—have been, even and especially when the pairings seemed unlikely, but is also about testing those relationships when it turns out that the goals of the characters might not align. There's a tension in the game nearly from the start when it becomes clear that everyone has their own agendas that they are unwilling to share for one reason or another—because a character or group likes to hold their cards close to the chest in general, because they are from another country and are wary of spilling secrets to a now-ally but former foe, or because a certain protagonist is hiding things from everyone, even their closest confidants and established allies. There's an unease to it for you, the player, since you're aware of the personalities and motivations of all these characters, who you've grown accustomed to liking and appreciating, and who now might very well be in conflict with each other. 

It's all told in an exceptional fashion that will have you guessing even when you think you know what's going on or why any decision is made by the characters in question. Trails Beyond The Horizon is a 70-hour game that feels much, much denser than that, one that keeps piling new twists and realizations on top without those moments ever feeling forced, because they have been earned over the course of not just this subseries' three games, but over the 13 that make up Trails as a whole.

Trails Through Daybreak II concerned itself with the personal more than with an arc that pushed the overall narrative of the series; it excelled at both the big and small pictures, but showed  a clear preference for the latter in terms of what it mostly zeroed in on. That decision made plenty of sense in the moment, given how many loose ends there are to tie up for a series that is heading toward its overall conclusion—yes, a video game series telling a complete, start-to-finish story is allowed if publishers will only let it happen—but it is even more justified after seeing how Trails Beyond The Horizon plays out. Trails Through Daybreak II is its own worthwhile story and entry in the series, but it's also 60 hours of staging for what's to come, a slowed-down look at the game world and its characters to prepare you for the breakneck pace of Trails Beyond The Horizon, which is Vladimir Lenin's quote about weeks where decades happen given video game form: the entire game takes place over a matter of days, with a clear deadline for its story to wrap up, and it is incredible how much happens in that span and how different the world is when it wraps.

Every little thing that has popped up in the Daybreak games to this point, whether new or building on previous Trails' subseries, matters in Trails Beyond The Horizon. Every relationship, everything you know about Calvard and its status with its neighbors, what you know of the Septian Church and its seeming polar-opposite enemies of Ouroboros' “Society,” the things that have been hinted at about the oddness of the continent of Zemuria and how it's seemingly detached from the rest of the world in some way, of the speed at which technology is discovered and harnessed and discarded for something new, the cost of progress and the dangers inherent within it, what the characters who clearly know something beyond what has been revealed to the rest of the cast or even you yourself know about the world… it all comes to a head here. Falcom is so on top of it that they even manage to make the protagonist of the Cold Steel games, Rean Schwarzer, not an annoying distraction here, and instead a fit for what he's used for that doesn't detract from the experience. A miracle, really.

﻿

And it all results in the most dramatic cliffhanger the series has ever produced. If the cliffhanger in between the first two games in the series was an intensely personal one that mixed in larger-scale intrigue, this is the opposite: the scale of what's happening is enormous and concerning in a way that's never happened in the series before, which is saying something given how seemingly apocalyptic it's been in the past. But it also doesn't just tug at your heartstrings; it rips them right out of your chest not just with what actually happens in front of your eyes, but the implications of it, as well. It's masterfully done, and of course happened when Trails finally caught up to the Japanese release schedule in the west: for the first time, we don't know when the next brand-new Trails is coming.

As you can imagine given all of this detail above, Trails Beyond The Horizon is arguably the least-newbie-friendly game that Falcom has ever produced, but that's not a negative nor a reason to ding it. Start at the beginning. Earn your way to this game's payoffs, which tie together even moments you might have once thought wouldn't matter beyond the one in which they were experienced, or ones you had even forgotten about entirely. Falcom didn't just bring Kevin Graham back because it had been awhile—it is bad news when he shows up, because his job is to dirty his hands in the tasks no one else is equipped to handle, either mentally or physically. His being partnered with the Picnicking Front here—a group that, despite its intentionally goofy, lunch-loving namesake, is full of former child assassins, a major (former) series antagonist, and a constructed consciousness so powerful it's been used for evil in the past—is no mistake. Graham is a conflicted misfit with dangerous abilities unsure of his own place in the world as well as his worth, with a weariness and desire for things to be different and an inability to know how to make them so. You can get a sense of that from how everyone discusses him within the context contained solely in Trails Beyond The Horizon, sure, but it all works so much better if you have lived through the very struggles that still haunt him, as you do in Trails In The Sky The 3rd. The same goes for understanding what the Picnicking Front's whole deal is, which you need the Trails Of Cold Steel games, Trails Into Reverie, and Trails Through Daybreak II for in order to paint a complete picture of what is a whole bunch of tragic backstories and presents aiming to make the characters more than “just” that. This is less than one-third of the game's playable cast, by the way, never mind the many, many key non-playable characters whose scent Van and the rest of the Daybreak crew spend the game chasing as “Spriggans,” the subseries' regional answer to the Bracers Guild of the Sky games.

Trails is the most ambitious epic in games, and that's only becoming truer with each new entry that builds on the previous ones. Every new Trails game starts a round of “is this a good one to start with?”, and the answer is “no” every time, unless you're referring to the recent remake of the original, Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter. Which, if you want to experience Trails Beyond The Horizon in full, go start with that. Then play Trails In The Sky 2nd Chapter when that remake lands, then Trails In The Sky The 3rd on a Windows-compatible machine, then… you get the idea. It's been said before, but you don't start a lengthy book series in the middle; why would you do that with Trails, unless FOMO is your primary driving force? Respect yourself and Trails more than that, and do what's right for the both of you. Only then will you get the full experience that you deserve.

Jameela Jamil defended her feminist views after calling Blake Lively a “suicide bomber” and “villain” in a series of texts.

The “Good Place” alum, 39, took to Instagram Stories on Thursday to address her texts with Justin Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, which were uncovered in recently unsealed court documents.

“Guys, feminism means fighting for the political, social and economic equity for women. Just gender equity,” Jamil said in a video, per The Hollywood Reporter. 

“It does not mean you have to like every single woman. It doesn't mean you have to be friends with every single woman. It means you can actually beef with other women. You can criticize them. You can do whatever you want, as long as you are also fighting for their human right to the same things that men have in this world.”

The self-proclaimed feminist and activist continued, “That's all feminism is. It's a moral and political stance. It is not a sleepover where we braid each other's pubes, OK? So if you are fighting for women's rights, but you don't get along with every single woman, it doesn't make you a bad feminist.”

Although she did not name-drop Lively in her Story, her comments came shortly after the DailyMail exposed her texts with Abel.

In the August 2024 exchange, Jameel and the PR strategist were reacting to a TikTok video about Lively's allegedly “tone-deaf” promotion of the film. 

At the time, the “Gossip Girl” alum had been accused of promoting her haircare line and talking about her fashion instead of the film's serious theme of domestic violence.

“I want to officially incorporate nightmare c–t and demon c–t into my vocabulary; UNBELIEVABLE; She's doing this to herself,” Abel texted Jamil, who is also her client, about Lively.

Jamil curtly replied, “She's a suicide bomber at this point.”

Later in their conversation, Abel expressed that she hated Lively “so much,” to which Jamil agreed.

“I've never seen such a bizarre villain act before,” the “She-Hulk” actress texted. “She's Over over.”

A source close to the matter exclusively told Page Six Thursday that Jamil's comments were “disappointing.”

“It's disappointing that instead of listening to women when they speak out, other women call them names,” the insider said.

Rumors of Lively and Baldoni's feud sparked in August 2024 after their movie, “It Ends With Us,” premiered in New York City.

By December, Lively filed an official complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of sexually harassing her on set, before officially suing him. The 41-year-old has repeatedly denied the claims.

The “Jane the Virgin” star reacted with a $400 million countersuit, accusing Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, of defamation. 

He also sued the New York Times for libel after the outlet reported on Lively's lawsuit.

This past summer, a judge dismissed both of Baldoni's countersuits; however, Lively's legal battle against the actor is still ongoing.

	With Oscar nominations and a couple of Golden Globe awards, the KPop Demon Hunters phenomenon is now well and truly established. But even so, the ratings Demon Hunters has put up for Netflix continue to stun.


As Deadline's Katie Campione noted, the animated movie became Netflix's most-watched title ever over a six-month period, according to the streamer's latest What We Watched report.


KPop Demon Hunters amassed 482M views between July and the end of December, but this does not include the 36.7M streams it recorded in the 10 days after its release on June 20, 2025.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In total, the Sony Pictures Animation title has 518.2M views on Netflix. That's right, more than half-a-billion views in around six months.

	











	To put this into some context, it's worth looking at how KPop Demon Hunters has performed since Netflix first started publishing views in What We Watched reports from July 2023.


	Over that two-and-a-half year period, Demon Hunters has more than double the number of streams of any other title on Netflix. 


The Super Mario Bros. Movie was the second biggest film during that time with 241M views. The biggest TV show was Squid Game Season 2 with 220.9M streams.


	Below is the chart showing how KPop Demon Hunters is on a summit all of its own.

EXCLUSIVE: Netflix‘s Korean content craze has helped the streamer to more than four billion views, with demand going far deeper than Squid Game.


	A Deadline analysis can reveal that Korean-language titles across film and TV have amassed at least 4.5BN streams since Netflix first started publishing views in What We Watched reports from July 2023.


	Unsurprisingly, Squid Game has led the charge, with two new seasons dropping over the past two-and-a-half years, cementing its status as a true phenomenon on Netflix. Other notable titles include disaster movie The Great Flood, which has become a breakout hit since debuting last month.

	Season 2 of the Squid Game franchise has recorded 220.9M streams since its premiere in December 2024, making it the most-watched TV show on Netflix during that time.




			Watch on Deadline		







Squid Game Season 3 has delivered 150M views since June last year, making it the third highest-rated show on Netflix. Even Season 1, which premiered in 2021, has 97M views in the past couple of years.


	Put together, all three seasons account for nearly half-a-billion views, but other titles have also struck a chord with Netflix's 300M-plus subscribers, even if they had not had the same attention.


King the Land, a romantic drama series about the heir of a luxury hotel group thrown into an inheritance war, was the next biggest Korean series on Netflix after Squid Game.


	Featuring K-pop stars Lee Jun-ho and Lim Yoon, the 2023 series originally screened on Korean network JTBC, but has since checked in 64.7M views for Netflix.

	











	This put it in the top 100 series on Netflix over the past two-and-a-half years, placing it ahead of splashy English-language originals like the final season of The Crown and Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.


	Other hit Korean series include True Beauty (47M streams), My Demon (45.8M), and Queen of Tears (44.6M), all of which featured in Netflix's top 150 shows. Below is the top 10 Korean series.


Netflix committed to investing $2.5BN in Korean originals in 2023 — and the strategy is delivering results. When Life Gives You Tangerines and The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call, which both premiered in the first quarter of 2025, were among the top 10. The Trauma Code has reportedly been renewed for two more seasons. 


	One original series that is confirmed to return is All of Us Are Dead, which has registered 31.5M views since July 2023, an impressive return given it originally premiered in January 2022.


	Over in movies, the top Korean title was 2024's Badland Hunters, an original Netflix production about a group of Seoul earthquake survivors in an orderless wasteland. Badland Hunters has recorded 73.9M views since its debut, putting it 108th Netflix's top films since mid-2023, when it began publishing What We Watched reports in their current form.


	The next biggest Korean film was The Great Flood, another Netflix original, which has made waves with 66.1M views after only being released on December 19. Set on the last day of Earth, it tells the story of a desperate fight to save a child from an apartment after a great flood has swept the planet. Below is the top 10 Korean films.


	Netflix is planning to launch well over 30 Korean originals in 2026, with K-content chief Don Kang saying that more than 210 Korean titles have been ranked in the global top ten over the past five years.

One kid and counting.

Michelle Duggar and Jim Bob Duggar's eldest daughter, Jana Duggar, became a mom last month.

“We took some time to settle into our new rhythm before sharing this sweet news 🤍,” the new mom gushed via Instagram on Friday. “Our hearts have been completely changed. We're soaking in these early days, full of love, wonder and so much gratitude.”

The former reality star debuted her baby bump over the summer, telling her Instagram followers how “excited” she felt.

“January 2026 is going to come with a little bundle of joy joining our family,” Jana captioned her August pregnancy reveal via Instagram.

“We're counting down the days and eagerly looking forward to this thrilling new chapter in our lives!” she concluded.

Jana's sisters gushed over her announcement in the comments section at the time.

“Can't wait to meet this baby!!🥰” Jessa Duggar wrote, while Jill Duggar added that she was “so thrilled” for the couple.

Jana marked the mid-point the following month, writing, “Halfway through pregnancy and I'm still in awe! It sure has flown by! I love feeling those tiny kicks these days!”

The former reality star and sister-in-law Abbie Duggar teamed up to share the sexes of their babies in November, with the former expecting a baby boy.

“Loved getting to share this special moment,” Jana wrote of Abbie, who has a daughter on the way with husband John-David Duggar.

The duo walked down the aisle two months after the private pilot got down on one knee.

He and Jana briefly dated between 2020 and 2022, with the pair getting back together in early 2024.

Styles appeared on BBC Radio 1's Breakfast show to discuss his comeback song "Aperture" and hitting the road.

Harry Styles is officially back. On Thursday (Jan. 23) the British pop star announced his Together, Together global residency tour, and shared new single “Aperture,” the first to be taken from his upcoming album Kiss All The Time. Disco, Occasionally.

	On Friday morning, Jan. 23, he followed the reveal with his first interview of the new era on BBC Radio 1's breakfast show with Greg James. During the 10-minute conversation, Styles discussed the inspiration behind the new song, the album's playful title and how ended up amongst the crowds in Rome to see the reveal of Pope Leo XIV back in May.

	Speaking to James, Styles said that “Aperture,” a five-minute electronic-inspired banger, was influenced by his time away from performing. He said the song, produced with longtime collaborator Kid Harpoon, was the last track completed for the LP, due for release on March 6. 


	“It was amazing for me. We had most of the album done and a lot of it was exploring the themes that the song is exploring. Getting this song at the end of the process when we were feeling the freest and having a lot of fun… and it felt like the mission statement of what the album was about.”

	











	“I'd had a couple years away from work stuff and a lot of big realizations about generally opening up more to the world and allowing some more positive things to come into my life. It was the culmination of all that was happening around me making this record. [“Aperture”] was like a perfect little bow, and once this song happened it was like ‘oh, the record's finished.'”


	He added that the song was influenced by “classic pop songwriting” but picked out LCD Soundsystem and English post-punk band The Durutti Column as additional inspirations for the sonic departure.


	“I saw [LCD Soundsystem] at a festival in Madrid, then saw them again at Brixton [Academy, London]. It was so joyous watching them be immersed in it. The inspiration from watching [LCD Soundsystem] and realizing ‘that's how I want to feel when I'm on stage,' and it matched the music I was making.”


	Styles last performed live in 2023 in Bologna, Italy after 169 dates on the Love On Tour run. Returning to being an audience member and “getting out into the world” is what inspired him during the recording process.


	“The most important thing was about getting on the other side of the audience experience. Having so many years being on stage, the last couple years allowed me to be a real audience member and be in the crowd and have a reminder of ‘oh this is why this is special to people and this is why this feels so good.'”


	When asked by James if going incognito at concerts was easy, Styles replied: “Yeah, when it's dark enough and music is loud enough it's quite easy actually.”

	











	James then questioned Styles on the LP's title – Kiss All The Time. Disco, Occasionally – and the semantic implications. “You could say it's like ‘drink water all the time. But you're gonna have to pee occasionally,” Styles said. “You can have a break from kissing, but you could also drink water while you're peeing. It's kind of optional. The idea is that you can take a break from kissing to disco.”


	Since the conclusion of his tour in 2023, Styles has been spotted by fans on a number of “side quests,” such as attending Glastonbury Festival, attempting to help a fan parallel park their Fiat 500, (“The space was too small. It wasn't going in there”) and popping up in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican City when Pope Leo XIV – the first pope to be born in North America – was revealed to the world in May 2025.


	“I was getting a haircut in Rome and then I heard all these people start shouting ‘Habemus Papam!' [‘We have a pope'] and people running down the street. The guy who was cutting my hair was like ‘Habemus Papam!,' but then he finished up and then I was like ‘oh I'm like 5 minutes walk from there' so I just walked over there. It was wild.'


	Styles' Together, Together tour kicks off on May 17 at Amsterdam's Johan Cruyff Arena, before heading to London's Wembley Stadium for six nights. Further stops will take him to São Paulo and Mexico City before a 30-night stint at NYC's Madison Square Garden. The tour concludes with shows in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia on Dec. 13.

Paris Hilton discussed the 2004 release of a sex tape that featured her during an appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Hilton, accompanied by Democratic New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Florida representative Laurel Lee, the reality star gave an impassioned speech about the importance of protecting women from similar incidents. 


	“When I was 19 years old, a private, intimate video of me was shared with the world without my consent,” Hilton said. “People called it a scandal. It wasn't. It was abuse.”


	Hilton made the appearance in support of the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act, or DEFIANCE Act. The bipartisan legislation would allow victims of AI-generated, sexually explicit content to take legal action against people who create it, distribute it, and solicit it with the intent to distribute. The bill has already pass in the Senate. 


	“There were no laws at the time to protect me,” Hilton explained. “There weren't even words for what had been done to me. The Internet was still new, and so was the cruelty that came with it.”

	She continued, “They called me names. They laughed and made me the punchline. They sold my pain for clicks, and then they told me to be quiet, to move on, to even be grateful for the attention. These people didn't see me as a young woman who had been exploited. They didn't see the panic that I felt, the humiliation, or the shame. No one asked me what I lost.”


	Hilton explained that she had the platform to reclaim her story, but “so many others don't.” “And what I've learned is that when your image is violated, it doesn't disappear; it lives inside you, but so does your power,” she said. “Telling the truth has helped me heal, and I am so proud that today I stand here without shame.” 

	











	She concluded, “I will keep telling the truth to protect every woman, every girl, every survivor, now and for the future.”

When I was 19, a private video of me was shared without my consent — and there were no laws to protect me. What people called a “scandal” was actually abuse, and it's something survivors are still facing today. That's why today, I spoke on Capitol Hill with @Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and #LaurelLee about the DEFIANCE Act 🏛️🩷 This bipartisan bill strengthens legal protections for survivors of AI-generated explicit deepfakes giving people real options to fight back and seek justice when intimate images are shared without consent. Proud to use my voice on this issue and stand up for women and girls everywhere 💗 #DEFIANCEAct


	The sex tape was filmed by Hilton's then-boyfriend Rick Salomon. She recounted the experience in her 2024 book, Paris: The Memoir, writing that she felt pressured to allow her much older boyfriend to record her. The footage was released in 2004. After Hilton said publicly that she did not approve of its release, Salomon sued Hilton for defamation. She counter-sued and was awarded damages, which she donated to charity.

	In 2021, Hilton described the sex tape to Vanity Fair as “something that will hurt me for the rest of my life.” “It was a private experience between two people,” Hilton said. “You love someone, you trust someone and to have your trust betrayed like that and for the whole world to be watching and laughing… It was even more hurtful to me to have these people think that I did this on purpose — that killed me. It still gives me post-traumatic stress disorder to talk about it.”


	Hilton will release a new documentary, Infinite Icon: A Visual Memoir, on Jan. 30. The film will center around the creation of Hilton's 2024 album of the same name, and explore how music often served as a balm during the most difficult moments of her life and career. In the film, Hilton will confront the often deeply misogynistic ways she was portrayed in the media, and discuss her experiences at troubled teen schools, where she claimed she was abused.

Louis Tomlinson appeared on The Tonight Show to perform his recent single, “Imposter,” and to chat with host Jimmy Fallon about his new album, How Did I Get Here?, which is out today. 


	The former One Direction member took the stage alongside his band to showcase the pop song, released earlier this week. Tomlinson built the mood with flashing colorful lights and artfully-arranged piles of cords. 


	The track was written by Tomlinson with Nico Rebscher and Dave Gibson. “Imposter was written in the jungle in Costa Rica,” the singer explained of the song in a statement. “Conceptually it leans into the idea of identity. It's probably the most melodic moment on the record, I'm really excited for the world to finally hear it!”


	Tomlison and Fallon discussed the creation of How Did I Get Here? and the sense of “relief” the singer feels having now released it. “I've been sitting on it for a while now,” he said. “There's a lot of anticipation, a lot of tension, but a lot of excitement too.”

	











	The singer reflected on whether being part of One Direction prepared him to be a solo artist. “Every moment, every memory I have of One Direction is incredibly special, obviously,” he said. “But that experience, it was relevant, but somewhat. Being in a band and doing things collectively and sharing the pressure it's a very different version of the same thing.”


	He added, “This is the record where I feel really comfortable with it. And I felt really comfortable making it. I really enjoyed the process. I'm even enjoying the promo, which is a new thing for me.”

	











	Tomlinson has been dropping Easter eggs for the album for a while. He told Fallon he tries to “imagine what it's like to be a fan” so he likes to create “as much excitement around it” as possible. He noted that the Easter eggs did confuse Taylor Swift‘s fans. 


	“I think they were thinking it was somehow related to her album,” he said. “So I got free promo for a couple days.”

How Did I Get Here? is Tomlinson's third solo album. The singer will embark on an extensive world tour in support of the LP, which will visit Europe and North America. The North American tour dates kick off on June 3 in Vancouver and continue through July 24, when the trek wraps in Miami.


	“I sum up it as ‘The record I always deserved to make,” Tomlinson said in a statement. “My bread and butter is my honesty. I genuinely wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope it comes through in the music.”

Abby Ryder Fortson and Sam Waterston also star in Rachel Lambert's story of a divorced doctor struggling to reconnect with or pull away from a former girlfriend.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	Whether playing sexy comedy or hostility, raw emotional agita or hollowness, Chris Pine and Jenny Slate are so damn fine in Carousel that you keep wondering why we seldom get to see these gifted actors bite into characters of such substance and complexity. Rachel Lambert's latest is a strange and beguilingly lovely relationship drama. Eventually. But first, the writer-director needs to get out of her own way, peeling away the fussiness and frustration of her oblique approach and finally cutting back on her overbearing use of a cascading score to give us unfettered access to characters about whom it's clear she cares deeply.

	Not to pile onto composer Dabney Morris, who presumably is doing what was asked of him, but the wall-to-wall music of the opening scenes is almost a deal-breaker. Even before the title card appears, we get that the plinky-plonky melodies are meant to suggest the merry-go-round of life, with the rise and fall of the horses mirroring the ups and downs of our relationships. It's a trite metaphor, and a movie as smart and subtle as this one deserves better.

The Bottom Line

	
	Takes its time but sneaks up on you.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (U.S. Dramatic Competition)Cast: Chris Pine, Jenny Slate, Abby Ryder Fortson, Sam Waterston, Katey Sagal, Heléne York, Dagmara Domincyzk, Jessica Harper, Jeffrey DeMunn, Tien TranDirector-screenwriter: Rachel Lambert

								1 hour 45 minutes			






	There are moments early on that draw us in, notably between Noah (Pine), a Cleveland doctor with a small family medical practice, and his teenage daughter Maya (Abby Ryder Fortson), when he drops her at school and she has a full-blown panic attack after realizing she left some important papers at home.

	











	Lambert clues us in quickly that Maya is suffering from anxiety and depression, and the way Noah tiptoes around her — showing support and concern but holding back as if by not making a big deal of it, the problem will go away — is quietly affecting.


	But it's not until midway, in a devastating extended duologue between Noah and Maya's high school teacher and debate coach Rebecca (Slate), that the movie's defining elegance and restraint fully take hold and the actors are given space to deepen their characters. Like something out of Scenes From a Marriage (the HBO remake, not the original Bergman miniseries), the sequence unfolds in a kitchen but is shot mostly from the next room. It's carefully blocked but lived in and spontaneous as Noah and Rebecca cycle through anger, regret, self-justification and defeat, setting the drama on a decisive new trajectory from which it never looks back.


	The pair were a couple back in school, their relationship ending in bitterness and resentment when Rebecca left Cleveland to pursue a career in the political sphere and Noah chose to stay put and start a family. When they initially reconnect through Maya at a farmers market, it seems as if they barely knew each other — beyond being cast in the same production of Fiddler on the Roof. But the first time they are alone together it's evident that the sexual sparks are still very much there, along with the underlying emotions.


	Noah is bruised by his recent divorce from Maya's mother (Dagmara Domincyzk), saddened by the decision to retire of his mentor at the financially precarious clinic (Sam Waterston), and we later learn, grieving from the unexplained but seemingly tragic loss of his father. But he's so inured to shoving aside his troubles so he can keep a vigilant eye on Maya that a complicated romantic relationship with Rebecca feels like more than he can handle.

	











	The minute Maya is out of the picture for a summer studies program at Stanford, Noah falls apart, literally unable to pick himself up and even get out of the airport for what seems like days.


	Rebecca has her own problems and uncertainties — her parents (Jessica Harper and Jeffrey DeMunn) are aging; her friend Sophie (Tien Tran) tells her she has worked too hard to make inroads into D.C. politics to be teaching high school; her history with Noah is far from perfect.


	The love between the central couple is never in doubt, but hesitancy is a big part of this romantic drama. Lambert is clear-eyed and perceptive about the emotional safeguards people put up to protect themselves from the messiness of relationships. But the film also advocates for taking risks, for leaving doors open and giving love a shot. The long final scene, melancholy but beautiful, again framed from a detached distance, this time in half-light, encapsulates that sense of hope with pleasing delicacy.


	DP Dustin Lane shot Carousel on 35mm in what looks like the boxy Academy ratio, suffused in soft light. The visuals heighten the drama's intimacy. Lambert shows an attention to the details of daily life that shape the ways people connect and communicate. Returning to solitude as a central theme after Sometimes I Think About Death, the director has made a flawed movie that requires patience, but it delivers in the end, thanks in large part to the sensitive work of three excellent leads.


	Not since Hell or High Water has Pine conveyed such depth of feeling, such corrosive sorrow. Slate's Rebecca at first glance has a brittle aspect but slowly reveals a yearning that makes her question her choices. And Fortson, who was such a radiant discovery in Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret, is maturing into a first-rate actor, alternatively heartbreaking and resilient.

When most people think about concrete, they think about the obvious stuff: The color gray. New York City. Why it's generally a bad idea to jump off tall buildings. When John Wilson thinks about concrete, the erstwhile star of HBO's “How to With John Wilson” thinks about DMX, Hallmark movies, Kim Kardashian, public diarrhea, a trailblazing Asian American judge, the world's first 3D-printed Starbucks, and a 3,100-mile footrace that honors a dead Brooklyn cult leader. 

What do those things have in common? Possibly everything! Maybe a little bit less than that. But definitely, definitely at least this: They're all things that John Wilson thinks about when he thinks about concrete. And that turns out to be all the connective tissue we need to appreciate the relationship between them.

Related Stories Corey Feldman's Documentarian Marcie Hume on Why the '80s Teen Icon Is More Than Just a ‘Victim' or ‘Villain' ‘Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!' Review: An Exuberant and Whimsical New Spin on the Grief Drama 

A sweetly Dantean scavenger who collages this broken existence back together from an endlessly amusing library of first-person video snippets and unpredictable detours (his clips layered with a quizzical voiceover that warps their images into cheeky visual puns, and evokes the affect of an alien kindergartner sending travelogues about life on Earth to its friends back home), Wilson makes sense of the world by sanding the edges off its infinite strangeness. His work suggests a sleeping brain that's straining to organize chaos into order, and his ability to manufacture semi-logical associations between literally anything — often by forging a path that leads from A to B to Q to ancient hieroglyphics to an Avatar fan support group before eventually finding its way back to where it began — has allowed him to impose some credible degree of meaning onto a human condition that offers all too little of its own. 

 










Much like the episodes of his show (very much like, to the point of being indistinguishable, aside from its length), Wilson's consistently hilarious and sneakily profound “The History of Concrete” is sustained by an internal tension between order and entropy. Between meaning and mayhem. This meandering but laser-focused essay film is, like the best episodes of Wilson's show, sustained by parallel dramatic questions that inevitably answer each other by the end. (The series finale of “How To” is especially relevant, as its search for lasting purpose amid the transience of all things perfectly tees up this debut feature). 

The first is as simple as it gets: What is Wilson going to do with himself now that his short-lived but deeply beloved premium cable TV series is over? (“The space between projects is hard” he muses at the start of the movie before cutting to an inordinately phallic sign of a hot dog bisecting the two sides of a giant bun). The second is more complicated, even though it's basically the first question in disguise: How is Wilson going to cut all the footage he's been shooting ever since into a coherent rationale that allows him to rescue a convincing sense of peace from his jobless uncertainty? 

Of course, “The History of Concrete” is Wilson's next project, and the process of turning it into an actual job — which is to say, the process of getting it funded — is subsumed into the smorgasbord of material that he presents to us over the course of the movie's 100 minutes. 

 










It would be a waste of time to walk you through how Wilson gets from 49-cent royalty checks and rueing his life as a Ridgewood landlord to the oldest buildings in Rome and a brick-laying contest in Las Vegas, but suffice it to say that concrete — everyone's favorite composite material composed of aggregate bound together with fluid cement — serves as the great connector. Wilson is compelled to the substance because he recognizes how well it straddles the divide between false permanence and ephemerality. People make skyscrapers and highways out of it. They scratch their names into the mixture before it dries as a bid for immortality. They use it to build the burial vaults that sustain them into the sweet hereafter. It is nothing less than the backbone of modern infrastructure.

And yet, concrete only lasts for about 40 years before it starts to crumble. I've already held out for longer than that, and my body is made out of mushy stucco and wiry gray hair. Even the most solid things on Earth aren't meant to last forever. Towers crumble. Highways collapse. TV shows come to an end. And that's OK! Well, that last thing is. 

And Wilson must understand that at heart, as he ended “How To” on his own accord. But as anyone knows who's ever lost — or even voluntarily relinquished — a foundational piece of themselves, to understand loss is not the same as to accept it. And “The History of Concrete” is nothing if not a sprawlingly beautiful self-portrait of a man trying to strike a balance between letting go and holding on. A man trying to make space for grief at the same time as he scrambles for self-preservation. 

 










The existential anxiety of that mission provides “The History of Concrete” an even deeper bedrock of wistfulness than could be found in the flooded basement of Wilson's previous work (among this movie's other miracles: It made me sympathetic towards a New York City landlord). Death, evanescence, and the inevitability of change cast a long and constant shadow over the film, as Wilson's attention flits from the Sri Chinmoy ultramarathon and its promise of self-transcendence to Tibetan sand mandalas and a tattoo artist who preserves the inked flesh of the dead so that the living can frame it on their walls. 

That context is probably enough to appreciate some of the film's most delightful asides, such as a profile of the man behind GumBusters — a business that power blasts old gum off the streets of NYC — and a brief aside into the temporary venues that host Wilson's favorite DIY noise shows. Other detours would be harder to explain and much easier to ruin, but anyone familiar with “How To” will be unsurprised by how Wilson's cock-eyed perspective allows him to be movingly sentimental without ever veering into self-seriousness. 

By the same token, fans of his work will be familiar with how “The History of Concrete” looks askew at its hero characters without ever looking down on them. And no hero character in any of Wilson's previous stuff plays a larger role than part-time rock-and-roller Jack Macco, who Wilson meets when the guy is handing out free tequila samples at a liquor store. While Macco is an undeniable eccentric, and there's something a little sad about the empty bar gigs he plays along the Jersey shore (a sadness made that much stronger by his bandmates' refusal to rehearse), he gradually comes to embody the core truth at the heart of Wilson's work: There's more to everybody than meets the eye. 

 










It isn't long before Macco's set list — a careful negotiation between originals and covers — erupts into an existential dilemma over the push-and-pull between creation and inertia, which in turn leads to a wildly unexpected personal revelation that confronts us with a universe of new possibilities at the same time as it bring the film back to its nucleus of grief. That circularity is a defining staple of how Wilson has always shaped his vision of the world, and, perhaps even more than the filmmaker's signature aesthetic, is the thing about this movie that might engender the feeling that he's simply repeating himself with a longer running time. 

I don't think Wilson would deny that. On the contrary, “The History of Concrete” offers a characteristically roundabout argument for the rewards of sticking to a formula (it involves a trip to the Canadian warehouse where they shoot all of Hallmark's Christmas movies). A formula imposes comfort upon chaos. That comfort can be manufactured, even inauthentic, but everyone needs to make their own sense of this merciless world if they want to enjoy living in it. 

For a certain demographic of wine-drunk women, a degree of peace with their smallness in the universe can be found in the divine predictability of watching someone move back to their adorable hometown for the holidays, save a house from a grinchy banker, and share a kiss with a ChatGPT-created hunk under the mistletoe. John Wilson finds the same from stringing “random” things together until life itself begins to resemble a wildly bizarre — and oddly soothing — evidence board in the case he's building against meaninglessness. 

 










Humanity has long regarded the lack of a grand design as an invitation to create their own, and you don't have to believe in the connections that Wilson makes in “The History of Concrete” to appreciate how the act of making them keeps the world from crumbling around him, and allows him to make his own kind of peace with the fact that it will some day. If maybe not for another 40 years. 

“The History of Concrete” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Co-helmed by Neil Berkeley, the Sundance-premiering film delves into Bamford's mental health and professional journeys.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	It's rare to see a lofty executive as front-and-center in a documentary as Netflix's Ted Sarandos is in Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley‘s Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story. 


	Sarandos takes justifiable pride in Bamford's career, since Netflix helped launch her mainstream visibility with the documentary The Comedians of Comedy and then fronted two seasons of Bamford's surreal and semi-autobiographical Lady Dynamite, which Sarandos boasts he bought from co-creator Mitch Hurwitz based on only a brief hallway pitch. Sarandos even calls Lady Dynamite his favorite Netflix original, a likably quirky choice, though he goes one step too far.

The Bottom Line

	
	Funny, emotional and a bit too conventional.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (Premieres)Directors: Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley

								1 hour 55 minutes			






	“Critics really did love the show, but then they didn't talk about it much in the second season,” Sarandos declares, to which I can only say: I know at least one critic who had the second Lady Dynamite season in his Top 10 list for 2017.


	That's the thing about Maria Bamford. She has built a career on people taking personal ownership over “discovering” her. She's been one of those “your favorite comic's favorite comic” esoteric choices going back nearly 30 years. With every success, pundits have tipped her as being on the verge of breaking out, as if she craved something “bigger,” when the truth is that with her avant-garde eccentricities and increasingly confessional approach to her battles with mental illness, Bamford has never seemed destined for stadium tours. 


	So anyway, Maria Bamford seems to be on the verge of breaking out with Paralyzed by Hope, a 115-minute exploration of Bamford's personal and professional journey from Duluth to Altadena, with myriad roadblocks — depression, OCD, suicidal ideation, family tensions — along the way. 

	











	The documentary has one serious problem that won't bother many viewers and doesn't fully detract from a portrait that blends the candid, silly, uncomfortable, sad and triumphant, just like Bamford herself.


	The most Bamford-ian part of the documentary is actually the beginning, with Apatow and crew arriving at Bamford's house, offering her a banana and a small cash payout — “Maybe we have no ethics here,” Apatow confesses — and sitting down for a casual conversation that Bamford compares to dating. This is before she agrees to do the documentary.


	Bamford, of course, ultimately agrees to participate, and she participates with consummate candor, luring talking heads from her personal life — including her father and sister, who both admit to discomfort when they first saw Bamford's on-stage impressions of them, and her husband, who is central to the documentary's best and most heartwarming chapters. 


	The documentary is well-represented with Bamford's various colleagues, comics like Jackie Kashian, who met her at open mics in Minneapolis in the '90s, and Patton Oswalt, Bamford's Comedians of Comedy touring partner, who says without hesitation that when he first saw Bamford onstage he didn't get her. 


	Oswalt is far from the only person who required some exposure to understand Bamford, whose material has evolved to include Andy Kaufman-esque anti-comedy absurdity and those impressions, which have always been astonishing. Sarah Silverman, who seems to appear in every Apatow documentary, Stephen Colbert, who calls Bamford his favorite comedian, and Ron Funches, another of those comics who is always presented as being on the verge of breaking out, are among the many peers who show up to confirm Bamford's greatness. 

	











	The documentary's biggest challenge or obstacle in telling Bamford's story is something of a luxury problem: Maria Bamford has long been spectacular at telling Maria Bamford's story, and she hasn't been stingy in her openness. Bamford's stand-up has been primarily autobiographical for years and she's covered her stints in mental wellness facilities, her struggles to find a proper diagnosis and medication, her bumpy relationship with her family and several prominent tragedies in cable specials, talk show appearances, podcasts and, yes, in Lady Dynamite, which critics apparently didn't support enough. 


	If you're going to tell Maria Bamford's story, you probably won't be able to tell it as well as Maria Bamford, so you're going to lean into those various clips of her telling her story, at which point the question becomes: What, exactly, are you adding to this experience? The answer, in the case of Paralyzed by Hope, is that what's being added is the platform, but not a lot else. Apatow frames several of those oft-discussed biographical details as surprises in a way that felt a little cheap to me — not grossly manipulative, but not exactly additive. 


	Maybe the documentary's biggest advantage and biggest revelations relate to recency. The chapter of Bamford's life over the past year-and-a-half, which includes the impact of last January's Eaton fire, hasn't been processed onto the stage as fully. This is the chapter that even casual fans may not know, with details that admirably baffle even her various contemporaries. In a good way.  

	











	In contrast to how Lady Dynamite depicted Bamford life, with its boundary-pushing whimsy and expressive weirdness, Paralyzed by Hope is shaped by a very straightforward, somewhat dry and largely familiar approach. Or it's familiar if you know her story. Which some people don't. Because Maria Bamford is on the verge of breaking out, but apparently not there yet. So it's a good opportunity to fall in love with Maria Bamford if you're unfamiliar. And even if you know the story, the way Bamford tells it remains refreshing and fully involving.

Kingsley reprises his role as Trevor Slattery, now just an actor looking for his next big role, in the eight-part dramedy co-created by 'Shang-Chi' director Destin Daniel Cretton.


							By 

	Angie Han


Television Critic


	Simon Williams, the lead of Disney+'s Wonder Man, is no superhero. I don't mean he's a future Avenger yet to come into his potential — he's just not a superhero in any sense, and has no desire to become one. Nor is he any kind of villain, though like any of us he has his bad days.


	No, Simon, an aspiring actor played by former DC supervillain Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, is that rarest of Marvel protagonists: a totally regular person, albeit one blessed (or saddled) with unexplained hidden powers.







	
	
		
					Wonder Man		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	More human than superhuman.
	



Airdate: Tuesday, Jan. 27 (Disney+)Cast: Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Ben Kingsley, Arian Moayed, X Mayo, Zlatko BuricCreators: Destin Daniel Cretton, Andrew Guest			
			







	Perhaps this should make him less interesting than the likes of Spider-Man or Captain America, who can't seem to step outside for coffee without being whisked into one galaxy-hopping adventure or another. Simon's most dramatic chase, by contrast, is tracking a scooter-riding brat through Los Angeles gridlock. But Wonder Man turns Simon's ordinariness into its secret weapon, delivering a dramedy that's all the more charming for being so low-key.

	As the second title released under the “Marvel Spotlight” banner, following 2024's Echo, Wonder Man is a standalone affair. Well, mostly. The Disney+ series finds Simon looking for his big break, and then stumbling into an irresistible opportunity when he meets Ben Kingsley‘s Trevor Slattery — whom fans will recall as the oddball thespian revealed in 2013's Iron Man 3 to be posing as the terrorist Mandarin, though the show provides enough context for even non-fans to get up to speed. (Trevor also appeared in 2021's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, who co-created Wonder Man with Andrew Guest, but that's less relevant to the plot.)

	











	Now just a working actor like any other, Trevor tips Simon off to the auditions for Wonder Man, a remake of Simon's favorite 1980s action movie. The two couldn't be more different in temperament: Simon overthinks his roles to the point of self-sabotage; Trevor is all impulse and intuition. Simon is so reserved that even his live-in girlfriend (an egregiously underused Olivia Thirlby) has given up on him; Trevor is a kooky gadabout who'd be right at home trading druggy celebrity anecdotes with Oliver Putnam.


	They nevertheless become fast friends, drawn together by two major commonalities. The biggest is a sincere passion for their craft. These are men who bond by reciting their favorite monologues at each other, who absolutely mean it when they tell Joe “Everybody Calls Me Joey Pants” Pantoliano (in a highly amusing cameo) that acting is the “single most consequential” calling a person could possibly hope for in life. 


	Abdul-Mateen and Kingsley are adorable in their bromance, the former's combination of confidence and neediness playing against the latter's oddball sense of humor. Their chemistry, fun and fizzy with a hint of melancholy, is the main reason to watch Wonder Man — more so than any big shocking twists (there aren't any) or action thrills (there is one important fight scene in eight half-hour episodes) or weighty themes (this isn't really that kind of show).


	Trevor and Simon also share, unbeknownst to Simon, the interest of the Department of Damage Control. Desperate to fill up their new state-of-the-art prison with “enhanced individuals” in order to justify the enormous budget granted to them by the government — a situation with definitely no real-life resonance at all — they're looking to lock up any superpowered being who might possibly be conceived of as dangerous. So Simon is seen as a viable target, thanks to some vague ion-based (don't ask me) ability to blow things up, and Trevor is blackmailed by ambitious agent Cleary (Arian Moayed) into helping entrap him.

	











	To the extent that Wonder Man has a villain, it's a system that targets minority populations under the callous pretense of “security.” Simon's reality is one where studios have banned all superpowered performers following a tragic incident (dramatized in an episode-length black-and-white flashback starring Byron Bowers as DeMarr “Doorman” Davis and Josh Gad as an entertainingly douchey version of himself), and where the DODC has no qualms about detaining people who've committed no crimes. The stakes might be low in the sense that no one's trying to stop the manifestation of depression or an otherwordly entity from smiting the planet, but they're astronomical from Simon's perspective: If his secret were to come out, he could lose not just his career but his freedom.


	For most of the series, though, Simon's most pressing concerns are ones that'll be familiar to any struggling artist. He argues with an agent, Janelle (X Mayo, very funny), who's as encouraging of his talents as she is exasperated by his self-important habits. He sweats in audition rooms full of actors who are more successful or more connected. He argues with relatives who dismiss his aspirations as irresponsibility or laziness.


Wonder Man shares with other recent showbiz sendups like The Other Two or The Studio the wry amusement of creators who've clearly spent enough time in the trenches of Hollywood to know just how unglamorous it is up close — to know their way around cramped trailers and cheap apartments and self-tape studios. It does not, however, share with those shows the sharp satirical bite toward the industry in general, or the skepticism toward and critique of big-budget IP filmmaking more specifically. This is hardly surprising, given that Wonder Man hails from the money-minting Marvel machine, but it feels like a missed opportunity nonetheless.

	











	Instead, the series subverts the genre in its own characteristically unflashy way. By stripping away the epic scope and fantastical battles these superhero blockbusters have been known for, it brings to the forefront the very human drives — for approval, for connection, for meaning — that have always given Marvel movies their real magic. It's a pretty neat trick, even if it is a modest one.

Jennifer Lopez looked glamorous in a plunging black dress during a shopping trip in Beverly Hills, Calif.

The actress, 56, was photographed browsing inside luxury vintage boutique What Goes Around Comes Around while rocking a maxi dress that showed some cleavage.

Lopez looked sensational showing off her physique in the chic style choice, putting her hair in a simple ponytail to highlight the low-cut neckline.

The daring dress also showed off her toned back.

She completed her look with a pair of dangling earrings.

Lopez was later photographed getting into her car, wearing a herringbone blazer over her dress and enjoying a beverage.

While What Goes Around Comes Around is technically a thrift store, it's extremely high-end — the shop specializes in designer vintage fashion, including handbags, accessories and apparel that's authenticated and curated.

On Tuesday, Lopez was photographed generously giving cash to a homeless man in Los Angeles.

The “Kiss of the Spider Woman” star, who was carrying a nearly $80,000 Hermès Kelly crocodile handbag at the time, handed over the money after the man pleaded his “love” for her.

In turn, the man was grateful for the gift, telling her afterwards, “Jennifer, I love you. Thank you, Jennifer.”

Lopez's presence at the 2026 Golden Globes last week didn't garner nearly as positive a reaction due to her awkward interaction with Glambot director Cole Walliser.

In a video Walliser posted on Instagram that went viral, Lopez posed for the Glambot but didn't acknowledge him as he spoke to her.

Walliser later defended Lopez in a follow-up video.

“I didn't take it personally. It didn't feel rude in that moment,” the Canadian filmmaker said.

“One, she's just down to business. The carpet was closed,” he explained. “She's ready to go inside. She knew what she was gonna do. She got into the position.”

Walliser said it was “just unfortunate” that Lopez happened to be “facing away” from him in the moment.

“I knew she was getting ready. I knew it was late,” he said. “We were just getting through it. That moment didn't feel rude.”

We are first introduced to Lagos through the eyes of Lady (Jessica Gabriel's Ujah) and everything is upside down. It's not a projection error! The image flips and gravity returns. Two young girls are letting their heads loll backwards over the edge of a jetty, rendering the pastoral vision behind them the wrong way up. This idyll does not last long. One slammed door later and Lady — as a young adult — fills the frame. She is living in the same place, it's the dream that has shifted.

Nigerian-British writer/director Olive Nwosu, aided by cinematographer Alana Mejia Gonzalez, starts her career with a fully-formed sense of image-craft. The most enduring moments in her first feature “Lady” stem from a visual power. A widescreen 2:1 aspect ratio is maximized to shoot the over-populated highways of a city home to over 17 million souls, yet there is grace in the gridlock. With a shrewd eye for color and detail, Nwosu does for Lagos what Payal Kapadia did for Mumbai in “All We Imagine As Light,” finding the secret rhythms within a chaotic city.

But this is a boldly aestheticized genre film – and while there are serene moments where the camera takes the position of god overlooking an anthill, much of the film takes place after-hours with the camera drawn to individuals and small groups. Under the glow of car headlamps or club strobe lights, sex workers look like flocks of high-femme birds of paradise. By contrast, Lady holds fast to masculine clothing in the hope of going under the radar and staying in control of her destiny. Gender presentation as a theme is suggested, rather than explicated, by the yin-yang survival modes pursued by Lady and her oldest friend Pinky (Amanda Oruh), the other girl in the opening sequence.

 










Pinky's return after an abrupt departure many years prior presents Lady with an opportunity to earn more than the living she is scraping as a taxi driver. Fuel prices are skyrocketing and increasing numbers of Lady's driver colleagues are heeding the voice of DJ Revolution — a charismatic radio personality — and taking to the streets in protest. Used to being a lone wolf, a woman in a man's world, a solo grafter while collective dissent brews, Lady turns the other cheek and accepts Pinky's proposition to moonlight as a driver for sex workers.

For Lady has one simple dream and it is fully dependent on accruing funds. One wall of her shack is plastered with images of Freetown, Sierra Leone. Behind one tenuously attached photo ripped from a magazine, there is a hole in the wall where she keeps her life savings in cash. Just as Rita Hayworth in “The Shawshank Redemption” was a vulnerable guard against Andy's one shot at freedom, so too the words ‘WISH YOU WERE HERE' over an azure sea induce anxiety — it's a flimsy front for such a precious stash.

If the stakes laid out for Lady are simple enough, Nwosu saves complexity in her sketch of a city vast enough that a person could lose track of their dreams by sheer dint of distraction; the day-to-day business of survival slowly eroding anything more high-minded on the horizon. One of the ways that Lady keeps focused is by fiercely rapping to herself in the mirror; she is, she tells herself, “the boss”. Whether the film agrees is something that Nwosu keeps close to her chest.

 










Working with many first time actors, Nwosu draws out commanding performances, even if these are limited by the loose personas within her writing. The actors give committed emotional performances that suit the stylistic visuals, without emerging as fully-formed characters. Jessica Gabriel's Ujah holds the film together with a seething charisma, while butting up against an underwritten origin-story of her sexual phobia. Her traumatic memories, triggered by spying on the sex workers, sit on the surface; without nuanced rooting in the story, they function only as jagged atmospheric flourishes, detached from deeper significance. 

Yet, these limits have little chance to grate, so compelling is the vision that Nwosu has conjured. Individual scenes are directed with a flair for beat-by-beat menace and reprieve, and she avoids many of the traps that a less confident filmmaker would have dutifully entered. Nwosu has a refined ability to present alternating perspectives without tipping the scales on one or the other. There is a strong sense of duality throughout: characters code-switch between Nigerian and Pidgin, the soundtrack juggles tense strings with rap music, Lady balances the masculine and feminine, while the theme of individualism vs collectivism bubbles on the backburner.

 










If “Lady” is more successful as a series of interconnected vignettes, than as one fluid narrative, it has a moving ending up its sleeve. After presenting a morass of rich themes, Nwosu teases out a small, surprising finale that transcends the blinkered concerns driving her protagonist. ‘WISH YOU WERE HERE' is an entreaty to audiences on behalf of the cinematic and social movements of Lagos today.

“Lady” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Gayle Rankin and Grant O'Rourke also star as uncivilized off-the-grid siblings who resist being evicted by the Scottish Council from their island home.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	The British Isles can be treacherously vulnerable to twee overload in movies, though last year's The Ballad of Wallis Island showed that it can be avoided, remaining a minor-key charmer even while it embraced every oddball eccentricity that writer-stars Tom Basden and Tim Key could concoct. Louis Paxton's The Incomer is not so resilient. Set on an even more remote island, this one off the northeast coast of Scotland, it centers on orphaned siblings who have grown up in isolation, without the comforts of modern mainland life — in thrall to mythical seagull legends that make this abrasively unfunny comedy strictly for the birds.

	The movie's saving grace is Domhnall Gleeson as Daniel, a gentle-natured mainlander working as a land recovery coordinator for the Northeastern Scottish Council. He's an awkward outsider in the office, his moral misgivings about foreclosures and evictions, turfing people out of their lifelong homes, leading his careerist boss Roz (Michelle Gomez) to treat him like a bleeding-heart fool. He's also “a ginger” with eczema, which doesn't exactly raise his stock.

The Bottom Line

	
	A shipwreck.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (NEXT)Cast: Domhnall Gleeson, Gayle Rankin, Grant O'Rourke, Emun Elliott, Michelle Gomez, John HannahDirector-screenwriter: Louis Paxton

								1 hour 42 minutes			






	With Daniel's empathy perceived as a weakness, Gleeson makes him the ideal mediator to communicate with two people positioned even further out on the margins. Calum (Emun Elliott), the thuggish staffer usually in charge of doorstep evictions, is out of commission due to some legal strife, so Roz sends Daniel in his place to a tiny island where brother and sister Sandy (Grant O'Rourke) and Isla (Gayle Rankin) — on-the-nose names that make them seem like they belong in Bikini Bottom with Spongebob — have lived alone since their parents passed 30 years ago.

	











	Paxton makes clever use of Selina Wagner's doodling animation to pencil in the island's ancestral folklore, frequently recounted by bossy Isla to dim bulb Sandy, when she's not caw-cawing at birds like a witch. The isle belongs to the gulls, and the siblings were taught as children to defend the birds' sanctuary from “incomers,” bringing with them the decadence and deceit of the mainland. Even so, Isla jealously guards the flotsam that drifts ashore, including a bendy sex toy that they think must be a weapon of some kind. Oh, the hilarity!


	The brother and sister sustain themselves by digging up peat bog to burn in an ancient, dilapidated house with no utilities, and hunting seabirds. But it's a meager existence. “I could go for some whale blubber right now,” says hungry Sandy.


	Probably three readers at most will get this reference, but the establishing scenes on the island poked my repressed memory PTSD, hate-watching 1970s British children's fantasy TV series like Catweazle, a show about a creepy time-traveling wizard that dialed up the whimsy to 11. The movie also brought back those cringe-inducing scenes at the end of another drama set on a windblown Scottish island, The Outrun, in which Saoirse Ronan “conducts” turbulent nature with an invisible baton.


The Incomer follows similar cues. Rankin plays Isla as a shrill, feral version of Gaby Hoffman (no offense to the wonderful Gabs) given to physical violence, while O'Rourke gets to play the sweet, constipated dolt, talking wistfully of the days when his “bottom mess” flowed more freely. I'm serious. Isla also has frequent exchanges with a “fin man” (poor John Hannah), part of a mythical species of whiskered seal-like creatures that haunt the waters, bobbing up to lure land-dwellers into the murky depths.

	











	One of Isla and Sandy's preferred deterrents to keep incomers away is to dress up in home-made Wicker Man-type bird costumes and masks — which at least gets them out of their hideous knitwear. If their hostile squawking doesn't work, they take up primitive weapons. Daniel is greeted with a rock to the head and then dangled over a cliff. But he saves himself by telling Isla and Sandy he's a wizard (like Catweazle!), snapping a photo of them on his cellphone and threatening to use it to delete their souls.


	What follows is a predictable détente during which Daniel paints a rosy picture of relocation to a comfortable home and easier lives on the mainland. Given that stories are Isla and Sandy's chief currency, he also entertains them by taking ownership of Tolkien and recasting himself as Gandalf.


	Romantic complications ensue when time spent with Daniel sparks impulses that the siblings don't know what to do with, beyond roping him into a gull initiation ceremony. And violence intrudes when Roz grows impatient for results and deploys hotheaded Calum to clean up the mess.


	But this is designed to be a heartwarming comedy and debuting feature director Paxton is more assured with the outcome than he is about getting there. Some actual funny gags in the late action — a queer awakening avec bear; a hard headbutt when Daniel moves in for a kiss, confusing Isla — hint at what the story could have been with a less cutesy touch.


	Almost in spite of its full-scale charm offensive — the score's plucky strings and horns really are a bit much — The Incomer acquires poignancy through Gleeson's playful, unassuming performance. Watching Daniel stand up to Roz is a victory for social justice in a rapacious modern world, while the fear of change embodied by Isla and Sandy ultimately is quite touching. While I found the movie a mostly annoying guano pileup, some no doubt will respond more receptively to its quirky exploration of human connection.

Some actual funny gags in the late action — a queer awakening avec bear; a hard headbutt when Daniel moves in for a kiss, confusing Isla — hint at what the story could have been with a less cutesy touch.


	Almost in spite of its full-scale charm offensive — the score's plucky strings and horns really are a bit much — The Incomer acquires poignancy through Gleeson's playful, unassuming performance. Watching Daniel stand up to Roz is a victory for social justice in a rapacious modern world, while the fear of change embodied by Isla and Sandy ultimately is quite touching. While I found the movie a mostly annoying guano pileup, some no doubt will respond more receptively to its quirky exploration of human connection.

Sadly, it's a rarity these days: a filmmaker who trusts their audience to have the attention span to follow the story unfolding on the screen. Filmmaker Rachel Lambert has long excelled at just this, from her fractured family drama “In the Radiant City” to her delightfully off-kilter character study “Sometimes I Think About Dying.” Mostly, Lambert trusts her actors to breathe life into stories that may scan small on the page, but reach profound heights on the big screen.

Her latest film, the lovely romance “Carousel,” is perhaps the best example yet of these tendencies and talents, a film for and about grownups bolstered by strong performances from stars Chris Pine (in a role that, we hope, will define the next chapter of his career) and a wonderfully delicate Jenny Slate. Filmed in Lambert's own Ohio hometown, the film revels in the seeming minutiae of everyday life, but finds pleasure and profundity in such spaces.

When we first meet Noah — a local doctor who loves his handed-down practice — his gentle nature is barely masking some big pain. Lambert's script doles out details in small measures, requiring patience from her audience. It is, however, immediately clear that Noah's seemingly recent divorce has taken a major toll on both him and his teen daughter Maya (“Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret” breakout Abby Ryder Fortson), who displays major anxiety about the smallest of matters.

 










There are big matters afoot, too, like the news that Noah's mentor (Sam Waterston) is retiring from their practice. And there's the reappearance of Rebecca (Slate), who we later come to understand was Noah's high school sweetheart, and one he has been unable to shake in the intervening years. Rebecca is back in town to deal with her own problems, including a stuck career in politics and her aging parents' inability to move forward with selling their house. We see what's brought Rebecca here through a natty bit of perspective shift, a trick that Lambert employs sparsely throughout the film, and one that can occasionally catch audiences off-guard, eager to fill in the pieces.

But Lambert will fill in the pieces, often through the force of Pine's performance in particular. When he and Rebecca reunite — the pair exhibit an immediate chemistry that feels both physical and emotional, conveying a believably complicated history — no one is under any illusions that everything is suddenly perfect. This is, after all, a story about adults, people who look and talk like real people, imperfect actions, stilted sentences, so much unsaid. Communication, it seems, has always been a problem between the two, and when we get a taste of what tore them apart in the first place, we can already see what might happen this time.

 










Or will it? That's the central question of “Carousel,” which finds Lambert gently eschewing standard romance beats — they fall in love, express it, and live happily ever after! — in favor of a story that is compelled by viewing the cost of real love through a decidedly mature lens. Both Noah and Rebecca are dealing with real problems, true-life stuff, the kind of things coming at all of us. Noah's divorce has wounded him, a lingering tragedy involving his father still cannot be spoken of, Rebecca is realizing her career is not everything. Local stores are closing up on Main Street. Maya can't put into words what she's feeling. There are so many jokes about the cost of healthcare.

What happens to love in the face of all of that? Anchored by a heart-stopping argument that sees Noah and Rebecca laying bare every fault, flaw, and falsity that has kept them from fully embracing each other (and maybe even life itself), “Carousel” feels ripped from the fabric of a million lives. Don't let the seemingly small nature of the film fool you; there is career-best work here, especially from Pine, who was always made for a romantic drama. This one was worth the wait.

“Carousel” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking distribution.

The nominees -- also including Nicholas Pike and Max Richter -- share their reactions to being nominated with Billboard.


													By
												

	Melinda Newman



	For Diane Warren, the 17th time may be the charm for taking home her first Oscar, while The National's Bryce Dessner and composers Nicholas Pike and Max Richter are all celebrating their first nominations. For two time-Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat, it's a chance to add another trophy.


	They all may have approached writing for their nominated projects differently, but on Thursday (Jan. 22), the original score and original song honorees are all united on feeling the joy of hearing their name called when the 2026 Oscar nominations were announced at 8:30 a.m. ET this morning.

	











Billboard talked to a number of the nominees shortly after they learned of their nominations. Below are condensed highlights from the interviews.


	Clint Bentley's Train Dreams is such a minimalist film with the emphasis on the cinematography and small acting ensemble that the director and the film's composer, The National's Bryce Dessner, questioned if it even needed a song, but the pair ultimately decided it did. “It felt like [the song] had to kind of walk a careful line of feeling part of the film, which feels so closely related to the book, and this universe in which it lives,” says Dessner.




	Nick Cave was Bentley's first choice to write the lyrics and perform the song. “He's obviously a huge hero of mine, of my band, and someone we've listened to forever,” Dessner says. “It was not something I had imagined doing because how would we get to him?” But it turns out Cave was a huge fan of the book the movie is based on. “[Nick] called me and just said, ‘Look, I really want this to feel part of the world you created. Can you send me some music to work with? I sent him a piece that then he was able to write over and that's how it happened. Sometimes beautiful profound things are fairly effortless. I think that, basically, Nick had a dream, woke up and wrote the lyrics. It just came together quite quickly. A couple days [later] in the studio he asked me if I had any notes. I said, ‘Don't change a thing.'”


	Dessner says he and Cave have no future plans to work together, though he would be open to it. “This is just such a joy,” he says. “Having my name on an Oscar nomination with Nick is such a big honor.”


	Desplat considers Frankenstein the “third movement of the triptych” with director Guillermo Del Toro, following Pinocchio and The Shape of Water. “They are all about the creatures and being able to receive love to give love and create empathy, so there's some kind of line going through these three scores and these three movies. Each time it's how do you bring the audience to understand and love the creature?”


	To represent humanity, Desplat chose “the smallest, tiniest, most beautiful and most difficult instrument, which is the violin,” which plays as the movie opens and creates the sound of the creature for the film. “Of course, it will get bigger and operatic and huge with a symphonic choir but keeps going back and forth between this very intimate, gentle sound and the huge symphonic sound.”  Desplat and Del Toro had decided on the solo violin motif long before shooting for the movie even began. “We wanted the avoid the obvious, avoid the horror film, avoid the scary and we knew that we needed to be touched, moved by the creature. Very early on, we spoke about using a string instrument because the creature is a huge thing and we need to have a counterpoint with this instrument.”

	











	Over the course of their work together, the two have developed complete trust. “Guillermo likes music in cinema and that makes a huge difference because when the composer comes near him, he allows him to do whatever he wants as long as it brings the dramaturgy and the characters int a wider level of emotion. And so, it's really a flawless [process.]”


	With 12 nominations and two wins, Desplat says it is still a thrill to be nominated. “It's fabulous!,” he says. “It's amazing each time. I'm so grateful.”


	Writing an aria for the closing of Viva Verdi!, an independent documentary that shines a light on the elderly opera singers and musicians who live in Milan's Casa Verdi retirement home (built by the composer in 1896) and mentor young music students, opened up a whole new path for Pike. “I can't say I was a huge opera fan or going to the opera all the time,” he says before writing the song, but he found the process so enjoyable, he has written more arias for upcoming films and is now entertaining the idea of writing an opera that could hopefully appeal to a  younger audience to “This is a passion of mine at the moment,” he says, adding the film “really brought all that to life. Ideally, I would get a commission of some sort.”


	Pike, who also scored the documentary, wrote “Sweet Dreams of Joy” based on a 12-minute snippet of the film sent to him by producer Christine La Monte. “It was so inspiring, it was so full of humanity and music and energy, that I literally walked over to the piano and wrote the piece without any thought of would it end up in the film,” he says. “It was just so moving I had to write the piece. The lyrics took me a little longer to finesse them, but, really, it was just pure inspiration.”

	











	Soprano Ava Maria Martinez sang the aria after the original singer came down with bronchitis. After the singer fell ill, Pike says he was “complaining bitterly” to his engineer who suggested Martinez who had worked with her for series Mozart in the Jungle. It went so well that Pike pledged to her that “I wasn't going to rest until you're singing on the Oscars stage.”


	For Richter, his score to the Golden Globe winner for best motion picture-drama had to coordinate with the natural elements of the film. “The voice of the forest and of the earth, they're really a big part of the overall texture of the film,” he says. “It was almost like a conversation between those natural sounds and the score and dialogue. It was like trying to find very, very minimal kinds of ways for the music, just to kind of make things glow just a little bit.”


	The Chloe Zhao-directed movie looks at William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes' courtship, marriage and subsequent loss of a child that leads Shakespeare to write Hamlet.


	Richter was deliberately “very sparing” in his musical choices to let the “powerful, very emotional material speak on its own terms without trying to direct us as the audience in any particular way.” He also brought in renowned Renaissance choir, Tenebrae, “but I transformed those vocal recordings in the computer into a sort of haunted, ghostly version of those vocals.” He also used Elizabethan string instruments in keeping with the period, but “we hear them as altered, refracted ghostly versions of themselves.”


	For all the dark topics Hamnet addresses, Richter says working on the movie was nothing but a joyous experience. “It really is a special project to me because very often you may work on a film and the film will turn out great, but the project was a nightmare, right? That was not the case with Hamnet. The vibes on that set were just amazing.”

	











	Out of all the songs that Warren has written for films, “Dear Me” included a first: “I've never written a song about myself,” she says.


	“Dear Me,” the hopeful, inspiring end-title song performed by Kesha that accompanies the documentary about the 17-time Oscar-nominated songwriter, draws from what Warren would tell her younger self.


	“I was a lonely, misunderstood, bullied kid that spent a lot of time in my room by myself when I wasn't being kicked out of school or things like that,” she says. “What I wanted to do was tell that young girl sitting in a room and picking up a guitar and maybe writing her first song that, ‘Hey, you know what? You're going to be OK. You don't know it now, but you're going to be all right.'”


	Warren's most personal song turned out to be her most universal. “It's resonated with so many people because we all have that kid inside us,” she says. Even the third graders who came into her studio to sing on it related to the message, she says. “They said, ‘This song is giving me hope. This is making me tell myself it's going to be OK.'”


	Kesha was her first choice to sing the song as she “cast” the role. “They have to be authentic to the movie and to the song. You have to have both,” she said. “I've known Kesha for a while and I'm so aware she's an amazing singer. I also knew she's gone through a lot of stuff so I knew it would resonate with her. She came to my studio and was crying when she heard it and that's how I knew. There was no other choice.”


	Warren is behind only Sammy Cahn and Johnny Mercer in receiving the most nominations in the best song category. “That makes me feel pretty cool,” she says. “They've won a couple of those, right?” The answer is yes, with Warren hoping 17 is her lucky number to finally take home a trophy. “I'm not gonna lie and say I wouldn't like to win, especially with this song from this movie. Who knows, right?”

Romeo Beckham appeared to be in a good mood while in Paris with his girlfriend, despite his family rift with older brother, Brooklyn, dominating headlines.

The model, 23, was photographed holding hands in the city with Kim Turnball Thursday. The couple attended the Costes party as part of Paris Fashion Week.

Romeo — who sported bleached hair, a white long-sleeved T-shirt and baggy brown pants — flashed a smile in the pics. He also rocked a red plaid scarf, which he wore on top of his head.

Turnball looked chic in jeans, a black top and a sherpa coat. The DJ and model styled her hair in a slicked-back ponytail.

Romeo and Turnball rekindled their romance late last year after they previously broke up in June 2025 after seven months of dating.

The news came amid reports that Romeo and Brooklyn had fallen out over Turnbull, claiming Brooklyn previously had a romantic connection with her — but sources told Page Six that wasn't true.

“It's just an excuse to find an argument,” the source said, calling the rumors about the brothers “nonsense.”

Turnbull later shut down the rumors herself in an Instagram Story, stating that she and Brooklyn, 26, “have never been romantically involved in ANY capacity at ANY point.”

“Nothing between us has occurred further than a school friendship at age 16,” she claimed. “I would like to remove myself from the ongoing conversation & set the record straight for the sake of everyone involved.”

Meanwhile, Romeo has yet to comment on Brooklyn's scathing Instagram post against their parents, David and Victoria Beckham.

In the stunning attack — which Brooklyn shared via Instagram Stories on Jan. 19 — he accused his parents of “endlessly” attempting to “ruin” his and his wife, Nicola Peltz's, relationship and accused his mom of dancing “inappropriately” with him at his 2022 wedding.

“I do not want to reconcile with my family,” Brooklyn wrote in part. “I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life. For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family.”

“For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family [with] performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships,” he continued. “Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade.”

Much like Romeo, Victoria and David's youngest son, 20-year-old Cruz Beckham, appears to be taking the drama in stride.

He recently “liked” a video poking fun of Victoria's alleged “inappropriate” dancing at Brooklyn's wedding on Instagram.

As for Brooklyn, he and Nicola put on a united front in their first public sighting since going nuclear on his parents, showing PDA while walking their dog in Malibu, Calif.

Raye has announced that her sophomore album, This Music May Contain Hope, will land on March 27. 


	News of the aspirational offering arrived alongside a heartfelt message from the Grammy-nominated artist. “Music is medicine, I've always said that. I guess I'm in the process of making medicine for myself that I can share with the world,” said Raye. “I want us all to say to ourselves that it's going to be all right, and I'm going to have faith in the seeds that I've planted beneath the snow. I wanted to create something that is a hug, bed or soft place for that person who needs it.”


	The album will be set across four “seasons,” according to a press release, with each side of the vinyl representing a different chapter while taking listeners on a journey that begins with “darkness and ends with light.”

Back in October, she revealed that the car had been found — and the songbooks along with it. “It was a roller-coaster journey, but what I didn't tell everyone is the police called me maybe two or three months ago, and they were like, ‘We found your car,'” Raye told EE Official Big Top 40 From Global at the time. “Not only did I get it back, not one thing had been taken out of the car. All my songwriting books were there, untouched.”

	











	Tonight, the star is launching her 51-date arena tour, the aptly titled, This Tour May Contain New Music, and will travel to Europe, the U.K., and the United States for the international run. Rolling Stone named her trek one of the most anticipated tours of 2026, with music writer Larisha Paul noting, “The British songstress has an affinity for big band music and grand dramatic displays both onstage and in the studio, as evidenced by ‘Where Is My Husband?' and ‘Genesis.' A master entertainer and a true musician, Raye knows how to put on a show.”

On the morning of August 22, 2023, something went horribly wrong in the remote mountains of Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province: A makeshift gondola that was carrying eight people — most of them teenagers on their way to school — from one peak to another was left dangling on its side 1,000 feet in the air when two of the system's mile-long cable car wires snapped without warning. 

Like the Tham Luang cave rescue, the Copiapó mining accident, and the litany of other disasters that have been disseminated over the internet in media res, the situation in Battagram immediately became equal parts crisis and spectacle, as the industrialized world pivoted its narrow spotlight towards a poor stretch of the Himalayas that it had previously been happy to ignore.

How long would it be until the boys plummeted to their deaths? What could the Pakistani government do to help a people who'd always been left to fend for themselves? Why does it feel like no one would have cared as much about the outcome if not for the fact that a local drone operator was there to capture it all in jarring close-up, his camera hovering just a few inches away from the passengers' faces as they stood motionless inside the refurbished sheet metal, afraid that even the slightest movement might send the cable car screaming to the bottom of the valley below? TV news stations were eager to confront their viewers with the first two questions. At its best, Mohammed Ali Naqvi's taut but frustratingly anemic “Hanging by a Wire” takes a few measured steps toward addressing the third. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Molded on E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin's “The Rescue,” but sorely missing that film's artful suspense and rich characterizations, the 77-minute “Hanging by a Wire” gets right down to business with the sort of “don't click away to some true-crime bullshit!” urgency that all docs seem to require now that the entire medium has been relegated to streaming. Here is the valley. It's gorgeous but secluded. Here are the cable cars. They are clearly made and maintained by the locals. It was just another school day until BOOM — cue the very canned sound of an explosion over the soundtrack — the wires snapped at the worst possible time. 

From the moment the movie starts, there is little doubt in our minds that most or all of the passengers will ultimately survive; I'd like to think that we'd remember if things went south, but the more relevant tell is that people don't really make upbeat, action-forward, heart in your chest rescue docs about terrified kids who died horribly while their parents watched. Still, Naqvi does what he can to engender some doubt, as he introduces the boys through memorial-like still photographs (often being held by their fathers, who speak of their sons in the present tense, and whose only function here is to say things like “I can still feel the utter despair from that day” in a variety of different ways), and diverts our attention from them until the rescue is well underway. 

 










In the meantime, Naqvi introduces us to a terrifically memorable cast of characters, all of whom help to explain why he was so compelled to make this movie, but few of whom receive the degree of detail they deserve. 

First up is Sumaira Khan, a pro-active news anchor who grew up in Battagram, but has since worked her way into an on-air gig at SAMAA TV, and feels an obligation to help the people of her hometown (knowing full well that the authorities need an extra kick in the ass to bother with the country's poorer communities). She effectively passes the baton to police chief Sonia Shamraz, another woman who knows a thing or two about defying the odds. Seen here cosplaying as herself in some of the film's least essential recreations, Shamraz determines that the locals can't be trusted to save themselves, and sends in a rescue helicopter without communicating her plan to the anguished parents and friends who are watching the situation unfold. 

“Hanging by a Wire” doesn't call much attention to the class divide that runs through the middle of this film like a faultline, but the broader points speak for themselves. You can hear it plainly in the use of language (the big city types are fluent in English, while the Battagram residents talk in Pashto or Urdu), and in the disregard that authorities like Shamraz have for “Sky Pirate” Sahib Khan, a winsome Battagram native who fearlessly attempts to save the kids with a pulley he cobbled together from $15 worth of spare parts. Confident in his know-how, Khan is forced to access the cable car from the other side of the valley — where the cops won't stop him. 

 










They have a Sky Pirate of their own, an entrepreneur and wildly entertaining social media influencer who runs the world's highest zipline and is more than happy to flaunt his success. Despite being the “best-looking member of his family” with “a handsome body,” Ali Swati feels like a disappointment to his father because he wasn't able to serve in the Pakistani Army, and sees the cable car situation as the perfect chance to prove his worth. 

Swati's mid-air clashes with Khan are destined to become the film's most valuable source of interpersonal conflict, and “Hanging by a Wire” clearly recognizes the nature of the tension between them, but Naqvi passes up the opportunity to shine a more revealing light at the subtext of their relationship. That's par for the course in a documentary that loses a lot of its you are there intensity when the dark of night descends on the dangling cable car, forcing Naqvi to transition from first-hand footage to studio-bound recreations starring the real people who survived the crisis. 

These sequences are elegantly shot and psychologically mega-charged (though “Hanging by a Wire” does precious little to engage with the anxiety of dramatizing the worst day of your life), but the pitch-black void isn't a particularly exciting backdrop, and the operation itself is absent the insane twists that all but ensured “The Rescue” would be adapted into a Ron Howard movie. 

 










Hollywood is far too white to make a similar go at “Hanging by a Wire” (there's no role for Christian Bale to play here), but it wouldn't be the worst idea for another film industry to give it a whirl, as this is the rare documentary thriller that feels like it might actually be improved by scripted dialogue and some more extensive stunt work. Naqvi has thoughtfully collected all of the right ingredients for a more penetrating story, and it's easy enough to appreciate how his emphasis on basic entertainment value is a roundabout effort to return the world's attention to Battaram (whose infrastructure has yet to be improved, something I had to discover on my own time after the movie had ended), but the movie's narrow focus on the pre-existing conditions that fed into the cable car crisis does more to flatten the people involved than it does to bring new dimension to their ordeal. 

Rather than offering a nuanced response to any of the issues it raises from the start, “Hanging by a Wire” ultimately asks a different set of questions — one that Naqvi's film is less equipped to answer. Chief among them: At a time when every disaster is captured on video, what's the value of fleshing them out into feature-length documentaries? It would seem there's a need for filmmakers to perform rescue missions of their own — to rescue the stuff of recent history from the slipstream of social media content and restore a measure of dignity to the people who suffered for the world's morbid amusement. Naqvi is able to accomplish that at least, but the movie he's made is unwilling to go even the slightest bit further, as if the filmmaker were afraid that audiences' last remaining connection to non-fiction cinema would snap if he applied any more weight to it. 

 










“Hanging by a Wire” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

	As Rolling Stone previously and dutifully reported, it had been more than 1,300 days since Harry Styles released new music before he returned on Thursday evening with new single, “Aperture.”


	The single delivers a shimmering first look at his long-awaited album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, out March 6. “It's best you know what you don't/Aperture lets the light in,” sings Styles before diving into the soaring chorus and declaring: “We belong together/It finally appears it's only love.”


	The singer previewed the song for fans who waited hours at New York's Rough Trade record store on Wednesday, Jan. 21, to be among the first to hear the lead single from the musician's upcoming LP. “As soon as I heard his voice, I was crying so much,” Lindsay, 24, told Rolling Stone at the listening party. “We've been waiting for years for his comeback.”


	The following day, Styles announced a global residency tour of 50 shows across seven cities in support of his upcoming fourth studio album. The international run will launch May 16 in Amsterdam, where he is booked to perform six shows, followed by shows in London, São Paulo, Brazil, Mexico City, and a whopping 30 shows at New York's Madison Square Garden. Styles will wrap the tour in Australia in Melbourne and Sydney.

	Last week, the star revealed that Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, was pending. Produced by Kid Harpoon, the LP will span 12 new tracks and mark Styles' fourth studio album and his first since 2022. Styles teased the announcement in his customary, enigmatic fashion, putting up billboards and posters from New York to São Paulo that quizzed onlookers, “Do you know who you are?” The signs were branded with “TPWK” at the bottom, an acronym corresponding to his single, “Treat People With Kindness” and merch from his last tour. Posters declaring “We Belong Together” also appeared in major cities worldwide.

	











	The signs also correlated with a new website from the musician, which currently invites visitors to spin a wheel to fatefully land on either “Disco” or “Kiss” — upon clicking, fans are prompted to text a number, which leads to a sign-up page to add contact information.

	Styles wrapped his Love on Tour — in support of the Grammy-winning albums 2019's Fine Line and 2022's Harry's House — in 2023, and reflected on the 169-date run in an Instagram post. “It's been the greatest experience of my entire life. I feel so incredibly full and happy. It's all because of you,” he wrote at the time. “You have given me memories that will last a lifetime, more than I could have ever dreamed of. Thank you for your time, your energy, and your love.”

Harry Styles‘ music and his fans belong together, and for the first time in years — with the release of new song “Aperture” on Thursday (Jan. 22) — they finally reunite.


	Arriving a few weeks ahead of the singer's fourth solo album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, “Aperture” finds Styles crooning over an electric beat produced by Kid Harpoon. It marks the first step in a new era that's already defined by romance, dancing and whimsy, which the One Direction alum kicked off earlier in January with the launch of his WeBelongTogether.co.

	











	The website preceded the announcement of Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally on Jan. 15, at which time he unveiled the release date (March 6) and cover art (a slightly out-of-focus photo of Styles at a dance party near dark woods) on Instagram. At this time, fans don't know much about the full-length, other than it including 12 tracks worked on by Kid Harpoon — but “Aperture” marks their first taste of Styles' next phase.


	Two months after Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally arrives, the Brit will embark on a series of residencies in seven different cities, starting May 16 with five performances in Amsterdam. After stops in London, São Paulo and Mexico City, Styles will set up shop for an eye-popping 30 shows in New York City's Madison Square Garden, where a banner celebrating his numerous 2022 Love On Tour shows in the famed venue already hangs. After NYC, Styles will close out the trek in Australia in late November, early December.

	











	The hitmaker last dropped an album in 2022, when Harry's House spent two weeks atop the Billboard 200. His first two albums also debuted at No. 1 on the chart. Harry's House won the album of the year Grammy in 2023 and housed the 15-week Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 “As It Was.”

Adriana Paz toplines Suzanne Andrews Correa's based-on-real-events drama as a survivor of sexual assault who embarks on a path of retribution.


							By 

	Sheri Linden


Senior Copy Editor/Film Critic


The Huntress (La Cazadora), the first feature by writer-director Suzanne Andrews Correa, opens with a portentous tableau: women waiting in darkness by the side of an unlighted road. Passing headlights illuminate their anxious faces. They know that the buses they depend on to get to their assembly plant jobs can also be traps, making them prey to rapists and killers. And, in the border town where they live, their calls for justice have long been met with official indifference and obstruction. They wait.


	Exploring trauma, rage and revenge from an intimate perspective, Andrews Correa's gritty, well-observed drama is based on events that unfolded in Ciudad Juárez, a place that has become infamous for violence against women, many of whose remains have turned up in shallow graves in the Chihuahuan Desert on the outskirts of the city. It was in Juárez, in the summer of 2013 (20 years after victims' bodies were first discovered), that a woman who called herself Diana, Hunter of Bus Drivers shot and killed two drivers at point-blank range. Her true identity remains unknown. The Huntress conjectures, affectingly, on who she might be.

The Bottom Line

	
	Keenly observed and deeply unsettling.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (World Cinema Dramatic Competition)Cast: Adriana Paz, Teresa Sánchez, Jennifer Trejo, Eme Malafe, Guillermo Alonso, Leidi Gutiérrez, Estrella Gómez, Suri GutiérrezDirector-screenwriter: Suzanne Andrews Correa

								1 hour 31 minutes			






	Set and filmed in and around Juárez, part of a U.S.-Mexico manufacturing hub, the movie imagines barely more than 24 hours, spread over two transformative days, in the life of Luz, a 40-something employee of one of the border town's maquiladoras. The character is brought to vibrant, ferocious, conflicted life by a superb Adriana Paz (Emila Pérez).

	After the opening nighttime scene, the film jumps straight into the shocking daylight shooting. Instead of boarding the bus she usually takes to the appliance assembly plant, Luz, with a gun in her shaking hands and her only disguise a long platinum wig, plants herself in the entrance to the bus and takes aim. She flees to a public bathroom to throw up and scrub the spattered blood from her face. The man she killed recently raped one of her co-workers, 17-year-old Clara (Leidi Gutiérrez), whose face still bears the bruises from her attack. During a moment alone, Luz seems to breathe for the first time in hours, her satisfied smile signaling her sense of accomplishment and, perhaps, a course of no return.


	The plant's American managers arrange for a local police detective, Rosales (Guillermo Alonso), to question employees about the shooting. With his faux geniality, he's almost a walking cliché of male entitlement. Alonso taps into this but also into how Rosales is posing, testing his power at every turn — from the menacing fashion in which he pours a glass of water to his maliciousness after nearly forcing his way into Luz's house. With cops like these, it's no wonder the investigation of crimes against poor women hasn't been a priority. Newscasters, meanwhile, quickly begin spouting an official story about the bus driver's killing that has nothing to do with the women.


	Luz's protective instincts have a particular focus: her 14-year-old daughter, Alejandra (Jennifer Trejo), first seen playing hooky with her bestie (Suri Gutiérrez) to shop for quinceañera dresses. It's a quintessential teen-girl moment, complete with glittering layers of crinoline, a joyful vision of innocence on the cusp of experience. Alejandra's innocence extends toward her mother's trauma: As the screenplay gradually reveals, Luz's assault happened a year earlier, and the truth of the matter has been kept from her daughter, who knows only that her mother was in an “accident.”

	











	Luz's boyfriend of three years, cabdriver Jaime (Eme Malafe), is a neighbor in their remote patch of Juárez. He's a good-natured and dependable guy — and a long-suffering one, at the end of his patience with Luz, who apparently hasn't slept with him since she was raped. Meaning well but hitting a flat note that signals he just doesn't get the depth of her pain, he tells her of her ordeal, “It's over. You're okay.” Later, though, after Luz harshly reveals that she views even him as a potential abuser, his viewpoint abruptly shifts. “You're really sick,” he tells her, understandably offended.


	That Luz is damaged is one of the strengths of Andrews Correa's screenplay, which doesn't downplay the trap that grieving and outrage can turn into. When Luz crosses paths with Ximena (Teresa Sánchez), a tough local who has devoted herself to the memory of her long-missing daughter with an obsessive focus, it's soon clear that they understand each other on a profound level — they are, as Ximena later puts, “two zombies.” Ximena, whose daughter worked at the same plant as Luz, leads groups of bereft parents of missing girls into the desert to search for evidence, people for whom any scrap of bone inspires hope. There's barely room for her to sleep amid the boxes of evidence in her house, but her daughter's room is pristine and carefully maintained. Hanging from the rearview mirror of her pickup is a figurine that intrigues Luz: the goddess Artemis, the hunter.

	











	Andrews Correa, a writer-director on the Paramount+ series Minimum Wage (15 a la Hora), roots the story in an unforced working-class sensibility and a powerful sense of place. María Sarasvati Herrera's widescreen camerawork captures an edge-of-the-world emptiness in the flat stretches of desert that surround the city, and a heartless chill in the horizontal grid of workstations stretching across the factory floor. The darkness of the night scenes is thick with danger, and the tension throughout the film, along with its sense of emotional unraveling, is ratcheted up by the sound design.


	The high August temperatures referred to several times in the dialogue never quite come across, though it's notable that Luz, averse to being touched by Jaime or anyone, wears long sleeves in the summer heat. Whether Luz's pain will dissipate remains in doubt, but in Paz's exceptionally compelling performance, it's clear that she's done waiting for justice. And she's accepted the price.

New research suggests liquid water may exist on tidally locked exoplanets beyond classic habitable zones. (CREDIT: NASA Astrobiology Institute)

For many years, astronomers have been looking for extraterrestrial life. In doing so, astronomers have narrowed their search to a small “habitable zone” around stars. This habitable zone defines the region in which the temperature of a planet is likely to be warm enough, but not too warm, for liquid water to exist at the surface of the planet.

By analyzing the data in a recent paper published in Astrophysical Journal, Professor Amri Wandel from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem argues that this long-held assumption may actually be too conservative. It may easily dismiss planets that once seemed inhospitable to liquid water as potentially habitable planets because they might still have liquid water on their surfaces.

Wandel's studies were focused mainly on planets orbiting two types of stellar names, M Dwarf Stars and K Dwarf Stars. These stars are both smaller and cooler than our Sun and make up the majority of stellar types in our galaxies.

The majority of M and K Dwarf Stars are excellent targets for exoplanet detecting. The planets orbiting these stars transit more frequently. They can be easily detected and studied with instruments like the James Webb Telescope, etc. Therefore, they appear to have tremendous potential for finding and studying exoplanets.

However, most of the exoplanets orbiting M and K Dwarf Stars look very different than Earth. Almost all of these planets are “tidally locked.” A planet that is tidally locked is a planet that has one side always facing its host star. The other side of the planet remains in perpetual dark.

Experts once argued that a planet that is tidally locked would not likely be a good candidate for life because of the extreme temperature difference between the two sides of the planet. For instance, one side may have “scorching heat.” The opposite side would have “freezing temperatures.” This would make it impossible for the atmosphere to exist on the planet due to atmospheric collapse.

However, Wandel argues that this assumption is incorrect by performing a comparison of the heat flow on such planets using his analytical climate model. "We found that the amount of heat circulating from the dayside of a planet to the nightside is more efficient than previously thought. If there is sufficient transfer of heat, more than a hemisphere's worth of the dark hemispheres on most worlds can be affected when they are closer to their stars using traditional models of astronomy," he explained to The Brighter Side of News.

Instead of just focusing on how warm or cold a world can get on average, Wandel's study also looks at the ability of any part of the surface within that planet's orbit to support permanent liquid water under the same conditions.

In a tidally locked world, the nightside of the world might be the only place to support liquid water.

In addition, Wandel's research has provided further understanding of previously observed phenomena based on the work of the James Comet Mike Space Telescope. This telescope has been able to detect the presence of gaseous forms of water (H₂O), as well as many gases associated with liquid water, in the atmospheres of warm, nearby, super-Earth-type planets orbiting around M-dwarf stars. 

These are mostly found within what would generally be considered an inner boundary of the habitable zone. Due to these observations, it is now difficult to state that there should be no evidence to support the idea that H₂O would survive around such star systems.

In addition to the inner edge of the habitable zone being able to accommodate places for the presence of H₂O in its gaseous form, Wandel's research also extends the outer edge of the habitable zone outwards. On other worlds within our solar system, for example Earth, there could be evidence for permanent liquid water being located under the covering of thick, ice-crusted layers. It could also exist below the covering of a permanent ice-frosted layer. 

If conditions were to allow for sufficient subsurface pressure to build up during ice onset or onset of maximum freezing temperatures, such as when subglacial or intraglacial lakes were present, these places where permanent liquid water might have existed would also mean that there are places on these worlds where there is a chance of continued existence of permanent liquid water. This could occur despite atmospheric or environmental conditions remaining frozen.

While water is viewed as the most important of all life-supporting compounds, it is only one of several critical needs that living systems have for proper functioning. These needs ultimately include both chemical energy and long-term stability.

Traditional limits of habitability are typically based on two different sets of legibility limits. The inner limit represents the point of maximum water vapor loss through atmospheric escape. The outer limit represents the point at which any planet has frozen over completely.

This study proposed a simpler approach for estimating the habitability of exoplanets around different types of stars. The luminosity of main-sequence stars is directly related to the size and temperature of those stars. Main-sequence stars are in the process of fusing hydrogen to helium in their cores. This relationship means that their luminosities can be positively correlated to their mass and size.

Using the relationships established in this study, scaling laws can be devised for estimating the location on exoplanets that would support habitable conditions. This can be done without the necessity of performing complex climate models.

The intention of such an approach is to aid researchers in directing future observations. It is not intended to provide a substitute for the more detailed models.

A major conclusion of this work is that, generally, tidal locks on exoplanets are more likely to have habitable conditions at their star than those that have a faster rotation. These are exoplanets that are constantly in orbit around the same planet at the same distance from their star. In contrast, planets with a day-length cycle comparable to the rotation of a solar system every one to two years are less likely to be habitable when compared to Earth.

Whereas previously researchers tended to consider whether or not the entire zone would be too hot, Wandel proposed that researchers ask themselves if some part will remain cool enough.

In summary, the research has provided two potential scenarios. The first scenario is the presence of liquid water on the surface of the planet. The second scenario involves the possibility of the presence of frozen water beneath a solidified nightside of an exoplanet. This could occur even though the conditions at the surface may be entirely extreme.

Two parameters are established as frames for this study. One of these is the Heating Factor, which incorporates stellar energy, surface reflectivity (albedo), and greenhouse warming. The other is the Heat Transport Fraction, which describes how much incoming energy is distributed uniformly across the planet.

In the case of various heavenly bodies, drastically different ratios exist with respect to heat transport. For instance, with regard to Mars, close to 85 percent of the energy that is absorbed by Mars is distributed globally. On the other hand, Mercury absorbs nearly 100 percent of its received energy. There is little to no global redistribution of that energy.

Utilizing moderate heat transport values, the author deduces that liquid water on the night side of a planet could remain viable for many planets. This would apply to planets that receive multiple times the solar energy received by Earth.

Additionally, according to the research, a tidally locked planet could occupy an orbit nearly three times closer to the parent star than the inner boundary defined by conservative estimates. It could still maintain liquid water on its night side.

Before establishing a definition for habitability linked to location or distance, the author Wandel established definitions for habitability that were based instead on heating. This heating refers to energy input produced from incoming stellar energy. It represents the amount of energy reaching the planet from its parent star. It also includes the surface reflectivity (albedo) and the greenhouse warming effect.

With the heating-based model of habitability, habitability is defined by the extent to which a planet falls within the range of temperature between freezing and boiling. This range is related to its surroundings. All of this holds true in locations that are permanently covered by ice. It also applies in regions where there is water below the planet's surface.

This study proposed various atmospheric patterns. Examples include hot day-side and cool night-side waters.

There are also other important findings from this research that have implications for searching for extrasolar planets. Based on previous studies, M-dwarf systems are easier to study than other types of stars. Thus, the findings of this research indicate that many more planets orbiting M-dwarfs will likely contain water.

If scientists do not have access to the atmospheric data of the exoplanets, the study suggests using infrared measurements of the exoplanets. This can serve as a method of testing for the presence of exoplanets with substantial atmospheres.

In this situation, scientists can use the heat transport to determine whether the basic atmospheric condition has a significant effect on the temperatures on the day and night sides. If the pattern, or heat transport subsystem, can be identified, then it supports the idea that a significant amount of atmosphere exists.

Finally, the recent discoveries of water vapour on close-in planets may suggest that there may be night-side or subsurface oceans of water on the planets. These are exoplanets orbiting stars. If this holds true, this would support an even broader definition of habitability than the currently accepted definition.

According to Wandel, based on the research findings, there may be far more potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs and K-dwarfs than was previously theorized by conservative model estimates. In fact, the difference in potentially habitable exoplanets between M-dwarfs and Sun-like stars could be as great as a factor of 50.



Research findings are available online in the Astrophysical Journal.

Alexis Wilkins rubbishes conspiracy theories concerning her relationship and insists: ‘I've never been to Israel. There's not a stamp in my passport'

Alexis Wilkins, the girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel, has denied being an Israeli spy tasked with ensnaring her partner in a “honey trap,” as baseless conspiracy theories about their relationship continue to swirl online.

Wilkins, 27, a conservative pundit and country singer, has already sued three right-wing influencers for promoting the lie about her relationship with Patel, 45, which also attracted controversy last year after it was reported he had used a government jet to travel to watch her sing at a wrestling event.

Asked about her alleged Mossad connection in a new interview with Vanity Fair, Wilkins reportedly rolled her eyes and answered: “It was widespread character assassination. People assume that because you're already public, absolutely everything about you is fair game. The input is unimaginable. I've never been to Israel. There's not a stamp in my passport.”

She speculated that the falsehood might have arisen from her past work with PragerU, whose CEO, Marissa Streit, has claimed to have served in the Israeli military's spying arm.

“They're like, ‘Well, Marissa must have just gotten surgery to look like someone else, and this is now Alexis, and they placed her with Kash,'” Wilkins said. 

“It's just very confusing to me. That was a theory that was more widespread than I was comfortable with it being because that's insane. How are this many people thinking this is true?”

When Vanity Fair suggested to Wilkins that she may be at least partly responsible for the climate of misinformation she now finds herself a victim of – she having previously promoted President Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 presidential election and other untruths about Covid-19, January 6, and the war in Ukraine – she answered dismissively.

“I don't think it's a straight line back to Trump or his ascent or his presidency,” Wilkins said. “I think that we have arrived at a unique time in politics where people have so much information, they can look up anything.”

She previously denied the Israel allegation in good humor during an appearance on SiriusXM's The Megyn Kelly Show last July, saying that she was “shocked” when she first heard it, but was more concerned by the fact that: “It's accusing me of manipulating the person that I'm with, that I love. You know, that's a horrible accusation.”

Pressed by Kelly “for the record” on whether or not she was an operative for a foreign government, she laughed and said: “Definitely not. That is a firm ‘no' on that front.”

She and Patel also previously discussed their “love story” on a MAGA podcast hosted by Katie Miller, wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller, which had the misfortune to drop in mid-December when the bureau was engaged in a manhunt for the person behind the shooting at Brown University.

The episode's timing attracted criticism, notably from Laura Loomer, and only reinforced the perception that the FBI is “rudderless” under Patel's command and that he is “in over his head.”

Elsewhere in the Vanity Fair interview, Wilkins discussed her experience growing up in the U.K., Switzerland, and Arkansas, and reflected on the often surreal and occasionally disturbing nature of being in a relationship with the director of the FBI.

“We had a beautiful Christmas with family, which was wonderful and normal and good to make some normal, great family memories,” she said. “Then someone got arrested for threatening to execute me. It's scary. There's no point at which you get used to that or that it feels good.”

She added that she felt people have gone after her as a means of attacking Patel, commenting, “I think it's sad that people have figured out that they can try to use me to get to him in the press.

“I don't have a lot of skeletons in my closet. I'm not someone who hopes that something doesn't come out.”

Asked about having to have a security detail, Wilkins said: “It's definitely strange. Everyone's doing their best to make it as normal as possible because, contrary to what seems to get reported, it's not the most comfortable thing, especially when you're not someone who… I'm not doing a job that warrants it. 

“It was determined – outside of Kash and I, agents who are experts at this stuff – that that was necessary. And so here we are.”

Elon Musk has provided the world with a shocking update on the possibility of there being alien life beyond Earth.

It's an age-old question that still remains unanswered - is there life outside of our planet?

Despite extensive efforts, experts still haven't been able to conclusively find any evidence but many people believe extraterrestrial life could exist.

In recent years, billionaire Musk has also set his sights on the stars, with hopes for his space firm SpaceX to establish permanent bases on both the Moon and Mars.

And now, the tech mogul has spoken out at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to give people an update on his thoughts about intelligent life possibly being out there in space.

During a conversation the billionaire had with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk joked that he is often asked whether there are aliens among us, adding: “And I'll say that I am one. They don't believe me.”

He continued: “The bottom line is, I think we need to assume that life and consciousness is extremely rare and it might only be us and if that's the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished.”

Musk has previously said that he believes SpaceX could achieve ‘self sustaining life' on Mars in the next 20 to 30 years.

Speaking out last year, he said: “Starship is the first rocket that has the potential to make life multi-planetary, make us a multi-planet civilization for the first time in the history of Earth and that's truly profound.”

The billionaire added: “We are going to be able to take astronauts to Mars, in fact we want to take anyone who goes to Mars and ultimately build a self-sustaining civilization on Mars.

“That is the long-term goal of the company, to make life multi-planetary.”

SpaceX anticipates that Starship will have the ability to travel 140 million miles to the Red Planet in a journey time of six months.

It is also hoped that it will be capable of refueling there before making the return trip.

This will be done by ‘leveraging Mars' natural H2O and CO2 resources to refuel on the surface of Mars'.

According to the SpaceX site: “Mars is about half again as far from the Sun as Earth is, so it still has decent sunlight. It is a little cold, but we can warm it up.

“Its atmosphere is primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other trace elements, which means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere.”

Silver Spring Stage presents the local debut of “Enough To Let the Light In,” a 2022 play by Paloma Nozicka that blends human drama with the supernatural. Director Rob Gorman explores the play's complex themes in a recent Q&A, highlighting its psychological twists and chilling, suspenseful conclusion.

Source of the Spring: This play has only two characters. Tell us a little about each of them.

Rob Gorman: Cynthia is played by Katherine Leiden. She's an artist who had a thriving career until something we about learn through the play, some event happened, that made her, essentially, retire from producing art. She was a high-powered artist, and she's now working at art store.

Marc, who is played by Shampa Basu, is a psychiatrist. She met Cynthia on a dating app. The play begins when they have been dating for about six months.

Source: The play is set on an important night for their relationship, a declaration of greater seriousness and commitment.

Gorman: Yes, and it also contains a lot of secrets. It seems to start pretty straightforwardly, but we learn at least one of these characters is holding a number of secrets she wants to reveal but is struggling to reveal. One of the things that makes the play so fascinating [is] we see the other sides of the person come out, and they come out in oblique ways, like when they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Cynthia has a reason to want to play, to reveal something, but it does not work out how she hopes.

So we learn a lot about them right from the start, but then the onion starts to peel back and we learn much more.

Source: Do you see Cynthia or Marc as driving more of the action than the other? Or are they basically equals?

Gorman: I do see Marc as the one who is, to some extent, driving the relationship. She very much loves Cynthia and she sees in Cynthia hope for her future, for having love in her future. She wants so desperately to lock that in.

Cynthia is more reserved and reactive. I guess Marc takes a little more of the traditional role of the pursuer and the one who has a protective aura about her. Cynthia at least on the surface comes across as a little more reactive and fragile, in a sense. But she's very, very resilient and very strong and capable.

Source: Why did you pick each of the actors for their roles?

Gorman: I considered Shampa for both parts (I think she knows this!) because she has the range. Marc's character can be serious and professional and controlling, with a maternal vibe to her. But she can also be very light and smiley and fun, and she brings a sense of joy. It's hard to find someone who can bring that entire range.

I've seen Katherine [Cynthia] in other shows. She has a magnetic personality on stage and a great stage presence. I'm extremely fortunate in real life that she is an artist and [that experience] resonates with her character in ways I had not guessed before casting her. She brings some lived experience that is unteachable.

Source: There are a lot of conflicts in the play between these two obviously loving people. To name a few, there's belief or disbelief in God; the value or lack thereof of counseling and psychological therapy; high career ambitions vs. giving up a career; and their versions of reality. Pick one and tell us how you see it.

Gorman: To me, the biggest conflict in the play – and it's one that I think is relatable to people, especially these days – is when one person expresses a belief in what somebody else finds unbelievable. This happens so often in today's society, whether about a political conviction, or how life works, or religion, or whatever other issue. The other person says, not only do I not believe that, but I don't even know if I can connect with you as a human any more because of the things you are telling me you believe.

Source: In this play, that belief on the part of Cynthia is really unusual.

Gorman: The conflict comes when you love someone tremendously and think you know them, and they reveal something about themselves that is so true to their core beliefs that it makes you rethink everything about them. How can you accept that person when they present something that you can't understand?

Cynthia is unwavering in her belief … but it seems completely impossible to Marc. It really makes Marc think, I love this person, but do I know them at all?

Source: The two characters are lesbians in a long-term relationship. You're a straight, married man directing this play. Did that cause any issues?

Gorman: When you come to Silver Spring Stage with a proposal, you come with a particular show, and you explain that you want to direct it, and why. Generally, if the play is selected, it's a package deal: the director and play. But they can accept the play and not the director, or the other way around.

With that said, the play-reading committee did ask me essentially that question. I told them I don't think it's about lesbians or the lesbian experience. Its core is not about being a woman with a same-sex partner. This play could have been about a straight couple, and Marc could have been a guy. It would be slightly different, not enormously.

“Enough To Let the Light In” is about all these other things. It's about belief. How do we respond when we think we know somebody, and we realize maybe we don't? And it's about trauma and how we process it. None of that is specific to the lesbian experience. It's about the humanity.

They say 80% of good directing is good casting. I'm very fortunate to be working with Shampa and Katherine, and I hope the experience has been equally positive for them.

“Enough To Let the Light In” debuts on Friday, January 23, and runs through Sunday, February 8. Tickets are $25-$28, including fees, and available online at ssstage.org.

   00:54 EST 23 Jan 2026, updated  03:41 EST 23 Jan 2026    By CHRIS MELORE, US ASSISTANT SCIENCE EDITOR  

An off-the-grid explorer has spotted a mysterious UFO-shaped aircraft flying over the top secret US military base Area 51.

Anders Otteson, a self-described backpacker and videographer, was documenting his trip to the desert surrounding the infamous Nevada facility on January 14 when the unidentified craft was seen flying overhead at around 3am local time (6am ET).

Otteson had already seen what appeared to be a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber flying over Area 51 two hours earlier and noted that this craft was shaped more like an 'equilateral triangle,' which UFO researchers have called the 'Dorito.'

Moreover, a scanner monitoring Area 51's unencrypted radio frequencies picked up a bizarre transmission full of code words themed around beer, food, and snacks instead of standard military jargon.

Otteson noted that this isn't the first time the mystery aircraft has been seen flying over the US.

Twice in 2014, photographers caught the same Dorito-shaped object on camera, revealing that the craft looked nothing like the US military's current stealth bomber planes or known drones.

Area 51 has been involved in the development and testing of revolutionary and experimental aircraft for decades, including the F-117 Nighthawk, America's first stealth bomber.

The explorer claimed that the latest sighting of the Dorito adds to recent reports of triangle-shaped objects seen over Southern California and Death Valley, near the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) where Area 51 sits.

On his Uncanny Expeditions YouTube channel, Otteson said he was camping in the Tikaboo Valley of the Nevada desert, on public land near Groom Lake Road, which overlooks Area 51's restricted airspace and front gate area when the Dorito appeared.

Around 1am local time, he spotted and filmed what appeared to be the B-2 flying overhead from the northwest, which had allegedly originated from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.

Hours later, Otteson observed the second aircraft performing a low flyover from the northwest, passing directly over his position before continuing onward.

The Dorito triangle's flight path was consistent with a low-altitude pass over the area like other military aircraft, though the explorer wasn't able to determine its exact heading. 

Although the B-2 has a similar V-wing design, the Dorito had a drastically different body, with a noticeably flatter trailing edge, no wings, or jagged rear section like the stealth bomber.

'Are we looking at a classified test flight or run-of-the-mill training sortie?' Otteson said. 'I certainly think we have something interesting here.'

The mystery sighting over Area 51 played out very much like the Dorito sightings in 2014; one captured by photographer Jeff Templin in Wichita, Kansas and another by photographer Steve Douglas in Amarillo, Texas.

Both showed similar unidentified triangle-shaped aircraft that looked unlike known Air Force planes or drones. The main difference was this new incident took place over a base infamously tied to UFO sightings since the 1950s.

As for the strange radio code picked up on fellow UFO researcher Joerg Arnu's scanner, military personnel at Area 51 were heard using words such as 'pretzel snack,' 'corona pretzel snacks zero with cheese,' 'profile Michelob,' 'Imperial with garlic,' and 'fridge hydrate' to mask what they were saying.

While the familiar flight path of the Dorito and the military code words point to the craft being a manmade aircraft, triangle-shaped UFOs have been a frequent sighting over the US for decades.

According to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), there have been 10 UFO sightings throughout the US in January that mention a triangle-shaped object flying overhead.

Unlike the Dorito over Area 51 hover, the UFOs has bright or flashing lights that could be seen clearly by witnesses on the ground.

Overall, there have been 85 triangle-shaped UFO reports since November 2025 throughout the world, including in the UK, Canada, Germany, and Brazil.

Dolcy D'Cruz

‘The Twisted Child' marks Goan author Mario Coelho's return to short fiction two years after ‘Moonlight And Shadow', his first collection of unsettling tales for adults. His new book comprises 12 short stories that move into the terrain of mystery and the supernatural, dark, but not quite horror. Set in Goa, the stories are populated by recognisable characters and everyday situations, drawing readers in through familiarity before leading them towards the unexpected. The stories are dark but not frightening, each with a twist as Mario strikes that balance as a writer. “Some of the stories are a little frightening, but not so much that they'll keep you awake at night. I myself don't mind reading stories that are a little scary, but I shy away from downright horror. I don't want to have nightmares when I sleep,” says Mario. Each story can be read on its own, but all are closely tied to Goa and its surroundings with characters that most readers would relate to, whether a village drunkard, a hardworking toddy tapper or the elderly woman living alone in her heritage home. Published by Goa 1556, several stories in ‘The Twisted Child' are inspired by experiences shared with Mario by friends, acquaintances and even strangers. Once a sceptic, he admits these encounters forced him to reconsider his disbelief in the supernatural. “I never used to believe in ghosts, but after listening to people, both friends and strangers, who've spoken of their supernatural experiences, I've had to do a rethink. And many of the stories were so fascinating that I had to weave them into a story of my own. It would have been such a waste if I hadn't. Usually, I take the basic experience that the person has had, and weave a completely different story from that experience, as I did with the title story ‘The Twisted Child'. Imagination has a lot to do with this process, and that is simply a gift; I don't take any credit for it.” Known for his children's books ‘Daksh, the Dancing Dragon' and ‘The Cats Who Loved to Dance', this is Mario's second collection of stories after ‘Moonlight and Shadow.' Speaking about why mystery and the supernatural as genres remain underexplored locally, Mario explains, “I've been reading the works of Goan writers like Tino D'Sa, José Lourenço, Sheela Jaywant and Kaustubh Naik, to name a few. These are all immensely talented and entertaining writers. From Mangalore, Dr Geralyn Pinto's writing, is extraordinary. Much of Goan writing, including the works of Damodar Mauzo (Bhai) is what I would call ‘slice of life' or vignettes of Goan culture and society. You can smell the earth in their stories, taste the tang of curry and spice, and inhale the fragrance of the soil after the first rains. But as to why mystery and the supernatural are largely unexplored genres in Goan writing, the honest answer to that is: I don't know. Maybe I alone have a dark soul, who knows?” Mario began writing seriously at the age of 46. Despite the challenges of publishing, he says “It is easier to know the mind of the Almighty than that of a top publishing house.” Looking ahead, Mario has no shortage of plans. “Tentatively titled ‘Avigail – Tales of a Darker Night' is another book of tales with a twist. In April or May this year, HarperCollins will be bringing out a book, written by me, on the Vikram & Betaal mythological series. We are thinking of calling it ‘Betaal Pachchisi'. These will comprise 25 stories, written almost entirely in verse, and profusely illustrated,” he informs. What keeps him going is simple and honest. “First, the fact that I'm putting my talent to good use. Secondly, that I'm entertaining people. Thirdly, the fact that someday I'll be widely read and well known; fame and recognition are important to me. And lastly, that I am weaving or crafting narratives, whether children's stories or dark tales, which are of a certain quality. That is the most important thing to me, above everything else,” concludes Mario. (Mario Coelho will launch his latest book, ‘The Twisted Child: Tales of the Unexpected', at Broadway Book Centre, Panjim, on Thursday, January 29 at 5 pm. The event will also feature a session titled The Art and Craft of the Short Story, with speakers Tino de Sa, Sheela Jaywant, Bina Nayak, José Lourenço and Mario Coelho.)

We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it. When we can recognize what's pushing us — in our personal lives and as a society — we already have a degree of freedom from it.

It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that brings these injustices to light—fueling open dialogue and constructive action.

A concise essay explores the core reasons there is so much corruption and manipulation in our world and gives inspiring ideas on what we can do to create a brighter future.  

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. 

Don't lose hope. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Here's one paragraph of this poetic writing. 

"Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good."

In Montana, a focus on restorative justice is reducing juvenile recidivism through a nonprofit program that engages them, rather than punishes them. The nonprofit believes that it's actually far more challenging for juvenile offenders to look their victims in the eye and explain why they behaved antisocially than it is to simply serve a suspension from school, where they're distanced from friends and mentors, and often fall behind in their education. The Center for Restorative Youth Justice (CRYJ), is not a new organization, but their influence in Montana is growing. CRYJ receives referrals from Youth Court probation officers, school administrators, or school resource officers made on behalf of a juvenile offender who's broken the law. CRYJ then has a conference with the youth and their parent or guardian, and creates a tailormade program of restorative justice. This can involve peer group discussion, victim-offender meetings, and other situations where the youth is given the forum to reestablish a relationship with the community, rather than something like a school suspension. CRYJ believes that by limiting the overuse of exclusionary discipline and emphasizing a community-driven approach, it can help at-risk youth avoid falling behind in school. We spend a lot of time separating people after there's been harm, but often the deepest healing and learning and moving forward can happen ... when we can actually come together and talk about what happened and how to make things right.

You do not need to believe in ghosts to get hooked on Spooky Time Paranormal at RealSpookyTime on YouTube, but you might start wondering if something unexplained is lurking just around the corner.

The creators behind the channel are Logan Countians Matthew Tinsley, Austin Yewell, Zack Peck, Easton May, and Jared Diehl. They say the name of their channel started as nothing more than a running joke among friends.

“Halloween has always been my favorite time,” Tinsley said. “I would constantly say, ‘It's finally spooky time,' and eventually everyone else picked it up. The joke just stuck and it became the perfect name.”

The idea to take paranormal investigating seriously goes back even further to a night they still talk about.

“We were just hanging out at this house nearby,” Tinsley said, speaking for the others in Spooky Time as well as himself. “Totally normal night until suddenly it was not. Something happened that none of us could explain and it is one of those moments that sticks with you forever. That is really when we realized the paranormal might be more real than we thought.”

From that night on, the group decided to explore those questions together. They describe their style on camera as a mix of honest reactions, real friendship, and the kind of nervous humor that spills out when things get too spooky.

“We are not overly serious on camera,” Tinsley admitted, “but we take the places, the history, and the people connected to these locations very seriously. Our goal has always been to show what we experience honestly while still letting our personalities shine through.”

Their travels take them all over Kentucky and Tennessee, where they say there is an endless list of historic and supposedly haunted places. They have explored everything from old hospitals and jails to sanatoriums and forgotten homes tucked deep into rural towns.

What this group loves most are the locations no one else pays attention to.

“We try to find places that have not been investigated a thousand times,” said Tinsley. “Those hidden spots usually have the best stories.”

Two of their most memorable recent projects include their investigation of the Capitol Theatre in Bowling Green, where they later hosted a public premiere and a trip into an abandoned coal mine in eastern Kentucky.

“The mine really stuck with us,” said Tinsley. “You walk in and immediately feel the history. It meant everything to that small community. Even though it has been shut down for years, people still talk about it with pride. That kind of emotional weight is powerful.”

For Spooky Time Paranormal, history is what guides every investigation.

“Before we ever step inside a building, we research everything we can,” Tinsley explained. “If you do not understand the history, you miss the context behind the activity people report.” That is especially true, they said, in places like Logan County. “Areas with deep roots and long histories have stories layered into them. You feel that before you ever pick up a camera." 

During investigations, the members tend to use tools that allow for interactive moments, especially the spirit box. “Some of our funniest moments come from that thing,” said Tinsley. “Sometimes the responses match exactly what we are asking and sometimes we just look at each other like, ‘What did it just say?' It is chaos, but fun chaos.”

Behind the scenes, this fun group of gentlemen take preparation seriously.

“People think we just show up somewhere creepy and start filming,” Tinsley joked. “No. There is planning, research, talking to property managers, safety guidelines, walkthroughs, everything.”

They say safety always comes first, especially when working in old structures with unknown hazards. Respect is another major priority.

According to Tinsley and the others, these sites matter to people and they treat every location like it belongs to someone who cares deeply about it. They are not there to make a mess or stir things up. They are there to tell its story even if that means freaking out on camera a little.

Support from viewers across Kentucky and Tennessee has been better than the men ever expected.

Friends, family, strangers online—everyone has been incredible, according to the group. They also welcome skeptics.

“We get it. Honestly, we were skeptics ourselves before we started doing this. We do not expect everyone to believe what we believe. We just like when people watch and ask questions," Tinsley said.

Preserving and sharing local history has become one of the strongest parts of their mission.

The spooky fellas add that a lot of locations already come with legends or rumors. Some of it is true, some is not, but every story says something about the people who lived there.

The Capitol Theatre in Bowling Green is a perfect example, according to the spooky team. “People whispered about it being haunted for years. Getting invited in to explore it and then getting to show our findings to the public meant a lot to us,” they said.

Looking ahead, the team hopes to focus more on their own community.

“Logan County is filled with stories we grew up hearing,” said Tinsley. “Some of these legends have been around forever but have not been looked into the way we do it on our channel. We would love to change that.”

The spooky sleuths believe paranormal stories stick around in small towns because they become part of shared identity. “In places like this, stories get passed down. It keeps everyone curious. And honestly, that curiosity is what keeps us doing what we do. We want to understand the stories people have been whispering about for generations,” Tinsley said.

For Matthew, Austin, Zack, Easton, and Jared, the heart of Spooky Time will always be the same: real friendship, real reactions, local history, and a deep respect for the communities who trust them with their stories.

Whenever the team investigates somewhere, especially in Logan County, they want people to know they are treating it with care. They are there to document, explore, and tell these stories the right way.

Whether you believe in ghosts or not, watching them explore these old theaters, coal mines, and hidden corners makes you feel like you are right there with them, holding your breath, laughing, and wondering if maybe, just maybe, there is something out there waiting to be discovered.
