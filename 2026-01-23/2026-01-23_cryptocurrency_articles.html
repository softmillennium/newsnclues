with @PalmerLuckey @cdixon

In this special episode — our 100th on the a16z crypto show! — Chris Dixon interviews Palmer Luckey (founder of Anduril; founder of Oculus VR and designer of the Oculus Rift) to talk about the future of technology, belief, and building.

What does it take to build hardware at scale? Where are many of today's tech bottlenecks? And what's the case for optimism about the future despite growing geopolitical turmoil, regulatory constraints, and other blockers to innovation? The candid, wide-ranging conversation covers crypto, banking, and stablecoins, as well as modern warfare, the U.S.–China technology race, AI and manufacturing, and much more.

Dixon also digs into company building in good times and bad with Luckey; the conversation was recorded live at our Founders Summit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swiss banking giant UBS Group AG will open up crypto investing to some of its private banking clients, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg. UBS's clout grew significantly in 2023 when Swiss authorities forced the bank to merge with Credit Suisse after years of scandals had eroded confidence in the 167-year-old lender. In 2021, Credit Suisse experienced two big failures: A $5.5 billion loss after the Archegos Capital family office imploded, and a $10 billion loss when Greensill Capital supply-chain financing was frozen. When the rushed deal was done, UBS saw its assets under management jump by roughly $1.5 trillion almost overnight. After that, it might then be rolled out to the Asia-Pacific region. The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt. And Ethereum has dipped to $2,967 after having sunk 10% since last week. Switzerland has become one of Europe's more accommodating jurisdictions for crypto businesses. In November, the Swiss National Bank quietly increased its Bitcoin exposure. Swiss banks told Reuters at the time that there had been an uptick in inbound requests from U.S. companies looking abroad for banking partners.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DAVOS, SWITZERLAND — January 23, 2026: The World Economic Forum's annual meeting underwent a dramatic transformation this year as artificial intelligence executives and conversations dominated the Alpine gathering, fundamentally reshaping what has traditionally been a forum for global economic and political dialogue. This year's Davos meeting saw AI topics consistently overshadow traditional WEF pillars including climate change mitigation, global poverty reduction, and geopolitical stability talks, marking what many observers describe as a pivotal moment in the forum's five-decade history. The physical transformation of Davos began with prominent storefront takeovers by technology giants. Meta and Salesforce established highly visible installations along the main promenade, creating immersive experiences that drew constant crowds of attendees. These leaders didn't merely participate in discussions—they actively shaped the agenda with public criticisms of international trade policies, warnings about potential AI investment bubbles, and bold predictions about the industry's trajectory. Observers noted that the traditional balance between public and private sector voices shifted noticeably toward technology leadership. Where previous forums featured equal representation between government officials and corporate executives, this year's conversations frequently centered on how AI development should proceed rather than whether it should be regulated. This substantive shift extended beyond session selection to include the nature of conversations themselves, with AI safety, alignment research, and computational governance emerging as dominant themes where macroeconomic policy once prevailed. AI startup Humans& secured a $480 million seed funding round despite having no commercial product on the market—a development that would have been unthinkable just three years earlier. The Humans& funding exemplifies a broader trend in AI investment patterns. Venture capital firms increasingly prioritize founding team credentials and technological vision over traditional metrics like revenue or user growth. This shift reflects both the extraordinary capital requirements of AI development and investor belief that early positioning in foundational AI technologies will yield substantial returns as the market matures. However, some Davos participants expressed concerns about this approach, noting that similar investment patterns preceded previous technology bubbles. First, the increased visibility of AI executives at traditionally policy-focused forums suggests growing recognition that technological development cannot be separated from broader societal considerations. Second, the substantial funding flowing to pre-product AI companies indicates investor belief that current development cycles justify unprecedented risk-taking. Third, the public nature of policy criticisms from AI leadership marks a departure from previous corporate approaches to regulation, suggesting more direct engagement with governance processes moving forward. Several specific developments emerged from Davos discussions that will likely shape the industry throughout 2026: First, the shift toward AI discussions reflects genuine technological progress rather than mere hype—foundational models have reached capabilities that justify serious policy attention. Third, the substantial funding flowing to pre-revenue AI companies indicates investor belief that current development windows create unique opportunities for first-mover advantages in what may become defining technologies of the coming decade. The concentration of both conversation and investment in artificial intelligence could divert attention from other critical global challenges. Additionally, the substantial funding for companies without products raises questions about investment discipline and potential market corrections. Finally, the increased corporate influence on policy discussions at traditionally multilateral forums may complicate efforts to establish balanced governance frameworks that consider diverse stakeholder perspectives. A second wave emerged during the 2010s with the rise of social media and platform companies, though these firms typically participated within broader business delegations rather than as primary conversation drivers. This historical progression reveals important patterns about technology's integration into global economic discussions. The 2026 emphasis on artificial intelligence specifically reflects recognition that AI represents not just another technological advancement but potentially a fundamental shift in economic production, labor markets, and innovation processes—topics that naturally align with the World Economic Forum's mission to address global challenges. The 2026 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos demonstrated how thoroughly AI CEOs transformed the gathering from its traditional focus on macroeconomic policy and global challenges to a technology-forward conference centered on artificial intelligence's development and implications. The AI industry's growing influence at traditionally policy-focused forums suggests we have entered a new phase in technology's relationship with global governance, one where technical development and societal consideration increasingly intersect at the highest levels of economic discussion. Q2: What was significant about the Humans& funding round mentioned in Davos discussions?The $480 million seed round for pre-product AI startup Humans& represents one of the largest seed investments in technology history and signals investor confidence in founding teams with strong research credentials from companies like Anthropic, Google, and xAI, despite the absence of traditional metrics like revenue or user growth. Q3: Did traditional Davos topics like climate change disappear completely?Traditional topics remained on the official agenda but received significantly less attention and engagement compared to AI-focused sessions. Climate change and poverty reduction discussions continued but no longer dominated conversations as they have in previous years. Q4: What are the potential risks of AI dominating global economic forums?Potential risks include diversion of attention from other critical challenges, excessive influence by corporate perspectives on governance discussions, investment patterns that may not reflect sustainable market fundamentals, and reduced diversity of viewpoints in policy formulation. Unlike dot-com era or social media company presence, AI executives in 2026 actively shaped both formal and informal agendas rather than simply participating in existing discussions, reflecting the technology's perceived fundamental importance to economic futures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An inactive Ethereum whale has just re-entered the trading scene, withdrawing over $15 million worth of ETH in just a single day. Considering Ethereum's slow price growth over the past few months and the whale's sudden appearance despite being dormant for months, there could be a possibility of insider trading. A sudden $15.14 million Ethereum transaction has caught the crypto market's attention, with the move either driven by insider knowledge or simple strategic positioning. According to data from blockchain analytics platform, Onchain Lens, the transfer shifted approximately 5,099 ETH from a dormant wallet address on Kraken into active circulation on Thursday, January 22. The anonymous whale had initiated multiple million-dollar trades in UETH, USDT, and USDC. After withdrawing 5,099 ETH from Kraken, Arkham Intelligence reported that the whale had transferred the ETH to Lido Finance, converting it into 5,100 STETH. Typically, insider trading in crypto occurs when individuals with non-public information make large transactions ahead of major market events that could influence market price. Currently, there has been no spike in Ethereum's price, nor any major news that could suddenly affect its movements. In fact, ETH continues to trade lower, down by roughly 1.7% over the past 24 hours. Its daily trading volume is also down by 34.89%, signaling reduced confidence among traders and investors. While dormant large-scale players are suddenly re-entering the market, some active whales remain bullish on Ethereum's long-term prospects despite its ongoing downtrend. According to well-known market analyst Max Crypto, an anonymous whale has just opened a $202 million long position in ETH with 15x leverage. Market participants are closely watching the whales' positioning, with some calling it a brave but chaotic bet. Others have even speculated that the position may have been taken based on insider information, fueling discussions about potential market moves and a possible bullish turnaround for ETH.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and serves as the foundational infrastructure for decentralized applications, smart contracts, decentralized finance, and non-fungible tokens. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a store of value and settlement layer, Ethereum operates as a programmable blockchain that allows developers to build and deploy applications without centralized intermediaries. From a macro perspective, Ethereum remains sensitive to global liquidity conditions, real interest rates, and overall risk appetite. Periods of easing financial conditions and expanding liquidity tend to support higher valuations across crypto assets, while tightening cycles often pressure speculative positioning. Recent sentiment has been mixed as markets balance expectations around central bank policy, regulatory clarity in the United States, and ongoing discussions around Ethereum scaling upgrades and network efficiency. Headlines related to spot ETF flows, regulatory enforcement actions, or significant protocol upgrades can quickly shift sentiment and short-term positioning. Bitcoin often leads directional moves, with Ethereum following at a higher beta. However, Ethereum can outperform during periods when attention shifts toward smart contract platforms and decentralized finance growth. Relative to other large cap altcoins such as Solana and XRP, Ethereum is viewed as more institutionally established, though it can lag faster moving narratives tied to transaction speed or payments focused use cases. • Market has been in a large multi-year sideways range between the 4000 and 2300 area since December 2024. • However, the market was unable to accept above the 4000 level and subsequently, rotated back toward the 3800 to 4000 zone where buyers and sellers engaged in a prolonged battle between 3750 (bid block 1 high) and 4250 (offer block 1 low), forming offer block 2 in October 2025 • Buyers attempted to defend this region while sellers stepped down offers, eventually forcing long liquidation as price auctioned lower. • In November 2025, buyers responded at the yearly VWAP, but sellers continued to apply pressure and prices rotated further down toward bid block 1, where buyers once again stepped in. • Since November 2025, the market has balanced in a two-way auction between 3500 (daily level 2), and 2700 (daily level 3), with sellers defending at offer block 2 and buyers defending at bid block 1. • Since the start of 2026, price has tested lower, crossed above the yearly VWAP to print new highs, and has since rotated back to chop around VWAP. • Flat VWAP would continue to signal market indecision and acceptance of current value. • Acceptance above 3500 could open a move toward 3800 and potentially extend to the 4100 area. • Responsive sellers are expected at offer block 2, which may slow or cap upside momentum. • If sellers begin holding below range mid and VWAP, it would suggest that downside control is developing. Ethereum remains technically balanced while macro forces continue to dictate broader risk sentiment. Flat VWAP and sustained two-way trade suggest the market is waiting for a catalyst, whether from liquidity conditions, regulatory clarity, or renewed institutional flows. A decisive move beyond the current range will likely require both technical acceptance and supportive macro alignment, making patience and level awareness critical in the weeks ahead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto researcher Axel has provided insights into why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices are still crashing. Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Prices Are Still Crashing In a research report, Axel noted that anomalous exchange inflows accompanied the BTC breakdown below the $90,000 zone as sellers prepared in advance. As such, there is a possibility that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices will decline further. Further commenting on Bitcoin netflows into exchanges, Axel noted that between January 20 and 21, almost 17,000 BTC flowed into exchanges, coinciding with BTC dropping to as low as $87,000, while Ethereum and Solana prices also dropped. The crypto researcher explained that these anomalously high values followed a period of predominantly negative netflow in the first half of this month. In the context of the falling Bitcoin price, Axel stated that such a spike is more likely to reflect supply preparation than neutral transfers. In other words, the breakdown below $90,000 appears to be structural rather than emotional. Meanwhile, Bitcoin netflow returned to neutral levels yesterday, but the accumulated inflow still creates a supply overhang, which could lead to further declines in the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Axel noted that a signal of improvement would be if netflow turns negative again amid rising prices, which could indicate that the overhang has cleared. However, with the short-term holders' 7-day SMA SOPR below 0.996, the crypto researcher suggested that BTC faces increased selling pressure on every recovery as these holders look to sell at breakeven. In its latest research report, on-chain analytics platform Glassnode explained that a Bitcoin rally above $100,000 looks unlikely for now as the supply overhang persists. They noted how this overhang supply above $98,000 remains the dominant sell-side force capping short to mid-term rebounds. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US prosecutors have formally dropped their case against former OpenSea manager Nathaniel Chastain following an appeals court reversal that dismantled what was once positioned as the first NFT insider trading prosecution in American history. The decision closes a chapter that began in June 2022 when Chastain was arrested and charged with wire fraud and money laundering for using confidential information to purchase NFTs before they were featured on OpenSea's homepage. Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton, a former SEC chair, told the federal court that prosecutors would not retry the case given Chastain had already served three months in prison and agreed not to contest forfeiture of 15.98 ETH worth $47,330. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that jurors were improperly told they could convict Chastain based solely on unethical behavior rather than actual theft of property with commercial value. The appeals panel sharply criticized jury instructions that permitted conviction based on violations of “broad notions of honesty and fair play,” warning such standards could criminalize nearly any deceptive act. The court found the featured NFT data was not monetized by OpenSea and was not treated internally as a valuable asset, making it too “ethereal” to qualify as property under federal wire fraud statutes. After tokens were featured and prices increased, he sold them at two- to five-times profit using anonymous wallets. US Attorney Damian Williams had described the case as a warning to digital asset markets when announcing charges. “NFTs might be new, but this type of criminal scheme is not,” Williams said. “As alleged, Nathaniel Chastain betrayed OpenSea by using its confidential business information to make money for himself.“ More than 300 defense attorneys had filed letters supporting dismissal, arguing that treating confidential business information as property would “criminalize a broad swath of conduct.“ The agency has dismissed multiple high-profile cases including those against Coinbase, Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland DRW. At that time, OpenSea founder Devin Finzer called the closure “a win for everyone who is creating and building in our space.“ Get dialed in every Tuesday & Friday with quick updates on the world of crypto Get dialed in every Tuesday & Friday with quick updates on the world of crypto The information on this website is for educational purposes only, and investing carries risks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The confession arrived on LinkedIn, of all places. Lichtenstein, 38, didn't sugarcoat his past. “Ten years ago, I decided that I would hack the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world,” he wrote. It was the worst thing I had ever done,” Lichtenstein admitted. I know I disappointed a lot of people who believed in me and grossly misused my talents.” In 2016, Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, executed a scheme that drained 120,000 bitcoins from Bitfinex. At today's prices, that haul exceeds $10 billion. The couple pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy in 2023, a year after federal agents arrested them at their Manhattan apartment. He became an informant, helping the government recover the stolen cryptocurrency and consulting on additional crypto investigations. “Working with the good guys, being part of a team solving a bigger problem felt surprisingly good. His 60-month sentence took him through some of America's toughest federal facilities. To stay sharp, he devoured math textbooks in prison libraries. Earlier this month, authorities transferred him to home confinement. Lichtenstein isn't the first convicted hacker to seek redemption through legitimate security work. Kevin Mitnick, once the FBI's most-wanted computer criminal, built a respected career as a penetration tester and security consultant after his release. The path forward won't be simple. “Now begins the real challenge of regaining the community's trust,” he wrote, making his pitch to potential employers. Now I can use those same skills to stop the next billion-dollar hack.” Whether the cybersecurity industry will embrace a reformed billion-dollar thief remains an open question.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase is moving early to confront  the rise of large-scale quantum computers, a risk that still sits years away but could upend the foundations of blockchain security. The crypto exchange said in a company blog post that it is forming an independent advisory board to assess how advances in quantum computing could affect blockchains and to provide guidance to developers, users and institutions long before the technology becomes practical. Coinbase said the new Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain will bring together leading researchers in quantum science, cryptography and distributed systems to evaluate risks, publish position papers, and respond to major scientific developments as they occur. The company framed the effort as part of a long-term security strategy rather than a reaction to any immediate threat. If they can be built at sufficient scale and reliability, quantum computers are expected to solve certain mathematical problems far faster than classical machines. Those capabilities could have wide effects across industries such as finance, healthcare, materials science and national security. For blockchain systems, the concern is that many of these systems rely on cryptographic techniques that could eventually be weakened or cracked by quantum algorithms. Most major blockchains today use elliptic-curve cryptography to secure wallets and verify transactions. According to Coinbase, these systems remain secure against current computers, but a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could one day undermine them. The board includes researchers whose work spans quantum theory, applied cryptography, and blockchain security. Members include Scott Aaronson, a leading theorist in quantum computing; Dan Boneh, a specialist in modern cryptography and blockchain research; and Justin Drake, who focuses on the long-term security of blockchain networks. Other members include Sreeram Kannan, founder of EigenLayer; Yehuda Lindell, who leads cryptographic research at Coinbase; and Dahlia Malkhi, an expert in resilient distributed systems. Coinbase said a key role of the group is to provide independent insight rather than promotional endorsement. The first output from the advisory board is expected in the coming months, when it plans to release a position paper establishing a baseline assessment of quantum risk and outlining early steps toward resilience. The advisory board is one part of what Coinbase described as a broader post-quantum roadmap. At a research level, Coinbase said it is working to support post-quantum cryptographic schemes within secure multiparty computation systems. These approaches aim to distribute cryptographic trust across multiple parties, reducing the risk that a single compromised key could expose assets. One example cited by the company is ML-DSA, a type of digital signature scheme designed to remain secure even against quantum attacks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the biggest and "safest" investments in the world start to get questioned, it's necessary to take a hard look at what the idea of "safety" actually means. On that note, if major foreign holders in the European Union reduce their exposure to U.S. Treasuries as a result of the Trump administration's constant barrage of controversial actions at home and abroad, Bitcoin (BTC +1.39%) could well end up in the conversation as an alternative store of value. But the coin's recent track record suggests a far less flattering first reaction is also probable, so let's examine what's most likely to happen if a real Treasury sell-off ends up playing out. The Treasury market is among the largest in the world, with nearly $30 trillion in marketable debt outstanding, and policymakers, as well as central bankers, watch its liquidity closely because disruptions can and do ripple into other markets. Foreign investors hold about $9.4 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities in total. If foreign selling ever accelerates due to irritation with the U.S., or a lack of confidence in its economy or its leadership, all of which are risks that are currently in play, the near-term impact is usually that the stock and crypto markets pivot to being risk-off, meaning that investors pull capital from higher-risk assets and reallocate their capital to safer ones as quickly as they are able. So let's take a look at what that would do to Bitcoin. If there's a genuine Treasury sell-off, the bullish scenario is that some investors will want an asset outside any one country's control, and Bitcoin becomes a beneficiary of that preference. In theory, that would channel capital away from fiat currencies like the dollar. The channeling process could take quite a while, though. Bitcoin's correlation with the U.S. stock market can and does spike sharply from time to time, especially in times of crisis. Thus, the most likely immediate outcome of a true U.S. Treasury sell-off is that Bitcoin would drop sharply, and take a long period to recover. Over an even longer horizon, perhaps on the order of a couple of years, Bitcoin could still benefit massively if global diversification away from the U.S. dollar continues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prosecutors will not pursue a retrial after his conviction was overturned last year. Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton, who also previously served as SEC Chair, noted in a letter to the court that the government's decision factored in Chastain's partial completion of his original sentence. The former OpenSea manager served three months in federal custody and had to forfeit 15.98 ETH, valued at roughly $47,000, which prosecutors claim represented the proceeds from his NFT trades. Chastain also agreed not to challenge that forfeiture. Chastain was initially convicted in May 2023 of wire fraud and money laundering after federal prosecutors accused him of using advance knowledge of which NFT collections would be spotlighted on OpenSea's homepage to purchase them in secret before flipping them for profit. The jury found that Chastain used anonymous wallets and burner accounts to make at least 15 such trades between June and September 2021, earning around $57,000 from the scheme. He served his time later that year while preparing to appeal. The appellate court ruled that the jury had been misdirected, effectively convicting Chastain for ethical lapses rather than for fraud tied to misappropriated property with clear commercial value to his employer. Judge Steven Menashi, who was overseeing the case, concluded at the time that deceptive behaviour alone does not constitute criminal fraud without a demonstrable property interest at stake. Chastain was later released from court supervision and is now eligible to seek the return of the $50,000 fine and $200 special assessment he paid after his 2023 conviction. At one point, prosecutors also looked into whether OpenSea itself might be on the hook for Chastain's conduct. However, it later concluded that the company had acted swiftly to investigate the misconduct, requested Chastain's resignation, and cooperated with investigators throughout. Since late 2024, the US regulatory agencies have steadily backed away from their most aggressive crypto cases, as they pivoted away from their regulation-by-enforcement approach under new leadership. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission ended its yearlong investigation into OpenSea last year, which had stemmed from the same events.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LAS VEGAS (FOX5) — Las Vegas Valley businesses are accepting Bitcoin as payment as the cryptocurrency continues to grow in popularity, from restaurant chains like Steak and Shake to small businesses like a juice bar in the southwest valley. At Cane Juice Bar and Cafe on Rainbow near Windmill, district manager Tyler Peterson serves fresh pressed sugar cane juice. It can be paid for with cash, card or Bitcoin. “It's been about 8 months now that we've had Bitcoin implemented as a payment,” Peterson said. “Bitcoin is getting very popular with mainstream people, not just the people that are actually into things like cryptocurrencies… it's just something to help us move forward.” Peterson said customers who normally wouldn't know about his shop come in specifically to use Bitcoin. “So actually some customers we have generated off of accepting Bitcoin… That Bitcoin map is helping us out a lot.” Jeremy Querci, a Bitcoin consultant with Sovreign, said businesses accepting Bitcoin range from medical practices to juice bars to children's play places. “At the time of checkout, you say you want to pay in Bitcoin and the business can bring up a QR code that you scan with your phone with any Bitcoin app,” Querci said. In November, Square enabled roughly 4 million merchants across the US to accept Bitcoin payments with zero processing fees through 2026. Businesses can avoid credit card processing fees, which average 2.5 to 3.5 percent, by using Bitcoin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent pattern of transactions on the decentralized blockchain network ethereum suggests that scammers have launched an “address poisoning” campaign, CoinDesk reported Thursday (Jan. 22), citing Citi analysts. Trends on ethereum that suggest that such a campaign may be underway include a record-breaking surge in transactions and active addresses at a time when bitcoin activity has been trending lower, a large share of the transactions being worth less than $1, and low transaction fees that make it inexpensive for attackers to send out their small payments, per the report. Blockchain data firm TRM Labs said in July 2024 that an attack in May 2024 at the Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin, which led to the theft of coins valued at upwards of $300 million, may have involved an address poisoning scam. “While the exact cause of the attack remains unknown, potential vectors include stolen private keys or address poisoning — a tactic wherein attackers send tiny amounts of cryptocurrency to a victim's wallet to create fake transaction histories, potentially confusing users into sending funds to the wrong address in future transactions,” TRM Labs said at the time. FBI Denver said in April 2024 that it had seen criminals creating cryptocurrency tokens that impersonate well-known tokens but have no value and using those impersonation tokens to send to victims as part of an address poisoning attack. “Impersonation tokens increase the likelihood that address-poisoning attacks will work against both experienced and newer cryptocurrency users.” We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
