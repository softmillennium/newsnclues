                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with obesity and high blood pressure may face a higher risk of dementia, according to a new study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. Dementia is a growing global public health challenge, with no cure currently available. People with dementia experience a severe decline in mental abilities, like memory, thinking and reasoning. Dementia is a progressive brain disease that causes nerve cell damage that worsens over time, affecting memory, language, problem-solving and behavior. "In this study, we found high body mass index (BMI) and high blood pressure are direct causes of dementia," said study author Ruth Frikke-Schmidt, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Chief Physician at Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark. In the Mendelian randomization study design, common genetic variants causing high BMI are used as proxies for BMI altering medications. As active drug versus placebo is randomly assigned due to the randomization process in drug trials, and as BMI-increasing genetic variants versus neutral variants are randomly assorted from parents to offspring, the effects on the disease endpoint will be clear and not affected by confounding factors. Therefore, this strategy enabled the researchers to establish a direct causal link between high BMI and risk of dementia. Much of this increased dementia risk appeared to be driven by high blood pressure, suggesting that preventing or treating obesity and high blood pressure could help reduce dementia risk. This study shows that high body weight and high blood pressure are not just warning signs, but direct causes of dementia. "Weight-loss medication has recently been tested for halting cognitive decline in early phases of Alzheimer's disease, but with no beneficial effect. An open question that remains to be tested is if weight-loss medication initiated before the appearance of cognitive symptoms may be protective against dementia. In our latest interview, News-Medical speaks with Rosanna Zhang from ACROBiosystems about utilizing organoids for disease modeling in the field of neuroscience research. GLP-1 agonists are pivotal in obesity care, promoting weight loss and addressing related health issues, with a focus on personalized, holistic treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For more than a century, oral insulin has been considered a "dream" therapy for diabetes, hindered by enzymatic degradation in the digestive tract and the absence of a dedicated intestinal transport mechanism. Consequently, many patients must rely on daily insulin injections, which can significantly reduce their quality of life. A research team at Kumamoto University, led by Associate Professor Shingo Ito, has developed a breakthrough drug-delivery platform using a small-intestine-permeable cyclic peptide known as the DNP peptide, enabling efficient oral delivery of insulin. Unlike previous oral insulin approaches requiring very high doses (often over ten times that of an injection), this platform achieved a pharmacological bioavailability of approximately 33–41% relative to subcutaneous injection. This result demonstrates a substantial reduction in the amount of insulin needed for oral administration and marks a key step toward practical clinical use. "Insulin injections remain a daily burden for many patients," said Associate Professor Shingo Ito. Our peptide-based platform offers a new route to deliver insulin orally and may be applicable to long-acting insulin formulations and other injectable biologics." The team is now progressing toward translational studies, including evaluations in large animal models and human intestinal systems. Small Intestine-Permeable Cyclic Peptide-Based Technology Enables Efficient Oral Delivery and Glycemic Efficacy of Zinc-Stabilized Insulin Hexamer and Its Analogs in Diabetic Mice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By analyzing bowel movement frequency in more than 268,000 people, researchers uncover how thiamine-processing genes shape gut motility, link constipation and diarrhea to shared biology, and point to new therapeutic possibilities for IBS and related disorders. A recent study in Gut focused on identifying genes and mechanisms involved in gut motility to uncover how vitamin B1 processing influences bowel movement frequency (stool frequency, SF) and identifies potential treatment targets for common digestive disorders that affect millions of patients worldwide. This process, known as peristalsis, is controlled by the enteric nervous system and modulated by signals from the brain. Proper digestive motility is essential for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. Disrupted motility underlies irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), other gut-brain interaction disorders, and severe conditions like chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Even though these are common disorders, clinicians experience significant challenges in their treatment, primarily due to a lack of understanding of their root causes. By studying the genetics of gut motility, researchers hope to identify new treatment targets that go beyond symptom management. A previous study developed a unique strategy that focused on measurable disease traits, such as gut motility, to identify genes affecting gut function in IBS patients. Gut motility can be precisely measured by colonic transit time; however, this method is not practical for large-scale genetic studies needed to discover new genes. In contrast, the current study used a more accessible measure of stool frequency (SF), which estimates how often people have bowel movements. While SF is not a perfect stand-in for gut motility, it correlates with colonic transit time and captures the full range of motility problems, from constipation to diarrhea. A previous proof-of-study tested this approach by analyzing SF genetics in five European populations. This study successfully identified biological pathways and cell types that control gut contractions. The current study aimed to expand the research by using larger datasets, including an East Asian biobank, to enable broader genetic insights. The current study analyzed questionnaire data from 268,606 people across six biobanks, five European ancestry groups, and one East Asian group. SF ranged from 0.98 to 1.42 bowel movements per day across the different populations. In the European meta-analysis, a total of 7,879,955 genetic variants were analyzed, yielding 3,083 significant genetic markers at 12 independent genomic locations, including two that had never been linked to SF. Separate analyses by sex did not reveal any additional genetic signals. Genetics accounted for about 7 percent of the variation in SF among Europeans. A significant genetic overlap was observed with 164 conditions spanning digestive, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurological, and psychiatric domains. SF also showed genetic connections to various pain-related traits. Combining all 268,606 participants in a multi-ancestry analysis revealed 479 significant markers across 18 genomic locations. Together, these corresponded to 21 independent genetic signals, including 10 newly identified loci, nearly doubling the number previously linked to stool frequency. A total of 21 genetic locations were identified along with 197 protein-coding genes. Fine mapping determined specific genetic variants that influence GI motility. The analysis pinpointed three specific genetic variants with high confidence: rs12407945 in Europeans, and rs2581260 and rs12022782 in the multi-ancestry analysis. The second variant links to hemorrhoids, but its mechanism remains unclear. The third affects XPR1, a phosphate exporter also linked to blood pressure. SLC35F3 transports thiamine into cells, while XPR1 exports phosphate needed to activate it. Analysis of 98,449 participants confirmed that higher thiamine intake was associated with higher SF in observational dietary data, with the effect depending on which gene variants a person carried. This suggests these genes regulate how the body uses vitamin B1 to control gut motility rather than acting through a single organ or pathway. Drug signature analysis computationally prioritized 831 compounds that could speed up or slow down gut motility based on gene expression patterns. These could be further explored for better treatment opportunities, but have not yet been tested experimentally in this context. This genetic analysis of SF reveals new insights into how the gut controls motility. The study uncovered a surprising role for vitamin B1 metabolism in gut motility. This discovery opens possibilities for dietary or drug interventions targeting thiamine pathways. Because SF is a questionnaire-based proxy for motility, and dietary thiamine intake was assessed observationally rather than through intervention trials, the authors emphasize the need for mechanistic studies and clinical validation. Many existing medications, particularly cardiovascular drugs, could be repurposed to treat IBS and other gut motility disorders, but further experimental and clinical investigation is required. Díaz-Muñoz C, Bozzarelli I, Lopera-Maya EA, et al. (2026) Genetic dissection of stool frequency implicates vitamin B1 metabolism and other actionable pathways in the modulation of gut motility.
