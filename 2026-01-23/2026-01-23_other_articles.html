                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research suggests liquid water may exist on tidally locked exoplanets beyond classic habitable zones. In doing so, astronomers have narrowed their search to a small “habitable zone” around stars. By analyzing the data in a recent paper published in Astrophysical Journal, Professor Amri Wandel from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem argues that this long-held assumption may actually be too conservative. It may easily dismiss planets that once seemed inhospitable to liquid water as potentially habitable planets because they might still have liquid water on their surfaces. Wandel's studies were focused mainly on planets orbiting two types of stellar names, M Dwarf Stars and K Dwarf Stars. These stars are both smaller and cooler than our Sun and make up the majority of stellar types in our galaxies. The majority of M and K Dwarf Stars are excellent targets for exoplanet detecting. The planets orbiting these stars transit more frequently. They can be easily detected and studied with instruments like the James Webb Telescope, etc. Therefore, they appear to have tremendous potential for finding and studying exoplanets. However, most of the exoplanets orbiting M and K Dwarf Stars look very different than Earth. Almost all of these planets are “tidally locked.” A planet that is tidally locked is a planet that has one side always facing its host star. Experts once argued that a planet that is tidally locked would not likely be a good candidate for life because of the extreme temperature difference between the two sides of the planet. However, Wandel argues that this assumption is incorrect by performing a comparison of the heat flow on such planets using his analytical climate model. Instead of just focusing on how warm or cold a world can get on average, Wandel's study also looks at the ability of any part of the surface within that planet's orbit to support permanent liquid water under the same conditions. In addition, Wandel's research has provided further understanding of previously observed phenomena based on the work of the James Comet Mike Space Telescope. This telescope has been able to detect the presence of gaseous forms of water (H₂O), as well as many gases associated with liquid water, in the atmospheres of warm, nearby, super-Earth-type planets orbiting around M-dwarf stars. These are mostly found within what would generally be considered an inner boundary of the habitable zone. On other worlds within our solar system, for example Earth, there could be evidence for permanent liquid water being located under the covering of thick, ice-crusted layers. It could also exist below the covering of a permanent ice-frosted layer. If conditions were to allow for sufficient subsurface pressure to build up during ice onset or onset of maximum freezing temperatures, such as when subglacial or intraglacial lakes were present, these places where permanent liquid water might have existed would also mean that there are places on these worlds where there is a chance of continued existence of permanent liquid water. This could occur despite atmospheric or environmental conditions remaining frozen. While water is viewed as the most important of all life-supporting compounds, it is only one of several critical needs that living systems have for proper functioning. These needs ultimately include both chemical energy and long-term stability. Using the relationships established in this study, scaling laws can be devised for estimating the location on exoplanets that would support habitable conditions. This can be done without the necessity of performing complex climate models. The intention of such an approach is to aid researchers in directing future observations. It is not intended to provide a substitute for the more detailed models. A major conclusion of this work is that, generally, tidal locks on exoplanets are more likely to have habitable conditions at their star than those that have a faster rotation. These are exoplanets that are constantly in orbit around the same planet at the same distance from their star. Whereas previously researchers tended to consider whether or not the entire zone would be too hot, Wandel proposed that researchers ask themselves if some part will remain cool enough. In summary, the research has provided two potential scenarios. Two parameters are established as frames for this study. One of these is the Heating Factor, which incorporates stellar energy, surface reflectivity (albedo), and greenhouse warming. In the case of various heavenly bodies, drastically different ratios exist with respect to heat transport. For instance, with regard to Mars, close to 85 percent of the energy that is absorbed by Mars is distributed globally. On the other hand, Mercury absorbs nearly 100 percent of its received energy. There is little to no global redistribution of that energy. Utilizing moderate heat transport values, the author deduces that liquid water on the night side of a planet could remain viable for many planets. This would apply to planets that receive multiple times the solar energy received by Earth. It could still maintain liquid water on its night side. Before establishing a definition for habitability linked to location or distance, the author Wandel established definitions for habitability that were based instead on heating. All of this holds true in locations that are permanently covered by ice. It also applies in regions where there is water below the planet's surface. Examples include hot day-side and cool night-side waters. Based on previous studies, M-dwarf systems are easier to study than other types of stars. Thus, the findings of this research indicate that many more planets orbiting M-dwarfs will likely contain water. If the pattern, or heat transport subsystem, can be identified, then it supports the idea that a significant amount of atmosphere exists. Finally, the recent discoveries of water vapour on close-in planets may suggest that there may be night-side or subsurface oceans of water on the planets. According to Wandel, based on the research findings, there may be far more potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs and K-dwarfs than was previously theorized by conservative model estimates. In fact, the difference in potentially habitable exoplanets between M-dwarfs and Sun-like stars could be as great as a factor of 50.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexis Wilkins rubbishes conspiracy theories concerning her relationship and insists: ‘I've never been to Israel. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Alexis Wilkins, the girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel, has denied being an Israeli spy tasked with ensnaring her partner in a “honey trap,” as baseless conspiracy theories about their relationship continue to swirl online. Wilkins, 27, a conservative pundit and country singer, has already sued three right-wing influencers for promoting the lie about her relationship with Patel, 45, which also attracted controversy last year after it was reported he had used a government jet to travel to watch her sing at a wrestling event. Asked about her alleged Mossad connection in a new interview with Vanity Fair, Wilkins reportedly rolled her eyes and answered: “It was widespread character assassination. She speculated that the falsehood might have arisen from her past work with PragerU, whose CEO, Marissa Streit, has claimed to have served in the Israeli military's spying arm. “They're like, ‘Well, Marissa must have just gotten surgery to look like someone else, and this is now Alexis, and they placed her with Kash,'” Wilkins said. When Vanity Fair suggested to Wilkins that she may be at least partly responsible for the climate of misinformation she now finds herself a victim of – she having previously promoted President Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 presidential election and other untruths about Covid-19, January 6, and the war in Ukraine – she answered dismissively. “I think that we have arrived at a unique time in politics where people have so much information, they can look up anything.” She previously denied the Israel allegation in good humor during an appearance on SiriusXM's The Megyn Kelly Show last July, saying that she was “shocked” when she first heard it, but was more concerned by the fact that: “It's accusing me of manipulating the person that I'm with, that I love. Pressed by Kelly “for the record” on whether or not she was an operative for a foreign government, she laughed and said: “Definitely not. She and Patel also previously discussed their “love story” on a MAGA podcast hosted by Katie Miller, wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller, which had the misfortune to drop in mid-December when the bureau was engaged in a manhunt for the person behind the shooting at Brown University. “We had a beautiful Christmas with family, which was wonderful and normal and good to make some normal, great family memories,” she said. She added that she felt people have gone after her as a means of attacking Patel, commenting, “I think it's sad that people have figured out that they can try to use me to get to him in the press. “I don't have a lot of skeletons in my closet. I'm not someone who hopes that something doesn't come out.” Asked about having to have a security detail, Wilkins said: “It's definitely strange. Everyone's doing their best to make it as normal as possible because, contrary to what seems to get reported, it's not the most comfortable thing, especially when you're not someone who… I'm not doing a job that warrants it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's an age-old question that still remains unanswered - is there life outside of our planet? Despite extensive efforts, experts still haven't been able to conclusively find any evidence but many people believe extraterrestrial life could exist. In recent years, billionaire Musk has also set his sights on the stars, with hopes for his space firm SpaceX to establish permanent bases on both the Moon and Mars. And now, the tech mogul has spoken out at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to give people an update on his thoughts about intelligent life possibly being out there in space. During a conversation the billionaire had with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk joked that he is often asked whether there are aliens among us, adding: “And I'll say that I am one. He continued: “The bottom line is, I think we need to assume that life and consciousness is extremely rare and it might only be us and if that's the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished.” Musk has previously said that he believes SpaceX could achieve ‘self sustaining life' on Mars in the next 20 to 30 years. SpaceX anticipates that Starship will have the ability to travel 140 million miles to the Red Planet in a journey time of six months. According to the SpaceX site: “Mars is about half again as far from the Sun as Earth is, so it still has decent sunlight. “Its atmosphere is primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other trace elements, which means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Silver Spring Stage presents the local debut of “Enough To Let the Light In,” a 2022 play by Paloma Nozicka that blends human drama with the supernatural. Director Rob Gorman explores the play's complex themes in a recent Q&A, highlighting its psychological twists and chilling, suspenseful conclusion. Source of the Spring: This play has only two characters. Tell us a little about each of them. Rob Gorman: Cynthia is played by Katherine Leiden. She's an artist who had a thriving career until something we about learn through the play, some event happened, that made her, essentially, retire from producing art. She met Cynthia on a dating app. The play begins when they have been dating for about six months. Source: The play is set on an important night for their relationship, a declaration of greater seriousness and commitment. Gorman: Yes, and it also contains a lot of secrets. It seems to start pretty straightforwardly, but we learn at least one of these characters is holding a number of secrets she wants to reveal but is struggling to reveal. So we learn a lot about them right from the start, but then the onion starts to peel back and we learn much more. Source: Do you see Cynthia or Marc as driving more of the action than the other? Gorman: I do see Marc as the one who is, to some extent, driving the relationship. She very much loves Cynthia and she sees in Cynthia hope for her future, for having love in her future. She wants so desperately to lock that in. Cynthia at least on the surface comes across as a little more reactive and fragile, in a sense. Source: Why did you pick each of the actors for their roles? It's hard to find someone who can bring that entire range. I've seen Katherine [Cynthia] in other shows. I'm extremely fortunate in real life that she is an artist and [that experience] resonates with her character in ways I had not guessed before casting her. She brings some lived experience that is unteachable. Source: There are a lot of conflicts in the play between these two obviously loving people. To name a few, there's belief or disbelief in God; the value or lack thereof of counseling and psychological therapy; high career ambitions vs. giving up a career; and their versions of reality. Pick one and tell us how you see it. Gorman: To me, the biggest conflict in the play – and it's one that I think is relatable to people, especially these days – is when one person expresses a belief in what somebody else finds unbelievable. The other person says, not only do I not believe that, but I don't even know if I can connect with you as a human any more because of the things you are telling me you believe. Source: In this play, that belief on the part of Cynthia is really unusual. Gorman: The conflict comes when you love someone tremendously and think you know them, and they reveal something about themselves that is so true to their core beliefs that it makes you rethink everything about them. Cynthia is unwavering in her belief … but it seems completely impossible to Marc. It really makes Marc think, I love this person, but do I know them at all? Source: The two characters are lesbians in a long-term relationship. You're a straight, married man directing this play. This play could have been about a straight couple, and Marc could have been a guy. It would be slightly different, not enormously. “Enough To Let the Light In” is about all these other things. None of that is specific to the lesbian experience. I'm very fortunate to be working with Shampa and Katherine, and I hope the experience has been equally positive for them. “Enough To Let the Light In” debuts on Friday, January 23, and runs through Sunday, February 8. Tickets are $25-$28, including fees, and available online at ssstage.org.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An off-the-grid explorer has spotted a mysterious UFO-shaped aircraft flying over the top secret US military base Area 51. Anders Otteson, a self-described backpacker and videographer, was documenting his trip to the desert surrounding the infamous Nevada facility on January 14 when the unidentified craft was seen flying overhead at around 3am local time (6am ET). Otteson had already seen what appeared to be a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber flying over Area 51 two hours earlier and noted that this craft was shaped more like an 'equilateral triangle,' which UFO researchers have called the 'Dorito.' Moreover, a scanner monitoring Area 51's unencrypted radio frequencies picked up a bizarre transmission full of code words themed around beer, food, and snacks instead of standard military jargon. Area 51 has been involved in the development and testing of revolutionary and experimental aircraft for decades, including the F-117 Nighthawk, America's first stealth bomber. On his Uncanny Expeditions YouTube channel, Otteson said he was camping in the Tikaboo Valley of the Nevada desert, on public land near Groom Lake Road, which overlooks Area 51's restricted airspace and front gate area when the Dorito appeared. Around 1am local time, he spotted and filmed what appeared to be the B-2 flying overhead from the northwest, which had allegedly originated from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. Hours later, Otteson observed the second aircraft performing a low flyover from the northwest, passing directly over his position before continuing onward. 'Are we looking at a classified test flight or run-of-the-mill training sortie?' The mystery sighting over Area 51 played out very much like the Dorito sightings in 2014; one captured by photographer Jeff Templin in Wichita, Kansas and another by photographer Steve Douglas in Amarillo, Texas. Both showed similar unidentified triangle-shaped aircraft that looked unlike known Air Force planes or drones. As for the strange radio code picked up on fellow UFO researcher Joerg Arnu's scanner, military personnel at Area 51 were heard using words such as 'pretzel snack,' 'corona pretzel snacks zero with cheese,' 'profile Michelob,' 'Imperial with garlic,' and 'fridge hydrate' to mask what they were saying. According to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), there have been 10 UFO sightings throughout the US in January that mention a triangle-shaped object flying overhead. Overall, there have been 85 triangle-shaped UFO reports since November 2025 throughout the world, including in the UK, Canada, Germany, and Brazil.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘The Twisted Child' marks Goan author Mario Coelho's return to short fiction two years after ‘Moonlight And Shadow', his first collection of unsettling tales for adults. His new book comprises 12 short stories that move into the terrain of mystery and the supernatural, dark, but not quite horror. Set in Goa, the stories are populated by recognisable characters and everyday situations, drawing readers in through familiarity before leading them towards the unexpected. “Some of the stories are a little frightening, but not so much that they'll keep you awake at night. Each story can be read on its own, but all are closely tied to Goa and its surroundings with characters that most readers would relate to, whether a village drunkard, a hardworking toddy tapper or the elderly woman living alone in her heritage home. Once a sceptic, he admits these encounters forced him to reconsider his disbelief in the supernatural. And many of the stories were so fascinating that I had to weave them into a story of my own. It would have been such a waste if I hadn't. Imagination has a lot to do with this process, and that is simply a gift; I don't take any credit for it.” Known for his children's books ‘Daksh, the Dancing Dragon' and ‘The Cats Who Loved to Dance', this is Mario's second collection of stories after ‘Moonlight and Shadow.' Speaking about why mystery and the supernatural as genres remain underexplored locally, Mario explains, “I've been reading the works of Goan writers like Tino D'Sa, José Lourenço, Sheela Jaywant and Kaustubh Naik, to name a few. These are all immensely talented and entertaining writers. From Mangalore, Dr Geralyn Pinto's writing, is extraordinary. But as to why mystery and the supernatural are largely unexplored genres in Goan writing, the honest answer to that is: I don't know. Maybe I alone have a dark soul, who knows?” Mario began writing seriously at the age of 46. In April or May this year, HarperCollins will be bringing out a book, written by me, on the Vikram & Betaal mythological series. We are thinking of calling it ‘Betaal Pachchisi'. These will comprise 25 stories, written almost entirely in verse, and profusely illustrated,” he informs. What keeps him going is simple and honest. “First, the fact that I'm putting my talent to good use. And lastly, that I am weaving or crafting narratives, whether children's stories or dark tales, which are of a certain quality. That is the most important thing to me, above everything else,” concludes Mario. (Mario Coelho will launch his latest book, ‘The Twisted Child: Tales of the Unexpected', at Broadway Book Centre, Panjim, on Thursday, January 29 at 5 pm.</p>

Considering the vital role money plays both in our lives and in the world, our educational system teaches us very little about how money is created, how banks operate, and what causes the huge banking scandals and bankruptcies that have occurred.

In Montana, a focus on restorative justice is reducing juvenile recidivism through a nonprofit program that engages them, rather than punishes them. The nonprofit believes that it's actually far more challenging for juvenile offenders to look their victims in the eye and explain why they behaved antisocially than it is to simply serve a suspension from school, where they're distanced from friends and mentors, and often fall behind in their education. CRYJ receives referrals from Youth Court probation officers, school administrators, or school resource officers made on behalf of a juvenile offender who's broken the law. CRYJ then has a conference with the youth and their parent or guardian, and creates a tailormade program of restorative justice. CRYJ believes that by limiting the overuse of exclusionary discipline and emphasizing a community-driven approach, it can help at-risk youth avoid falling behind in school.

Partly cloudy skies this evening will become overcast overnight. Spooky Time members, left to right, Matthew Tinsley, Jared Diehl, Easton May, Zack Peck, and Austin Yewell. You do not need to believe in ghosts to get hooked on Spooky Time Paranormal at RealSpookyTime on YouTube, but you might start wondering if something unexplained is lurking just around the corner. They say the name of their channel started as nothing more than a running joke among friends. “Halloween has always been my favorite time,” Tinsley said. “We were just hanging out at this house nearby,” Tinsley said, speaking for the others in Spooky Time as well as himself. “Totally normal night until suddenly it was not. Something happened that none of us could explain and it is one of those moments that sticks with you forever. From that night on, the group decided to explore those questions together. They describe their style on camera as a mix of honest reactions, real friendship, and the kind of nervous humor that spills out when things get too spooky. Their travels take them all over Kentucky and Tennessee, where they say there is an endless list of historic and supposedly haunted places. What this group loves most are the locations no one else pays attention to. “We try to find places that have not been investigated a thousand times,” said Tinsley. “Those hidden spots usually have the best stories.” Two of their most memorable recent projects include their investigation of the Capitol Theatre in Bowling Green, where they later hosted a public premiere and a trip into an abandoned coal mine in eastern Kentucky. “The mine really stuck with us,” said Tinsley. “You walk in and immediately feel the history. For Spooky Time Paranormal, history is what guides every investigation. “Areas with deep roots and long histories have stories layered into them. “Some of our funniest moments come from that thing,” said Tinsley. “Sometimes the responses match exactly what we are asking and sometimes we just look at each other like, ‘What did it just say?' Behind the scenes, this fun group of gentlemen take preparation seriously. “People think we just show up somewhere creepy and start filming,” Tinsley joked. There is planning, research, talking to property managers, safety guidelines, walkthroughs, everything.” They say safety always comes first, especially when working in old structures with unknown hazards. They are not there to make a mess or stir things up. They are there to tell its story even if that means freaking out on camera a little. Support from viewers across Kentucky and Tennessee has been better than the men ever expected. Friends, family, strangers online—everyone has been incredible, according to the group. We just like when people watch and ask questions," Tinsley said. The spooky fellas add that a lot of locations already come with legends or rumors. “People whispered about it being haunted for years. Looking ahead, the team hopes to focus more on their own community. “Logan County is filled with stories we grew up hearing,” said Tinsley. “Some of these legends have been around forever but have not been looked into the way we do it on our channel. The spooky sleuths believe paranormal stories stick around in small towns because they become part of shared identity. “In places like this, stories get passed down. We want to understand the stories people have been whispering about for generations,” Tinsley said. For Matthew, Austin, Zack, Easton, and Jared, the heart of Spooky Time will always be the same: real friendship, real reactions, local history, and a deep respect for the communities who trust them with their stories. Whenever the team investigates somewhere, especially in Logan County, they want people to know they are treating it with care. They are there to document, explore, and tell these stories the right way. Whether you believe in ghosts or not, watching them explore these old theaters, coal mines, and hidden corners makes you feel like you are right there with them, holding your breath, laughing, and wondering if maybe, just maybe, there is something out there waiting to be discovered.
