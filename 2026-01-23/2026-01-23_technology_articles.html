                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Under this requirement, CBP will take additional steps to enhance its ability to detect, and thus, significantly reduce the harms of illicit contraband entering the United States of America, thus bolstering national security.” CBP and General Dynamics did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment. Last week's justification does not get into detail about which methods its “quantum sensors” would use or what information the AI database would store and analyze. However, it does provide hints about detection methods the agency has considered. The document claims that CBP conducted market research from April through October of 2025. In July, CBP published an information request seeking a vendor for exactly 35 handheld "Gemini” analyzers, sold by Thermo Fisher Scientific, which are designed to identify unknown chemicals and narcotics. The July request—which notes that the devices would be used to identify substances like fentanyl, ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, diazepam, and MDMA—makes no mention of artificial intelligence or a database. The July request for information claims that the Gemini analyzers use “Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),” which measures how much infrared light a sample absorbs, and “Raman spectroscopy,” which measures how light scatters off the surface of a sample when a laser is directed at it. Last week's contract justification says that the agency found an American company that creates a “handheld analyzer” for identifying dangerous chemicals but claimed it “cannot detect fentanyl.” It's unclear whether this was referring to Gemini or one of the more than 10 other devices DHS tested in 2021 and 2023. But when reached for comment, Thermo Fisher Scientific said that its Gemini analyzers “are designed to detect fentanyl.” It's also unclear whether the General Dynamics prototype may use FTIR or Raman spectroscopy. While it remains ambiguous what exactly last week's justification was referring to with its mention of “quantum” sensors, there are fentanyl detection methods based in quantum chemistry. When a few micrograms of fentanyl are added to this mixture, Webber says, it sticks to the quantum dots and “outcompetes” the fluorescent dye, causing a loss of fluorescence. Webber notes that all fentanyl-related lab research is conducted in a “super-controlled environment,” and never entails large quantities of fentanyl for legal, practical, and safety reasons. He emphasizes the sensitive nature of discussing fentanyl research, and says that labs like his never have bags of fentanyl laying around, an incorrect impression some people may have. “If you have signals coming from multiple agents within a mixture, the eye may not be able to see to deconvolve the spectra into individual components, Webber says. In other words, since new street drugs can constantly move the goalposts of detection, an AI-based system that processes images and recognizes patterns may catch fentanyl in situations where a human could miss it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is enabled by default. But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft's cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects' hard drives. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year. Apart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft's cloud infrastructure — something that has happened several times in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. “It's 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a post on Bluesky.

A new leak from tech YouTuber der8auer claims that Nvidia is ending a program dubbed "OPP", purportedly an incentive scheme used by Nvidia to ensure that at least some of its graphics cards were sold to consumers at MSRP by AIBs like Asus and others. By way of historical background, the creator said in his YouTube video that Nvidia's GPUs were previously being sold for way above the suggested retail price for the last few generations, and consumers were starting to notice and complain about it. So, the company instituted the OPP program, which, according to de8auer's sources, is some sort of cash back for participating AIB partners. According to der8auer's leak, Nvidia apparently stopped this program a few days ago. There were rumors late last year that the company no longer bundled VRAM with the GPU chips that board partners ordered, but Nvidia refuted this at CES, telling HardwareLuxx [machine translated], “No changes on how Nvidia is handling the memory allocation.” If the OPP program is indeed real, it seems that the continuous increase in memory pricing is making it difficult even for Team Green, with its record revenues fueled by the boom in AI infrastructure build-out, to sustain the GPU and memory subsidy that allows board partners to at least sell some models at MSRP. Another YouTube channel, Hardware Unboxed, was told by an Asus representative that the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB have been discontinued or marked as end-of-life (EOL). Asus refuted this a few hours later, saying that “Certain media may have received incomplete information from an Asus PR representative regarding these products,” and that “Asus has no plans to stop selling these models.” In fact, the opposite has been true in recent days, with prices for different RTX 5080 models from various AIBs showing an increasing trend on Amazon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're back with our regular spotlight on early stage startups sprouting up in the Seattle region. For this edition, we're featuring Axel AI, DrunR, Eluum, and profileAPI. Read on for brief descriptions of each company — along with pitch assessments from “Mean VC,” a GPT-powered critic offering a mix of encouragement and constructive criticism. The business: A self-described “reasoning layer” for retail media sales teams that aims to translate messy data into commercial narratives and proposals. The idea is to help sales teams spend less time on manual analysis and preparation. The bootstrapped company officially launched its MVP at CES and NRF 2026 earlier this month. Leadership: CEO and co-founder Bobby Figueroa previously founded Gradient, another Seattle-based commerce insights company that was acquired by Criteo. The pedigree helps, but long-term success will hinge on whether your product drives actual revenue lift, not just cleaner decks. The business: A nutrition app that provides personalized guidance based on users' goals and preferences, particularly while dining out or ordering food online. DrunR is running a closed beta in Seattle with restaurants and users, including people using GLP-1 medication. Mean VC: “The intersection of nutrition, personalization, and GLP-1s is timely — especially as eating habits shift alongside new weight-loss drugs. I'd zero in on a high-frequency use case — something that keeps users opening the app daily, not just when they're thinking about dinner.” The business: A new take on social media with a product that helps people organize their personal memories, stories, and digital artifacts into one user-controlled system. The bootstrapped company is onboarding early users and plans to launch a MVP later this year. Mean VC: “The concept taps into a real emotional need — people are overwhelmed by digital clutter and increasingly skeptical of algorithm-driven feeds. The key will be showing how your platform earns daily use without relying on dopamine loops. I'd push to define a sharp use case first — memory curation is broad, so lead with one thing people urgently want to preserve, then expand once you've earned their trust.” The company, which was previously a sales AI agent product called Truebase, has raised $2 million in funding. Mean VC: “The shift from product to platform is smart — selling infrastructure to power GTM copilots has stronger upside than building another agent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India is hosting its first major AI event — the India AI Impact Summit 2026 — in New Delhi between February 16 and 20, bringing together global technology leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei alongside key Indian business figures like Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, per the summit's website. But TechCrunch has learned that OpenAI is separately planning to host closed-door meetings on the sidelines of the summit in New Delhi, where Altman is expected to be present. The company is also hosting an OpenAI event in New Delhi on February 19, with venture capitalists and industry executives invited, one person familiar with the matter said. Altman's visit has not been publicly announced and plans could still change, the sources said. Several other U.S. companies are also planning side events around the summit week. Anthropic is hosting a developers' day in Bengaluru on February 16, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. The cluster of events underscores how global AI firms are seeking to engage India's enterprise customers, startup ecosystem, and developer community. Altman had previously said he planned to return later in 2025 following OpenAI's August announcement of a New Delhi office, but that trip did not take place. In recent months, Anthropic announced an office in Bengaluru and named former Microsoft India managing director Irina Ghose as its local head, while Google and Perplexity have struck partnerships with Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, respectively, to bundle premium AI subscriptions for millions of telecom users. OpenAI has been expanding its India presence in recent months, hiring across enterprise sales, technical deployment, and legal roles focused on AI regulation. The company is currently listing openings in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. Still, OpenAI has faced challenges converting that demand into paid subscriptions, introducing a lower-priced “ChatGPT Go” plan last year priced under $5 and offering it free for a year to drive uptake. Altman is expected to meet key tech executives, startup founders, and government officials during the trip, the sources said, as OpenAI looks to expand ChatGPT's enterprise adoption while still broadening its reach as a mass-market product. OpenAI is also looking at India as a potential base for infrastructure expansion, the sources said. But India's data-center ambitions face constraints, including uneven power availability, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating costs for cloud providers. The federal government is also pushing domestic startups to build smaller models for local use cases, eventually reducing reliance on U.S.-based systems. OpenAI, India's IT ministry, and the AI summit's organizers did not respond to requests for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anbernic, the company that has brought us a mountain of retro gaming handhelds over the last several years, is ready to get into high-end peripherals with a controller built for the cross-section of hypochondriacs and gamers. The RG in Anbernic's nomenclature stands for “retro gaming,” though there's little about this controller that recalls past screen-based control schemes like the old spaceship-shaped Sega Dreamcast controller. Anbernic's gamepad uses two sensors on either side of the controller grips to measure heart rate and alert you if you may be playing too hard. Don't worry, that screen has uses other than just telling you if you need to calm down after a grueling session of Battlefield 6. Is this controller solving some kind of problem with gamers having heart-related health incidents? A 2023 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology looked at patients at the Mayo Clinic's genetic heart rhythm clinic from 2000 to 2022 and found that heart-related medical incidents when gaming were extremely rare for people with genetic heart conditions. On the whole, the RG G01 suggests it's more fun to watch your ECG (electrocardiogram) pump along while you try to not get stomped in your next Call of Duty match. You already expect a high-end controller to have Hall effect or TMR (tunneling magnetoresistance) joysticks, though Anbernic is going a step further. It's packing the RG G01 with Purple Kirin inductive joysticks, which use capacitive sensing. This measures a small electric current to detect movement and convert that into digital signals that the controller uses for movement. The RG G01 has a touted 1,000Hz polling rate in both wired and 2.4GHz wireless modes, meaning it's a fast controller for those who detest any latency in their controls. Otherwise, Anbernic's new controller sports many of the same high-end features we're used to, like 6-axis gyroscopes that are compatible with systems like Nintendo Switch 2. It also has two-stage trigger locks for when you want a full analog trigger or a rapid-fire sensation for first-person shooters. The back buttons are programmable with macros that could prove useful for fighting games. The controller is “coming soon,” though as for price, it's anyone's guess. The RG G01 will likely cost more, though we doubt it will be anywhere near as expensive as Nintendo's own $90 Switch 2 Pro gamepad. AMD's new Ryzen 7 9850X3D seems powerful, though it's not a massive leap over what we already have. This may be the moment when ARM really takes off on PCs, though it couldn't come at a worse time. Razer doesn't know exactly what it's creating, but it still wants you to put money down on its desktop AI gadget. We can already tell 16GB graphics cards will become an exclusive commodity in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We lost some part of our digital life, perhaps because we accidentally deleted it or a system failed us in some way. Well, a professor in Germany lost a large amount of work recently after changing his settings with OpenAI's ChatGPT, writing about it this week in Nature. But social media users don't seem very sympathetic. Marcel Bucher, a professor of plant sciences at the University of Cologne, writes that he signed up for a paid ChatGPT plan two years ago and found the AI tool tremendously useful. “Having signed up for OpenAI's subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, I used it as an assistant every day — to write e-mails, draft course descriptions, structure grant applications, revise publications, prepare lectures, create exams and analyse student responses, and even as an interactive tool as part of my teaching,” wrote Bucher. At that moment, all of my chats were permanently deleted and the project folders were emptied — two years of carefully structured academic work disappeared. Fortunately, I had saved partial copies of some conversations and materials, but large parts of my work were lost forever. Bucher went on to explain that he initially thought it was a mistake and assumed that he would be able to recover his years of data. He reinstalled the app, tried different browsers, and tinkered with more settings. He then tried to contact OpenAI but was predictably met with an AI agent, which couldn't help him. He eventually was able to contact a human, but they couldn't help him either. Again, this is the kind of story that would've likely elicited some sympathy in another era. But here in 2026, when AI is often seen as a slop machine for generating wrong answers and child sexual abuse material, there are more than a few people who will revel in someone losing all their AI chats. “Amazing sob story: ‘ChatGPT deleted all the work I hadn't done',” one Bluesky user wrote. “Maybe next time, actually do the work you are paid to do *yourself*, instead of outsourcing it to the climate-killing, suicide-encouraging plagiarism machine,” wrote another another. “(But, in his defense: there is no particular reason to assume that the guy who published this actually wrote it himself. Bucher did make the point that he was being encouraged to use AI in his work, and there's validity to that complaint. Large institutions are telling their workers to incorporate AI more often under the theory that it's some kind of inevitable future: We are increasingly being encouraged to integrate generative AI into research and teaching. However, my case reveals a fundamental weakness: these tools were not developed with academic standards of reliability and accountability in mind. If a single click can irrevocably delete years of work, ChatGPT cannot, in my opinion and on the basis of my experience, be considered completely safe for professional use. It remains to be seen whether generative AI will truly transform the workplace in ways that actually matter, especially as workers are more skeptical and bosses try to insist on its use. Whatever happens, there will likely be plenty of AI skeptics around to celebrate when someone loses a bunch of work. The iPhone maker might be preparing to battle OpenAI's own family of AI gadgets. No, there have not been any updates about what the hell it is. OpenAI just rehired former employees who previously left the company to work at Thinking Machines Lab.</p>

The Lian Li RS1200G delivers genuine innovation with its rotatable AC inlet and dual-sided modular interface. Exceptional electrical performance and build quality justify the premium positioning, though universal compatibility remains elusive. Lian Li Industrial Co., Ltd., founded in 1983, is a Taiwanese company renowned for its premium computer cases, power supplies, and PC accessories. As one of the oldest players in the PC hardware market, Lian Li is recognized for its commitment to high-quality craftsmanship, innovative aluminum-based designs, and solutions tailored to both industrial and consumer markets. Among PC enthusiasts, Lian Li's reputation for blending functionality with aesthetics has established them as an industry leader. This review examines the RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU, representing Lian Li's most sophisticated approach to power supply design. Would this cutting-edge design earn it a spot in our list of best power supplies? The implementation appears more versatile than competing solutions, though it introduces its own compatibility requirements. Complementing this mechanical innovation is an optional magnetic USB hub that can mount directly to the PSU, expanding connectivity options for modern systems. Protection is substantial, with the PSU enclosed in a protective pouch and surrounded by dense foam packaging inserts designed to withstand shipping stresses. Cable combs arrive pre-attached to select cables, with additional units included for user customization. Finally, Lian Li includes some basic cable ties as well. All cables utilize an all-black aesthetic with black connectors and wires. The cables employ a flat, ribbon-line construction that simplifies routing in tight spaces. The cable configuration proves conservative for a 1200W unit, providing one 12V-2x6 connector and five 6+2 pin PCI Express connectors distributed across four cables. The unit's maximum output rating at 40 degrees Celsius and the number of connectors hint that it is not a platform meant to be severely stressed. This compact form factor is remarkable for a 1200W unit. The matte black chassis paint job demonstrates excellent finishing quality, with smooth surfaces free from manufacturing defects. The design philosophy diverges dramatically from conventional PSU architecture. This receptacle represents the unit's defining feature, allowing users to shift modular cable connectors between rear and left-side positions. This appears more sophisticated than competing solutions, as users maintain orientation control based on case requirements. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The 24-pin connector location inverses relative to other connectors depending on AC receptacle orientation. FDB designs represent optimal acoustic-to-reliability balance, maintaining low operational noise at elevated speeds while delivering strong mean time between failure figures. The PSU originates from Sirfa, a Chinese OEM whose designs have graced numerous mid-to-top tier power supplies over the past two decades. Sirfa's experience shows in the platform's assembly quality and component selection, though some choices reflect cost optimization rather than absolute premium positioning. Most filtering components mount on a vertical daughterboard, optimizing spatial efficiency and freeing the AC receptacle for movement. Two rectifying bridges are installed on a substantial heatsink immediately following the filtration stage. One encased inductor and two EPCOS (TDK) capacitors totaling 1210 μF comprise the passive components. These German-manufactured capacitors offer superior thermal and mechanical stress resistance compared to most alternatives but are very costly and we rarely see their products even in top-tier units. These components are on a separate heatsink positioned after the APFC bulk capacitors. Heatsink dimensions are generous, providing substantial surface area for heat dissipation even under sustained high-power operation. The absence of dedicated heatsinks for these components hints their exceptional efficiency characteristics. Secondary side capacitors originate entirely from Teapo, a reputable Taiwanese manufacturer. While Teapo lacks the prestige of premium Japanese manufacturers like Nippon Chemi-Con or Rubycon, they maintain solid reliability records and appropriate specifications for this application. For the testing of PSUs, we are using high precision electronic loads with a maximum power draw of 2700 Watts, a Rigol DS5042M 40 MHz oscilloscope, an Extech 380803 power analyzer, two high precision UNI-T UT-325 digital thermometers, an Extech HD600 SPL meter, a self-designed hotbox and various other bits and parts. The Lian Li RS1200G PSU achieves average nominal load efficiency of 90.0% with 115 VAC input and 92.0% with 230 VAC input, measured across the 10% to 100% load range. The unit received Cybenetics Platinum certification based on average efficiency calculations, though efficiency dips at maximum load prevented higher certifications from the other two certifying bodies. Lian Li markets this as Gold-certified, likely avoiding internal competition with their premium product lines. Efficiency peaks near 40% load and maintains fairly good stability across most operational ranges. Very low load efficiency remains good, an important characteristic for modern systems spending significant time in idle states. Beyond 900 Watts, fan speed increases substantially though it still remains below half maximum capability. During elevated ambient temperature testing, the Lian Li RS1200G PSU exhibits notable efficiency degradation. Signs of thermal stress emerge at maximum load, though they remain within acceptable operational parameters. This is a product rated for maximum output at 40°C and, although it can reach its maximum output at a higher temperature, the signs of stress are apparent. The fan maintains slow rotation up to 600 Watts, after which speed increases progressively until reaching maximum at 90% load. Maximum load operation produces significant noise levels, though this represents expected behavior for a compact, Gold-certified 1200W unit under thermal stress. Internal temperatures remain within acceptable operational levels throughout testing. Maximum ripple measured 26 mV on the 12V rail, 14 mV on the 5V rail, and 14 mV on the 3.3V rail, all substantially below industry safety limits and representing excellent performance considering test conditions and massive power output capability. These figures indicate exceptional power quality across all voltage outputs under varying load conditions. These protection thresholds are exceptionally sharp, particularly for an ATX 3.1 certified unit. The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU represents genuine innovation in power supply design, addressing cable management challenges through mechanical ingenuity rather than incremental improvements. The rotatable AC inlet provides unprecedented installation flexibility, adapting to diverse case architectures while maintaining compact ATX dimensions. This feature alone distinguishes the RS1200G from conventional offerings, though it introduces specific compatibility requirements that potential buyers must carefully evaluate. Cases must accommodate behind-motherboard routing for at least the primary ATX cable, eliminating compatibility with chassis lacking appropriate cable management provisions. This restriction is not insurmountable but requires careful case selection, potentially limiting the RS1200G's appeal to builders with existing incompatible cases. The magnetic USB hub adds practical value for builders requiring additional connectivity and cable management. Direct PSU mounting eliminates SATA power requirements when positioned in the dedicated slot, simplifying cable management. Alternative mounting locations throughout the chassis provide flexibility for specific layout requirements. This feature addresses modern system connectivity demands elegantly, though its utility varies significantly based on individual build requirements. One 12V-2x6 connector and five 6+2 pin PCIe connectors accommodate most GPU requirements but may prove limiting for some top-tier builds. Flat ribbon cables with magnetic cable organizers simplify routing in constrained spaces, representing thoughtful attention to practical installation concerns. Voltage regulation maintains sub-1% deviation across all rails, demonstrating precise control under varying loads. Ripple suppression achieves outstanding results, particularly given the unit's 1200W output capability and compact form factor. Hot testing reveals significant but predictable efficiency degradation to 88.4% and 90.3% respectively, with thermal stress signs at maximum load, even though the figures remain within acceptable parameters. The compact 150mm chassis and overall topology, although paired with a 135mm fan and good heatsinks on the primary side, create inherent cooling challenges at maximum power output. The fan remains inactive or operates at minimal speeds under moderate loads, contributing to excellent low-load acoustics. High load operation produces significant noise levels, particularly under elevated ambient temperatures when the fan reaches maximum speed. Overall, the thermal control circuitry is very reasonably programmed and responsive. EPCOS APFC capacitors and Infineon MOSFETs represent premium choices in critical high-stress positions. Teapo secondary capacitors occupy a middle ground between economy and premium Japanese alternatives, appropriate for the 10-year warranty period but not representing absolute top-tier specification. This mixed approach balances cost optimization with reliability requirements. Pricing positions the RS1200G at approximately $180, representing premium positioning justified by innovative features and solid electrical performance. Competition exists from conventional high-wattage units offering lower pricing but lacking the RS1200G's distinctive capabilities. Value assessment depends heavily on individual compatibility requirements and appreciation for the rotational design innovation. The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU succeeds in delivering meaningful innovation beyond incremental specification improvements. Exceptional electrical performance, comprehensive protection features, and thoughtful accessory inclusion demonstrate engineering competence. The unit's performance at maximum load suggests the platform may be a little stressed at 1200 Watts, although it can deliver its maximum power output under adverse circumstances if necessary. Case compatibility limitations represent the primary concern, requiring careful evaluation before purchase. For builders with compatible cases seeking innovative solutions and exceptional power quality, the RS1200G merits serious consideration despite its premium pricing. Dr. E.

Most news sources are owned by people who support this administration's positions, and are glad they don't have to do this whole charade of pretending to care about the truth or normal people.

Juvenile shit like this does absolutely nothing to advance any policy goals.Even worse, why should you average normie trust any image that comes out from the White House?

You should stop appealing to some kinds of higher principles that are provably inexistant among Trump supporters. This kind of juvenile shit is why they like him in the first place. Anyone still siding with them deserves only scorn and disgust. The Biden administration slow-rolled prosecution of Trump for his crimes because they wanted to court moderates and republicans. That failure enabled Trump to run again from somewhere other than prison. "If only the dems had run Romney for president, then they would have won" is not serious.

Something more in the Sanders direction would have been way better, though with a keener eye towards not alienating working-class folks (like putting a massive student loan forgiveness plan front-and-center did), with Trump's rejection of free-trade dogma, and jettisoning the social justice activism that loses rural areas and many working-class voters. It is always important to look at the larger context these points are being made in.Here, the original comment was taking individual Republican voters to task for supporting this performatively-cruel societally-destructive con man with a proven track record.

A Trump-like Democratic power grab is just as unacceptable to many people, and putting voters in the position of choosing between two unacceptable power grabs to not a recipe for resounding electoral success. It's likely a recipe for failure.A power-grab would emotionally satisfying for partisan Democrats, as they are angry at Trump and would be happy with the result. The problem is they aren't even close to a majority, and they're exactly the kind of people who should be told to hold their nose instead of being catered to.>> And let me be very clear: any Dem that does not agree not only deserves to lose, but they deserve to be harassed for the rest of their life and never, ever hold another job again.

That said, I think "Trump's voters are all assholes" is a talking point NOT of liberal voters, but of the Democratic party, because it conveniently avoids any discussion of policy, particularly where the party and its typical voters may differ.Trade is a good example. The bipartisan consensus since Clinton has largely been that unfettered trade is good. However, if you work in manufacturing, or are in a labor pool that competes with former manufacturing workers (or workers who might have chosen a career in manufacturing, or mechanical engineering, or processing engineering), then there are certainly some drawbacks to consider.To be clear: I do not in any way endorse Trump's policy. I am not trying to discount "owning the libs", or violent racism, certainly both motivators for a good chunk of the MAGA camp. Trump's foreign policy has been intervention-heavy, but his rhetoric was frequently isolationist. The bipartisan consensus since Clinton has largely been that unfettered trade is good.

By and large, I'd expect the professionals of the party to not be so stupid to use "Trump's voters are all assholes" as a talking point (even if they think it). IMHO, it's a talking point of extremely polarized liberal voters, who are letting their emotions get the better of them, and themselves thinking and acting in a more Trump-like manner.Both the party and its voters seem extremely reluctant to think about their role in this, and seem to prefer to continue to make the same mistakes, hoping luck or other-side incompetence brings them a better result next time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla has discontinued Autopilot, its basic driver-assistance system, as the company tries to boost adoption of a more advanced version of the technology that it calls Full Self-Driving (Supervised). After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software's capabilities improve. Musk believes that Tesla's newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though texting while driving is illegal in almost all states. On Thursday, Tesla rolled out the first robotaxi versions of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company's driving software and are still followed by the company's cars for supervision. Tesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” required for Musk to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. Tesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s after talks broke down between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant's then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on all of its vehicles in April 2019. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters, summarises its mechanisms and intent quite succinctly: “This is the path that Viktor Orbán took in Hungary, where you use the power of the state to ensure that the media is compliant, that outlets are either curbed and become much less willing to be critical, or they are sold to owners who will make that happen." - Do something wildly unacceptable- Media writes an article declaring the action is indefensible- Those involved complain publicly about the unfair nature of the story; their supporters back them up- Next time to avoid controversy media writes a slightly more fair storyIt doesn't even require state power because technically in the US they cannot.

Most news sources are owned by people who support this administration's positions, and are glad they don't have to do this whole charade of pretending to care about the truth or normal people.

Juvenile shit like this does absolutely nothing to advance any policy goals.Even worse, why should you average normie trust any image that comes out from the White House? Even worse, why should you average normie trust any image that comes out from the White House? This part is literally what the vote was about. They, collectively, made decisions that allowed a guy like Trump to win, twice. They screamed about the risks every day, but that was only a campaign tactic. It was massively selfish and incompetent for them not to make major policy pivots with the goal of just annihilating Trump and his movement. Instead they just treated it as a regular election, where the goal was to eek out a victory for their partisans.When when you say your opponent is a fascist, it's time to tell your partisans to be quiet, and expand your tent massively.> This is precisely the thing they voted for.Come on, that's obviously false.

The Biden administration slow-rolled prosecution of Trump for his crimes because they wanted to court moderates and republicans. That failure enabled Trump to run again from somewhere other than prison. "If only the dems had run Romney for president, then they would have won" is not serious.

Yes, the GOP would have painted him as a "Communist destroying the American Way of Life", but they did that to Harris anyway so being centrist gave the Dems nothing.- not focusing on prices and jobs from day one, in simple terms the average uneducated worker could understand, and mostly, trying to say "things are good/better" which may have been true, but everyone else thought they were not when they went to buy eggs- Biden trying to stay in for a second term instead of bowing out at the start - not focusing on prices and jobs from day one, in simple terms the average uneducated worker could understand, and mostly, trying to say "things are good/better" which may have been true, but everyone else thought they were not when they went to buy eggs- Biden trying to stay in for a second term instead of bowing out at the start - Biden trying to stay in for a second term instead of bowing out at the start It sounds a lot like you actually agree; those are all reasons why every Democrat constituent should be livid with the party "establishment". Instead, any time this point is brought up, people respond instantly with the "it's not a 'both sides' issue" thought-terminating cliché. Something more in the Sanders direction would have been way better, though with a keener eye towards not alienating working-class folks (like putting a massive student loan forgiveness plan front-and-center did), with Trump's rejection of free-trade dogma, and jettisoning the social justice activism that loses rural areas and many working-class voters. It is always important to look at the larger context these points are being made in.Here, the original comment was taking individual Republican voters to task for supporting this performatively-cruel societally-destructive con man with a proven track record. This is something that every individual Republican voter directly did, while Democrat voters did not do and would not have ended up doing [had Harris won]. Rather, bringing it up here seems like yet another instance of the only-Democrats-have-agency fallacy. But my country called, so I swallowed my own independent individualist pride and answered that call rather than falling for the siren song of destructionist grievance politics) Here, the original comment was taking individual Republican voters to task for supporting this performatively-cruel societally-destructive con man with a proven track record.

There is no middle ground anymore.This just ignores the point from the parent comment it is in response to; regardless of how agreeable these actions would be to you and others (myself included), there are many who could be easily convinced that the result will be harmful to them pretty much "because it's 'the Democrats' doing it". You can arrest however many thousands of politicians and agents; the problem would be exacerbated in that case since the same people who voted for Trump twice would feel even more aggrieved. Many of them like what (they think) he's doing and would jump at any opportunity to vote for someone similar.What you describe would not be the recovery you hope for, at least not long term. Granted, I don't know what would be, but this issue is one of "post-truth" where significant amounts of people can simultaneously be convinced of conflicting opinions about an event, even given videos from multiple perspectives, as we learned recently. Throwing an easily-contested "massive power grab" into the mix is not a serious suggestion. The political machine that got Trump elected will easily get another demagogue elected off the back of lies mixed with truths about said power grab. > At this point, the only recovery from the damage Trump has inflicted upon this country is going to be a massive power grab.

And I a key point is: rejection of Trump is not an endorsement of the Democrats, let alone a full-throated one. A Trump-like Democratic power grab is just as unacceptable to many people, and putting voters in the position of choosing between two unacceptable power grabs to not a recipe for resounding electoral success. > Others were likely motivated by things Trump is willing to say out loud ... his policies actively make all those problems worseThese two things are not mutually exclusive, but rather they are directly related.

Even without any societal history of racism, it's straightforward to adopt a 90% rule that white -> ingroup, and nonwhite -> outgroup. A non-white person can become "one of the good ones" by "acting white". A white woman can remain ingroup-accepted by "knowing her place", or can become part of the outgroup by actively rejecting the heteronormative role (eg declaring herself a lesbian).After this stews for a while, gaining more and more "predictive power" (aka confirmation bias), there becomes a tacit rule that anybody not nodding in full agreement with the Party mantras is also in the outgroup. Essentially everyone "good" must be supporting this particular leader and repeating the litanies of a narrow Overton window - if you're not onboard, then the simple answer is you're not "good" and therefore not worth listening to at all - even if you're merely trying to point out how they are not going to get what they themselves claim to want.The end result is basically a self-reinforcing cult that goes off the rails of all reason, and here we are. For example, someone arguing that tariffs are bad because free trade is inherently good and brings benefits somewhere else, handwaving about the manufacturing economy being disrupted - not going to be very convincing to anyone that sees the lack of manufacturing jobs as a problem.

That said, I think "Trump's voters are all assholes" is a talking point NOT of liberal voters, but of the Democratic party, because it conveniently avoids any discussion of policy, particularly where the party and its typical voters may differ.Trade is a good example. The bipartisan consensus since Clinton has largely been that unfettered trade is good. However, if you work in manufacturing, or are in a labor pool that competes with former manufacturing workers (or workers who might have chosen a career in manufacturing, or mechanical engineering, or processing engineering), then there are certainly some drawbacks to consider.To be clear: I do not in any way endorse Trump's policy. I am not trying to discount "owning the libs", or violent racism, certainly both motivators for a good chunk of the MAGA camp. Trump's foreign policy has been intervention-heavy, but his rhetoric was frequently isolationist. The bipartisan consensus since Clinton has largely been that unfettered trade is good.

By and large, I'd expect the professionals of the party to not be so stupid to use "Trump's voters are all assholes" as a talking point (even if they think it). IMHO, it's a talking point of extremely polarized liberal voters, who are letting their emotions get the better of them, and themselves thinking and acting in a more Trump-like manner.Both the party and its voters seem extremely reluctant to think about their role in this, and seem to prefer to continue to make the same mistakes, hoping luck or other-side incompetence brings them a better result next time.

The image is AI, whether AI added a tiny cloud in the upper corner, or completely fabricated it from a prompt. Your example shows two things that are obviously different from a moral standpoint.

He is not naming the provider, because the company is a global host that contracts with independent regional companies to expand its reach. The database was hosted by one of these affiliates in Canada. “This is like a dream wish list for criminals, because you have so many different types of credentials,” Fowler told WIRED. The database was in a format made for indexing large logs as if whoever set it up was expecting to gather a lot of data. And there were tons of government logins from many different countries.” The data was publicly accessible and searchable using just a web browser. “It seemed like it captured anything and everything, but one thing that was interesting was that the system seemed to automatically classify each log with an identifier, and these were unique identifiers that didn't reappear,” Fowler says. Though Fowler emphasizes that he did not determine who owned or used the information and for what purpose, such a structure would make sense if the data were being queried for cybercriminal customers paying for different subsets of the information based on their scams. There is a seemingly endless flow of mistakenly unsecured and publicly accessible databases online that expose sensitive information for anyone to access. But as data brokers and cybercriminals amass ever greater troves, the stakes of potential breaches only grow. “Infostealers create a very low barrier of entry for new criminals,” says Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at security firm Recorded Future.

It moves a deal one step closer to completion, following years of uncertainty over whether the app would be banned in the U.S., though TikTok was quick to note that this isn't a final deal to sell the company. Michael Dell is also involved, according to the Times. The content recommendation algorithm will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment.” It's not entirely clear what that means, but obviously there are concerns that Trump and the U.S. government will tinker with the platform to make it more MAGA friendly. Congress passed a bipartisan law in 2024, signed by President Joe Biden, that required TikTok to be sold to U.S. interests or be banned in America over national security concerns. And then Trump signed an executive order extending it yet again until June. When June rolled around, that was extended again until September. After they blew through that deadline, it was extended again to January 22. Trump had no authority to just keep extending the deadline, but he did it anyway, which seems to be a theme of this presidency. He had initially tried to ban TikTok during his first term, but that got tied up in the courts and fizzled out. Trump then pulled a 180 while campaigning for the presidency in 2024, insisting that he liked TikTok because it was popular with young people and he had a lot of supporters there who could help him win the election. It's entirely possible that this news is in many ways another headfake, given the fact that we've heard about a “done deal” many times since President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second time in January 2025. Back in October 2025, we heard the same thing. And when Gizmodo reached out to TikTok on Thursday after the New York Times first broke the news, our email asked about a finalized deal. A new U.S.-based joint venture would keep TikTok online while handing oversight of its algorithm and data security to some of America's wealthiest investors. Trump posts just 5% of the tweets under his name, according to a new report. The lawsuit has Star Wars jokes, of course.</p>
