                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history' Ahead of the manufacturer's first season in F1 as a works team, Audi are set to launch their own Driver Development Programme. McNish brings a wealth of experience to his role with the programme. Along with his racing background – which includes an F1 stint with Toyota in 2002 and three 24 Hours of Le Mans victories – the Scot has worked in team management roles and has held a long-standing relationship with the Audi brand. “To be entrusted with finding the cornerstones of the future Audi Revolut F1 Team is a great honour and a responsibility I am very passionate about,” said McNish. “This brand is built on a history of 'Vorsprung durch Technik', and that philosophy must apply to our young drivers as much as to our cars. “We are not just looking for raw speed; we are looking for the resilience, intelligence, and team-driven mindset that defines a future Audi champion. Our goal is to build a pathway that turns potential into precision and performance on the world stage. “With Allan McNish, we have a director who not only has an incredible track record in motorsport but also embodies the spirit and dedication of our operations. Under his leadership, this programme will be integral to our vision for 2030, our goal of building a winning team and shaping the future of Audi in Formula 1."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hamilton reflects on Ferrari's 'remarkable' journey at Maranello launch Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history' Mercedes have revealed the first images of their 2026 challenger, which features a revised livery in their iconic silver and black colours. The Silver Arrows, who fought back to finish second in the Teams' Championship last year, will run an unchanged line-up of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli this season. The W17, like all its rivals, will be smaller, narrower and lighter than its predecessor as it has been designed and built to sweeping new aerodynamic regulations. “Formula 1will undergo significant change in 2026, and we are prepared for that transition," said Team Principal and CEO Toto Wolff. "The new regulations demand innovation and absolute focus across every area of performance. We will continue to push hard in the months ahead." The eight-time world champions will then host a season launch event with their drivers, senior personnel and the W17 on February 2. Afterwards, the squad will then head to Bahrain for official pre-season testing, with two three-day tests planned for teams to refine their cars and start to chase performance.</p>
