                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Years ago, Valentin Vacherot would sometimes turn up at ATP Challenger events to simply watch his half-brother Benjamin Balleret compete. The two Monegasques would hit a few balls together in the evening before Vacherot, still a schoolboy at the time with no real thoughts of turning professional, headed back to his studies. “He was just playing tennis for fun,” Balleret told ATPTour.com, reflecting on Vacherot's teenage years. What once felt like a casual introduction to life on Tour has evolved into one of the most compelling coach-player partnerships, built not solely on contracts but on family and belief. It is a relationship that made global headlines in Shanghai in October last year, when Vacherot stormed through qualifying to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in series history (since 1990). Ironically, Vacherot began that Shanghai run as the No. Now 43, Balleret admits he never achieved the success he hoped for as a player, but the lessons learned have become central to his effectiveness as a coach. Before committing full time to Vacherot in 2022, Balleret built a strong coaching resume, guiding Gilles Muller to a career-high World No. 21 and working with Pierre-Hugues Herbert across a four-year spell that included three Grand Slam doubles titles. Those experiences helped shape a philosophy rooted in consistency rather than quick fixes. “Some things for me as a coach are important: work, respect… It doesn't matter who you coach, this has to be there. [You have to] work hard, respect and trust each other. After Vacherot completed four years of college tennis at Texas A&M — where he played alongside his cousin Arthur Rinderknech, whom he later defeated in the Shanghai final — the brothers formally joined forces. What followed were seasons of steady progress, difficult losses and continued emotional investment. “Sometimes it was difficult because it took time before what happened in Shanghai,” Balleret explained, referring to the sacrifices. “But we never stopped believing, working and trusting each other — that's more important. Then Shanghai happened… I think everybody talks enough about this, but it was really unreal to go until the end.” Valentin Vacherot and Benjamin Balleret celebrate in Shanghai. Coaching a family member presents its own challenges, particularly when the emotional lines between success and disappointment are thinner. For Balleret, learning when to step back as a brother and when to step in as a coach has been key to sustaining both the relationship and the results. When we win, I try to not be overwhelmed with the win because it's also my brother and I'm so happy for him. Sometimes it's difficult when you have a bad loss and not to be at the bottom, so I try to be really honest with him. So this has helped me, of course. For most of the day, I'm his brother and not his coach.” Shanghai also represented validation for a wider support team that had been carefully assembled over several seasons. “Val and I, we tried for three years to put together a team that would help him reach his goals,” Balleret said. Also his girlfriend, Emily… We try to work all together and for all those people also, not only for Val and me. “I'm so happy that Shanghai happened and that everybody's rewarded with all the work in the dark. We were working in the shadows for so many years. We're not looking for the spotlight, but you just feel good reaching the goal and being there with the top players and playing every week against those players.” You May Also Like: Why Vacherot's fairytale Shanghai run was crazier than anyone knew: 'Is this real life?' Vacherot showed the Shanghai title was no one-off. That will be the main challenge this year for Val and I.” More than 10 years after a young Valentin once watched from the stands without expectation, the tables have fully turned. Balleret is no longer the one being observed. Instead, he is the steady presence behind the scenes, guiding his half-brother through the brightest moments of a career that, not long ago, felt like nothing more than a game.

'”The idea of joining forces initially came up in the opening week of the 2026 season when Fernandez and her father were having a light-hearted conversation.“We said, ‘Wouldn't it be cool if Nick and I, we played doubles together?'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>29 seed Jovic into the second week of a major for the first time at just her sixth attempt. It's also her first win over a Top 10 player in four meetings. Two of the American teenager's three previous losses had come against Paolini, at Indian Wells and the US Open last year. Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play "I've been wanting this one for a while now," Jovic said in her on-court interview. In her press conference, Jovic revealed that she had been given some "very attentive tips" from former ATP World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in a conversation the previous day to incorporate into her game. "So I tried to do that, and it ended well. Jovic, the daughter of a Serbian father and Croatian mother, is still closely connected to her roots. She visits Serbia annually, both the capital of Belgrade and the southern town of Leskovac, where she has extended family. The link to one of Serbia's greatest athletes of all time is a natural one -- though she still finds it surreal. "You always think about those moments where you're going to meet your idols a little bit, and I think sometimes for certain people it can be a little bit deflating if they are maybe not as nice or as open as you anticipated. I think that happens a lot of times where you kind of see, oh, wow, that's definitely not how it looks like on TV. "I think he's almost even kinder and even more attentive outside the cameras than what he's portrayed. So I'm really grateful to have that advice." It forced Paolini to over-press in response -- she tallied 13 unforced errors and just four winners in the opener -- but the two-time major finalist made Jovic battle hard in the second. Paolini adjusted her tactics, pumping high balls to Jovic's backhand and extending the rallies. But despite those setbacks, it was younger player who got on the front foot in an impeccable tiebreak, taking the lead with sweetly-timed backhands down the line and reaching match point with a bold return winner -- her 20th of the match. "Being really aggressive and controlling the play. The result continues a rapid rise for Jovic, who was ranked No. She captured her first title on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz in Guadalajara last September, and started 2026 in fine form by reaching the Auckland semifinals and Hobart final. Her record this year is already 10-2, and she'll have the opportunity to extend that further against Yulia Putintseva in the fourth round.</p>

All three featured in the Australian Open draw as far back as 2007, and their remarkable staying power has emerged as one of the defining talking points of the tournament's opening week in Melbourne. 1 Aryna Sabalenka was the latest star to weigh in on her admiration for the trio. “These guys are legends, G.O.A.T.s, especially Novak,” Sabalenka said. Right now, he's really relevant with young boys. I feel like it depends on your physicality, of course, mentality, your approach to tennis. Yeah, at this age he's playing incredible tennis. “I feel like there is no age anymore in sport. But could she still be competing a decade from now? “I cannot say anything because you never know. Ideally for me, I would love to, I don't know, maybe have kids at 32 or something. “So probably we're going to see me being that grandma on tour trying. Hopefully I'll be pushing these young girls.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 100 matches at Grand Slam level, Carlos Alcaraz has compiled a record that places him in rarefied air. Alcaraz has surpassed legends, including Rafael Nadal and fellow ATP No. 1 Club member John McEnroe, who both went 86-14 across their first 100 major matches. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings is setting a standard that some of the sport's greatest names did not reach as quickly. Most wins after 100 major matches in the Open Era Novak Djokovic, a record 24-time major titlist and 10-time champion in Melbourne, went 79-21 across his first 100 Slam matches, while Swiss Roger Federer went 80-20. Alcaraz's great rival Jannik Sinner played his 100th major match (81-19) last year at Wimbledon, coincidentally against the Spaniard in the championship match. At just 22 years old, Alcaraz is a six-time major champion who this fortnight is chasing more history. Should he claim his maiden Australian Open title, Alcaraz would complete his Career Grand Slam and become the youngest player to achieve that feat. 141-ranked qualifier earned a milestone first major victory against Botic van de Zandschulp. In 2022, Alcaraz captured his maiden major crown at the US Open and with that victory, he became the youngest World No. One of 29 members in the prestigious ATP No. 1 Club, Alcaraz has already secured a memorable milestone with his latest victory Down Under.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 WTA Newcomer of the Year Victoria Mboko will face World No. Victoria Mboko's Australian Open breakthrough now carries her into a fourth-round meeting on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz with World No. Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play 17 seed sealed a second-week berth regrouped after failing to convert three match points in the second set of an eventual 7-6(5), 5-7, 6-3 win over No. 14 seed Clara Tauson in the third round on Friday, a win that puts her through to the fourth round of a Grand Slam event for the first time in her career in her fourth main draw played. Simultaneously, two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka was navigating her own tough test inside Rod Laver Arena to reach the second week in Melbourne for a sixth year in a row. Up against Anastasia Potapova, Sabalenka found herself reeled in from a 7-6(4), 4-0 lead -- and eventually, saved four set points in the second-set tiebreak to win 7-6(4), 7-6(7). Mboko did not come close to losing a set in each of her first two matches of her Australian Open debut and looked on course to do the same against Tauson. After edging out an opening set tiebreak after being ahead by a break of serve twice, Mboko came from an early break down to build a 7-6(5), 5-3 lead. But Tauson found her best tennis in the next games -- most crucially, when she was one point from defeat three times serving down 5-4. Mboko later said "self-belief" was what helped her get over the finish line in 2 hours and 19 minutes. She broke back immediately, the start of a four-game run of her own, and hammered back-to-back backhand winners to clinch the match from 30-30 in the final game. "I had so many chances in the second set but I have to give credit where its due, she was playing incredible tennis, so I just had to lock in in the important moments," Mboko said afterward. "When you have those chances like that, and you're up in the match, and you have opportunities to finish but don't take it, it can be very discouraging. But that's why there's a third set, and I was able to regroup, find my groove again, and get it done. "I was just trying to calm myself down, which wasn't working well today, but at the same time, I was trying to figure out how to connect my body. It seemed like everything was working separate. My brain was somewhere else, my arms were going one direction ... and I was looking to put pressure on her, to try to let her play basically, and somehow, magically, I was able to get this win." Sabalenka has now made the fourth-round or better at the last 13 Grand Slam events she has contested dating back to a third-round loss at Roland Garros in 2022. 2025 WTA Newcomer of the Year Victoria Mboko will face World No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 30-year-old Dutchman will look to tap into that giant-slaying pedigree again on Saturday, when he faces record 10-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic in the third round at Melbourne Park. It is a daunting assignment, but not an unfamiliar one for Van de Zandschulp, who has beaten ATP No. 1 Club members Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal within the past two years — and holds a recent victory over Djokovic himself. “I know what I'm capable of… It gives you a confidence boost when you see those names in the draw. Van de Zandschulp prevailed in his most recent Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Djokovic last year at Indian Wells, a match he remembers vividly. “I didn't feel great at that time, but now I am feeling a little bit better tennis-wise,” Van de Zandschulp said, reflecting on their Indian Wells clash. “Hopefully that helps me… Here in Australia, it's one of his favourite tournaments, one of his favourite courts, so it will be a different test. Djokovic is far from the only superstar Van de Zandschulp has tested — and toppled — in recent seasons. “Beating Alcaraz over five sets is not an easy task, but beating him 3-0 was something I couldn't imagine before stepping on court,” Van de Zandschulp said. “[Beating] Rafa was also pretty special because it's not often in tennis you know who you are going to play a month in advance. “I found out that it was going to be his last tournament and that we were going to play Spain in the quarters. If he was going to play, I would be the one to play him, so I thought a lot about the match when usually you don't have time to. That was, mentally, the toughest match for me.” When Van de Zandschulp walks onto Rod Laver Arena this weekend, it will mark his third consecutive year competing on the iconic stage. He fell to Jannik Sinner and Alex de Minaur in first-round encounters in the past two editions of the hard-court major. Now, the Dutchman is back in the Australian Open third round for the first time since 2022, having dropped just one set en route after victories over 27th seed Brandon Nakashima and Shang Juncheng. “The last two years, I had some tough draws with Sinner and De Minaur in the first round. Part of that renewed confidence can be traced back to a more settled offseason — a rarity in recent years. With Davis Cup commitments stretching deep into November, Van de Zandschulp has often had limited time to reset physically and mentally. “The last couple of years, we have played Davis Cup in November, so the offseason has been pretty tough, pretty busy,” he added. “Now I already had three weeks off, five weeks practice, so I think that did me pretty well, especially for the mind, being at home a little bit longer. I really enjoyed my offseason and have started fresh.” Against Djokovic on his most decorated stage, Van de Zandschulp will once again arrive as the underdog. Yet history suggests that is a role he knows how to embrace. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Mark Kovacs has known Frances Tiafoe since he was 12 years old. Kovacs, with the USTA at the time, worked with a group that included Tiafoe, Reilly Opelka, Taylor Fritz, Stefan Kozlov and Michael Mmoh. They were putting in the hard yards on and off the court, dreaming of eventually being where they are today. “That's sort of the same environment we're trying to create again. Commit to what you're great at, work on the details, be as consistent and deliberate as we possibly can.” Already a two-time US Open semi-finalist and a 2019 Australian Open quarter-finalist, Tiafoe on Friday evening will play sixth seed Alex de Minaur inside Rod Laver Arena, the No. On this big occasion, Kovacs is by Tiafoe's side again. They have kept in touch over the years, while Kovacs, known for his high-performance and performance physiology work as well as sports technology consultancy, has helped many clients across different sports and industries. At the end of last season, Tiafoe was making changes and reached out asking if Kovacs could help, even just for a reset during the preseason. Kovacs “wants the best” for Tiafoe, so he happily obliged. “As things went along, he asked me if I'd be willing to take more of a serious role and sort of help him on the journey,” Kovacs said. “And obviously, I had to think about it. “But I gave him a handful of non-negotiables and said, ‘Hey, if you're willing to do these things, then let's do it'. He was willing to do these things. You May Also Like: Alexander Bublik: The Ring Master According to Kovacs, their collaboration has been “great so far”. We all know he could play tennis at a high level,” Kovacs said. “Now it's about, ‘Can he take care of the little details on a daily basis? An example for Team Tiafoe is time. Being on schedule is of the utmost importance, and Kovacs has integrated something he saw done in another sport into Tiafoe's daily routine. “I worked in the NBA for a few years. There's a fine system in the NBA if you're late. “We abide by a fine system, all of us on the team. Kovacs and company have worked on changing certain habits and several things they are working towards to allow Tiafoe to perform the best he can on court. “There's a combination of things, and most of the time, it's on things that he wants to do to get the end goal, and I'm just giving him some steps along the way,” Kovacs said. “If you really want to get these outcomes, these are the deliberate processes that we have to go through. And we're really not focused on outcome at all. and setting a consistent standard that we all can live to. Because they have known one another for more than half of Tiafoe's life, they are able to cut to the chase. “I can speak to him very differently than even I can speak to maybe other players I've worked with in the past, if we don't have the same relationship,” Kovacs said. “And he can speak to me in a different way as well. He knows we're all here for a very simple purpose and we're working together to try to see if he can achieve it.” “I tell him every day, ‘You chose this life.
