FIFA has raised the bar for women's club football by unveiling a record-breaking prize pool for the first-ever FIFA Women's Champions Cup. The 2026 champions will earn USD 2.3 million, the highest single payout in the history of the women's club game, as the new intercontinental tournament makes its debut in London.

In total, nearly $4 million will be distributed among the six participating clubs based on performance. The two losing semifinalists will each receive USD 200,000, while Auckland United FC (New Zealand) and Wuhan Chegu Jiangda WFC (China PR), eliminated in the earlier rounds, will earn USD 100,000 each.

FIFA Secretary General Mattias Grafström said the prize structure reflects the organization's belief in the rapid growth of the women's club game and its commitment to making long-term, meaningful investments that elevate competitions worldwide.

The tournament will bring together the champion clubs from each confederation to determine the first women's intercontinental club champion. The final stage will take place in London, with the semifinals scheduled for Jan. 28, at Brentford Stadium.

Credit: AP/Jonathan Brady ZURICH — FIFA will pay $2.3 million in prize money to the club that wins the first Women's Champions Cup at Arsenal's stadium next week. The final stages in London are a warmup for a planned full Women's Club World Cup in 2028. European champion Arsenal will play ASFAR of Morocco after Gotham from the United States plays Corinthians of Brazil in back-to-back semifinals on Wednesday at the home of Premier League club Brentford. Two continental champions already eliminated in earlier rounds — Auckland United from Oceania and Wuhan Chegu Jiangda representing Asia — each get $100,000. The prize money is “a clear statement of the belief in women's club football and the players, teams and competitions driving its continued rise,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafström said in a statement. Arsenal got more than 1.5 million euros ($1.8 million) in prize money for winning the UEFA Women's Champions League last season. FIFA paid $1 billion among 32 teams in the men's 2025 Club World Cup. That tournament in the United States was backed by Saudi Arabian money to ensure influential European clubs got the prize money they sought to agree to take part.

Arsenal will be one of the four competing teams in a few weeks time after winning the Champions League in 2025 David Ramos/Getty Images

The winners of the inaugural Women's Champions Cup will earn $2.3million (£1.69m; €1.95m), FIFA announced on Friday.

The global football organisation said on top of the “highest single payout ever awarded in women's football”, the second-placed team will earn $1million and the third and fourth-placed sides will earn $200,000 for participating in a prize pot totalling $6m.

The maiden intercontinental tournament — between January 28 and February 1 — will see the best club from each confederation (UEFA, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL) in a calendar year compete over two semi-finals and a final.

This year, Gotham FC (United States) will face SC Corinthians (Brazil) while Arsenal will take on ASFAR (Morocco) before the winners of each tie compete for the title at the Emirates Stadium in London. The champions of the federations representing Oceania (Auckland United FC) and Asia (Wuhan Chegu Jiangda WFC) were eliminated in the earlier rounds and will receive $100,000 each.

“Our focus is clear,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom said in a release on Friday. “To continue investing in, growing and elevating women's club football at every level – ensuring that opportunity, visibility and value keep pace with the exceptional performances seen on the pitch.”

The promised prize money is only $200,000 shy of the $2.5m awarded to the winners of 2025's global seven-a-side tournament that featured clubs such as Manchester United, Manchester City, winners Bayern Munich and San Diego Wave. By contrast, the women's Champions League winners last year won €350,000 ($412,417), though money was also given out in the group stages.

The Champions Cup is set to take place annually in the other three years of the Club World Cup cycle, of which the first edition will be held in 2028.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Public transportation systems across the U.S. are “poised to get” a $100.3M assist from the federal government as Congress considers “directing more money to transit agencies” in cities that are hosting this year's FIFA World Cup games, according to Michelle Kaske of BLOOMBERG NEWS. The allocation is included in a bipartisan appropriations bill that “would fund spending on defense, transportation, housing, education and health” through FY2026. The legislation also includes $94.3M for public transit needs in and around L.A for when it hosts the 2028 L.A. Olympic. The U.S. House is set to approve the appropriations bill on Thursday before it heads to the US Senate next week. Congress has until Jan. 30 to pass spending measures and avoid a government shutdown. According to legislation, the exact amount of funding each transit agency receives will be “calculated by stadium seating capacity and the number of matches in each host city” (BLOOMBERG NEWS, 1/22). CITY IMPACT: KC2026 President Pam Kramer said, “We know that any base camp here will be an impact.” She added, “There are lots of factors, but we think that the base camps can be not only an economic impact, but there's a cultural opportunity here.” In K.C., Pete Grathoff noted Kramer “likened the World Cup base camps to spring training where teams stay for two months at a city in Florida or Arizona, and fans come to see the players.” But at the World Cup base camps in K.C., “more than fans are expected.” Kramer said, “For the base camps, there will be families of players, coaches, staff. In some cases, there will be sponsors, certainly the embassies, I think with base camps aside, with Argentina playing here, and their massive fan following, I think they will have several representatives from their embassies, several consul generals, counselors on the ground here in Kansas City” (K.C. HELPING HAND: USA TODAY's Marcus Smith noted FIFA President Gianni Infantino confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump will co-present the World Cup winner's trophy on July 19. Nobody can touch this trophy.” Smith noted it is a “sacred tradition” (USA TODAY, 1/22).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Sen. John Cornyn took a break from the campaign trail Thursday afternoon to join Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson and local and federal law enforcement leaders at the Dallas Police headquarters for a conversation on public safety during this summer's FIFA World Cup games. The One Big Beautiful Bill, which Congress passed last July, included a $625 million appropriation for security during the World Cup, and Cornyn stated that he believes Texas will receive around $100 million of that funding. According to Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux, the funds will be key to covering overtime hours worked by Dallas and Arlington police officers during the region's nine games. The funds can also be used for equipment needs, though it was unclear from Thursday's briefing which technologies the departments may need. The Department of Homeland Security announced a separate federal funding package in January to develop drone surveillance programs and counter-drone technologies ahead of the games, something Rick Burkhead, a regional safety liaison with FIFA, described as “a concern.” Cornyn — perhaps not that far off from the campaign trail after all — emphasized that the funding is a crucial step in affirming the federal government's support of local law enforcement efforts. I know there are some who say we should defund the police, or we should abolish ICE, or we should interfere with law enforcement officers enforcing the laws of Congress,” said Cornyn. Present at Thursday's briefing was Christina Foley, special agent in charge of the United States Secret Service. Foley will serve as the federal coordinator for the Dallas matches, communicating between local and federal law enforcement agencies. Five departments within the Department of Homeland Security will be active in monitoring security threats throughout the World Cup, Foley said. So did the media members present on Thursday. Millions of soccer fans are expected to visit Dallas for the World Cup, which Johnson touted as an “incredible opportunity to market our neck of the woods to the world.” But details were also few on whether local law enforcement leaders are communicating with federal immigration officials about plans to ensure that international visitors are not affected by President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department stopped issuing visas to immigrants from 75 countries, including several that have already qualified for the North American games. Still, the American Immigration Council has warned that public arrests by ICE agents, fast-changing federal policy, and altercations like the shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent may have a chilling effect on those who are willing to travel to the U.S. for the games. When asked how North Texas officials were preparing for this summer's intersection of international visitors and ICE's presence, Cornyn described Trump's federal immigration policy as part of the “mandate” he received from voters, said ICE's being in North Texas “should not be a problem at all,” and moved to the next question.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a new highest-paid player in women's soccer. The National Women's Soccer League is only 13 years old. Women's professional leagues have come and gone in the U.S., compared to Europe and globally where soccer is a much more established sport. Top-tier players have often left the U.S. to play abroad, where they can earn significantly bigger salaries (the previous top-paid player was in Barcelona). Meanwhile, American soccer has struggled with pay equity and the U.S. Women's National Team's famous lawsuit. The Washington Spirit, which is owned by billionaire Michele Kang, wanted to keep her. After months of back-and-forth, the league debuted a new “high-impact player” rule that allowed teams to pay extra for star players, determined by both on-field ability and commercial potential. There's still some uncertainty regarding this rule; the players' union has objected to it, saying it was not negotiated and violated their collective-bargaining agreement. ESPN reports that while the rule's ultimate form is still up in the air, Rodman's contract is still a contract and will be honored. In many ways, it's been a challenging year for women's sports. Hyper-growth comes with growing pains; cracks in the foundation appear. The WNBA is currently operating without a contract with its players, who demand a greater share of the league's revenue. While we wait for a resolution that will support the continued growth of women's basketball, in women's soccer Rodman's contract can set a new standard. For now, the NWSL has figured out how to hold onto its best. The bill requires institutions to distribute information about pregnant students' rights on campus, including that abortion is not their "only option."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MANCHESTER – World Cup ticket prices are at exorbitant levels yet fans are still queueing up in their millions to attend soccer's biggest tournament. There is a such an over-demand for the event being staged in the United States, Canada and Mexico this year that FIFA president Gianni Infantino said the governing body would need to hold a draw to allocate tickets to fans and acknowledged that prices would likely be even higher on resale platforms. "Now for this World Cup in four weeks (on sale), we have the request for 1,000 years of World Cups at once. It could also lead to a lot of disappointed fans being driven to resale sites where tickets are being listed for multiples of their face value. FIFA does not resell tickets or set prices on the platform, but can cash in for a second time by taking a 30% cut from any sale. He said all 104 matches at the World Cup would be sold out, meaning “tickets will probably be resold at even higher prices.” Soccer fans have reacted with outrage to the pricing strategy for this year's tournament. FIFA is asking for up to $8,680 per ticket, but after criticism said it would offer a selection of $60 tickets for every game to the 48 national federations participating. Costs can be even more exorbitant through sellers trying to make a massive profit on the secondary market. Sellers also set their own prices on FIFA's marketplace and enormously inflated listings further highlight the spiralling costs of the tournament for fans, while the governing body stands to make even more money, having already sold tickets at face value. The list price for a category one ticket for the final at MetLife Stadium on July 19 is $8,680, but that is subject to change as dynamic pricing will be utilized at a World Cup for the first time. The lowest list price for an equivalent ticket on FIFA's marketplace this week was $16,000 - almost twice as much. A fan group, Football Supporters Europe, already has accused FIFA of a “monumental betrayal” over its pricing and is also critical of its resale platform. Ronan Evain, executive director of FSE, told The Associated Press he believed “a significant proportion of tickets that are sold and put on the resale platform are there just for profit.” Other resale sites are also listing World Cup tickets. FIFA says its platform provides a safe and secure way for fans to resell tickets. It was also in control of setting resale prices, which could be higher or lower than face value. “We are focused on ensuring fair access to our game for existing but also prospective fans. FIFA resale fees are aligned with North American industry trends across various sports and entertainment sectors.” There was outcry last month when FIFA announced its latest general release of tickets priced from $140 to $8,680. FIFA defends its pricing model, saying it “reflects the existing market practice for major entertainment and sporting events within our hosts on a daily basis, soccer included.” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinity Rodman didn't just sign a contract this week—she rewrote the economic ceiling of women's soccer, especially in the United States. RELATED: 5 Cameron Brink Card Sales from 2025: Is it too late to get in on This Star? Salary breakthroughs tend to coincide with broader visibility, league-wide change, and a player crossing from star into market reference point. In Rodman's case, the deal didn't just reward performance, it helped force structural change, prompting the NWSL to introduce a new “High Impact Player” mechanism (quickly nicknamed the “Rodman Rule”) that allows teams to spend up to $1 million over the cap to retain truly elite talent. RELATED:  Top 5 Liv Morgan Card Sales of 2025 Rodman's rise has been fast, loud, and largely uninterrupted. By 19, she already held playoff records, and in 2022 she signed a reported $1.1 million extension that briefly made her the league's highest-paid player at the time. Even before this latest contract, the Spirit had effectively built around her as a franchise face: high-energy winger, defensive pest, transition threat, and marketing centerpiece rolled into one. Internationally, Rodman has quickly become one of the defining figures of the U.S. women's national team's transition period. Since her senior debut in 2022, she has earned 47 caps with double‑digit goals and assists while helping the USWNT win the Concacaf W Championship, three straight SheBelieves Cups, the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup, and Olympic gold at Paris 2024. Armed with speed, physicality, pressing, and highlight-reel finishes, her game translates cleanly to big moments and global broadcasts. Even after a recent back-injury layoff, her return to national-team camps under Emma Hayes has reinforced that she's viewed as a long-term pillar, not just a supporting piece. She chose soccer over basketball, turned pro instead of playing college soccer at Washington State, and reached franchise-player status before turning 24. That blend of legacy, independence, and early success has helped push her into mainstream awareness. With club salaries historically topping out in the mid-six figures—nd even global stars in Europe often sitting below the $1 million mark—Rodman's deal stands as a genuine market reset. An NWSL winger in her early prime now sits at or above the club salary level of Ballon d'Or winners and Champions League icons. Contracts don't make careers, but they crystallize them. A lifelong collector of sneakers, sports cards, and pop culture, he also advises companies shaping the future of the hobby and sports. He's driven by a curiosity about why people collect—and what those items reveal about the moments and memories that matter most. - SPORTS ILLUSTRATED IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ABG-SI LLC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This past September, United States Women's National Team's (USWNT) 21-year-old star Alyssa Thompson signed a contract to transfer from the National Women's Soccer League's (NWSL) Angel City FC to Chelsea FC in England's Women's Super League (WSL). Thompson's move comes amid a growing wave of USWNT players heading overseas. In recent years, starting center back Naomi Girma and defender Emily Fox have also made the jump to European clubs. The NWSL operates under a $3.5 million team salary cap, while the WSL does not currently enforce such a cap. Previously, when soccer icons Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan played for Lyon in 2013 and 2017, respectively, they reportedly earned more in a single month than many NWSL players made in an entire season. European leagues also offer prestige and increased competitive opportunities. By comparison, the NWSL has only recently introduced additional competitions—and those tournaments have yet to gain widespread traction. The NWSL is largely composed of American players whereas European leagues feature rosters filled with international talent. Competing with and against players from different countries can help athletes develop their game and better prepare for major international tournaments such as the FIFA Women's World Cup and the Olympics. Before 2022, many USWNT players were signed as “federation players” under U.S. Soccer contracts, making them the highest-paid athletes in the league. This system encouraged national team players to remain in the NWSL, as all USWNT players during the 2015 and 2019 World Cup cycles were based domestically. Now, players are free to sign wherever they choose. Five starters from the most recent Olympic roster are currently playing abroad. USWNT head coach and former Chelsea Women's head coach Emma Hayes has even faced criticism for the growing migration of players to Europe—though she has emphasized that the decisions ultimately rest with the athletes. However, the departure of elite players like Girma and Thompson raises concerns about whether the league's overall quality and star power could decline over time. There is a harsh reality to acknowledge: Women's soccer is still not among the most widely followed sports in the United States. If you ask a random person to name a women's soccer player, they will likely mention household names like Alex Morgan or Hope Solo who are now retired or no longer active at the top professional level. Among current players, the most recognizable names tend to come from recent U.S. national team and Olympic rosters such as Mallory Swanson, Trinity Rodman and Sophia Wilson. While all three currently play in the NWSL, they have also attracted strong interest from top European clubs, reflecting the growing global demand for elite American talent. In response, the NWSL has begun taking steps to retain top talent after European clubs pursued Rodman. To keep Rodman in the NWSL, the league introduced the High Impact Player Rule (HIP), now commonly referred to as the “Rodman Rule.” This policy allows teams to spend an additional $1 million beyond the salary cap to sign or retain elite players who meet specific criteria, such as national team minutes or high rankings on year-end lists like ESPN's Top 50. The bottom line is that many of these top-performing athletes are not paid at a level that reflects their talent, workload or impact. Outside of a small group of high-profile stars, many NWSL players earn salaries that are barely a livable wage. To put the gap into perspective, the minimum salary for an NFL rookie is approximately $840,000, while Rodman earns roughly $275,000 annually from her NWSL contract. Even Morgan, widely considered one of the most recognizable women's soccer players in the world, earned around $250,000 per year in league salary at her peak. For many of these top athletes, a significant portion of their income comes from off-field endorsement deals—an opportunity that is far less accessible for lesser-known players, further widening the financial gap within the sport. Despite these challenges, the NWSL continues to look ahead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinity Rodman is staying in the National Women's Soccer League. According to ESPN's Jeff Kassouf, the three-year deal is worth $2 million annually, “a world record.” “First off, it's amazing, but it's also relieving to finally have pen to paper, signed, confirmed,” Rodman said on SportsCenter Thursday evening. Rodman entered free agency at the end of last season, but the process of re-signing her created league-wide issues. European teams — which do not have salary caps — attempted to lure the 23-year-old abroad, competing with an NWSL salary cap that would have limited Rodman's earning potential. The National Women's Soccer League Players Association filed a grievance before the NWSL created a “High Impact Player” rule, allowing teams to go above the salary cap for a certain caliber of player. “It's been a roller coaster of emotions through it because there's one side of wanting to be paid well, wanting to stay in the US and represent my country, but also there's the other aspect — the other piece — of we want to get a lot more players paid this and continue to raise the bar for that," Rodman said. “Again, celebrating me, but at the same time, it's a big moment for soccer as a whole and another stepping (stone) for another opportunity for somebody else and hopefully numerous people around the league.” She was a member of the 2020-2021 Association for Women in Sports Media... more The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Advance Local.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The LEGO Group are building towards 2026 in serious style. Ahead of next summer's tournament, LEGO will roll out a dedicated product portfolio celebrating the biggest stage in the game, starting with the most iconic symbol of them all. Launching in March 2026, the LEGO FIFA World Cup Official Trophy is the first-ever, officially licensed 1:1 LEGO replica of world football's ultimate prize. Built from an impressive 2,842 pieces, it's designed as a centrepiece — something to build, display and obsess over as the tournament approaches. A hidden scene sits inside the upper globe, revealed via a pullable slip, featuring the 2026 World Cup logo and an exclusive branded minifigure holding a miniature version of the trophy itself — a subtle nod to every fan's dream of lifting it one day. Beneath the base, a printed plaque lists every World Cup winner since 1974, grounding the set firmly in football history. Two different finishes — drum-lacquered bricks and moulded gold pieces — combine to give the trophy its unmistakable sheen. It's also the first LEGO set ever to use this volume of gold-coloured elements, underlining just how special this one is meant to be. And what better way to show it off than with the help of Roberto Carlos, Cafu, Iker Casillas, Sami Khedira and Marco Materazzi. Five different journeys to the summit of world football. There's laughter, disbelief, and that familiar glint in the eye that only comes from remembering what it feels like to lift the real thing. Roberto Carlos and Cafu waste no time arguing over who gets to take the trophy home, before all five icons are handed personalised sets of their own. Beyond the jokes, though, there's a genuine sense of reflection. And on why a LEGO World Cup trophy might just be the perfect bridge between generations of fans. As Roberto Carlos puts it: “Winning the FIFA World Cup was one of the most incredible moments of my life, and I'll never forget what it felt like to hold that trophy. I know we couldn't have achieved it without our amazing fans and what this trophy means to them. Now, with the LEGO World Cup Trophy set, fans can create their own version and bring that magic home. This isn't just about building a trophy; it's about sharing the love of football with family and friends.” The LEGO Editions FIFA World Cup Official Trophy building set is available for pre-order now at LEGO.com. Each piece is a work of art, designed to mirror each city's identity and football culture before bringing the biggest competition in football to their doorstep. The design pays homage to all three host nations with some bold graphics, blending performance, aesthetics, and culture for the game's biggest stage. And yep, it's still going to be the first World Cup to be played in November and December. Having collaborated since 2010 FIFA and Lous Vuitton have taken their relationship to new heights as the brand have revealed an entire collection of leather goods along with the official World Cup Trophy travel case. In what is surely set to be one of the last big additions to the FIFA franchise as we know it, EA Sports has revealed an overview of features for its FIFA Women's World Cup Australia and New Zealand 2023 update. adidas and FIFA have revealed their 2018 World Cup tournament trophies for the Golden Boot, Golden Ball and Golden Glove, revealed this week at a special adidas pop-up store in Moscow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations when it comes to the US-shaped problem Could European countries really decide to boycott the World Cup this summer? It is an astonishing question to be asking in 2026 and an indictment of the bind in which, as Donald Trump sows confusion around a potential annexation of Greenland, the world's most popular sport finds itself. While flexibility is essential in a volatile, fast-moving situation, there is an acceptance that no one can afford to be asleep if the time for action comes. That is why there is a growing belief that Europe's governing bodies, whether led by individual federations or by Uefa itself, must cohere behind a common position – or at least prepare one. Sources have described a tightening of unity since Trump, whose suggestion on Wednesday he will not take Greenland by force – and later that there was the outlines of a deal – must surely be treated with caution. While some federations are understood to have been relatively unbothered by the spectacle of Trump receiving a peace prize from the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in December, choosing in certain cases to find a funny side, the gravity of current events is lost on no one. There is a consensus that Fifa has chosen to politicise itself; that could bring consequences if the US president intensifies his designs on a territory that belongs, indisputably, to a Uefa member in Denmark. Russia was quickly frozen out of international competition after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, essentially because other countries refused to compete against them. In the event Trump's latest pronouncements stand the test of time, it means any whispers about a boycott will remain hushed for now. None of Europe's FAs are in a rush to go public with a stance and plenty may follow their governments' positions. The question is whether that would be enough for those who feel football has a unique opportunity to assert itself. There are certainly some within football's corridors of power who feel a stand could be made while politicians prevaricate. Trump has wedded himself to the World Cup project since his first term, naturally making mention of his own hard work in steering the bid when it succeeded in 2018. The prospect of visible, palpable damage to his latest big moment would not be easy for the president to stomach. Perhaps, if Uefa and its federations flexed their muscles, Infantino could even feel compelled to engage in far-reaching diplomacy with his friend around the Greenland problem. Some within Uefa would strain at the leash to see Infantino put in his place. More moderate forces close to the organisation may not favour incendiary moves this time, with the future of global football facing enough uncertainty, but the sport has been planted in uncharted waters and could find it needs to swim hard. The hypotheticals continue but they cannot be purely dismissed as such. Recent events have underlined that football's leadership must be agile and the message is hitting home.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by LSEG. Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports on new details about why President Donald Trump wants control of Greenland on ‘Special Report.' France's sports minister addressed questions about whether the country would consider boycotting the 2026 FIFA World Cup in response to the U.S.'s recent "framework" deal for control of part of Greenland. French Minister of Sports, Youth and Community Life Marina Ferrari told reporters this week the country has "no desire" to skip the cup, which takes place in North America this year. "As it stands now, there is no desire from the ministry for a boycott of this great competition," Ferrari said. "Now, I will not anticipate what could happen, but I have also heard voices raised from certain political blocs. I am one who believes in keeping sport separate [from politics]. The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport." The Greenlandic flag flies in Nuuk, Greenland, Jan. 20, 2026. Far-left French politician Éric Coquerel has called for the U.S. to be stripped of World Cup hosting rights and has suggested a boycott by France. "Seriously, one imagines going to play the World Cup in a country who attacks its ‘neighbours,' threatens to invade Greenland and rides rough shod over international law?" Trump announced on Truth Social Wednesday that the framework for a deal has been made for the U.S. to gain control of parts of Greenland. "Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region," he wrote.

"Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland." During a speech at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Switzerland Thursday, Trump seemed to indicate that he would not use force to seize Greenland. Despite similar calls for sanctions in response to Trump's foreign policy, the U.S. has not been penalized by any major sports bodies for its recent intervention in Venezuela either. "The ability to bring athletes together, no matter where they come from, is fundamental to the future of values-based, truly global sport, which can give hope to the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinity Rodman agreed to a new contract with the NWSL's Washington Spirit to keep her with the team through 2028. It comes with an annual salary of over $1 million, her agent Mike Senkowski of Upper 90 Sports Group told ESPN. “I've made the DMV my home and the Spirit my family, and I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,” Rodman said in a statement. “I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed. Rodman had been a free agent since the end of 2025 when her contract expired, and there was an ongoing saga to try to sign the star to a new deal. The Spirit and Rodman attempted to get creative to make a deal work in November by backloading a four-year deal worth over $1 million per year, but commissioner Jessica Berman stepped in to cancel the contract. In an attempt to keep Rodman in the NWSL, the league's board of governors approved a new rule dubbed the High Impact Player rule, allowing teams to spend up to $1 million over the cap on contracts for star players who meet specific performance and marketability criteria. “Trinity is a generational player, but more importantly, she represents the future of this club and the future of women's soccer,” Washington Spirit Michele Kang said in a statement. At the Spirit, we are building something enduring: a club that competes for championships every year, invests in excellence and creates an environment where world-class players can thrive long-term. Trinity choosing to continue her career in Washington is a powerful statement about what we are building here.”</p>
