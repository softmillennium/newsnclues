A California man was arrested and his home was raided after he was accused of stealing millions of taxpayer dollars meant for the homeless. California officials have arrested Alexander Soofer, who allegedly used tens-of-millions of taxpayer dollars meant to house and feed the homeless to fund his lavish lifestyle, Fox News has learned. Soofer was the executive director of the charity Abundant Blessings, which received government funding for its work. First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli said in a news conference on Friday that Soofer was charged with wire fraud, a felony that carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. "I want to tell you a little bit about his organization, Abundant Blessings. It was a South Los Angeles-based charity whose purpose is to help house and properly feed the estimated 72,000 homeless people living in the greater Los Angeles area. His organization received more than $23 million in taxpayer funds for the purpose of housing and feeding the homeless," Essayli said. "California was pushing this money out quickly. A lot of money went out the door, with, frankly, very little vetting, very little checks and balances. Essayli said that rather than providing the needy with "at least three healthy, balanced, nutritious meals a day," which he was allegedly contracted to do, Soofer gave them ramen noodles and a microwave. Soofer allegedly used the money to put a down payment on his $7 million mansion, pay for his children's private school tuition and to purchase a $125,000 Range Rover, according to Essayli. People are literally dying, and this guy is out vacationing, buying homes, buying Range Rovers and going shopping." Law enforcement took Soofer into custody in a pre-dawn bust at his multi-million-dollar mansion in Los Angeles. Federal authorities, who claim Soofer used the funds to make improvements on his luxury home, later arrived to tow his Range Rover. Tents of homeless people are seen on a sidewalk amid rainfall on Jan. 3, 2026, in Los Angeles, Calif. (Qian Weizhong/VCG via Getty Images) The bust comes after independent journalist Nick Shirley, who worked to expose the fraud scandal in Minnesota, told Congress that the fraud in California could be "worse" than what he found in the North Star State. Shirley made the remark in response to a question posed by Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., about whether his state was showing similar signs of fraud to what was seen in Minnesota. When asked to elaborate, he noted the missing $24 billion in homeless funds, as well as various other projects and issues that, in his opinion, appear to signal fraud. "California has spent $24 billion in the last five years on homelessness, and no one can account for where that money has really gone," Essayli told "Fox & Friends" earlier this month. Gavin Newsom speaks during a press conference about "New Funding for Homelessness and Mental Health Efforts" and criticized President Trump over ICE operations in San Francisco, Calif., on Jan. 16, 2026. In April, Essayli launched a task force to investigate corruption in California, with a focus on homeless services. The task force has already resulted in federal charges against two men accused of using real estate projects to exploit the state's homelessness system for personal profit. Essayli said those cases, which involve millions of dollars in alleged fraud, are only the "tip of the iceberg." This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• New wave of protests: Hundreds of Minnesota businesses are expected to close and a rally is planned in Minneapolis as organizers urge people to protest the Trump administration's latest surge in its aggressive, nationwide immigration crackdown. • Preschooler taken by ICE: A 5-year-old is one of the latest children caught up in the mass deportation campaign after he and his father were taken by federal agents outside their Minneapolis-area home. • Church protest in focus: Three people who denounced federal immigration agents in a protest at a St. Paul church have been arrested – and more arrests could be coming. “We're going to take them off the streets wholesale,” he said. Bovino accused the media of failing to cover stories about undocumented immigrants committing violent crimes. He took as an example the 2023 killing of Rachel Morin, which was covered by both local and national media outlets. ICE Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Marcos Charles accused “political activists” and the media of trying “to deceive the American public about ICE and our operations.” It's been a common theme for DHS officials, who have railed against “fake news” and pushed back on reporting about immigration enforcement operations. Charles said ICE is arresting “dangerous criminal, illegal aliens” – a contrast to data showing the agency has detained nearly 75,000 people without criminal records. Charles characterized the anti-ICE protest that disrupted Sunday services at a Southern Baptist church in St. Paul as a “riot” and said it was “not a peaceful protest.” Dozens of demonstrators rushed into Cities Church during worship, chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good” and saying in part they were protesting one of the church's pastors believed to be a senior ICE official. Church leaders and politicians, especially on the right, have decried the protest for interrupting a religious service, and multiple people have been arrested. But there haven't been reports of physical violence committed by demonstrators – just disruption. The 5-year-old who was taken by federal agents from the driveway of his home in Minneapolis after returning from preschool is now being held with his father at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dilley, Texas, according to school district officials and a family attorney. And detainees have described that same facility as a place of prolonged stays and despondent children, with limited access to potable water and agents offering money for families to voluntarily leave the country, court declarations filed in December show. Read more about life inside the Dilley detention center here. Asked about discrepancies between federal and Minnesota officials' counts of non-US citizens in state custody, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Marcos Charles said Friday that ICE has “better databases.” Schnell said Minnesota conducted a point-in-time survey of county jails, finding a total of 301 individuals with ICE detainers — nowhere close to the federal figure. A top ICE official denies allegations from a Minneapolis school that the 5-year-old son of an asylum seeker was used as bait to capture his father. “(Adrian Alexander) Conejo Arias was not walking to school with the child, and we did not target the child,” said Marcos Charles, executive assistant director of Enforcement and Removal Operations. ICE officials say the 5-year-old, Liam Conejo Ramos, seen being loaded into a federal vehicle while wearing a backpack and blue beanie with bunny ears, had been abandoned by his father when he saw agents approaching. “(Agents) cared for him, took him to get something to eat from a drive-thru restaurant and spent hours ensuring he was taken care of,” Charles said. Charles countered, saying the agents were trying to reunite Ramos with other family members. The father eventually asked to have Liam stay with him, Charles said. “We do everything in our power not to separate families,” said Charles. At church services, they screamed and harassed children,” Marcos Charles, ICE's executive assistant director of enforcement and removal operations, said at a Friday morning news conference. Demonstrators on Sunday rushed into Cities Church during worship, saying in part they were protesting one of the church's pastors, who they claimed was a senior ICE official. Once inside, they questioned another pastor about his role, according to a protester who spoke with CNN. Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino said at a Friday morning news conference that “we are experts in dealing with children,” in the wake of controversy after a 5-year-old boy and his father were taken by ICE in Minneapolis. Border Patrol officials are “experts in dealing with children, not because we want to be, but because we have to be,” he said. Organizers of a march protesting the surge of ICE agents to Minnesota will face a particularly challenging opponent this afternoon: the weather. The wind chill in Minneapolis is not expected to rise above -20 today. The march that was originally scheduled to begin and end at the city's Commons Park will instead conclude with an indoor rally at Target Center. The event is part of a broader Friday strike activists have called for, encouraging people to stay home from school and work and for businesses to close. The Department of Homeland Security is calling for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey to turn over a convicted sex offender they said federal agents were searching for when they dragged a US citizen from his St. Paul home on Sunday. “This is exactly what we have been saying: We need state and local law enforcement engagement and information so we don't have to have such a presence on the streets,” reads a post on X from the agency. Paul Schnell, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections, told CNN yesterday he had notified DHS that the offender was in state custody. Some context: ICE agents bashed open ChongLy “Scott” Thao's door before detaining him and leading him outside in his underwear in frigid conditions, according to the Associated Press. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Thao of living with two convicted sex offenders, the targets of the operation, and said both were still at large. But Schnell said that one of those sex offenders is already in prison. The Trump administration has ordered a review of federal funding sent to more than a dozen Democratic-led states, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. The request signals a dramatic escalation of the Trump administration's increasingly aggressive strategy to target federal funding in blue states — an unprecedented policy approach triggered during last year's government shutdown that has rapidly accelerated in the wake of sweeping fraud allegations in Minnesota. Federal officers in tactical gear line up at the driveway of a large block-shaped building wedged between the city limits of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The man behind the name — Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple — would be standing outside with protesters if he were still alive, one historian and scholar said. Now, the Whipple building is where many people are temporarily detained after being swept up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — now facing a subpoena from the Trump administration in an investigation of possible obstruction of justice — says the dramatic increase in federal immigration agents is not making his city safer. It's not even about immigration,” Frey told CNN's Sara Sidner. President Donald Trump has called Frey “a fool” for his support of the city's Somali community and posted on Truth Social earlier this month, “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” “You don't need to take my word for it,” Frey said. “You can listen to exactly what Donald Trump is saying.” The United Nations Human Rights Chief is calling on the Trump administration to ensure immigration and enforcement practices “respect the human dignity and due process rights” and to end practices that he says are tearing apart families. “Individuals are being surveilled and detained, sometimes violently, … often solely on mere suspicion of being undocumented migrants,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said in a news release as he questioned the administration's concern for dignity and humanity. The high commissioner also said he is worried these policies are often enforced without carefully assessing each person's situation. He called for “an independent and transparent investigation” into what he said is a concerning rise in the number of detainee deaths while in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. A Cumberland County, Maine correctional officer recruit was detained by federal agents in Portland's Bayside neighborhood, according to the sheriff. A Cumberland County, Maine correctional officer recruit was detained by federal agents in Portland's Bayside neighborhood, according to the sheriff. A Chicago-area man accused of offering a $10,000 bounty for the life of Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino over Snapchat was found not guilty Thursday,  the Associated Press reported. Juan Espinoza Martinez, 37, faced up to 10 years in prison on a murder-for-hire charge. Defense attorneys told jurors the government didn't present any evidence against Espinoza Martinez, who they said didn't follow up on the messages and had only a few dollars in his bank account. He does not have legal permission to stay in the United States. The strike, organized by local faith leaders and unions, urges Minnesotans to avoid shopping and stay home from work or school, according to CNN affiliate KARE. There is also a rally planned in downtown Minneapolis uniting under the slogan “ICE out of Minnesota.” The statewide strike comes a day after Vice President JD Vance, who visited Minneapolis, blamed a lack of cooperation from local authorities for some of the problems in the city, and suggested that is why ICE needs such a robust presence in Minneapolis. The attorney for 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, who were taken by federal agents this week, said the two were “not eluding ICE in any way.” He also pushed back on Vice President JD Vance's comment that agents were arresting an “illegal alien.” The attorney for 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, who were taken by federal agents earlier this week, said the two were “not eluding ICE in any way.” He also pushed back on Vice President JD Vance's comment that ICE agents were arresting an “illegal alien.” It's a move, CNN's Josh Campbell reports, that can potentially ramp up already tense interactions between the public and immigration officers.

Gavin Newsom in an interview with Politico over his rhetoric at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent took aim at Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his political stunt at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, brushing the left-wing governor off as operating with a "brain the size of a walnut." "I think Gavin Newsom may be cracking up, some of these things he's saying. I think he may be in over his hairdo," Bessent told Politico's "The Conversation." Newsom traveled to Davos, Switzerland, recently to attend the World Economic Forum, where President Donald Trump's presence headlined the event as the administration pressures European leaders to strike a deal for the U.S. to acquire Greenland. The Democratic governor is a longtime political opponent of Trump's, and issued a warning to foreign leaders to grow a "backbone" with Trump in a political broadside against the White House from the forum Monday. His attack included saying he should have brought "kneepads" for foreign dignitaries interacting with Trump while also comparing Trump to a T.rex. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent slammed California Gov. Gavin Newsom over his political stunt and commentary at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "This is diplomacy with Donald Trump. You mate with him, or he devours you, one or the other," Newsom said Tuesday. "The Europeans could be (devoured) if they continue down this path and process. "Being on the national stage is very different than being governor of California with no signature achievements, but to say strange things, like President Trump is a Tyrannosaurus rex. Newsom did in fact bring kneepads to the forum as part of a political stunt, calling them "Trump signature series kneepads" during a speech in Davos, Switzerland. Amid his meetings in Davos, Newsom was photographed with left-wing billionaire Alex Soros, the son of billionaire philanthropist George Soros. Gavin Newsom holds a knee protector at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 22, 2026. Bessent quipped: "If you brought the kneepads, maybe that was for his meeting with Alex Soros. The Treasury secretary added that Newsom knows "less about economics than" former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he described as "a terrible place to be in." Bessent's remarks to Politico are his latest this week against Newsom, comparing him to a mix of "American Psycho" main character Patrick Bateman "meets Sparkle Beach Ken" doll Tuesday. "We're deeply in their head," Newsom said in response to Bessent's comparison on Thursday from Switzerland. "I think the affordability agenda appears to be I'm living rent-free in the Trump administration's head." President Donald Trump, center, holds up a signed Board of Peace charter during the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 22, 2026. Trump was asked about Newsom's presence in Davos Tuesday during a press briefing, remarking that the pair had a warm relationship before it fell to political tatters. "I had a very good relationship with Gavin Newsom when we were, you know, in office together," Trump told the media, referring to his first term in the Oval Office. We had a really … he would talk about it often. Gavin Newsom is a longtime political opponent of Trump's, and issued a warning to foreign leaders to grow a "backbone" with Trump in a political broadside against the White House from the forum Monday. He and I had a very good relationship. Fox Digital reached out to Newsom's office on Friday morning regarding Bessent's latest comments but did not immediately receive a reply.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indiana holds the trophy after their win against Miami in the College Football Playoff national championship game, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026, in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) IRVING, Texas (AP) — The College Football Playoff will remain at 12 teams after the commissioners of the Southeastern Conference and Big Ten couldn't come up with a compromise for expansion. The CFP went from four teams to 12 teams for the 2024 season, and the two most powerful conferences favored further expansion but could not agree on a number. The SEC pushed for 16 teams, with an emphasis on at-large bids — a format favored by the Power Four leagues other than the Big Ten and most of the smaller conferences that are hoping for access into whatever comes next. The Big Ten has pushed for a bracket of up to 24 teams with multiple automatic qualifiers from each conference. It could do away with the need for conference title games and replace them with seeding games to determine, say, two or three of the automatic spots. “After ongoing discussion about the 12-team playoff format, the decision was made to continue with the current structure,” CFP executive director Rich Clark said. “This will give the Management Committee additional time to review the 12-team format, so they can better assess the need for potential change. While they all agree the current format has brought more excitement to college football and has given more schools a real shot in the postseason, another year of evaluation will be helpful.” The 2026-27 season's format will feature 12 teams based on conference champions and final ranking by the CFP selection committee. First-round games will be played on campus sites, followed by quarterfinals and semifinals hosted by the CFP bowls, and the national championship game, which will take place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 25, 2027.</p>

President Donald Trump has turned up the heat on European leaders as he looks to ink a deal for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, including a specific focus on French President Emmanuel Macron in recent weeks. Trump was in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum Wednesday and Thursday, delivering a speech and holding bilateral meetings with foreign leaders at the annual conference that attracts foreign dignitaries, business leaders and celebrities to discuss the world's economy. The president's visit to Switzerland came as he threatened to impose tariffs on eight European nations if no deal on the U.S. acquiring Greenland was achieved by Feb. 1. Initial tariffs would have begun at 10% on goods from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was set to increase to 25% by June 1 if there is no deal by that point. Trump has put many of Europe's top leaders on notice as he looks to secure the deal, but he has taken an outsized focus on Macron. President Donald Trump delivers a special address during the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 21, 2026. The French president has meanwhile vowed from Davos that France will stand up to "bullies" and added that U.S. threats to impose tariffs in a bid to acquire Greenland was "fundamentally unacceptable." Trump announced Wednesday that he would not impose tariffs that were set to take effect, citing a "framework of a future deal" with NATO involving Greenland and the Arctic region. "Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region," Trump wrote on Truth Social. Days after Maduro's capture and as talks of Greenland mounted, Trump joined House Republican lawmakers Jan. 6, when he imitated Macron's accent while recounting how Trump pressured Macron to raise drug prices in France in 2025 as the U.S. looked to bring parity to its sky-high prescription costs compared to other nations. "He's a nice guy," Trump said before launching into an accent and recounting their conversation in a viral moment. Trump again put on a French accent to recount the same conversation he held with Macron Jan. 16 during a rural healthcare roundtable at the White House. Thank you so much for calling,'" he continued, using an accent to indicate Macron was speaking. "I said, 'You're not going to like this call,'" Trump continued. Trump recounted the story to show his long history as the deal-maker-in-chief and pressure Macron to raise France's ultra-low government-set prices that Trump said let pharmaceutical companies shift costs onto Americans. France was listed among eight countries facing additional tariffs if no Greenland deal is made. Trump singled out France early Tuesday morning when he shared a text message Macron sent Trump, which included the French leader saying, "I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland." "My friend, We are totally in line on Syria(.) "I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland(.) Let us try to build great things: 1) i (sic) can set up a g7 meeting after Davos in Paris on thursday afternoon. The president also shared a text from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on social media, who told Trump that he was "committed to finding a way forward on Greenland." "It just made my point," Trump said in an interview with The New York Post of why he shared the messages. Simultaneous to talks on potentially acquiring Greenland, Trump extended invitations to a swath of foreign leaders to join the Gaza Board of Peace, which is styled as a new oversight body tied to the next phase of the Gaza peace plan that the Trump administration ironed out in 2025. Trump, again, targeted Macron with fiery comments when asked about the declined invitation. Well nobody wants him, because he's gonna be out of office very soon. What I'll do is if they feel like hostile, I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes and he'll join. If he said that, you're probably giving it to me a little bit differently, but if he actually did say that — but as you know, he's gonna be out of office in a few months," Trump said. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on the president's rhetoric focused on Macron and France's role in a potential Greenland deal but did not immediately receive a reply. Trump underscored from his speech in Davos Wednesday that "no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States." Trump is looking to acquire the island from Denmark for national security purposes, citing its strategic location among the United States, Russia and China. "All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland," Trump said Wednesday from his speech at the World Economic Forum. "Where we've already had it as a trustee, but respectfully returned it back to Denmark not long ago after we defeated the Germans, the Japanese, the Italians and others in World War II, we gave it back to them." French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech during the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 20, 2026. Trump also took a shot at Macron during his address to the body, remarking on the French president wearing sunglasses during public events before again recounting his prior discussion with him regarding drug prices. "I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses," Trump said to the crowd. Macron spoke before the World Economic Forum Tuesday while wearing aviator sunglasses, sparking mockery and memes online. Macron's office said he had worn them due to a burst blood vessel and need to protect his eyes. "Competition from the United States of America through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions, and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe," Macron said from Davos in a hit on Trump. "Combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable – even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty." Fox News Digital reached out to Élysée Palace for comment from Macron's office regarding Trump's remarks but did not immediately receive a reply.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy urged Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores Friday to protest immigration enforcement operations, even as subzero temperatures beset the state. Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the Twin Cities for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements. Protesters gather during a rally for Renee Good, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026, in Minneapolis, after she was fatally shot by an ICE officer the day before. The demonstration coincides with a blast of cold air hitting the Upper Midwest and ahead of a severe winter storm that is expected to affect millions. On Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative from that of a 5-year-old boy detained by ICE officers in Minneapolis by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. An image depicting Renee Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE officer last week, adorns a makeshift memorial for her in Minneapolis, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. Organizers hope Friday's mobilization will be the largest coordinated protest action to date, with a march in downtown Minneapolis planned for Friday afternoon. “Minnesotans understand that when we're in a snow emergency … we all have to respond and it makes us do things differently,” she said. “And what's happening with ICE in our community, in our state, means that we can't respond as business as usual.” Candles burn around a poem written by Renee Nicole Good during a vigil honoring Good, outside the State Capitol, in St. Paul, Minn., Friday, Jan. 9, 2026, (Kerem Yücel/Minnesota Public Radio via AP) Somali businesses especially have lost sales during the enforcement surge as workers and customers, fearing detention, stay at home. Many schools were planning to close Friday, but cited different reasons. Minneapolis Public Schools were scheduled to be closed “for a teacher record keeping day.” People visit a makeshift memorial for Renee Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE officer last week, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Minneapolis. Clergy planned to join the march as well as hold prayer services and fasting, according to a delegation of representatives of faith traditions including Buddhist, Jewish, Lutheran and Muslim. Royster said at least 50 of his network's faith-based organizers were joining the protest. About 10 were traveling from Los Angeles while others from the same group planned a solidarity rally in California, said one of the organizers there. “It was a very harrowing experience,” said the Rev. Jennifer Gutierrez of the large immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles last year. “We believe God is on the side of migrants.”</p>

An informational panel is seen at President's House Site Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025, in Philadelphia. People look an informational panel at President's House Site Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025, in Philadelphia. PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Outraged critics accused President Donald Trump of “whitewashing history” on Friday after the National Park Service removed an exhibit on slavery at Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park in response to his executive order “restoring truth and sanity to American history” on display at the nation's museums, parks and landmarks. One woman cried silently at their absence. A hand-lettered sign said “Slavery was real.” Their names remain engraved on a cement wall at the entrance. Seeking to stop the display's permanent removal, the city of Philadelphia on Thursday sued Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and acting National Park Service Director Jessica Bowron. The panels came down because Trump's order requires federal agencies to review interpretive materials to “ensure accuracy, honesty, and alignment with shared national values,” an Interior Department statement said. The City of Philadelphia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The people enslaved at the mansion included Oney Judge, who famously ran away and remained free despite Washington's attempts to return her to bondage. Critics condemned the removals as confirmation that the Trump administration seeks to erase unflattering aspects of American history. “Their shameful desecration of this exhibit raises broader, disturbing questions about this administration's continued abuse of power and commitment to whitewashing history,” said Rep. Dwight Evans, a Pennsylvania Democrat. Taking pride in American independence shouldn't mean hiding its mistakes, said Ed Stierli, senior mid-Atlantic regional director for the National Parks Conservation Association, which works to protect national parks. “It reverses years of collaborative work by the National Park Service, City of Philadelphia, and community members, and sets a dangerous precedent of prioritizing nostalgia over the truth,” Stieri said. “It shows that the United States is still unwilling to reckon with the horrors of its past and would rather prefer to sanitize the history that it has and try to present a convenient lie,” said Timothy Welbeck, director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University. “At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — where our Nation declared that all men are created equal — the prior administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates dismantling ‘Western foundations' and ‘interrogating institutional racism' and pressured National Historical Park rangers that their racial identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting Americans because America is purportedly racist,” the order states.

The husband of a woman whom Attorney General Pam Bondi said "played a key role" in the storming of a church in Minnesota this week by an anti-U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) mob is now speaking out, slamming the "Beavis and Butt-Head" prosecution. Marques Armstrong made a reference to the cult MTV sitcom as he spoke Thursday following the arrest of his wife Nekima Levy Armstrong. Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly were also taken into custody. Understand that this is not our first rodeo. Threats on our lives have been coming since we have been doing this work," Armstrong said. "I won't go into too much detail about the Beavis and Butt-Head show for the prosecution," he continued. "We are making a statement, we are making a stand not just for the individuals here, not just our state, but for this entire nation. We cannot afford to take the bait," Armstrong added. "I repeat, we cannot afford to take the bait and be provoked into violence. FBI Director Kash Patel said Armstrong's arrest was in connection with an alleged violation of the FACE Act, which prohibits interfering with the exercise of religion at a place of worship. Kelly allegedly stormed the Cities Church service in St. Paul and berated congregants, according to video posted online, while Allen is a member of the St. Paul School Board who also helped organize the protest. "Minutes ago at my direction, HSI and FBI agents executed an arrest in Minnesota," Bondi wrote on X on Thursday, adding, "We have arrested Nekima Levy Armstrong, who allegedly played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota." The arrests of Chauntyll Allen, left, and Nekima Levy Armstrong, right were announced on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. "Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP," Bondi also said. Marques Armstrong said on Thursday that, "My wife wasn't taken." "She gave herself up, tall, no crime. And for those of you who are following this group of liars, criminals, thieves, shame on you," he said. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. Federal authorities arrested Chauntyll Allen, leader of Black Lives Matter Twin Cities, left, agitator William Kelly, center, and Nekima Levy Armstrong, Racial Justice Network leader, right, after a mob invaded a St. Paul, Minnesota, church, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. "The actions of Chauntyll Allen, my wife, Nekima Levy Armstrong, and all of the protesters were not criminal, violent, or destructive," Armstrong also said. Their conduct remained nonviolent, verbal, restrained, which matters both morally and legally. What motivated their action was not lawlessness but consciousness."

(AP) — Millions of Americans from New Mexico to the Carolinas are bracing for a potentially catastrophic ice storm that could crush trees and power lines and knock out power for days, while Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Boston could see enough snow to make travel very difficult or nearly impossible, forecasters say. Fresh snow blows through an intersection in Lowville, N.Y., on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. The storm, which began early Friday and continues through the weekend, is also projected to bring heavy snow and all types of wintry precipitation, including freezing rain and sleet. An atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas before heading northeast, forecasters said. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. More than 1,500 flights scheduled to fly through U.S. airports Saturday were canceled by the time the storm began early Friday, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.

The city uses other heavy machinery like skid steers and small excavators to clear roads, said James Caldwell, deputy director of public works. Jackson also has three trucks that carry salt and sand to spread across roads before freezing weather. The amount of ice — half an inch, or 1.27 centimeters — that can lead to a crippling ice storm, toppling trees and power lines to create widespread and long-lasting power outages. The latest forecasts from the weather service warn of the potential for a half-inch of ice or more for many areas, including parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee.

AP video journalist Mark Vancleave in Minnesota explains the benefits of all three — a base layer, a middle layer and an outer shell — in this video. The natural sugars of beet juice lower the freezing point of water, allowing salt mixtures to work at much lower temperatures and preventing refreezing, while also helping salt stick to the road longer. The city also has six trucks that spread brine, a mixture designed to melt wintry precipitation. The degree in Fahrenheit when water freezes, equivalent to 0 Celsius. This is a magic number when it comes to winter weather, said Eric Guillot, a scientist at the weather service. If the temperature is slightly above 32, it will be mostly liquid. The windchill value — how cold it feels to a person when winds are factored in — that is expected in parts of the Northern Plains, the weather service projects. “When the weather forecast says, ‘feels like negative 34,' it's just a matter of covering skin and being prepared for it,” said Nils Anderson, who owns Duluth Gear Exchange, an outdoor equipment store in Duluth, Minnesota. The number of miles added last year to snowplow routes in Nashville, Tennessee. That was done “to get deeper into our neighborhoods — roads that had never been plowed before,” said Alex Apple, a spokesperson for Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell. He said the agency also works with state partners and contractors to get more equipment when needed. In the Dallas area, “right now our main focus is treating our roadways in advance of the storm,” agency spokesperson Tony Hartzel said Wednesday. The state has 121 salt houses around the Arkansas, plus 600 salt spreaders and 700 snowplows, said Dave Parker, an agency spokesperson.</p>

Former Canadian Olympic snowboarder and FBI Ten Most Wanted fugitive Ryan Wedding has been captured in Mexico with the help of local authorities, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed Friday. Bondi announced Wedding's capture in a post on X, adding the Canadian national was flown into the United States, where he will "face justice." The FBI announced Friday that they had captured former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding after a monthslong manhunt. "At my direction, Department of Justice agents @FBI have apprehended yet another member of the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted List: Ryan Wedding, the onetime Olympian snowboarder-turned alleged violent cocaine kingpin," Bondi said. "This is a direct result of President Trump's law-and-order leadership. Under @POTUS, criminals have no safe harbor. We are grateful to our incredible Ambassador Ron Johnson and the Mexican authorities for assisting us in this case." Patel highlighted in a separate post on X that Wedding was the first fugitive added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list during his tenure and, "Now, less than a year later, he is in custody." "Wedding is believed to have been hiding in Mexico for over a decade - and has been wanted on charges for cocaine trafficking and murder since 2024," he said in part. "This is the SIXTH Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitive this FBI has captured within a year — fugitives who had been on the run for almost 40 years combined. Wedding, 44, was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted list in March 2025 and is accused of running a transnational drug trafficking network that "routinely shipped hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia, through Mexico and Southern California, to Canada and other locations in the United States," according to the FBI. He is also accused of orchestrating multiple murders and attempted murder as a part of his drug trafficking operation. Wedding and 14 other alleged associates were specifically accused of orchestrating the January 2025 murder of a witness who was shot and killed at a restaurant in Colombia. The FBI has described Wedding as an "extremely violent criminal believed to be responsible for the murder of numerous people abroad." Just last month, FBI officials confirmed that Mexican authorities seized $40 million in motorcycles believed to be owned by Wedding. That news came more than a month after Wedding was hit with additional charges and raised the reward for his capture to $15 million. It was the only Olympics he competed in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal officers in tactical gear line up at the driveway of a large block-shaped building wedged between the city limits of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Across from them, a crowd of protesters yell at the officers and sometimes try to block cars driving in and out. The man behind the name — Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple — would be standing outside with protesters if he were still alive, one historian and scholar said. Whipple, Minnesota's first Protestant Episcopal bishop, was known for advocating for the welfare of Native Americans and was a well-connected leader who stood up to government officials on their behalf throughout the mid-to-late 1800s, according to historians. While his legacy reflects his advocacy for those in the minority, it falls short of altruism and the building bearing his name perches on sacred land also known for its traumatic and violent history toward Indigenous peoples. Now, the Whipple Federal Building is where many people are temporarily detained after being swept up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Others are called to appear there for asylum and deportation hearings and other proceedings that have become increasingly confusing for migrants in the second Trump administration. Though Whipple, who died in 1901, began his term as bishop more than 165 years ago, some say he has influenced the protests and social justice efforts  present in the city today as activists respond to President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Whipple “arrived in a Minnesota that was deeply racially divided at a national moment that was full of lots of conflict and tension,” said Craig Loya, current bishop of the Episcopal Church in Minnesota. “He spent his whole ministry, oftentimes at great personal cost, standing with Jesus on the side of those who were marginalized and excluded.” That imperative of standing with vulnerable people is something Loya said he thinks his congregation has carried on through the decades. Whipple was a “missionary bishop,” according to Michael McNally, the director of American Studies and professor of religion at Carleton College. Whipple and settlers were the newcomers in Minnesota. “Part of his story and his myth is that he was given a name that translates to a ‘straight tongue' because Ojibwe and Dakota leaders saw him as sort of worth their trust, but he also had a big network of people, and he was a very sort of powerful voice in DC and other places,” McNally said. While Whipple is best remembered for advocating for Native Americans, his attitude towards them was “paternalistic,” McNally said. At the time, Whipple made it his aim to understand and advocate for Indigenous peoples' best interests — or rather “what we thought their best interests were,” he said. The result, McNally said, were Indian boarding schools in large part created by Whipple, where Native American children were forcibly taken, stripped of their culture and sometimes abused, he said. “I think he'd be out in the parking lot of the Whipple office building complaining about what's going on in there. But that doesn't mean that he's an uncomplicated person from the past with a real problematic legacy in terms of the boarding schools,” McNally said. In 2019, there were efforts to remove Whipple's name from the federal building, but not because of his complicated history, according to the campaign's leaders. Religious and community activists argued that he would have been opposed to what was taking place inside. They also claimed that a “well-oiled, ruthless, and inhumane deportation machine” was being run out of the federal building. “It came up because… Whipple never would have wanted his name on a building where these bad things are happening, because he was an advocate for people,” said Kathleen Motzenbecker, the refugee services director at the Minnesota Council of Churches. Any push to rename the building now would likely take an act of Congress, according to a government report. But things have changed since the initial “What Would Whipple Do?” movement, with community and religious organizers like Motzenbecker saying the situation is even more urgent now than it was in 2019. The network of resources she said was strengthened by the campaign years ago is now in overdrive trying to help people. “There's a paramilitary group yanking people out of cars, armed men with masks. Federal agents surged to the city earlier this month and were met by demonstrators condemning President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement crackdown. Protests intensified after Good, a 37-year-old mother, was fatally shot by an ICE agent on January 7. Since then, demonstrators have been denouncing the agency and its use of force, leading to tense standoffs between officials in riot gear and protesters – many of them in front of the Whipple federal building. Other loosely organized groups have made an effort to follow and document immigration enforcement efforts and warn neighbors about where operations are taking place. Federal authorities have called those who monitor ICE ‘domestic terrorists.' Loya said it has evolved to respond to new, more pressing threats, taking the form of direct services and financial support for immigrants and refugees. “Even if we succeed in getting Bishop Whipple's name removed from the federal building, the injustices taking place there remain. And whether Bishop Whipple's name is on that building or not, we will continue to do everything we can to stand up with immigrants and to witness against the cruelty that is taking place inside,” Loya said. The church has established a network of resources for immigrants and refugees and has been involved in legislative efforts for more than 60 years, said Loya. Using the political and legal system to fight for social justice was a key part of Whipple's legacy, too, McNally said. The bishop was known to call on leaders in Washington, DC, New York and Philadelphia as well as influential people in Episcopal networks to advocate for his cause, he said. He also became a well-known consultant on Native Americans and served on commissions to try to address corruption in government organizations that dealt with policy around Indigenous peoples. Still, 38 were executed with little to no judicial process. Weeks after the end of the war, more than 1,600 Dakota people, mostly women, children and the elderly, were marched hundreds of miles to a concentration camp nearby, according to the Minnesota Historical Society, and as many as 300 people died while they were detained over that winter. Several years later in 1871, Whipple went to bat again for the rights of the Ojibwe and Dakota people when the US wanted to end treaties with Native Americans, McNally said. As a consultant, he advocated to retain a treaty-based approach but said the government should no longer treat Native American tribes as independent nations. He said Whipple was “standing with the vulnerable in the best way that he was capable” and that he too will “do that in an imperfect way.” Kitto Stately is the project director for the nonprofit We Are Still Here Minnesota, a group that wants to expand education about Indigenous peoples. It's something that we have constantly stood against. We even have a word in our language for these men that come and snatch people. “It means ‘men snatchers' and so when we look at our history and we connect it with our language we already know that this has happened in our past. We already have a name for them,” she said. Kitto Stately said there is a group involved in peaceful protests and which has been present outside the only inner-city reservation, a 212-unit housing development called Little Earth. Enhanced security measures are in place around casinos and large event spaces owned by Native Americans, she added. Last week, the Native American Rights Fund said in a statement that it stands “with our neighbors —whatever their country of birth — who are getting ripped away from their families or violently apprehended for their lawful efforts to protect their communities” and called for an end to ICE's campaign. Recent reports of Native Americans being stopped at their homes and workplaces and being questioned or detained by federal agents, has revived historic trauma, Kitto Stately said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As thousands of protestors demonstrate in Washington, DC, at Friday's annual March for Life, the Trump administration faces a deadline to explain why it opposes a lawsuit that would achieve a key goal of its allies in the anti-abortion movement by ending the availability of abortion pills by mail. “We're at a point where, from a lot of the pro-life movement's perspective, this is too important to play political games with,” Katie Glenn Daniel, the director of legal affairs for SBA Pro-Life America, told CNN. “They could pull these drugs out of the mail tomorrow. While Trump has erected some hurdles to abortion in his second term, his administration has not reversed regulatory rules that have allowed abortion pills to be sent by the mail. That policy, enacted under President Joe Biden, has made it possible for women within states that limit of ban abortion to obtain the two-step drug regimen used to terminate a pregnancy. Trump health officials promised to look at the drug's safety data, but they have been noncommittal about when that would happen, or if they would ultimately reverse the Biden-era changes. “Where we are is that that the Trump administration has managed not to say anything,” said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at UC-Davis and author of several books about the anti-abortion movement. “It seems pretty clear politically that all the steps that Republicans and abortion opponents are taking aren't really moving the administration.” “We can simply fix this if we have the courage to do it,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and staunch Trump ally, said last week. “So, what all of us are telling the administration: ‘you've been a very pro-life president, Mr. President, it's now time to deal with this issue. But SBA-List said that addressing abortion drugs was an “urgent” issue the administration must act on. “If there are those that don't care about the life issue, they should care about the politics of this,” said Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council. “This is going to be a political problem for those who have sold out the pro-life movement.” “Republican members of this committee and many other senators expect an answer,” said Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the chair of the committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr said in a September letter to Republican attorneys general that he had ordered drug regulators to “review the latest data” on mifepristone's risks and safety. But Kennedy and agency spokespeople did not say when the review began or how long it would take. Abortion advocates and mifepristone manufacturers say that years of data show the drug is overwhelmingly safe and has fewer reported side effects than Viagra or penicillin. They are worse because there is another generic now on the market,” said Daniel of SBA Pro-Life America. Trump has checked some boxes off the anti-abortion movement's wish list, by reversing federal guidance requiring hospitals provide abortions in medical emergencies, restricting Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, and barring abortion at Veterans Affairs facilities. The FDA has not made any changes to the rules around medication abortion and neither Secretary Kennedy, nor FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, have testified before congressional committees in recent months. Makary, who has faced calls from anti-abortion groups that he be fired, also made comments to a conservative outlet in December suggesting that the mifepristone review was still in an early phase. “I hope the rumors are false, some of them are in print, that the agency is intentionally slow walking its study on mifepristone's health risks. In a statement, HHS denied that the review was being slow-walked for political reasons, and it said that the “FDA's scientific review process is thorough and takes the time necessary to ensure decisions are grounded in gold-standard science.” The testimony of GOP witnesses highlighted accusations that women were being coerced to take the drugs and were allegedly facing increased health risks by not having an in-person visit with a doctor first. “This is basically setting a stage to demand a different reaction from the Trump administration,” said Rachel Rebouché, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law who specializes in reproductive health law. Anti-abortion movement seeks to escalate clashes over blue state ‘shield' laws Missouri, Kansas and Idaho are carrying forward a case, originally brought under the Biden administration by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations, that seeks to reverse several FDA moves that made medication abortion easier to obtain. A separate case, brought by Florida and Texas, is trying to reverse the 2000 approval of mifepristone as well, effectively banning medication abortion. “There should be no reason why they shouldn't just simply agree or take their own action,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told CNN. Trump administration halts use of human fetal tissue in NIH-funded research “Court decisions are not within the administration's control in the same way these political decisions are, which means there's a lot more unpredictability there,” Ziegler said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE -Finnish icebreaker Polaris is moored in Helsinki, Finland, Thursday Sept. 27, 2018. Military vessel HDMS Knud Rasmussen of the Royal Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. A woman walks with her dog in Nuuk, Greenland, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. Military vessel HDMS Knud Rasmussen of the Royal Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. Pieces of ice move through the sea in Qoornoq Island, near Nuuk, Greenland, on Feb. 17, 2025. But the United States has only three such vessels, one of which is so decrepit as to be barely usable. It has entered agreements to obtain 11 more, but can only source additional ships from adversaries — or allies it has recently rebuffed. Despite toning down his rhetoric, U.S. President Donald Trump seems set on the U.S. owning Greenland for security and economic reasons: to keep what he calls “the big, beautiful piece of ice” out of the hands of Moscow and Beijing, to secure a strategic Arctic location for U.S. assets, and to extract the island's mineral wealth including rare earths. Yet there is no meaningful way to do that — or anything else in the semiautonomous Danish territory — without icebreakers' crucial ability to cut trails through frozen seas. Even if they decided to surge U.S. material into Greenland tomorrow, “they would have two or three years gap in which they're not really able to access the island most of the time,” said Alberto Rizzi, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “On a map, Greenland looks surrounded by sea, but the reality is that the sea is full of ice,” he said. If the U.S. wants more icebreakers, there are only four options: the shipyards of strategic adversaries China and Russia or longtime allies Canada and Finland, both of whom have recently weathered blistering criticism and threats of tariffs by Trump over Greenland. Icebreakers are expensive to design, build, operate and maintain and require a skilled workforce that can only be found in certain places like Finland, with expertise forged in the frigid Baltic Sea. “It's very niche capabilities that they developed as a necessity first and then they have been able to turn it into geoeconomic leverage,” he said. Russia has the world's largest fleet with about 100 vessels, including colossal ships powered by nuclear reactors. “China is now in a position to develop indigenous icebreakers, and so the U.S. feels it must do the same,” he said. Washington has to play catch up, and fast, said Sophie Arts, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund focused on Arctic security. “President Trump has really bemoaned this lack of icebreakers, especially in comparison to Russia,” Arts said. During his first administration, Trump prioritized the U.S. military's acquisition of ice-capable vessels, a strategy that the Biden administration followed up on by signing an agreement called the Ice PACT with Helsinki and Ottawa to deliver 11 icebreakers constructed by two corporate consortiums with Finnish designs. Investments there would take years if not decades to pay off, Lanteigne said. Even with adequate icebreakers, the price to build and maintain mining or defensive facilities — like those envisioned in the yet-unfunded $175 billion Golden Dome missile defense network linking detectors and interceptors in space and on the ground — would be enormous. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement that she would be open to strengthening Arctic security including the U.S. Golden Dome program “provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity.” “It's kind of absurd because I don't think Finland would scrap the deal with the U.S. as a response to threatening to invade Greenland,” Rizzi said. “But if Europe wants to exercise significant leverage to the USA, they could say ‘We're not going to give you any icebreakers and good luck reaching the Arctic, or projecting power there, with those two old ships that you have. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reminded world leaders Tuesday at Davos of the key EU-technology base for any Arctic endeavors. “This shows that we have the capability right here, in the ice so to speak, that our northern NATO members have Arctic-ready forces right now, and above all, that Arctic security can only be achieved together.” She announced after an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday that the EU would surge defense spending in Greenland including an icebreaker.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has revoked his invitation to Canada to join the Board of Peace that was established at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland. Trump made the surprise announcement in a brief “letter” posted on Truth Social late Thursday. “Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,” he wrote to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. “But Canada doesn't live because of the United States. “Canada gets a lot of freebies from us. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.” Adding further fuel to the strained tensions between the United States and Canada is Trump's rhetoric about acquiring Greenland, either forcibly or diplomatically. The Danish territory was a major topic of conversation between Trump and European leaders. Trump promised more details about a possible deal involving Greenland in the next two weeks. Besides Canada, Trump has been critical of the NATO alliance. Despite finding some common ground on Greenland, Trump argued NATO should have perhaps sent its forces to protect the southern border from illegal immigrants. “Maybe we should have put NATO to the test,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Invoked Article 5, and forced NATO to come here and protect our Southern Border from further Invasions of Illegal Immigrants, thus freeing up large numbers of Border Patrol Agents for other tasks.” Trump formally unveiled the Board of Peace at a Thursday morning signing ceremony in Davos. With Trump as its chairman, the Board of Peace is primarily designed to oversee the transition of power in post-war Gaza from Hamas to a Palestinian technocratic committee. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted Trump's offer to join the board, but he was notably absent from the signing ceremony.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE — Vice President JD Vance told the Washington Examiner that the public hostility exhibited by European leaders regarding President Donald Trump's demands for Greenland is simply “posturing,” and that they've expressed more “reasonable” responses to the president's plan in closed-door discussions. The vice president sat with the Washington Examiner for a half-hour interview while flying from Toledo, Ohio, to Minneapolis on Thursday morning. While speaking in Toledo, Vance largely reiterated the administration's points that acquiring Greenland would boost American national security interests and its critical minerals supply chain. The Washington Examiner asked the vice president, whom Trump has tapped alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio to continue negotiations with Europe on a “framework” for a new Greenland deal following the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, how he and Rubio are game-planning the negotiations, given Europe's open hostility to Trump's demands. “They've been incredibly hostile in public, and a lot of this is posturing, right? “So a lot of this, what we've seen, is more symbolic posturing for the Europeans. The vice president added that, during private negotiations carried out by himself, Rubio, and other senior administration officials, European leaders readily “admit” that Greenland “is important to our shared NATO security alliance” and that both Russia and China have signaled designs to move on the island “over the next three to 15 years.” “They've also acknowledged that, God forbid, something significant happened in Greenland, the United States would have to play the leading role in defending it,” he continued. “So there's a broad recognition that much of what we said about Greenland is actually true, and it's interesting to juxtapose the public posturing with the very reasonable private negotiations that we've had with the Europeans.” It would make our missile defense weaker, and so these things all counsel in favor of us shoring up that area, making sure it's properly secure.”</p>
