            Days after Brooklyn Peltz Beckham exposed the depth of his rift with his parents, David and Victoria Beckham, in a blistering Instagram post, the DJ who performed at his wedding has offered his account of the now-infamous dance that contributed to the feud.
    


            Nicola Peltz Beckham, Brooklyn's new wife, left the room “crying her eyes out,” after Brooklyn danced with his mother, Victoria, before her at their April 2022 wedding, DJ Fat Tony told British TV show This Morning on Friday.
    


            The British celebrity DJ, whose real name is Tony Marnach, said singer Marc Anthony called up “the most beautiful woman in the room” to join Brooklyn on the stage, a moment everyone present expected to precede the newlyweds' first dance.
    


            But rather than calling on the bride, Anthony went on to invite the mother of the groom, Victoria, to the stage.
    


            As for the dance itself, “there was no slutdropping, there was no black cat PVC catsuits, there was no Spice Girl action,” Marnach said, dispelling some of the memes circulating on social media this week.
    


            Instead, Marnach said the “timing” made the dance “inappropriate.”
    


            “Brooklyn went onto the stage, and the next minute everyone's expecting it to be Nicola to go up and do the first dance,” said Marnach.
    


            “So Victoria is by the stage, she goes onto the stage, and of course at that point Brooklyn is literally devastated because he thought he was going to do his first dance with his wife. Then Nicola leaves the room, crying her eyes out,” Marnach said.
    


            “Brooklyn is stuck there on stage, and they do this dance, and Marc Anthony says ‘put your hands on your mother's hips' … and the whole situation was really awkward for everyone in the room.”
    


            That incident — which Brooklyn described as his mother dancing “very inappropriately on me in front of everyone,” leaving him “humiliated” — was one of several that the eldest Beckham child described in a long Instagram post Monday.
    


            In it, he accused his parents, who are among the most famous couples in the world, of trying to “ruin” his marriage to Peltz, planting stories about him in the media and of prioritizing “Brand Beckham” over the family unit.
    


David and Victoria Beckham family drama pulls in a generation unafraid to go ‘no contact'



            “I do not want to reconcile with my family,” he wrote, confirming yearslong rumors of a rift. “I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.”
    


            David and Victoria Beckham have not so far commented on their son's allegations. CNN has reached out to their representatives, as well as representatives for the Peltz Beckhams.
    


            Marnach added that he had performed at several Beckham parties, describing them as a “close-knit family” who love to dance. “If (Brooklyn) felt it was inappropriate and awkward, it was inappropriate and awkward,” he said.
    


            Brunch the next day was “the most awkward part of it all,” Marnach recalled, because everyone was discussing the previous evening.
    


            “When the bride and the groom leave their own wedding devastated, word trickles out,” he said.

            A former Canadian Olympic snowboarder and the largest cocaine distributor in Canada, according to officials, has been arrested and is being placed in US custody.
    


            Ryan Wedding was one of FBI's “Ten Most Wanted” fugitives, with a $15 million reward for his capture, after being indicted for allegedly running a criminal enterprise, cocaine trafficking and murder in an operation stretching across the US, Canada, Mexico and Colombia.
    


            According to FBI Director Kash Patel, Wedding was taken into custody in Mexico on Thursday night and is being transported to the US. Officials say Wedding has been hiding in Mexico for over a decade, working for the Sinaloa Cartel and their cocaine operations – shipping the drug from Columbia to the US and Canada.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi previously said Wedding's operation was responsible for more than $1 billion a year in illegal drug proceeds. Officials had believed Wedding to be somewhere in Mexico under the protection of the Sinaloa cartel.
    


            “This operation is the result of tremendous cooperation and team work with the Government of Mexico,” Patel wrote in a post online Friday announcing the arrest. “Special thanks to our amazing partners in Mexico who facilitated this - President Sheinbaum, Secretary Harfuch, Ambassador Ron Johnson, Legat Mexico, and more.”
    


            Competing for Team Canada, Wedding finished as the 24th-best parallel giant slalom snowboarder in the world at the 2002 Winter Olympics.
    


            Wedding was taken to the US Friday, arriving at the Ontario International Airport in Southern California where officials, including Patel, gave a press conference following his arrest.
    


            During the press conference, officials said they had been searching for Wedding for over a year and accused the former snowboarder of orchestrating murders including of government officials.
    


            Officials say they seized guns, expensive cars, artwork and other items as part of the arrest. Wedding is expected to appear in federal court as soon as Monday, Patel said during the press conference, referring to the alleged cocaine kingpin as a “modern day Escobar.”
    


            FBI officials say they are still searching for more individuals involved in Wedding's operations.
    


            Wedding's arrest was first reported by NBC.
    


            This won't be the first time Wedding faces a judge.



            In June 2008, Wedding was arrested along with two other people and accused of conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, according to a criminal complaint.
    


            The arrest came after Wedding and associates traveled from Canada to San Diego, California, to buy cocaine as part of a drug trafficking organization based in Vancouver, according to an affidavit. The operation was a sting, though, and FBI agents arrested the trio after the deal was done, the affidavit states. Investigators allegedly found $100,000 in cash in their hotel room, the affidavit states.
    


            His two co-defendants pleaded guilty, according to court records, but Wedding took the case to trial. He was found guilty in November 2009, and in 2010, was sentenced to four years in prison, per court records.
    


How an Olympian became a fugitive



            At his sentencing hearing, Wedding invoked his sports background in speaking to the court, saying it was his personal goal to rebuild his reputation.
    


            In October 2024, however, federal prosecutors released a superseding indictment charging Wedding with running a criminal enterprise, cocaine trafficking and murder in an operation stretching across the US, Canada, Mexico and Colombia. The indictment says the enterprise began around 2011, when Wedding was released from prison.
    


            The crimes Wedding is accused of now, though, are even more serious.
    


            Prosecutors accuse him, along with another man, of ordering the killings of several people. They say he directed the November 2023 murders of two members of a family in Ontario “in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment” and of ordering the murder of another person in May 2024 over a drug debt.

France's famed high-speed rail service TGV INOUI is facing a backlash after introducing a new premium-class carriage that bans children.
    


            As of January 8, national rail operator SNCF has been offering “Optimum” class on many TGV INOUI routes to and from Paris, according to the ticket-selling SNCF Connect website.
    


            As well as flexible tickets and a dedicated customer service, the offer promises a “dedicated 1st-class carriage” designed for “privacy” and “access to a quiet, dedicated space on board.”
    


            Not only does the carriage have “a limited number of passengers,” but the type of passengers that it allows is restricted, the train company says, noting that “to ensure maximum comfort in the dedicated space, children are not permitted.”
    


            On Friday, a journey from Paris to Lyon was priced at €132 ($155) for a seat in traditional first class, and €180 ($211) for the child-free Optimum Plus, a version of Optimum only offered on the Paris-Lyon route that includes a personal host and dining.
    


            But the latest offering has prompted criticism from French officials and citizens alike, who have described the restriction as “discrimination.”
    


            “Faced with the #NoKids pressure, SNCF must not give in,” Sarah El Haïry, High Commissioner for Children at France's Ministry for Health, Social Affairs and Labor, wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday, referring to the phenomenon — amplified by social media — of people seeking child-free spaces.
    


            The train company's move “really amounts to direct discrimination against children, and that's why I think this matter is causing such a stir today,” said Stéphanie d'Esclaibes, entrepreneur and creator of the podcast “Les Adultes de Demain” (The Adults of Tomorrow), while speaking on French radio program RTL Soir on Thursday about the so-called “No Kids” movement.
    


            “I understand needing quiet on the TGV when you want to work, but I also think this shouldn't come at the expense of a social group, namely children. And I think it's an opportunity to rethink spaces for children and families as well,” added d'Esclaibes.
    


A guerrilla approach to flying with kids



            “SNCF invents an ‘Optimum' class… without children,” essayist Naïma M'Faddel wrote in a post on X on Thursday. “In a country worried about its birth rate, this signal is disastrous.”
    


            Last year, France recorded more deaths than ‍births for the first time since ‌the end of World War II.
    


            Sharing an image of the book “Yes Kids” by Gabrielle Cluzel, M'Faddel recommended that people read the “magnificent plea for assumed and happy parenthood,” adding, “The child is life.”
    


            A day earlier, SNCF Voyageurs, the national passenger rail operator, released a video on social media responding to the “controversy” and defending the move.
    


            The Optimum class is “open to everyone aged 12 and over, as was already the case with our previous Business Première offering,” a spokesperson said in the video posted Wednesday.
    


            “These Optimum seats represent only 8% of the available space on our trains from Monday to Friday. This means that 92% of the other seats are available to everyone, and 100% on weekends,” the spokesperson continued.
    


            “I can even tell you that we have been under pressure for years to restrict children's access to certain areas of our trains. This is something we have always refused to do. Our services are designed for everyone, and of course, for families,” she added.
    


The most exciting new trains coming in 2026



            In a statement to CNN on Friday, an SNCF Voyageurs spokesperson said the company “never accepted the numerous requests from customers” for entire sections, “such as first class, to be child-free on TGV INOUI trains.”
    


            The previous Business Première service, for which toddler and child tickets were not valid, existed “for many years” and “without any negative feedback,” the spokesperson added.
    


            TGV trains have nursery areas, according to the spokesperson, who said passengers can also reserve tickets in the dedicated family area on all TGV INOUI trains on weekends and in school holidays and public holidays.

India's top refining firm, Reliance Industries, is set to resume purchases of Russian oil after a brief pause, Reuters reported on Thursday.

New Delhi has come under increasing pressure from Washington to stop buying Russian oil in recent months as the White House has sought to force Moscow to settle the Ukraine conflict. In August, US President Donald Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods, half of it as a punitive levy for its oil trade with Russia.

Reliance will buy Russian oil from non-sanctioned sellers in February and March, according to Reuters.

The refiner received Russian crude in December after it secured a US concession for a month after a November 21 deadline to close its dealings with sanctioned producer Rosneft, the news outlet reported.

The EU has also imposed sanctions on Russian oil, effective January 21.Some Indian refiners have temporarily halted new orders from Russia and sought alternative supplies in response to sanctions from the West.India, the world's third-largest oil consumer, became a key market for Russian crude following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022.Data from analytics firm Kpler shows Russia has been the South Asian nation's top oil supplier since then, providing over 36% of India's crude imports.

Russian, Ukrainian, and US negotiators will hold their first trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi on Friday, a senior Kremlin aide said after Russian President Vladimir Putin met with US President Donald Trump's envoys in Moscow.

Putin spoke for nearly four hours with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum. Putin's aide, Yury Ushakov, and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev took part on the Russian side.

In a phone call with journalists, Ushakov hailed the talks as “substantive, constructive, and extremely candid.”

Ushakov said the trilateral working group on security will meet for the first time in Abu Dhabi later on Friday. He added that the Russian team led by Admiral Igor Kostyukov, the head of the GRU military intelligence, had received instructions from Putin and will fly to the UAE in the coming hours. 

Witkoff and Dmitriev will meet separately in Abu Dhabi to discuss Russia-US trade, Ushakov said.

Ushakov said the Russian side stressed once again that peace between Moscow and Kiev is impossible “without resolving the territorial issue.”

“We remain interested in resolving the Ukrainian crisis by political and diplomatic means. However, if it does not happen, Russia will continue accomplishing its goals on the battlefield where the Russian troops have the initiative,” he said.

On Thursday, Trump met with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He told later journalists aboard Air Force One that he remains optimistic about brokering peace between Russia and Ukraine, while acknowledging the “complicated” issue of borders.

“There were times then Putin didn't want to make a deal, and times when Zelensky didn't want to make a deal. Now I think they both want to make a deal,” Trump said.

Moscow has demanded that Ukraine withdraw troops from parts of Russian territory they control, and recognize Russia's new borders, including Crimea and the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. Zelensky has ruled out making any territorial concessions.

Labor unions and progressive organizations have called on workers across the state to stay home

Full report: Economic blackout in Minnesota to protest against ICE: ‘No work, no school, no shopping

A “no work, no school, no shopping” blackout day of protest was kicked off by community leaders, faith leaders and labor unions on Friday in protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) surge in the state.

The Day of Truth & Freedom protest comes in the wake of the killing of Renee Good, the unarmed woman killed by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Their demands include that ICE leave Minnesota, that the ICE officer who killed Good be legally held accountable, an end to additional federal funding for ICE, and for the agency to be investigated for human rights and constitutional violations.

Dozens of local businesses in Minnesota have announced closures in solidarity. The Minneapolis city council endorsed the day of action and the general strike. The day of action culminates with a march in downtown Minneapolis at 2pm local time.

“We are going to be having dangerously cold weather on Friday – -10F with wind chills. Like the high is going to be -10F with wind chills of up to -20F,” Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the Minnesota Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, told the Guardian.

“We are a northern state, and we are built for the cold, and we are going to show up, but folks are going to need to pay attention to not just the march, but what people are doing, the individual stories of solidarity that people are going to be doing.”

The Minnesota AFL-CIO, the state's federation of more than 1,000 affiliated local unions, has endorsed the day of action, along with dozens of local labor unions.

CNN has spoken to the Columbia Heights, Minnesota, school district superintendent Zena Stenvik about ICE's detention of four students in the city, including five-year-old Liam Ramos.

A reminder that Liam was taken into custody on Tuesday as he and his father arrived home from preschool in the Minneapolis suburb. According to school officials, an ICE agent used the child to knock on the family's front door to determine if anyone else was inside, before detaining father and son. They were later transported to Texas.

Stevnik described arriving to the scene to people crying in the street who told her the child had been taken. The father's car was also still running, she told CNN, contradicting claims from homeland security that he had attempted to flee on foot and abandoned Liam. Stevnik also said that another adult at the home had pleaded to take care of Liam but was denied.

Vice-president JD Vance has defended ICE's detainment of Liam, claiming the child would've been left to “freeze to death” if he wasn't taken with his dad. Asked if the child would've been abandoned and left outside, Stevnik said, “Not a chance.” She told CNN she spoke to Liam's mother, the school board chair and neighbors close to the family, all of whom wanted to take him.

I entered the home and the mother was distraught. She wanted Liam, she wanted to open the door. And I can't even imagine as a mother myself how conflicted she must have been. This is what she told me, seeing her husband standing in the driveway in handcuffs saying, don't open the door and also hearing her little one.

And she could see the ICE agent standing there at the door. So, I – I just can't imagine as a mother what she was going through. It was heartbreaking for me to hear her. And she looked up at me and - and said, I don't understand what's happening. We're not criminals. And as our – as the family's attorney stated yesterday, they have followed everything that they've needed to do in terms of the legal processes.

Stevnik went on:

Here in the Twin Cities right now, it's pretty common that people are not opening their doors because once anyone cracks open their door, the ICE agents are bursting through or even breaking doors down. So, that's the behavior that we're seeing. So, that's the only behavior that we can assume would have happened.

Marc Prokosch, an attorney representing the family, has said the Ramos family had followed proper legal procedures. They have an active asylum case and entered the US at an official port of entry, he said.

The family did everything they were supposed to in accordance with how the rules have been set out. They did not come here illegally. They are not criminals.

More on this story here:

FBI director Kash Patel has conducted another purge of field office leaders and senior agents linked to the two criminal investigations of Donald Trump, MS NOW reports citing multiple people briefed on the matter.

While the exact number ousted is unclear, two people familiar with the matter told MS NOW that the special agent in charge in Atlanta has been removed, as has the acting assistant director in charge of the New York field office and a former special agent in charge in New Orleans.

What is more, two people said that as many as six agents in Miami were forced out over their connection to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, and other agents pushed out were involved in the “Arctic Frost” investigation of Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election.

Talks between Russia, Ukraine and the United States have begun in Abu Dhabi, according to the United Arab Emirates' ministry of foreign affairs.

The UAE is hosting a rare set of trilateral talks, bringing together negotiators from Russia, Ukraine, and the US. The talks have started today, and are scheduled to continue over the next two days.

According to a press statement, the UAE hopes that these discussions would “contribute to tangible steps toward ending a crisis that has persisted for nearly four years and resulted in immense humanitarian suffering”.

A reminder that special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, also Donald Trump's son-in-law, are representing the US.

A new poll from Emerson College finds that 51% of likely voters disapprove of Donald Trump's performance in office, one year into his new administration.

Also included in this latest survey, 57% of voters think the presence of federal immigration agents in communities has been more harmful than beneficial, while 38% think it has been more beneficial than harmful.

Linked to this, only 38% of respondents had a favorable opinion of Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, while 45% had an unfavorable opinion.

Senator Elizabeth Warren and fellow Democrats have accused Donald Trump of letting white-collar criminals “off the hook” by diverting crucial resources to his sweeping immigration crackdown.

In a letter to federal watchdogs, the Democrats demand an investigation into the US president for shifting more than 25,000 personnel away from investigating fraud, tax evasion and money laundering in favour of his immigration enforcement agenda.

“The Trump Administration is letting white-collar criminals off the hook for all kinds of wrongdoing,” Warren, from Massachusetts, said in a statement. “Instead of protecting American families from fraud and predatory behavior, the Administration is diverting resources to pursue its inhumane immigration agenda.

“Nobody is above the law, and the Trump Administration needs to stop treating white collar criminals with kid gloves.”

In the letter to inspectors general of the justice department, state department, homeland security, the postal service and the treasury's tax division, the Democrats allege that the administration is “diverting critical federal law enforcement personnel and resources” away from corporate crime and into what they describe as Trump's “civil immigration dragnet”.

The letter – signed by Democrats including Warren, Senator Richard Blumenthal and Representatives Dan Goldman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Madeleine Dean – demands a formal evaluation of the extent of the transfers and their impact on US financial crime enforcement.

It cites a “deep concern” that entire investigative units have been “gutted” as agents are sent to bolster Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.

The president also made sure to tout his achievements at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. “So many things accomplished,” he wrote in a post on Truth Social, “including the framework of a deal with NATO on Greenland. Also, the BOARD OF PEACE. WOW!!! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

A reminder that the neither Trump, nor Nato chief Mark Rutte, have provided explicit details on the Greenland deal. Earlier in the week, the president said it would last “forever” while speaking to reporters in Davos.

Ahead of the snowstorms expected on the US east coast this weekend, the president took to Truth Social to posit how global warming could still exist in the face of adverse weather conditions like these.

“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States. Rarely seen anything like it before,” he wrote. “Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain – WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”

Of course, global warming does not stop winter … but in fact causes average global temperatures to rise. Increased temperatures also intensify snowstorms, and a rapidly warming Arctic has ultimately stretched the polar vortex – meaning the US is facing the brunt of colder weather over the coming days.

My colleagues Oliver Laughland and Tom Silverstone have spent time in Minnesota, following the fatal shooting of Renee Good.

In their latest piece, they travelled to neighbourhoods in Minneapolis, grappling with a surge of federal immigration enforcement, to speak with residents who are fighting to defend their communities from violence and intimidation. They also embed with ICE watch groups, hear from Somali American residents, and witness a swarm of federal agents conduct a sweep in the suburbs.

Watch here:

Donald Trump doesn't have any public events today, according to the White House schedule.

He's due to sit for a print interview later today, and meet with Frank Bisignano, the commissioner of the Social Security Administration.

We will, however, hear from the vice-president, JD Vance, who will speak at this year's March for Life in Washington. A reminder that this is the country's largest anti-abortion rally. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, is also set to address demonstrators.

The United Nations rights chief voiced astonishment on Friday at the “now-routine abuse” of migrants by US authorities, urging Washington to end practices “tearing apart families”.

Volker Turk called on the United States to ensure migration policies and enforcement practices respect human dignity and due process and slammed the “dehumanising portrayal and harmful treatment of migrants and refugees”.

“I am astounded by the now-routine abuse and denigration of migrants and refugees,” he said in a statement.

“Where is the concern for their dignity, and our common humanity?”

Thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to Democratic-led Minneapolis, as the Republican administration of Donald Trump presses its campaign to deport what it says are millions of illegal immigrants across the country.

A “no work, no school, no shopping” blackout day of protest was kicked off by community leaders, faith leaders and labor unions on Friday in protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) surge in the state.

The Day of Truth & Freedom protest comes in the wake of the killing of Renee Good, the unarmed woman killed by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Their demands include that ICE leave Minnesota, that the ICE officer who killed Good be legally held accountable, an end to additional federal funding for ICE, and for the agency to be investigated for human rights and constitutional violations.

Dozens of local businesses in Minnesota have announced closures in solidarity. The Minneapolis city council endorsed the day of action and the general strike. The day of action culminates with a march in downtown Minneapolis at 2pm local time.

“We are going to be having dangerously cold weather on Friday – -10F with wind chills. Like the high is going to be -10F with wind chills of up to -20F,” Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the Minnesota Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, told the Guardian.

“We are a northern state, and we are built for the cold, and we are going to show up, but folks are going to need to pay attention to not just the march, but what people are doing, the individual stories of solidarity that people are going to be doing.”

The Minnesota AFL-CIO, the state's federation of more than 1,000 affiliated local unions, has endorsed the day of action, along with dozens of local labor unions.

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the latest news lines.

We start with news that a vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy has been urging Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores on Friday to protest against immigration enforcement in the state.

“We really, really want ICE to leave Minnesota, and they're not going to leave Minnesota unless there's a ton of pressure on them,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 groups that are mobilizing. “They shouldn't be roaming any streets in our country just the way they are now.”

The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer during an operation on 7 January, AP reports.

The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents nearly 2 million service and healthcare workers across the US, is leading calls for nationwide participation.

“Martin Luther King wrote to Cesar Chavez during the Great Boycott and said our separate struggles are really one struggle,” David Huerta, president of SEIU-United Service Workers West (USWW) and SEIU California, said on Sunday on Politics Nation with the Rev Al Sharpton on MS Now.

“Right now, more than any time ever, we see our civil rights, workers' rights, and immigrants' rights … in alignment with one another.”

He added: “When we look at Minneapolis – the violence, the cruelty that's being brought by this federal government against working people – it is now more than ever that we have to stand together, regardless of our differences.”

Friday's mobilization was planned as the largest coordinated protest action to date, including a march in downtown Minneapolis despite dangerously cold temperatures that the National Weather Service forecast in the single to double digits below zero (-20 to -30C).

In other developments:

Donald Trump withdrew on Thursday an invitation for Canada to join his “board of peace” initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts. “Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post directed at the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney.

Greenland has demanded its red lines on sovereignty be respected after Donald Trump claimed an agreement with Nato would give the US full and permanent access to the Arctic island, the object of an increasingly bitter months-long dispute. Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Greenland's prime minister, said on Thursday he did not know what was in the deal but the largely self-governing territory wanted a “peaceful dialogue” with the US, and its sovereignty was non-negotiable.

Before the US military snatched Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, earlier this month, Delcy Rodríguez and her powerful brother pledged to cooperate with the Trump administration once the strongman was gone, four sources involved at high levels with the discussions told the Guardian. Rodríguez, who was sworn in on 5 January as acting president to replace Maduro, and her brother Jorge, the head of the national assembly, secretly assured US and Qatari officials through intermediaries ahead of time that they would welcome Maduro's departure, according to the sources.

The White House posted a digitally altered image of a woman who was arrested on Thursday in a case touted by the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, to make it seem as if she was dramatically crying, a Guardian analysis of the image has found. The woman, Nekima Levy Armstrong, also appears to have darker skin in the altered image. Armstrong was one of three people arrested on Thursday in connection to a demonstration that disrupted church services in St Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday.

Jack Smith, the former special counsel, has defended his decision to seek criminal charges against Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in his first and perhaps only public appearance to discuss the cases after they were dropped last year. “No one should be above the law in this country, and the law required that he be held to account,” Smith said in his opening remarks before the House judiciary committee. “So that is what I did.”

The Trump administration will block organizations that receive US foreign aid from subsidizing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and what the administration calls “gender ideology”. The new policy will affect about $30bn in foreign assistance.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Researchers found a new way to filter and destroy Pfas chemicals at 100 times the rate of current systems

New filtration technology developed by Rice University may absorb some Pfas “forever chemicals” at 100 times the rate than previously possible, which could dramatically improve pollution control and speed remediations.

Researchers also say they have also found a way to destroy Pfas, though both technologies face a steep challenge in being deployed on an industrial scale.

A new peer-reviewed paper details a layered double hydroxide (LDH) material made from copper and aluminum that absorbs long-chain Pfas up to 100 times faster than commonly used filtration systems.

“This material is going to be important for the direction of research on Pfas destruction in general,” said Michael Wong, director of Rice's Water Institute, a Pfas research center.

Pfas are a class of at least 16,000 compounds often used to help products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in the environment, and they are linked to serious health problems such as cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders and birth defects.

Current filtration technology like granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis or ion exchange absorbs Pfas in water, and the chemicals caught in the filter must be stored in hazardous waste facilities, or destroyed. Destruction of the chemicals typically involves a thermal process that subjects them to high heat, but that leaves toxic byproducts, or essentially breaks larger Pfas into smaller Pfas. There is no technology that fully destroys Pfas on an industrial scale.

Wong said Rice's non-thermal process works by soaking up and concentrating Pfas at high levels, which makes it possible to destroy them without high temperatures.

The LDH material Rice developed is a variation of similar materials previously used, but researchers replaced some aluminum atoms with copper atoms. The LDH material is positively charged and the long-chain Pfas are negatively charged, which causes the material to attract and absorb the chemicals, Wong said.

“There you go – it just soaks it in to the order of 100 times faster than other materials that are out there,” Wong added.

Pfas are virtually indestructible because their carbon atoms are bonded with fluoride, but Rice found that the bonds could be broken if the chemicals in the material were heated to 400-500C – a relatively low temperature. The fluoride gets trapped in the LDH material and is bonded to calcium. The leftover calcium-fluoride material is safe and can be disposed of in a landfill, Wong said.

The process works with some long-chain Pfas that are among the most common water pollutants, and it also absorbed some smaller Pfas that are commonplace. Wong said he is confident the material can be used to absorb a broad array of Pfas, especially if they are negatively charged.

Most new Pfas elimination systems fail to work at an industrial scale. Wong said the new material has an advantage because its absorption rate is so strong, it can be used repeatedly and it is in a “drop in material”, meaning it can be used with existing filtration infrastructure. That eliminates one of the major cost barriers.

Laura Orlando, a Pfas researcher with the Just Zero non-profit and a civil engineer who works on waste-management design, said she is always skeptical of claims around total destruction of Pfas, and new filtration technologies, because the processes are so complex in real-world conditions. Other challenges like occupational safety, or regulations and permitting, would have to be considered.

“We're going to need as many technologies as we can possibly find to deal with Pfas in drinking water, and if this works to scale on wastewater, then it would be really something to pay attention to,” Orlando said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ryan Wedding allegedly ran a drug-trafficking organisation that moved 60 tons of cocaine a year into Los Angeles

Ryan Wedding, the Canadian Olympic snowboarder turned alleged drug kingpin, has been arrested, US law enforcement officials announced on Friday.

Wedding, 44, has been sought by the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for his role in overseeing what the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, called the “one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations” in the world.

Officials in the US allege that Wedding's organisation had moved nearly 60 metric tons of cocaine a year into Los Angeles from Mexico using a network of semitrucks. Wedding is also accused of ordering the killing of a key FBI witness as well as several other murders, including that of a couple who were killed in a case of mistaken identity.

US authorities had previously said that they believed Wedding to be in hiding in Mexico. On Thursday, the FBI director, Kash Patel, was in Mexico City for meetings with the country's security chief, Omar García Harfuch. And on Friday morning he left with a souvenir: Ryan Wedding, and another, unnamed, “priority objective”.

García Harfuch released a statement saying that Patel was leaving with “a non-US citizen who was arrested by Mexican authorities and is among the FBI's 10 most wanted, and a Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered yesterday at the US embassy”.

NBC News first announced news of the arrest and US law enforcement officials familiar with the operation confirmed it to the Guardian.

In March, Wedding, whose nicknames include “Public Enemy”, “El Jefe” and “Giant”, was added to the FBI's list of 10 most wanted fugitives, and there was a $15m reward for information leading to his arrest.

Patel, who is due to speak to the media later in the day from California, has compared Wedding to Pablo Escobar and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.

The head of the RCMP, Michael Duheme, will also be present.

Wedding was allegedly being protected by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico while he was on the run.

The toll in Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests has killed at least 5,002 people, activists said yesterday, warning that many more were feared dead as the most comprehensive Internet blackout in the country's history crossed the two-week mark.

The challenge in getting information out of Iran persists due to authorities cutting off access to the Internet on Jan. 8, even as tensions with Washington rises, as a US aircraft carrier group moves closer to the Middle East — a force US President Donald Trump likened to an “armada” in comments to journalists on Thursday.

The Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the death toll, saying 4,716 were demonstrators, 203 were government-affiliated, 43 were children and 40 were civilians not taking part in the protests.

More than 26,800 people had been detained in a widening arrest campaign by authorities, it added.

That death toll exceeded that of other protests or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalls the chaos of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.

The Iranian government offered its first death toll on Wednesday, saying 3,117 people were killed, adding that 2,427 of the dead in the demonstrations that began on Dec. 28 last year were civilians and security forces, with the rest being “terrorists.” Iran's theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.

Iran has also reportedly limited journalists' ability locally to report on the aftermath, instead repeatedly airing claims on state television that refer to demonstrators as “rioters” motivated by the US and Israel, without offering evidence to support the allegation.

The new toll comes as tensions remain high over Trump laying down two red lines over the protests — the killing of peaceful demonstrators and Tehran conducting mass executions. 

Iran's attorney-general and others have called some of those being held mohareb, or “enemies of God.” That charge carries the death penalty. It had been used along with others to carry out mass executions in 1988 that reportedly killed at least 5,000 people.

The US military has moved more military assets toward the Mideast, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and associated warships traveling with it from the South China Sea.

A US Navy official on Thursday said the Lincoln strike group was in the Indian Ocean.

Trump said the US is moving the ships toward Iran “just in case” he wants to take action.

“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction and maybe we won't have to use it,” Trump said.

Dozens of South Koreans allegedly involved in online scams in Cambodia were yesterday returned to South Korea to face investigations in what was the largest group repatriation of Korean criminal suspects from abroad.

The 73 South Korean suspects allegedly scammed fellow Koreans out of 48.6 billion won (US$33 million), South Korea said.

Upon arrival in South Korea's Incheon International Airport aboard a chartered plane, the suspects — 65 men and eight women — were sent to police stations. Local TV footage showed the suspects, in handcuffs and wearing masks, being escorted by police officers and boarding buses.

They were among about 260 South Koreans detained in a crackdown in Cambodia over the past few months.

“When it comes to crimes that harm our people, we'll track down and arrest those involved to the very end and get them to face corresponding consequences,” senior police officer Yoo Seung-ryul said.

Public outrage over scam centers in Southeast Asia flared in South Korea when a South Korean student was found dead last summer after reportedly being forced to work at a scam compound in Cambodia. 

Authorities at the time said he died after being tortured and beaten, and South Korea sent a government delegation to Cambodia in October for talks on a joint response.

The suspects repatriated include a couple who allegedly operated a deepfake romance scam to dupe 12 billion won from about 100 people in fraudulent investment schemes. 

South Korea has made various efforts to bring them back home, including more than 10 rounds of video meetings with Cambodian officials, the South Korean Ministry of Justice said.

At the airport briefing, senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs official Yoo Byung-seok expressed gratitude to the the Cambodian government over the repatriation. 

South Korea hoped to continue close bilateral coordination until online scams targeting South Koreans are eradicated in Cambodia, Yoo added.

Cybercrime has flourished in Southeast Asia, particularly in Cambodia and Myanmar, as trafficked foreign nationals were employed to run romance and cryptocurrency scams, often after being recruited with false job offers and then forced to work in conditions of near-slavery. 

Since October, about 130 South Korean scam suspects from Cambodia, as well as more than 20 such Korean suspects from Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, have been sent back home. 

About 60 South Koreans remain detained in Cambodia awaiting repatriation, police said.

South Korean President Lee Jae-myung called for stern responses to transnational cybercrimes that he said erodes mutual trust in society and triggers diplomatic disputes with other countries.

This year could see the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) undertaking “more aggressive, ambitious operations around Taiwan,” in preparation for Chinese President Xi Jinping's (習近平) stated goal that the PLA would have the capability to invade Taiwan by next year, Global Taiwan Institute (GTI) director John Dotson said on Thursday. 

It is the last year for the People's Republic of China (PRC) to reach that capability goal, Ann Kowalewski, a senior non-resident fellow at the Washington-based GTI, told a panel discussion titled: “Looking Ahead for Taiwan Policy in 2026.”

Last year saw a mounting escalation in pressure from China against Taiwan, including the PLA's “Justice Mission 2025” military exercises conducted around Taiwan last month, the GTI said.

Analysts expect next year to be a flashpoint in cross-strait relations, after then-US Indo-Pacific commander admiral Philip Davidson in 2021 warned that Xi had instructed the PLA to be ready to invade Taiwan by next year.

However, substantial political analysis shows that they are “not quite there yet,” Kowalewski said.

“What we might see is a massive ramp-up this year in PRC military capability,” she said.

It remains unclear whether Taiwan and the US would increase their military capabilities or think through unique postures to ensure they can asymmetrically keep the balance of power in a relatively stable area, she said.

Conversely, at the end of the year, China might have complete military dominance, she added.

An increase in military activity this year by the PLA might try to signal to Xi: “Hey boss, we got the message and look at the cool stuff we can do now,” Dotson said.

Dotson said that last year's two PLA military exercises, held in April and last month, which were conducted toward the south and southeast of Taiwan, were in closer proximity to the nation's main island, and featured more aggressive use of the China Coast Guard.

Deploying the coast guard serves China's narrative, as it can be justified as law enforcement patrols rather than military incursions, he said.

China gives a “narrative justification” for each of its military exercises, such as blaming a speech by President William Lai (賴清德) on policies to target Chinese infiltration in March last year or an arms sale package with Washington last month, Dotson said.

He added that he recommends skepticism around these narratives, as large-scale exercises are planned out far in advance, but might have their exact dates adjusted to coincide with key events.

Meanwhile, Taiwan has maintained dialogue with Japan and the Philippines, and there is now “more of an opening on [South] Korea-Taiwan than we have seen previously,” Kowalewski said, adding that Seoul “may not want to fight, may not want to get involved in Taiwan.”

However, even if South Korea does not get involved militarily at the outset, its economy would be greatly affected if the waterways around Taiwan become a war zone, so it might have to get involved for its own national security reasons, she said.

Dotson is a former US Navy officer and was a staff member of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission under the US Congress.

Kowalewski formerly led the Indo-Pacific portfolio as a senior professional staff member of the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Guan Guan has said many controversial statements in her videos posted to Douyin (抖音), including “the red flag will soon be painted all over Taiwan” and “Taiwan is an inseparable part of China,” and expressing hope for expedited reunification.
The agency last year received multiple reports alleging that Guan Guan had advocated for armed reunification.

The Associated Press

10:21 JST, January 23, 2026

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, one year after President Donald Trump announced America was ending its 78-year-old commitment, federal officials said Thursday.

But it's hardly a clean break.

The U.S. owes more than $130 million to the global health agency, according to WHO. And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.

The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.

“In my opinion, it's the most ruinous presidential decision in my lifetime,” he said.

The WHO is the United Nations' specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.

Nearly every country in the world is a member.

U.S. officials helped lead the WHO's creation, and America has long been among the organization's biggest donors, providing hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise.

On average, the U.S. pays $111 million a year in member dues to the WHO and roughly $570 million more in annual voluntary contributions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

In an executive order issued right after taking office, Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency's “failure to adopt urgently needed reforms” and its “inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.”

WHO, like other public health organizations, made costly mistakes during the pandemic, including at one point advising people against wearing masks. It also asserted that COVID-19 wasn't airborne, a stance it didn't officially reverse until 2024.

Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives — there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 — have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.

Experts say the U.S. exit could cripple numerous global health initiatives, including the effort to eradicate polio, maternal and child health programs, and research to identify new viral threats.

Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called the U.S. withdrawal “shortsighted and misguided” and “scientifically reckless.”

The U.S. has ceased official participation in WHO-sponsored committees, leadership bodies, governance structures and technical working groups. That would seem to include the WHO group that assesses what flu strains are circulating and makes critical decisions about updating flu shots.

It also signals the U.S. is no longer participating in global flu information-sharing that guides vaccine decisions.

Such disease intelligence has helped Americans be “at the front of the line” when new outbreaks occur and new vaccines and medicines are quickly needed to counteract them and save lives, Gostin said.

Trump administration officials say they already have public health relationships with many countries and are working to ensure direct sharing of that kind of information, rather than having WHO serve as a middleman. But U.S. officials did not give specifics about how many such arrangements are in place.

Gostin, an expert on international public health treaties and collaborations, said it's unlikely the U.S. will reach agreements with more than a couple dozen countries.

Many emerging viruses are first spotted in China, but “is China going to sign a contract with the United States?” Gostin said. “Are countries in Africa going to do it? Are the countries Trump has slapped with a huge tariff going to send us their data? The claim is almost laughable.”

Gostin also believes Trump overstepped his authority in pulling out of WHO. The U.S. joined the organization through an act of Congress and it is supposed to take an act of Congress to withdraw, he argued.

The U.S. is legally required to give notice one year in advance of withdrawal — which it did — but also to pay any outstanding financial obligations.

The U.S. has not paid any of its dues for 2024 and 2025, leaving a balance of more than $133 million, according to WHO.

An administration official denied that requirement Thursday, saying the U.S. had no obligation to pay prior to withdrawing as a member.

President Volodymyr Zelensky is prepared to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 22. 

Trump's remarks followed a meeting between the two leaders earlier that day at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Shortly after the meeting, Zelensky announced that Ukraine would participate in trilateral talks with the U.S. and Russia in the United Arab Emirates starting Jan. 23.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Jan. 22, Trump said Zelensky told him during their conversation that he was ready to make a peace deal. 

""He said he'd like to make a deal. ... He came and he said he wants to make a deal,"" Trump said. 

The comment marks a shift from Trump's position earlier this month, when he claimed that Zelensky was the one holding up a potential agreement.

Trump also said on Jan. 22 that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to make a deal. As Trump spoke to reporters, his envoys held a meeting with Putin and his aides in Moscow ahead of the trilateral talks.

While Trump was asked to provide details about the content of the agreement, the remaining points of contention, and possible changes that may have made Kyiv or Moscow more amenable to a deal, the U.S. president provided few specifics. He said there were ""no changes"" and that the discussion topics are ""things that have been discussed for six or seven months.""

At times, Trump's commentary on the war veered into disjointed abstractions and real estate jargon. 

""It's complex. You have metes and bounds, you have streets, you have rivers, you have everything — you know, where does it end? So it's a little bit complicated. ... There are metes and bounds, it's a location, it's boundaries,"" he said. 

Trump also acknowledged the ""tough"" situation Ukrainians face amid a worsening energy crisis — without mentioning that Russia caused the crisis by deliberately attacking Ukraine's power grid despite severe winter cold. 

""It's really tough for the people of Ukraine, I'll tell you that,"" Trump said. ""How they live, without heat, where it's 20 degrees below zero, you know it's very cold. ... I asked (Zelensky), I mean, how do they do that and he gave me an answer. It's pretty amazing what they do to live. It's no way to live.""

Trump has been trying to strike a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine for over a year, brokering a series of talks that have yielded few results and done nothing to hamper Russia's intensifying drone and missile campaign against Ukrainian civilians. 

Russia has not signaled any interest in cooperating with the U.S.–Ukraine peace plan finalized in December, although it has acknowledged receiving the provisions. The latest plan is a revised version of a 28-point proposal co-drafted by Russia that heavily favored Moscow.

Ukraine's army, with about a million troops, should form the backbone of a prospective European joint forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Jan. 23.

The statement comes after Zelensky reiterated on Jan. 20 the call to create a joint European army of at least 3 million personnel in response to growing Russian threat.

""(Russian) army will number 2.5-3 million. They want to reach all of this by 2030, and, based on their speed, we see that this is possible,"" Zelensky said following the World Economic Foundation's meetings in Davos, Switzerland. 

""I'm not saying it will be that way, I'm saying it's possible,"" the president added. 

Zelensky pointed out how the Ukrainian army had used European and American weapons to great and even unprecedented effect in fending off the Russian army. 

Russia, meanwhile, now has both a supercharged domestic defense industry and 1.5 million soldiers or former soldiers with experience fighting in Ukraine.

""Considering European forces, we're not just talking about quantity, but about capability and experience. Without the Ukrainian army — without a million Ukrainians — you won't manage. And this will be the backbone of such an army.""

The size of the Ukrainian army, as announced by Zelensky, significantly exceeds Russia's demands, which seek to ensure that, following a peace agreement, Ukraine's military would consist of no more than 600,000 personnel — a condition Kyiv categorically rejects.

Yet Ukraine has reportedly agreed to limit its peacetime military to 800,000 service members, the Financial Times reported on Nov. 25, citing unnamed Ukrainian officials. 

A Ukrainian army of this size would still remain the second-largest European force after Russia and put it close to its current wartime strength of about 900,000 service members.

Zelensky's recent remarks come nearly a year after he first called on European partners to create a new armed force at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, 2025, amid uncertainty over further U.S. support if Russian aggression escalates.

Since then, European leaders have taken no steps toward implementing the initiative for nearly a year, according to Zelensky.

""Maybe now, with all the new challenges, European leaders will take it more seriously,"" the president said.

Several European nations, led by the U.K. and France, have held a series of talks aimed at establishing a ""Coalition of the Willing,"" which aim to provide Ukraine with the military guarantees underpinning a peace deal. So far, this coalition has yet to guarantee any European boots on the ground in post-war Ukraine. 

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump's saber-rattling over Greenland, which he wants to take from Denmark, has reinvigorated talk of a joint European army, with several nations sending token forces to military exercises on the Arctic island on Jan. 15.

Ukraine is banking on more anti-ballistic air defense missiles from the U.S. following a ""positive"" meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 23. 

""What did Davos bring to Ukraine? Above all, let's be fair: An important meeting with the United States of America. With all due respect to other leaders,"" Zelensky told reporters.

""We actually had a positive meeting with President Trump and his team,"" Zelensky said. ""Above all, if I'm being honest, I raised the question of air defense, and I think that the U.S.A. will return with a positive result.""

Relations between Ukraine and the U.S. have soured since Trump returned to office just over a year ago. His administration has largely cut off aid, in contrast to extensive U.S. weapons support under President Joe Biden. Ukraine's air defense in particular has been suffering. 

Lack of air defense has left Ukraine vulnerable to Russian air strikes that have taken large swathes of energy infrastructure offline, leaving millions of Ukrainians without electricity and heat in the coldest winter of the full-scale war yet. 

""We spoke with President Trump about additional anti-air missiles – the PAC-3s, against ballistics, which are what we need,"" Zelensky said. ""I'm counting on a positive result.""

PAC-3s are missiles for Patriot air defense systems that are to date the only reliable defense against Russian ballistic missiles like Kinzhals and Iskanders. ""Nothing else works,"" Zelensky said earlier this week. 

Zelensky is also further looking for Trump to underwrite security guarantees for Ukraine. 

""The treaty is ready to be signed. Of course, there will be different technical details, and on the basis of this document, other supplementary documents will come up,"" Zelensky said. ""Now I'm waiting for the time and place from President Trump. It's up to him.""

Ukraine and the U.S. have been discussing a potential agreement for several months that is expected to include security guarantees on land, sea, and air, as well as the involvement of foreign military contingents.

A European ""Coalition of the Willing,"" led by the U.K. and France, has held several meetings but has yet to secure commitments, such as providing boots on the ground, for a post-war Ukraine.

Zelensky said on Dec. 26 that the U.S. had offered Ukraine security guarantees for 15 years, but the president expressed hope the guarantees could be extended for a longer period.

On Jan. 12, Zelensky said the document was essentially ready and added that the next step would be its final review at the highest level.

There have been two very different Canadian reactions to our shock of realizing, slowly over the last year and then very quickly over the last week, that the United States is no longer an ally or even a competitor, but a tangible threat to Canada's well-being – and possibly its existence.

One response involves reaching out and renewing connections with more reliable partners. The other involves hunkering down, bunkering in and quite literally choosing the nuclear option.

We heard the outward-facing response in Prime Minister Mark Carney's Davos speech: We need to forge new alliances with other mid-sized countries, and reconstruct the globalized systems of open trade and collective security that have protected us since the 1940s, but without Washington. It was a summary of what Canada and European countries have been attempting to do for the past year.

The inward-turning response is most visible in the surprising number of people calling for Canada to develop its own nuclear-weapons program.

“Canada needs a nuclear deterrent” has become a widespread message on social media lately; a search of those words on X or Bluesky or Reddit will yield hundreds of versions, some from commentators with large audiences (interestingly, voices on the left seem to dominate).

Carney calls for national unity in face of economic challenges ahead

But it's also a message coming from circles of well-informed Canadians. Jean-François Bélanger of the NATO Defence College argued here in The Globe that Canada should get itself both nukes and ICBMs to confront “a continued and serious threat of annexation by the United States.” Political consultant Jamie Carroll said we need to replace the U.S. nuclear umbrella with our own to guard against Russia, China and other threats. University of Toronto political scientist Aisha Ahmad made the case that Canada needs “a bulletproof defence of its homeland” that only domestic nukes can provide.

At root is the increasingly popular image of a Hobbesian 21st-century world in which nuclear-armed countries invade or conquer those without nukes, and only individual countries adopting the bomb can protect them.

That is a fallacy on several levels – especially as it applies to Canada. 

In 1949, Canada chose to replace the old and very expensive idea of autonomous, soup-to-nuts national defence with the burden-sharing concept of collective security in the form of NATO. This includes both mutual defence, as embodied by its charter obligation to come to the aid of any member under attack, and perhaps more importantly collective deterrence – the notion that not every member country needs to possess every defensive armament and protective weapons system, and only a few need to have the really expensive ones, in order to protect all. This was not simply a way to get protection from the United States – even without Washington, it provides us middle powers a range of deterrents on a superpower scale.

There is no conceivable threat to Canada that would be reduced by Canada possessing its own nukes. 

An attack over our northern border by Russia or any other major military would immediately be viewed by Washington – regardless what sort of regime is present there and regardless its attitude toward Canada – as an incursion on its northern and Alaskan borders. Both NATO allies and a hypothetical non-NATO America would assert their conventional and nuclear deterrents.

And in the event that Mr. Trump decided to turn his red-white-and-blue map of North America into reality by force, we'd be no better off with nukes. Recent years have shown the world that nuclear weapons have no deterrent power against attacks or invasions by adjoining countries.

Opinion: America the predator: Trump wants to show the world he can take what he wants

The province of Kursk, theoretically protected by Russia's 5,459 nuclear warheads, was recently invaded and occupied by non-nuclear Ukraine for almost a year. The world's largest nuclear arsenal was of no help in either preventing the invasion or eventually bringing it to an end, because Ukrainians knew that Russia would not irradiate millions of its own people (the same reason why experts say that Ukraine keeping its Soviet nukes would have hastened rather than prevented a Russian invasion). Likewise, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal did nothing to prevent India's large-scale aerial bombing of hundreds of Pakistani military sites following a conventional war last year – much as it hasn't stopped India from more or less permanently occupying parts of Kashmir that international law designates as Pakistani.

It was a relief to see that the Canadian military's secret plans to defend against a U.S. invasion, revealed in The Globe this week, seem to understand this – they are limited to insurgency strategies and reliance on our collective-security umbrella, including our European deterrents. True, Canada will need to contribute more to military burden-sharing in the event that Washington withdraws from NATO. But we need not learn to stop worrying and love the bomb.

It's time they're held accountable for it","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-google-amazon-apple-meta-microsoft-governance-accountability/","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

These companies govern, unelected, through data-intensive platforms. It's time we explicitly acknowledge that

Wendy H. Wong is a professor of political science and Principal's Research Chair at the University of British Columbia, and the author of We, the Data: Human Rights in the Digital Age, which won the 2024 Balsillie Prize for Public Policy. Her next book, Mirrored States, will be published in 2027.

In the digital realm, small mistakes can result in big consequences. 

On July 19, 2024, a faulty software update from a company most people had never heard of grounded global air travel from Hong Kong to Hamburg. Hospitals couldn't access medical records or schedule appointments. Banks froze payments. Millions of people suddenly found themselves cut off from everyday services they assumed were reliable, all because of one cybersecurity company: CrowdStrike. 

What was a planned routine update from CrowdStrike triggered the largest global IT incident on record, crippling more than 8.5 million Windows machines. They fixed the bug the same day, but the fallout lingered. 

Images of stranded travellers and closed retail terminals peppered the news. Delta Airlines cancelled 7,000 flights and has since been cleared to sue CrowdStrike for the losses.

What the CrowdStrike fiasco revealed is that we're governed continuously, and unavoidably, by a complicated, interconnected and deeply enmeshed system of data-intensive platforms. That is, technologies (often working seamlessly in the background) structure how we live. When they fail, we feel the lack of order – the lack of governance – immediately. 

Technologies govern. Governance means setting the conditions under which people live, play and work – establishing rules, shaping expectations and allocating resources. When we say “Big Tech,” we mean the many companies that govern our lives, through their platforms that traffic in data.

It's time we acknowledge that governance explicitly. As governors, Big Tech companies should take accountability for the outsized role they play in our lives. 

We often talk about Big Tech as if it were just Google (Alphabet), Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft – the Big Five. Add Tesla and Nvidia if you like – the Magnificent Seven, instead. What unifies them is economic: market capitalization, stock valuations or shares across markets.

What if we thought about “bigness” as their embeddedness and indispensability in our lives? Not just user base, but the depth of our collective and individual entanglement with the platforms they run. These companies create platforms for users to access online resources. Through these platforms, they collect, store and analyze the behavioural data about and made by humans. 

I recently chatted with a friend about libraries over dinner as we shared photos on our phones – and libraries popped up in her socials and online ads the next day. When my sister was house hunting, she and I were texting about a Midwestern city I was speaking in; the next day, her suggested houses included properties in that city, thousands of kilometres away from her targeted search. Big Tech companies mediate communication, commerce, transportation, entertainment, education, health care, and social services – and, now, they're our portals to AI. 

Big Tech companies, it can be said, not only control the means of connection through platforms, but also the means to computation as organizations and individuals rely increasingly on AI, which in turn depends on cloud computing. Platforms pull us in and data encourage us to stay. Your connectivity gives you access to a share of computation that is not otherwise possible.

Governing is about creating a shared order with enforceable expectations. Since the Second World War, we've lived in a world where governance is presumed to be, and set up as, the domain of states, or governments. Today, we live in a world of multiple governors: states, yes, but also Big Tech governance.

Big Tech governs through:

• Data: More data means better platforms; better platforms attract more users; more users produce more data. These self-reinforcing network effects give companies reach no state could achieve.

• Platforms: The apps we use to direct our automated, internet-connected devices – from smart thermostats to office tools – create shared expectations and behaviours. Platforms create and control those digital networks: consumers to markets, business to business. It's not about the hardware so much as the software that runs on top.

From data-intensive platforms, Big Tech companies learn and steer human behaviours and choices. With current AI models' power and data-hungry tendencies, computation is now the domain of the cloud, which is the engine of artificial intelligence, logistics, social networks and online services. The data, platforms and computation are mutually reinforcing, making better services that keep you online. 

The marvel and challenge is that technologies have enabled companies to govern. Like governments, they are rather difficult to forsake.

You can (usually) opt out of social media. You can opt out of voting. You can sometimes emigrate to a different country. 

But do you have a job? Do you have a cellphone? Do you use e-mail or make digital payments? Have you passed by a smart doorbell like Ring or Nest? If so, you're already in the cloud, and you can't opt out of Big Tech governance.

Within days of each other, in October, 2025, two of the three biggest cloud computing services, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's Azure, erred and crashed. 

It was a dark October for thousands of businesses and, by extension, millions of people worldwide. The outages touched companies as varied as Alaska Airlines, Costco, Snapchat, Slack, Vodaphone, and Coinbase, government services such as Britain's HM Revenue and Customs, and anyone using Microsoft 365. Online gaming “tilted” as Roblox, Pokémon Go, Epic Games and the PlayStation Network went dark. 

One unique casualty was Eight Sleep, a company that sells “smart beds” with temperature controls, sensors and adjustable bases. When AWS went down, the beds malfunctioned. Customers found themselves stuck upright, overheated or shivering until the outage was resolved.

Most of us don't own smart beds. But most of us have smartphones. Moreover, we all depend on platforms for our work, communication and finances. That dependence becomes obvious only when something breaks.

We saw this during the 2021 Facebook outage, in which a configuration error of the company's internal systems took down Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram for six hours. Roughly 3.5 billion social network users lost access, but so did 200 million businesses that rely on such platforms to reach customers. In many parts of the world, WhatsApp is the way people communicate. Other users mused philosophically about who they really were without digital social networks, both as connections, and their personhood altogether. 

Technical problems must be recognized as social and political problems. A small error in one system can cascade through dozens of others, toppling the digital dominoes that underpin daily life. Platforms come in many forms. There are consumer-facing ones, such as TikTok, business-oriented ones, such as Salesforce, and ones that enable the world to run, providing compute for our lives to work, such as Amazon Web Services.

“Compute” is a term that technical types use to describe the resources needed to complete tasks, from loading websites to large language models like ChatGPT. These days, the interwoven nature of platforms creating, sharing and storing data that needs to be accessed quickly requires an incredible amount of compute, and it's not cheap. 

This leaves us vulnerable to how Big Tech platforms govern us. They don't have to actively collude to govern us across all the different domains of human life – social, political, cultural and economic. What they possess is much more elementary: Big Tech companies have invented and maintain the means to connectivity and computation that underlie modern societies.

This is a call to see Big Tech for what it is: a governor. Their power and motivation ostensibly come from the market, but their reach goes far, far beyond that. The word “governor” more accurately characterizes what they do, and also, how we should view their powers. If we understand them better, we can also imagine different strategies to reduce their disproportionate dominance in the economy and control of data, among other things.

When we look back at other “big” sectors, they've historically been active in limited areas. Think Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Tobacco. 

But Big Tech has moved beyond those limits and enmeshed itself in society and lives through platforms, and leverages the data collected from those platforms to govern us in ways that are hard to imagine ever giving Standard Oil or Philip Morris. 

We haven't seen business models like Big Tech before, because prior to the internet era, we didn't have the technology that has allowed companies to create the widespread tools and data collection capacity that we know today. This capacity enables them to govern.

There's a saying: If you're not paying, you're the product. We've moved beyond this implied choice. You're governed, whether you pay or not.

Governments haven't been exactly enthusiastic about shaking up the bargain with Big Tech. But they also seem stuck in an antagonistic dynamic. 

Somewhere along the way we've been swept up into this idea that states and companies are at loggerheads. But in digital technologies, governments (particularly the U.S. government) have been a key investor and developer of tools we take for granted. Expansive studies have shown that many of the things we take for granted in our smartphones, from GPS to touchscreen displays to the very internet that enables their smartness, are based on government-funded research. 

Generative AI models like ChatGPT and many others benefited from Canadian government funding. Canada led the way among states in national support with the Pan-Canadian AI strategy.

Aside from losing the thread of government support enabling innovation, governments have played an exasperating game of whack-a-mole, chasing the symptoms of Big Tech governance on companies' terms. You don't win the game by trying to whack those moles with what they give you. The mallet's too small and it's tied to the machine itself, putting you at a disadvantage from the start. To stand a chance of winning, you either drop the mallet and use your hands, or you figure out the underlying mechanism's pattern of revealing those smiling little mole faces.

If anything, some government forays have intensified the problem. The U.S. declaring Google a monopoly hasn't resulted in profound changes. In fact, Amit Mehta, the Washington, D.C.–based U.S. federal judge overseeing the Google antitrust case, made it such that Google was required to share search data with other companies, which only spreads the wealth embedded in those data. 

Similarly, the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) places special demands on the “gatekeeper” companies, including that they must make data available to other businesses. 

Sharing data makes the hold data-intensive platforms has on us worse, even as it introduces “competition” by undercutting the most powerful firms. Several of the EU's regulatory mechanisms rely upon heavy fines as deterrents and punishments. For example, the DMA can levy fines up to 10 per cent of a company's annual revenue, an admittedly impressive penalty. But fines are only effective if they can be collected and not ensnared in courts for years.

Holding a handful of massive companies responsible does not address the underlying system of data-intensive platforms. While it's normal to focus on some very prominent companies, we lose sight of the fact that in the very short history of the internet, Big Data and AI constantly introduce new players that can bring down seemingly unstoppable giants (pause here for AOL, Yahoo! and MySpace). 

More importantly, it perpetuates the idea that states need to whack companies into submission. Sometimes, positive incentives matter just as much (if not more) than punishments.

The answer to ineffective governance isn't to let companies do what they wish. Far from it. 

First, states don't have to be punitive (or use “sticks”) to govern. They can also change the incentives of other governors, by using “carrots.” As we know from international relations, power can be soft or hard, and hard power doesn't always prevail. Second, acknowledging that Big Tech companies are governors isn't just rhetorical. It means that they take on responsibilities of governing, just as governments do.

Practically speaking, governments can wield power without force. For one, states have the power of procurement. They need a lot more digital infrastructure than most customers, and the private sector wants those lucrative government contracts. For as much talk as there is about the antipathy between states and Big Tech, the companies benefit immensely from government largesse. 

Tech Inquiry revealed in 2022 that U.S. military and intelligence agencies, alone, had awarded US$28-billion to Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet from 2018 to 2022. 

Procurement can come with strings attached. Journalists at The Guardian recently exposed the lengths to which Google and Amazon went to win a US$1.2-billion cloud contract with the Israeli government (“Project Nimbus”). The deal included a “winking” alert system that notified Israeli officials whenever their cloud-stored data was queried, and provisions preventing either company from cutting off Israel's access to their technologies–even if the terms of service were violated.

Procurement is governance by wallet, but not punishment. Governments can embed requirements for complying with government policies in the contracts themselves. Thus, any value, be they transparency, security, oversight, accountability or rights, can become requirements in the contracts tech companies seek. In Canada, government can set standards on procurement through policies at the Treasury Board, or consider each case individually.

Another tool states have is the power of incentives, often called market-based policies (as opposed to punitive command and control policies). Think about how governments created supply and demand for electric vehicles in relatively short order. State-driven investments can support important research to overcome existing problems; it's also a way for governments to channel support as they see fit. 

This is the approach that Canada seems to be following with the Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy and the recently proposed $1-billion over the next five years designated for AI and quantum research in the 2025 budget. 

It has also announced a registry to report federal government uses of AI. The Canadian AI Safety Institute, created under the Trudeau government with a relatively modest $50-million, signals an intention to support research on the political and social effects of AI systems.

There is no escape hatch from the digital world. Even without AI, platforms would still shape how we communicate, shop, work and live. But calling them “governors” allows us to see their power for what it is – and to use more tools to reshape it.

Importantly, calling Big Tech companies governors gives us – the public, governments, other companies – the right to demand accountability and responsibility in line with the outsized power these firms wield. We expect states to hold other actors accountable because they represent the public.

In turn, constituencies hold governments to account. No one or few entities ought to dominate all others. Why wouldn't we demand the same responsibility from other governors that we demand from governments?

Overcoming their dominance requires creativity, a willingness to use incentives and a recognition that platforms, like states, are governors in the digital age.

An internet blackout has cut off Iran from the outside world, but reports of soaring protester death tolls are trickling out of the country. US President Trump said he was sending a ""massive fleet"" to the region.

US President Donald Trump renewed the threat of military action against Iran late Thursday as reports of rising death tolls from a brutal government crackdown on protests reach the outside world.

Trump delivered the threat while speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on route to Washington from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

""We have a massive fleet heading in that direction… and maybe we won't have to use it… we have a lot of ships heading in that direction, just in case,"" Trump said when speaking of a possible US reaction to ongoing unrest in the Islamic Republic.

""We're watching Iran,"" said Trump. ""I'd rather not see anything happen but we're watching them very closely.""

Trump had made similar threats before, while also urging Iranian protesters to take over Iranian institutions and pledging that ""help is on its way."" But the tensions ebbed last week with the US president saying he had received word from Iran that ""killing has stopped"" and Tehran had no plans to execute detained protesters.

The Pentagon has not confirmed Trump's statement about the US military fleet movements. However, the AP news agency reports the aircraft carrier group USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of associated vessels is currently in the Indian Ocean on its way to the Middle East from the South China Sea.

Iran was rocked by nationwide anti-government protests that began in late December and have yet to be entirely quelled; though the government's brutal crackdown on dissenters has kept most Iranians at home, fearful of repression, arrest or death.

On January 8, Iranian government has decided to cut off all internet access and to block international phone use.

Internet monitor NetBlocks on Friday said that the blackout had now entered its third week.

The communication blackout has made it close to impossible to verify death tolls reported by various actors both inside and outside the country. On Wednesday, the Iranian government — which has a historical tendency to underreport the numbers of dead protesters — said 3,117 people had been killed, including security forces.

Death tolls put out by international rights groups have ranged from 4,500 to more than 20,000.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) — which has provided accurate numbers during previous unrest in Iran — said that over 5,000 people had been killed and more than 26,800 arrested.  

That death toll exceeds all other protests or unrest in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

HRANA noted that not all those killed had been protesters, with several innocent women and children among the dead.

""All the evidence gradually emerging from inside Iran shows that the real number of people killed in the protests is far higher than the official figure,"" said Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of the Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights.

This organization reported verifying at least 3,428 deaths.

On Thursday, Iranian state television said that 200 further arrests had been made in western and southern provinces.

United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk urged Tehran on Friday to end its ""brutal ⁠repression,"" saying that children included the thousands killed. 

""I call on the ‍Iranian authorities to reconsider, ​to ​pull back, and to end their brutal repression,"" Turk told an emergency session of ‍the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

​He called the crackdown ""a pattern of subjugation and ⁠overwhelming ​force that can never address people's ‌grievances ‌and frustrations."" 

The UN Human Rights Council also voted on Friday for a probe into human rights abuses in Iran. Twenty-five countries voted in favor of the motion with China, Pakistan and Iraq among the countries voting against the proposal.

Iran has accused Israel and the US of being behind the nationwide protest.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard, labeled a terrorist entity by the US, Canada and Australia, has been accused of being on the frontline of the government crackdown.

On Thursday, the Iranian government, the army and the IRGC responded to Trump's pressure campaign with warnings.

""The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief,"" said IRGC commander, General Mohammad Pakpour.

Pakpour advised the US and Israel to ""avoid any miscalculations,"" saying they would otherwise face a ""painful and regrettable fate.""

General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, who runs Iran's Joint Command Headquarters and is under US sanctions, said ""all US interests, bases and centers of influence"" would become ""legitimate targets"" in the event of a US attack.

Last June, Iran, Israel and the US sparred in a 12-day war that ended with US long-range bombers attacking nuclear enrichment facilities in the Islamic Republic. 

Trump on Thursday said future US attacks would make those carried out last summer ""look like peanuts.""

President Donald Trump put into motion the withdrawal process to have the US removed from the Geneva-based organization after he signed an executive order on the first day of his second term.

The US has officially withdrawn from the World Health Organization (WHO), a year after President Donald Trump announced he was putting an end to America's 78-year-old commitment to the health agency.

Trump notified the United Nations health agency a year ago when he signed an executive order on the first day of his office in 2025. This was followed by a one-year waiting period before the withdrawal was finalized.

The US president cited the organization's alleged ""mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic"" and ""other global health crises"" among reasons to quit the body. He also said that US membership in the organization required ""unfairly onerous payments.""

""Today, the United States withdrew from the World Health Organization (WHO), freeing itself from its constraints,"" said a joint statement from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published Thursday. 

Washington's withdrawal hasn't been without problems. The US owes more than $130 million (€110 million) to agency, according to the WHO, but there is uncertainty and disagreementover it. 

Member states are also set to discuss the US departure and how it will be handled at the WHO's executive board in February, a WHO spokesperson said.

Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.

Over the last year, many global health experts have urged a rethink, including most recently WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

""I hope the US will reconsider and rejoin WHO,"" Ghebreyesus said at a press briefing earlier this month. ""Withdrawing from the WHO is a loss for the United States, and it's a ‌loss for the ⁠rest of the world.""

Over the course of last year, experts have warned that the US withdrawal is likely to  severely impact  the abilities of both the US and the WHO to address disease outbreaks and global health threats.

The US has historically been the largest funder of the organization. The specialized health agency is mandated to coordinate preparedness when it comes to disease outbreaks like mpox, Ebola and polio. 

It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries, helps distribute scarce vaccines, and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.

At Davos, Trump made bold claims about Greenland, NATO spending and China's wind power. DW Fact Check examines where his statements clash with historical records and current data.

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, US President Donald Trump delivered a speech lasting more than an hour — and made several claims that were either false or misleading. Many centered on Greenland, US defense commitments and NATO.

DW Fact check looked into some of the key statements.

Trump repeatedly spoke about the US military presence in Greenland during World War II, presenting it as territory the US had once ""returned"" to Denmark. 

Claim: ""We fought for Denmark. (...) We were fighting to save it. (...) All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland, where we had already been a trustee, but respectfully returned it to Denmark not long after we defeated the Germans, the Japanese, the Italians, and others in World War II. (...) We had it, and we gave it back to them.""

DW Fact check: Misleading

The US did help defend Greenlandduring World War II, but it never owned the territory and therefore could not have ""given it back"" to Denmark.

Nor did the US fight a separate military campaign to liberate or ""save"" Denmark itself. When Nazi Germany occupied Denmark in April 1940, Greenland became cut off from the Danish government in Copenhagen.

To prevent Germany from exploiting Greenland's strategic location and its cryolite mines(critical for aircraft aluminum production), the United States intervened with the approval of Denmark's ambassador in Washington who acted independently because Denmark was under occupation.

The US established military bases, weather stations and airfieldsto defend Greenland — but its legal sovereignty never changed.

Although the German Wehrmacht  operated a weather station on Greenland and there were isolated clashes between the German army and Danish-led island patrols, Greenland was never completely occupied by Nazi Germany.

After World War II, Greenland remained part of the Kingdom of Denmark. US military activity continued through the Cold War, most notably with the construction of Pituffik Space Base (formerly Thule Air Base). This presence was based on defense agreements, not on a transfer of ownership. At no point did Nazi Germany control Greenland nor did the United States acquire it from Germany. 

Claim: ""And all we're asking for is to get Greenland, including the right title and ownership, because you need the ownership to defend it. You can't defend it on a lease. Number one. Legally, it's not defensible that way. Totally.""

Fact check: Misleading

The United States is already mandated to help defend Greenland. Its defense arrangements are governed by agreements between Denmark and the United States, as well as by NATO obligations.

Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and is protected by NATO's collective defense clause under Article 5, which states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all NATO members.

The US has bilateral defense agreements with Denmark that allow US military to operate in Greenland with Danish consent. Ownership is not legally required for defense cooperation if the government of that territory consents to defense cooperation.

Many countries — including the United States — operate military bases abroad under lease or basing agreements without claiming ownership.

According to a 2024 report by the US Congressional Research Service, the Department of Defense manages or uses more than 128 foreign bases in at least 51 countries. A 2021 report by the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft estimates the number could exceed 750 installations across 80 countries and territories.

Examples include major bases in the Philippines, where the US maintained major military bases such as Clark air base and Subic Bay naval base for decades after World War II under long-term agreements without infringing on Philippines sovereignty.

It's not the first time that Trump has made false or misleading claims about Greendland. DW Fact check uncovered some in a previous fact check in March 2025. 

Trump repeated familiar assertions about the US bearing nearly all NATO costs.

Claim: ""Until I came along,"" the US ""was paying for virtually 100% of NATO,"" Trump said, adding, ""We paid for, in my opinion, 100% of NATO.""

DW Fact check: False

Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the year before Trump took office, the US accounted for a little over 70% of total defense spending by all NATO members. This is significant — but nowhere near 100%.

The US also contributes about 22% of NATO's relatively small common budget, which covers alliance headquarters and administrative costs, with the remainder paid by other member states.

To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Trump also made other inaccurate statements about NATO, including:

Claim: ""The United States had never received anything from NATO, despite having paid for it.""

Fact check: False

This claim ignores the support the United States received from NATO allies following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

The collective defense clause under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty was triggered on September 12, 2001 — the first and, so far, only time in NATO's history.

As a result, several NATO countries, including Germany,  participated in international military missions alongside the US, including the International Security Assistance Force, Operation Enduring Freedom , and the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan.

The deployment of the German armed forces in Afghanistan lasted around 20 years and, according to the German government, cost approximately €12.3 billion through to August 2021. A total of 60 German soldiers lost their lives during the mission, according to Bundeswehr data.

Claim: ""China makes almost all wind turbines. And yet I couldn't find any wind farms in China."" Trump further said China was very smart because it sold wind turbines to ""stupid people"" while not using them itself.

Fact check: False

In absolute terms, China produces more wind energy than any other country in the world. According to US Energy Information Administration (EIA), China generated 521 gigawatts of wind power in 2024 — around 40% of global wind energy production. The EIA notes that China is also expanding solar and wind energy ""at record speed.""

However, China still lags behind some countries in terms of the share of renewables in its electricity mix. According to Ember Energy, wind power accounted for about 12% of China's electricity mix in the first half of 2025. Overall, renewable energy sources made up around 23%, while coal accounted for 56%.

By comparison, renewable energy accounts for about 64% of electricity generation in Germany, with wind power alone contributing nearly 27%.

Icicles have formed on Harris's woolly hat and there's frost on her eyelashes. When she cries, genuine tears of sadness at what's happening to her home city, you half expect them to turn to ice too.

The weather has turned achingly cold, down to 36 below freezing, and the ill wind blowing through Minneapolis and St Paul makes it feel all the colder still. It's near enough the kind of weather that defeated Napoleon and Hitler in Russia.

Yet Minnesota won't be cowed; Minnesotans are determined to brave the coldest of cold snaps to continue their street demonstrations against Donald Trump and the army of immigration agents roaming the Twin Cities rounding up illegal aliens. Theirs is the politest and in some ways most middle-class of protests.

They shout “your mother would be ashamed” at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents driving out of the gates of their base on the outskirts of Minneapolis. Occasionally they swear at them.

It's been a fortnight since Renee Good was shot dead by an ICE agent in what the Trump administration has insisted was an act of self-defence against a “domestic terrorist”, but which video and eyewitness evidence suggests was a needless shooting of an innocent mother.

A little over five years before, George Floyd, a black man, was murdered by a white police officer who knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes until he suffocated.

The killing – just a few blocks from where Good was shot and killed – triggered violent protests, arson attacks and looting. Minneapolis's third precinct police station was overrun and set ablaze.

The response to the death of Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, in contrast has been muted. In part it's because many of those protesting are middle-class “moms” like Good, but it's also because no one wants to give Donald Trump a reason – or call it an excuse – to crackdown on a city he really doesn't like.

Eighteen months ago Tim Walz, Minnesota's governor, called Mr Trump “weird” in an interview that went viral and earned him the Democratic nomination for vice-president. Many Minnesotans now believe Mr Trump is hell bent on revenge for that humiliation.

The people here know Minnesota is on a knife edge.

It's no wonder Harris, 38, (she won't give her full name for fear of any consequences) starts to cry. She takes up her spot from 9am every day bringing supplies like hand and toe warmers, beanie hats, blankets and gas masks to the daily protest at the Bishop Henry Whipple Building where the department of homeland security has its Minnesota base.

“I am here until ICE stops,” she says. “It will end one way or another. We are not going anywhere. They say Minnesota Nice and they think it means we are pushovers. But what it means is we are passionate and we care.

“There's a saying: ‘we all do better when we all do better'. That's why I get up, that's why I do it.” And then Harris, who works with children with special needs, starts to weep.

The Trump administration has deployed 2,000 federal agents in Minnesota to round up illegal immigrants. It's not clear how much of a problem there is. Studies suggest there are somewhere between 80,000 and 95,000 undocumented migrants in Minnesota – about 1.5 per cent of the state's population.

Florida, where Trump lives in Mar-a-Lago, has somewhere between 770,000 and 1.15 million undocumented migrants, in the region of five per cent of the population. Texas, another “red” state, has an estimated 1.7 illegal migrants – in the region of six per cent of a 30 million population.

Yet Pete Hegseth, Mr Trump's defence secretary, has ordered 1,500 active duty soldiers with the army's 11th Airborne Division in Alaska to prepare for deployment to Minnesota.

It's no coincidence that troops have been chosen from Alaska, acclimatised as they are to Minnesota's savage winters. Temperatures were dropping to a low of -20C in the early hours of Tuesday morning, with a wind chill that makes it feel more like -27C. Frostbite, at those temperatures, can take hold in 15 minutes.

On Wednesday, the Pentagon also put an army military police brigade on standby to deploy to Minneapolis. That came after the local police in the city complained that off-duty ethnic minority officers with the force were being stopped by ICE.

At the same time, Mr Walz has mobilised the Minnesota National Guard to be ready to assist. It does, say protesters, risk a clash of troops under potentially different commands. The city is so tense, civil war is spoken openly as a possibility – and not easily dismissed as a laughable prospect.

There have been reports of Left-wing militants armed with semi-automatic rifles patrolling neighbourhoods on the lookout for ICE agents, the videos circulating on the social media feeds of hard-Right Trump supporters.

The anti-ICE protesters are convinced the White House is capable of cooking up a “red flag” operation to give the president the excuse to send in the troops.

Lily Wood, 43, a stay at home “mom” of three children, with “ICE OUT” pinned to her furry hat, said: “We are just hoping Donald Trump is so obsessed about Greenland that he forgets about us.”

That may be wishful thinking. On Tuesday, to mark his first year in office, Mr Trump opened his address to the nation by displaying the photos of Minnesotan criminals caught by ICE agents. JD Vance flew into Minneapolis on Thursday.

Ms Wood had attended the protests with her best friend from school Liz Walla, 43 and also a mother of three, on a day off. The pair are well used to Minnesota's freezing conditions. In the killing of Good, “you are seeing yourself, a white woman and a mother”.

She would go home later to put a casserole in the oven for her husband and kids but wanted to let the ICE agents coming in and out of the Whipple building know what she thought of them. The abuse is all verbal.

“Trump wants the protests to turn violent, to give him the excuse to deploy troops. We don't want this to de-escalate but really don't want it to escalate either. It's so frustrating. ICE are supposed to catch the murderers and bad people, instead they killed a mother,” she says.

Across town at the makeshift shrine where Good was shot, Karen Hutt, 68, a Unitarian minister, had watched the dead woman's body being carried limp from her car, placed on a stretcher and taken to an ambulance, which she said was prevented from breaching the police cordon following the shooting. She had heard the fatal gunshots.

“It was disgusting. It was inhuman,” said the grandmother. “This is all about Walz and the election. He called Trump weird and this is his retribution campaign. It's not complicated. Trump is a juvenile; he is not serious. He's a clown.

“But the big crisis is coming when Walz deploys the state national guard, Hegseth sends in the regular army from Alaska and ICE with its Stasi agents then who is fighting who?”

In 2020, when George Floyd was murdered, the city – in parts at least – was in flames. The gas station on the corner where Floyd died remains burnt out and his shrine still in place, surviving demands for it to be removed.

Becca Cerra, 34, education officer at the arts centre right where Floyd died, is hopeful ICE will be defeated by… well, the ice. “I am surprised if they can survive the cold,” she said.

“They haven't got the kit. No gloves, no hats. You can tell their boots aren't going to keep them warm,” she said. Videos circulating online are said to show ICE agents slipping and sliding, falling over.

Her boss, Victoria Lauing, 54, a mother-of-two, urges caution. “There is no interest in provocation. Most folks here are really not taking the bait,” she said.

“It's different from 2020 when the murderer was one of our own in the police force.” Then the backlash was violent, this time there is a genuine realisation that taking on the Trump administration appears to be exactly what it wants.

“This may well be a personal vendetta. That is how Trump operates,” said Ms Lauing. “He wrote to Norway, explaining he was taking Greenland because he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize. He is a petulant child except he is a grown man.”

How Minneapolis continues to respond is another matter. The fear for many will be that the memory of Good will fade and ICE will persist. And then the White House will have won.

It deployed the agents en masse in part on the pretext of a billion dollar fraud ring, a great chunk of it perpetuated by Somalis, starting in the Covid-era that covered food programmes, housing, day care centres and other social service provisions.

To date, more than 90 people have been charged and 60 convicted, many of them Somalis. On the back of the scandal, Mr Walz announced he would not be seeking re-election.

Nobody really thinks sending gun-toting immigration agents to a city to clear up a fraud makes any sense.

Meanwhile, the department of justice (DoJ) has begun opening up fresh cases in the wake of Good's death. Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot her, is not under investigation but reports have suggested that Good's widow, Becca Good, is being investigated over allegations she impeded a federal officer in the moments before a shooting.

Mr Walz and Jacob Frey, Minneapolis's mayor, are also facing federal investigation by the DoJ over allegations they impeded ICE operations by encouraging locals on the ground to report and record agents' activities.

The DoJ is also investigating protesters who disrupted a Sunday service at a church in Minnesota where the local pastor was also said to be a senior ICE official in charge of local field services, who had appeared at a department of homeland security press conference back in the autumn ahead of the launch of Operation Metro Surge.

At least two people were arrested on Thursday.

It's the kind of stunt that's been cheered by the protesters, but has got the White House's backs up.

There have been clashes. Police have used pepper spray and tear gas to dispel crowds. Protest groups are split over whether to get more confrontational. Not less. The Minnesota immigrant rights action committee, a prominent anti-ICE group, issued a statement last week that declared: “There is violence and there is resistance to violence. They must not be equated.”

Asamblea de Derechos Civiles, the faith-based nonprofit, also pushed for a stronger response to what it called a “racist, fascist” federal government.

Ben Ramirez told the local Minnesota Star Tribune: “It's now time to take our gloves off. We will not go peacefully.”

Back at the Whipple federal building, demonstrators ignored the snow, the ice and bone-chilling cold to hurl obscenities – but nothing more – at the agents driving out the building. Elizabeth Bubnash, 40, an ICU doctor born in Minneapolis had flown in specially from Pennsylvania to register her dissent.

“They hit us with chemical weapons but we are staying peaceful,” she said. “The white community is seeing for the first time what the black community have been seeing for decades – that this is a country of white privilege and white supremacy. But now one of our own has been murdered in the street and now there is a white outcry.”

Minnesota's middle-classes will continue to register their anger in their largely polite ways.

Women dressed from Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale, but wearing gas marks, promenaded past the ICE facility, the literary reference presumably lost on their adversaries. Or else they held up placards that proclaimed “Hey ICE – was that bonus worth your soul?” and “I need to be able to tell my grandchildren I did not stay silent.”

In the bitter chill of Minnesota that really stings.

“I have zero doubt that they intend to withhold funds” for political reasons, one Democratic lawmaker said.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is ordering an administration-wide review of federal funding for over a dozen states, the vast majority of which are led by Democratic governors.

The review will focus on federal funding for the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Washington, all of which are led by Democrats. Washington, D.C. will also face a review from OMB.

The memo only orders the review of one Republican-led state, Vermont. Even that inclusion, however, comes with a caveat: While Vermont has a Republican governor, its state legislature is controlled by Democrats, meaning its purse strings are largely controlled by that party. 

The review is ostensibly meant to root out “fraud” in those states, and will likely target the supposed misuse of federal funds by immigrants in particular. Although state investigators have been tackling such fraud in Minnesota for months, the Trump administration has exaggerated the scale of the fraud, seemingly in order to scapegoat immigrants and justify attempts to block billions of dollars in federal funding to states.

According to the memo, the reporting request aims “to collect a detailed spending report on Federal funds,” and will “be used to better understand the scope of funding in certain States and localities in order to facilitate efforts to reduce the improper and fraudulent use of those funds through administrative means or legislative proposals to Congress.”

A response from the states is due by the end of this month. 

“We are moving forward with taking fraud seriously,” a spokesperson from OMB said.

That statement, however, is doubtful, given that all but one of the states OMB is targeting with its inquiry are controlled by Democrats.

Democratic lawmakers panned the OMB memo for being blatantly politically motivated.

“OMB has no goodwill. They never say what they mean. They never mean what they say,” said Rep. Joe Morelle (D-New York). “I have zero doubt that they intend to withhold funds and they intend to punish people who have different views than they do.”

“We have to fight it in the courts because it is all illegal, and the courts have shown they're not going to tolerate the disregard for the law,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Connecticut) said.

The OMB memo seeks to disrupt any legal recourse relating to its investigation.

“This is a data-gathering exercise only. It does not involve withholding funds, and therefore does not violate any court order,” the memo stated.

It's possible, though, that a legal challenge could still block the inquiry from moving forward, as the results of the OMB investigation could be used to unfairly block Democratic-led states only, since it includes just one GOP-led state.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks.

We can only resist Trump's attacks by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

 How Private Security Contractors Can Help Stabilize Gaza

 Elliott Abrams, Eric Edelman, and Rena Gabber

When world leaders gathered in Egypt last October to celebrate the cease-fire in Gaza, U.S. President Donald Trump was triumphant. “Nobody thought this could happen,” he said of the peace agreement. “Prayers of millions have finally been answered.” By stopping the fighting, he declared, “we've done a lot of the hardest part.”

Trump's excitement was understandable. It took two years of war and tough negotiations to reach “phase one” of his peace plan: the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and the return of the hostages. But to move from a cease-fire to a sustainable peace, negotiators will need to disarm and dethrone Hamas. And so far, the group has largely refused to give up its weapons. In fact, Hamas is reasserting its authority across much of the Gaza Strip by killing off its competitors and repeatedly firing on the Israel Defense Forces. As a result, the IDF cannot pull out of Gaza. Billions of dollars in reconstruction aid remains tied up. As long as Hamas remains in power, establishing a new governing body for the enclave comprised of Palestinian technocrats, as Trump has called for, will achieve little. The odds of renewed war will only increase.

There is no easy way to keep Hamas down. The IDF wants more time to rest, refit, and re-equip, and Israel would likely suffer from additional political and diplomatic repercussions if it launched a renewed ground offensive in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority's forces are not strong enough to fight Hamas, nor are they interested. And the states willing to join Trump's proposed international stabilization force for Gaza do not want their troops fighting against the group.

But there is a fourth option: private military contractors. Operating under the right rules of engagement and in accordance with Western best practices, private contractors have a track record of successfully operating in difficult environments. Many contractors, for example, helped the U.S. military during its war on terror. In Gaza, such forces, if properly supervised, could effectively and responsibly clear areas of Hamas militants and infrastructure. Contractors, in other words, could successfully limit Hamas's power over Gaza and its populace. Gazans might then get the new day they so desperately deserve.

Hamas was battered by Israel's military operations, but it was by no means destroyed. It still controls much of its extensive prewar tunnel network and a multitude of booby-trapped buildings. It retains the capacity to make improvised explosive devices and the ability to resupply via drones flown in from Egypt's Sinai peninsula. On the first day of the cease-fire, Hamas mobilized around 7,000 fighters in order to reassert its authority over the enclave. It is both rebuilding and reasserting itself across the half of Gaza that isn't occupied by Israel, which is where almost all of the strip's two million residents live. The organization is thus jeopardizing what is already a very fragile cease-fire. If Hamas continues to gain strength, Israel may need to ramp up its military operations by conducting more airstrikes and renew ground operations—an outcome everyone should want to avoid.

In theory, United Nations forces could move into the western half of Gaza instead of the IDF. UN forces have been employed to maintain and enforce other cease-fires in the region, and they could try to displace Hamas, particularly after the UN Security Council has endorsed Trump's peace plan. But given the political constraints under which UN forces have traditionally operated, such peacekeepers would likely prove ineffective—much as they have in Lebanon, where they failed to stymie the rearmament of Hezbollah and halt its military deployments south of the Litani River. Israel would also be reluctant to accept UN forces after some of the organization's aid workers played a role in the October 7 attack and because of the risk that UN troops will come under friendly fire when the IDF inevitably needs to carry out operations. And even if all these obstacles were to dissipate, UN peacekeepers are just that—peacekeepers. They are not equipped to handle a situation in which Hamas becomes powerful enough that intensive military action is needed.

Israel has more experience working with the Palestinian Authority's security forces than with UN peacekeepers. But PA forces would be extremely wary of fighting against Hamas in Gaza, where they would be seen as Israel's agents. Even if the authority's security forces were willing to operate in the enclave, they, too, would be unlikely to succeed. The PA, after all, was pushed out of Gaza by Hamas and has failed to stop terrorist groups in the West Bank, which are all much weaker than Hamas is.



The Trump administration is aware of these issues; that is why it proposed an international stabilization force. The UN Security Council resolution endorsing the U.S. president's peace plan authorizes an ISF and gives it a wide-reaching mission, including “demilitarizing” Gaza and assisting with border security, humanitarian aid, and other assorted needs. The resolution also states that the ISF will work with Egypt, Israel, and “the newly trained and vetted Palestinian police forces” to carry out its mandate. Multiple countries, most of them majority Muslim, have said they are interested in participating.

But these states have been clear that they will not join the ISF if it means fighting Hamas. Egypt has signaled it is open to sending troops, but only for keeping a peace that is already established. Jordan is willing to train a Palestinian police force, but Jordanian King Abdullah declared in October that the country would not send in troops of its own. “We hope that [the ISF mandate] is peacekeeping, because if it's peace enforcing, nobody will want to touch that,” he added. Indonesia offered to send up to 20,000 troops, but strictly for noncombat health and construction roles. The United Arab Emirates, one of Israel's closest regional allies, has said it will not provide any soldiers. Azerbaijan says it will not send troops, either. Turkey has offered soldiers, but it supports Hamas, and it has proposed that the ISF focus on separating Israeli soldiers from Hamas rather than disarming the latter. Israel has thus rightfully refused to let Turkey join.

The ISF will not materialize in the way it has been envisioned, which is as a multilateral force that would serve as Gaza's “long-term internal security solution.” And even if it does come together in this manner, it will probably be ineffective. The ISF's rules of engagement, for example, might not permit it to disarm Hamas. It might struggle to deconflict its operations from the IDF's, and thus avoid the awful diplomatic consequences that would follow bouts of friendly fire. The ISF's sponsors have yet to decide who gets to provide oversight and who gets to be in command. The ISF, in other words, is unlikely, impractical, and poorly defined. It is a catch-all solution that catches nothing.

Together, these pitfalls might make it seem as though the IDF and Hamas are on a collision course and that a lasting peace in Gaza is unattainable. Hamas, after all, is as unyielding and belligerent as terrorist groups come. But before sending Israeli forces back into the western part of Gaza, there is another option worth attempting: calling on private security contractors to demilitarize Gaza and clear areas of Hamas fighters and infrastructure.

Top-level security contractors are a viable but overlooked option for ridding postwar Gaza of Hamas. They are staffed by well-trained, highly capable military personnel with experience serving in elite units. They will not shy away from potential conflict with Hamas terrorists. In fact, they are perhaps the only force besides the IDF itself willing to directly confront Hamas and do the hard work of demilitarizing Gaza. A demilitarizing force composed of private contractors could also come together quickly, particularly compared to the ISF. That would allow it to push Hamas back before the group gains even more power.

Contractors also have a strong track record. Many have long reliably, responsibly, and effectively supported American military operations. They have successfully trained foreign military forces in Croatia, Georgia, and other countries; in Afghanistan, they successfully provided security for former President Hamid Karzai in a highly dangerous environment. They have been used with relative success to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa, as well. The degree of difficulty in Gaza is undoubtedly higher, but with sufficient numbers and strong backing by Israel, the United States, and Arab countries, contractors stand at least as good a chance of success as an international stabilization force willing to take on Hamas.

Compared with an ISF or UN peacekeepers, contractors could also prove easier to manage. The United States Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority—the U.S. government team charged with improving the Palestinian Authority's security capabilities and facilitating its cooperation with Israel—would command these forces and ensure they are deconflicted with Israeli forces. Doing this would likely prove easier than it would with the ISF or UN peacekeepers, given that private contractors have substantial experience coordinating operations with the national military force in control of a given area. The U.S. Central Command should keep the civil-military coordination center recently created in the Israeli city of Kiryat Gat, which has facilitated the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and helped plan the next phase of the cease-fire. But having Central Command run contractor operations could risk fraying U.S.-Israeli cooperation: CENTCOM could end up overseeing IDF operations, pulling it in multiple directions and straining U.S. military and political relationships with Israel. The U.S. Security Coordinator, by contrast, has decades of knowledge and experience with multilateral policing. The recently created Board of Peace established by Trump's UN-backed plan and charged with overseeing Gaza's reconstruction could provide further oversight.



Such supervision would help ensure that contractors maintain discipline and avoid harming civilians. The U.S. Security Coordinator could, for instance, make sure that the companies properly vet prospective contractors. The Board of Peace could give these contractors clear mandates and rules of engagement to ensure that they disarm Hamas while minimizing risks to civilians. Contractors who did not follow these standards could be fined, fired, expelled, lose their licenses, or forced to forfeit investments. When accidents or wrongdoing by a contractor does occur, as is inevitable in dense urban conflict against an enemy that uses civilians as human shields, such remedies will be relatively easy to impose. Privately hired personnel can be efficiently investigated and disciplined. It will be much harder for any overarching organization to penalize an independent country's forces.

As private contractors disarm Hamas, the Board of Peace can create an ISF to keep the peace. This force would be charged with ensuring that Hamas fighters do not regain control of hospitals and other infrastructure. It would also protect border routes and secure food delivery. A new Palestinian police force, meanwhile, would support the ISF and help it maintain the rule of law. To create this force, the European Union and the United States should scale up existing programs in Jordan and Egypt for training Palestinian police. Together, private contractors, the ISF, and Palestinian police officers would create a large enough combined force to actually stabilize Gaza. (According to Pentagon guidelines for stabilization operations, Gaza needs 40,000 to 50,000 security personnel overall for such a mission.)

In the meantime, the Board of Peace and Gaza's interim civil administration should encourage civilians to move to the part of the enclave currently controlled by Israel, where organizations can more easily offer assistance. The IDF should let these civilians cross in. Meanwhile, the Board of Peace, Arab partner countries, and aid groups should lead an initiative to start clearing out rubble and building infrastructure in the Israeli-controlled half of Gaza, including temporary housing, schools, hospitals, and more food distribution sites.

Demilitarizing Hamas will be an uphill battle no matter who is doing the fighting. It may ultimately require the IDF to reenter the parts of Gaza from which it has withdrawn. Hamas has many weapons and resources, and it will use them all in a desperate effort to maintain power. But even if the IDF does return and fight, there will eventually be a new cease-fire and new debates about how to dethrone Hamas. The world will then be right back where it is now—which is to say, in need of contractors. Disarming Hamas is essential to reaching a durable peace, and private contractors are an essential part of any viable path forward. They must be deployed, and as quickly as possible.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","How a Minneapolis federal building's namesake is inspiring resistance to the ICE actions happening inside","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/23/us/henry-whipple-building-minneapolis-ice","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:00:46 GMT","


            Federal officers in tactical gear line up at the driveway of a large block-shaped building wedged between the city limits of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Across from them, a crowd of protesters yell at the officers and sometimes try to block cars driving in and out.
    


            The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building has served as the backdrop for the ongoing tense dance in the Twin Cities since federal agents shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good earlier this month. Its stark brick structure is home base for the immigration proceedings at the heart of the crackdown in the state, prompting fear and anger.
    


            The man behind the name — Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple — would be standing outside with protesters if he were still alive, one historian and scholar said.
    


            Whipple, Minnesota's first Protestant Episcopal bishop, was known for advocating for the welfare of Native Americans and was a well-connected leader who stood up to government officials on their behalf throughout the mid-to-late 1800s, according to historians. While his legacy reflects his advocacy for those in the minority, it falls short of altruism and the building bearing his name perches on sacred land also known for its traumatic and violent history toward Indigenous peoples.
    


            Now, the Whipple Federal Building is where many people are temporarily detained after being swept up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Others are called to appear there for asylum and deportation hearings and other proceedings that have become increasingly confusing for migrants in the second Trump administration.
    


            Though Whipple, who died in 1901, began his term as bishop more than 165 years ago, some say he has influenced the protests and social justice efforts  present in the city today as activists respond to President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.
    


            Whipple “arrived in a Minnesota that was deeply racially divided at a national moment that was full of lots of conflict and tension,” said Craig Loya, current bishop of the Episcopal Church in Minnesota. “He spent his whole ministry, oftentimes at great personal cost, standing with Jesus on the side of those who were marginalized and excluded.”
    


            That imperative of standing with vulnerable people is something Loya said he thinks his congregation has carried on through the decades. Whipple was a “missionary bishop,” according to Michael McNally, the director of American Studies and professor of religion at Carleton College. Whipple and settlers were the newcomers in Minnesota. In the 18th century, the Dakota were living in the southern part of the state, and the Ojibwe were in the north, McNally said.
    


            The bishop wanted to extend the gospel to them and along the way developed a reputation as a well-connected person who would advocate for the tribes at a time when the White population wanted to remove them, McNally said.
    


            “Part of his story and his myth is that he was given a name that translates to a ‘straight tongue' because Ojibwe and Dakota leaders saw him as sort of worth their trust, but he also had a big network of people, and he was a very sort of powerful voice in DC and other places,” McNally said.
    


            While Whipple is best remembered for advocating for Native Americans, his attitude towards them was “paternalistic,” McNally said. Though he thought the Indigenous peoples could be neighbors with the White settlers, Whipple believed they had to assimilate to White culture to do so, he added.
    


            At the time, Whipple made it his aim to understand and advocate for Indigenous peoples' best interests — or rather “what we thought their best interests were,” he said.
    


            The result, McNally said, were Indian boarding schools in large part created by Whipple, where Native American children were forcibly taken, stripped of their culture and sometimes abused, he said.
    


            “I think he'd be out in the parking lot of the Whipple office building complaining about what's going on in there. But that doesn't mean that he's an uncomplicated person from the past with a real problematic legacy in terms of the boarding schools,” McNally said.
    


            In 2019, there were efforts to remove Whipple's name from the federal building, but not because of his complicated history, according to the campaign's leaders. Religious and community activists argued that he would have been opposed to what was taking place inside.
    


            The movement, known as “What Would Whipple Do?” was led by the Episcopal Church in Minnesota, the Minnesota Council of Churches, and the Interfaith Coalition on Immigration. The group said federal immigration officials were sending detainees from the Whipple building to Minnesota county jails, according to a letter sent to the federal government requesting the name change. They also claimed that a “well-oiled, ruthless, and inhumane deportation machine” was being run out of the federal building.
    


            “It came up because… Whipple never would have wanted his name on a building where these bad things are happening, because he was an advocate for people,” said Kathleen Motzenbecker, the refugee services director at the Minnesota Council of Churches.
    


            The building was named after Whipple when it opened to the public in 1969 at the initiative of then-Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota, someone Motzenbecker said was respected on both sides of the aisle and knew both the significance of the land and the importance of the bishop's legacy. Any push to rename the building now would likely take an act of Congress, according to a government report.
    


            But things have changed since the initial “What Would Whipple Do?” movement, with community and religious organizers like Motzenbecker saying the situation is even more urgent now than it was in 2019. The network of resources she said was strengthened by the campaign years ago is now in overdrive trying to help people.
    


            “There's a paramilitary group yanking people out of cars, armed men with masks. There's arrests before people get re-interviewed,” she said, adding that the new intensity is a product of a new initiative to reexamine the pending cases of legal refugees, on top of increased enforcement of illegal immigration policies. “That was not happening in 2019.”
    


            Federal agents surged to the city earlier this month and were met by demonstrators condemning President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement crackdown.
    


            Protests intensified after Good, a 37-year-old mother, was fatally shot by an ICE agent on January 7. Since then, demonstrators have been denouncing the agency and its use of force, leading to tense standoffs between officials in riot gear and protesters – many of them in front of the Whipple federal building. Other loosely organized groups have made an effort to follow and document immigration enforcement efforts and warn neighbors about where operations are taking place.
    


Federal authorities have called those who monitor ICE ‘domestic terrorists.' Here's what we know



            The group of advocates pushing for the Whipple building to be renamed did not stop fighting, even if the movement died off. Loya said it has evolved to respond to new, more pressing threats, taking the form of direct services and financial support for immigrants and refugees. A vigil is held every month by the Minnesota Interfaith Coalition outside the building. In that respect, the bishop said the movement “is still going strong.”
    


            “Even if we succeed in getting Bishop Whipple's name removed from the federal building, the injustices taking place there remain. And whether Bishop Whipple's name is on that building or not, we will continue to do everything we can to stand up with immigrants and to witness against the cruelty that is taking place inside,” Loya said.
    


            For the Episcopal Church Whipple once led, fighting for immigration and human rights continues. In addition to belief in the scripture, the church has been standing on the foundation of principles laid by Whipple, Loya said.
    


            The church has established a network of resources for immigrants and refugees and has been involved in legislative efforts for more than 60 years, said Loya. Through its Office of Government Relations, the church supports ongoing efforts to create comprehensive reform, refugee resettlement and pathways to citizenship, according to the church's website.
    


            Using the political and legal system to fight for social justice was a key part of Whipple's legacy, too, McNally said. The bishop was known to call on leaders in Washington, DC, New York and Philadelphia as well as influential people in Episcopal networks to advocate for his cause, he said. He also became a well-known consultant on Native Americans and served on commissions to try to address corruption in government organizations that dealt with policy around Indigenous peoples.
    


            Whipple persuaded President Abraham Lincoln to commute the sentences of the more than 300 arrested Dakota leaders after the US-Dakota war in 1862. Still, 38 were executed with little to no judicial process.
    


            Fort Snelling, where the Whipple building now sits, played a key role during and after the conflict. Weeks after the end of the war, more than 1,600 Dakota people, mostly women, children and the elderly, were marched hundreds of miles to a concentration camp nearby, according to the Minnesota Historical Society, and as many as 300 people died while they were detained over that winter.
    


            Several years later in 1871, Whipple went to bat again for the rights of the Ojibwe and Dakota people when the US wanted to end treaties with Native Americans, McNally said. As a consultant, he advocated to retain a treaty-based approach but said the government should no longer treat Native American tribes as independent nations. In the end, as Whipple desired, Congress passed the Indian Appropriations Act, essentially placing tribal nations under the control of the United States, according to the National Museum of the American Indian.
    


            Loya acknowledges Whipple's “complicated legacy” as he works to carry on the mission as his successor. He said Whipple was “standing with the vulnerable in the best way that he was capable” and that he too will “do that in an imperfect way.”
    


            Ramona Kitto Stately, a member of the Santee Dakota Nation, knows the lands surrounding the Whipple building well. They are part of her family history.
    


            The area of Fort Snelling encompasses not just the federal building, but the historical fort for which it is named, a state park and the airport. It is also the place of the Dakota people's creation story, and they have lived in the river valley for more than 1,200 years, according to Kitto Stately. In the Dakota language, it's called the Bdote — a word to describe the energy of where the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers converge, she said, the most sacred site to the Dakota people.
    


            Kitto Stately is the project director for the nonprofit We Are Still Here Minnesota, a group that wants to expand education about Indigenous peoples. The Bdote – the sacred land – includes the federal building and the land surrounding it on both sides of the river, she said.
    


            The current immigration actions at the site are triggering, Kitto Stately said.
    


            “We have a word in our Dakota language, because we have been through this, we have had people make us carry papers, people who have stolen our children, people who have just disappeared like our missing and murdered Indigenous women. It's something that we have constantly stood against. We even have a word in our language for these men that come and snatch people. We call it ‘wicayuze,'” Kitto Stately said.
    


            “It means ‘men snatchers' and so when we look at our history and we connect it with our language we already know that this has happened in our past. We already have a name for them,” she said.



            The Dakota and other Indigenous peoples in Minneapolis have not been silent about the ICE actions in the city. Kitto Stately said there is a group involved in peaceful protests and which has been present outside the only inner-city reservation, a 212-unit housing development called Little Earth. Enhanced security measures are in place around casinos and large event spaces owned by Native Americans, she added.
    


            Last week, the Native American Rights Fund said in a statement that it stands “with our neighbors —whatever their country of birth — who are getting ripped away from their families or violently apprehended for their lawful efforts to protect their communities” and called for an end to ICE's campaign.
    


            Recent reports of Native Americans being stopped at their homes and workplaces and being questioned or detained by federal agents, has revived historic trauma, Kitto Stately said.
    


            Especially in Minnesota, the fear of being arrested and taken to the Whipple building — the very site of the Dakota people's forced encampment years ago — is present in the community, she said.
    


            “I mean, who's more of a citizen than a Native American person with tribal ID,” she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","‘Mr. President, it's now time': Social conservatives beg Trump for abortion pill crackdown","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/23/politics/march-for-life-abortion-pill-mifepristone-lawsuit","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:00:46 GMT","


            As thousands of protestors demonstrate in Washington, DC, at Friday's annual March for Life, the Trump administration faces a deadline to explain why it opposes a lawsuit that would achieve a key goal of its allies in the anti-abortion movement by ending the availability of abortion pills by mail.
    


            The lawsuit, brought by Louisiana against the President Donald Trump-appointed health officials, is one of several pressure points the anti-abortion movement is pressing to push the administration to limit access to medication abortion, which now accounts for roughly two-thirds of all abortions in the United States.
    


            “We're at a point where, from a lot of the pro-life movement's perspective, this is too important to play political games with,” Katie Glenn Daniel, the director of legal affairs for SBA Pro-Life America, told CNN. “They could pull these drugs out of the mail tomorrow. The justification is more than there.”
    


‘The most feminist thing you can do for yourself is not take birth control': The shifting politics of the pill



            While Trump has erected some hurdles to abortion in his second term, his administration has not reversed regulatory rules that have allowed abortion pills to be sent by the mail. That policy, enacted under President Joe Biden, has made it possible for women within states that limit of ban abortion to obtain the two-step drug regimen used to terminate a pregnancy.
    


            Trump health officials promised to look at the drug's safety data, but they have been noncommittal about when that would happen, or if they would ultimately reverse the Biden-era changes.
    


            “Where we are is that that the Trump administration has managed not to say anything,” said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at UC-Davis and author of several books about the anti-abortion movement. “It seems pretty clear politically that all the steps that Republicans and abortion opponents are taking aren't really moving the administration.”
    


            Anger within the anti-abortion community over the lack of action has reached a fever pitch and is manifesting in lawsuits, congressional hearings and calls for the firing of a top Trump appointee.
    


            “We can simply fix this if we have the courage to do it,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and staunch Trump ally, said last week. “So, what all of us are telling the administration: ‘you've been a very pro-life president, Mr. President, it's now time to deal with this issue.'”
    


            The White House, which did not respond to CNN's inquiry, is this week announcing new anti-abortion measures related to federal funding, including an expansion of a policy that bars foreign aid to groups that promote abortion. But SBA-List said that addressing abortion drugs was an “urgent” issue the administration must act on.
    


            “If there are those that don't care about the life issue, they should care about the politics of this,” said Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council. “This is going to be a political problem for those who have sold out the pro-life movement.”
    


            At a Senate hearing last week that aired GOP grievances about how medication abortion was reaching states that had banned the procedure, Republicans made clear that they had lost patience with the administration.
    


            “Republican members of this committee and many other senators expect an answer,” said Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the chair of the committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. “At an absolute minimum, the previous in-person safeguards should be restored and that should be done immediately.”
    


            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr said in a September letter to Republican attorneys general that he had ordered drug regulators to “review the latest data” on mifepristone's risks and safety. But Kennedy and agency spokespeople did not say when the review began or how long it would take.
    


            Abortion advocates and mifepristone manufacturers say that years of data show the drug is overwhelmingly safe and has fewer reported side effects than Viagra or penicillin. Mifepristone is also safer than procedural abortions, which are banned or heavily restricted in more than a dozen states.
    


            The Food and Drug Administration also approved a generic version of the abortion pill last fall, further infuriating conservative leaders. Graham led a letter with nearly all of the Senate GOP caucus demanding that the FDA revoke access to the drug while it conducts the review.
    


            “It's not even that things are paused where they were the day the president came into office. They are worse because there is another generic now on the market,” said Daniel of SBA Pro-Life America.
    


            Trump has checked some boxes off the anti-abortion movement's wish list, by reversing federal guidance requiring hospitals provide abortions in medical emergencies, restricting Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, and barring abortion at Veterans Affairs facilities.
    


            And without the justices appointed by Trump in his first term, the Supreme Court would not have overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a monumental victory for the anti-abortion movement that ended national protections for abortion access and allowed states to ban the procedure.
    


            To their dismay, however, the number of abortions has gone up since that court decision, with the provision of abortion pills by mail driving the increase.
    


            The FDA has not made any changes to the rules around medication abortion and neither Secretary Kennedy, nor FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, have testified before congressional committees in recent months. Makary, who has faced calls from anti-abortion groups that he be fired, also made comments to a conservative outlet in December suggesting that the mifepristone review was still in an early phase.
    


            “I hope the rumors are false, some of them are in print, that the agency is intentionally slow walking its study on mifepristone's health risks. I really hope that that's not the case,” Sen. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican, said at last week's hearing.
    


            In a statement, HHS denied that the review was being slow-walked for political reasons, and it said that the “FDA's scientific review process is thorough and takes the time necessary to ensure decisions are grounded in gold-standard science.”
    


            Facing indifference from the administration, last week's Senate hearing showcased the case the anti-abortion movement is now making about the current medication abortion rules, framing the pervasiveness of abortion-by-mail as a public health danger. The testimony of GOP witnesses highlighted accusations that women were being coerced to take the drugs and were allegedly facing increased health risks by not having an in-person visit with a doctor first.
    


            “This is basically setting a stage to demand a different reaction from the Trump administration,” said Rachel Rebouché, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law who specializes in reproductive health law.
    


Anti-abortion movement seeks to escalate clashes over blue state ‘shield' laws



            While their counterparts in Congress hold hearings and press conferences, anti-abortion state officials are going to court to force changes to access to medication abortion.
    


            Six states are currently suing the FDA over its rules for the drug. Missouri, Kansas and Idaho are carrying forward a case, originally brought under the Biden administration by anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations, that seeks to reverse several FDA moves that made medication abortion easier to obtain.
    


            A separate case, brought by Florida and Texas, is trying to reverse the 2000 approval of mifepristone as well, effectively banning medication abortion.
    


            The Louisiana lawsuit is not challenging the underlying approval of mifepristone, focusing on FDA's rules around the drug instead, but it's taken a more aggressive approach in the litigation. The state has asked for a preliminary order that would immediately end the provision of abortion pills by mail while the lawsuit plays out.
    


            Its filing cited specifically the reports that the FDA was moving on a slow track to complete the review of the drug.
    


            “There should be no reason why they shouldn't just simply agree or take their own action,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told CNN. “If they want to moot my lawsuit or any of our concerns about this… they should just do what they said.”
    


            The Trump administration must file its brief opposing Louisiana's emergency request by Monday, and the judge will hold a hearing on the matter in late February.
    


Trump administration halts use of human fetal tissue in NIH-funded research



            The legal cases are a more effective tool to force Trump's hand than the political pressure, said Zeigler, because the administration can't avoid taking a position in court.
    


            “Court decisions are not within the administration's control in the same way these political decisions are, which means there's a lot more unpredictability there,” Ziegler said.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy urged Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores Friday to protest immigration enforcement operations, even as subzero temperatures beset the state.

Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the Twin Cities for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.

Organizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses across the state have closed for the day in solidarity with the protest -- from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.

“We're achieving something historic,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 groups that is mobilizing. The demonstration coincides with a blast of cold air hitting the Upper Midwest and ahead of a severe winter storm that is expected to affect millions. 

On Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative from that of a 5-year-old boy detained by ICE officers in Minneapolis by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.

Organizers hope Friday's mobilization will be the largest coordinated protest action to date, with a march in downtown Minneapolis planned for Friday afternoon. Earlier Friday, the temperature in Minneapolis was minus 21 with a wind chill of minus 40 (minus 29 Celsius with a wind chill of minus 40 Celsius). 




Havelin compared the presence of immigration officers in Minnesota to the winter weather warnings.

“Minnesotans understand that when we're in a snow emergency … we all have to respond and it makes us do things differently,” she said. “And what's happening with ICE in our community, in our state, means that we can't respond as business as usual.”

Somali businesses especially have lost sales during the enforcement surge as workers and customers, fearing detention, stay at home. 

Many schools were planning to close Friday, but cited different reasons. The University of Minnesota and the St. Paul public school district said there would be no in-person classes because of the extreme cold. Minneapolis Public Schools were scheduled to be closed “for a teacher record keeping day.”

Clergy planned to join the march as well as hold prayer services and fasting, according to a delegation of representatives of faith traditions including Buddhist, Jewish, Lutheran and Muslim.

Bishop Dwayne Royster, leader of the progressive organization Faith in Action, arrived in Minnesota on Wednesday from Washington, D.C.

“We want ICE out of Minnesota,” he said. “We want them out of all the cities around the country where they're exercising extreme overreach.”

Royster said at least 50 of his network's faith-based organizers were joining the protest. About 10 were traveling from Los Angeles while others from the same group planned a solidarity rally in California, said one of the organizers there.

“It was a very harrowing experience,” said the Rev. Jennifer Gutierrez of the large immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles last year. “We believe God is on the side of migrants.”

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Since coming to the United States 30 years ago from Mexico, Fernando Perez said U.S. immigration officers have stopped by his home numerous times, but he has never once answered the door. 

“There are rules and I know them,” said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day laborer from contractors and people renovating their homes. 

Over the decades it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution's Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government's forced entry into someone's home.

As a result, immigration officers have had to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.

But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people's homes without a judge's warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades. 

The change comes as immigration arrests nationwide soar under a mass deportation campaign by President Donald Trump's administration that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on. 




“But if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent — they are not paying the rent — that's the last straw,” he said.

Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.

It is unclear how broadly the memo's directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man's home in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Blumenthal said in a news release.

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the “physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.”

For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.

In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he didn't leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

ICE has tried what the agency called “knock and talks” to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.

More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game — a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations.

Since shortly after ICE was created in 2003, advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments have diligently spread the word that people should not open their doors for immigration officers unless they can show a warrant signed by a judge. 

They've held know-your-rights trainings for communities, passed out flyers and posted videos on social media to teach immigrants how to protect themselves. 

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School's Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo “quite disturbing.”

“Know-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it's sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,” he said. “They know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.”

In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door. 

“They send us bulletins, to not answer the door, to not answer any questions,” he said.

Another man said he learned that from TikTok.

Trump's border czar Tom Homan has been highly critical of groups providing the information.

“They call it ‘know-your-rights,'” he said last year on CNN. “I call it ‘how to escape arrest.'”

The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.

Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they're at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn't work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk. 

With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of U.S. citizens.

Arulanantham said agents' aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.

“This would just be another step down that path,” he said. “Obviously it will be more significant because it suggests you're not safe even in your own house.”

BRUSSELS (AP) — The cold, hard reality facing any U.S., NATO or European plans for Greenland is the ice. It chokes harbors, entombs minerals, and freezes shorelines into minefields of white and blue shards that threaten ships all year.

And the only way to break through all that is, well, with icebreakers: enormous ships with burly engines, reinforced hulls, and heavy bows that can crush and cleave ice. 

But the United States has only three such vessels, one of which is so decrepit as to be barely usable. It has entered agreements to obtain 11 more, but can only source additional ships from adversaries — or allies it has recently rebuffed.

Despite toning down his rhetoric, U.S. President Donald Trump seems set on the U.S. owning Greenland for security and economic reasons: to keep what he calls “the big, beautiful piece of ice” out of the hands of Moscow and Beijing, to secure a strategic Arctic location for U.S. assets, and to extract the island's mineral wealth including rare earths. 

Without specifying any plan, he told world leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday that “to get to this rare earth you got to go through hundreds of feet of ice.”

Yet there is no meaningful way to do that — or anything else in the semiautonomous Danish territory — without icebreakers' crucial ability to cut trails through frozen seas.

Even if they decided to surge U.S. material into Greenland tomorrow, “they would have two or three years gap in which they're not really able to access the island most of the time,” said Alberto Rizzi, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.




“On a map, Greenland looks surrounded by sea, but the reality is that the sea is full of ice,” he said.

If the U.S. wants more icebreakers, there are only four options: the shipyards of strategic adversaries China and Russia or longtime allies Canada and Finland, both of whom have recently weathered blistering criticism and threats of tariffs by Trump over Greenland.

Icebreakers are expensive to design, build, operate and maintain and require a skilled workforce that can only be found in certain places like Finland, with expertise forged in the frigid Baltic Sea. 

Finland has built roughly 60% of the world's fleet of more than 240 icebreakers and designed half the remainder, Rizzi said. 

“It's very niche capabilities that they developed as a necessity first and then they have been able to turn it into geoeconomic leverage,” he said.

Russia has the world's largest fleet with about 100 vessels, including colossal ships powered by nuclear reactors. Second comes Canada, which is set to double its fleet to around 50 icebreakers, according to a 2024 report by Aker Arctic, a Helsinki-based icebreaker design firm.

“Our design and engineering work order books are pretty full at the moment and the near future looks promising,” said Jari Hurttia, business manager at Aker Arctic, as he describes rising interest in the firm's “unrivalled special competence which is not available anywhere else in the world.”

China currently has five compared to the U.S. three, and is rapidly building more as they expand their ambitions in the Arctic, said Marc Lanteigne, a professor at the University of Tromsø in Norway who teaches often at the University of Greenland in Nuuk.

“China is now in a position to develop indigenous icebreakers, and so the U.S. feels it must do the same,” he said.

Washington has to play catch up, and fast, said Sophie Arts, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund focused on Arctic security.

“President Trump has really bemoaned this lack of icebreakers, especially in comparison to Russia,” Arts said. The 2 of the 3 U.S. icebreakers are “basically past their life cycle already.”

So he turned to the undeniable expertise of the European Union's northernmost nation and the U.S.'s neighbor to the north.

“Both Canada and Finland are really, really vital to this,” Arts said. “Cooperation is what makes this possible ... the U.S. doesn't really have a pathway to do this on its own at this time.”

During his first administration, Trump prioritized the U.S. military's acquisition of ice-capable vessels, a strategy that the Biden administration followed up on by signing an agreement called the Ice PACT with Helsinki and Ottawa to deliver 11 icebreakers constructed by two corporate consortiums with Finnish designs.

Four would be built in Finland, while seven would be constructed in a Canadian-owned billion-dollar “American Icebreaker Factory” in Texas as well as a shipyard in Mississippi under joint U.S.-Canadian ownership.

Any mining of critical minerals would face high costs in the harsh conditions at sea and on land in Greenland. Investments there would take years if not decades to pay off, Lanteigne said. 

Even with adequate icebreakers, the price to build and maintain mining or defensive facilities — like those envisioned in the yet-unfunded $175 billion Golden Dome missile defense network linking detectors and interceptors in space and on the ground — would be enormous.

That means U.S. allies in the Arctic might still welcome more investment by Washington in Greenland.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement that she would be open to strengthening Arctic security including the U.S. Golden Dome program “provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity.”

While both the U.S. and the 27-nation European Union including Denmark and Finland have pledged to vastly increase investment in Greenland, it is clear who currently has the hard-power capability to actually reach the vast frozen territory roughly three times the size of Texas. 

“It's kind of absurd because I don't think Finland would scrap the deal with the U.S. as a response to threatening to invade Greenland,” Rizzi said. “But if Europe wants to exercise significant leverage to the USA, they could say ‘We're not going to give you any icebreakers and good luck reaching the Arctic, or projecting power there, with those two old ships that you have.'”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reminded world leaders Tuesday at Davos of the key EU-technology base for any Arctic endeavors. 

“Finland — one of the newest NATO members — is selling its first icebreakers to the U.S.,” von der Leyen said at the World Economic Forum. 

“This shows that we have the capability right here, in the ice so to speak, that our northern NATO members have Arctic-ready forces right now, and above all, that Arctic security can only be achieved together.”

She announced after an emergency summit of the 27 EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday that the EU would surge defense spending in Greenland including an icebreaker.

With many Americans still recovering from repeated snowstorms and bitter cold in the North, a new weekend storm could glaze roads, trees and power lines with damaging ice across much of the South.

KENNESAW, Ga. (AP) — Millions of Americans from New Mexico to the Carolinas are bracing for a potentially catastrophic ice storm that could crush trees and power lines and knock out power for days, while Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Boston could see enough snow to make travel very difficult or nearly impossible, forecasters say.

More than 170 million people — about half the population of the United States — were in the path of heavy snow and crippling ice, the National Weather Service said Friday. Alerts from the weather service stretched from Arizona and Montana in the West to the Carolinas and Maine in the east.

The storm, which began early Friday and continues through the weekend, is also projected to bring heavy snow and all types of wintry precipitation, including freezing rain and sleet. An atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas before heading northeast, forecasters said.




“Snow amounts could reach a foot or more in the I-95 major cities from D.C. to Boston,” said weather service forecasters on the East Coast, who are increasingly confident the storm will strike the big cities.

More than 1,500 flights scheduled to fly through U.S. airports Saturday were canceled by the time the storm began early Friday, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Airports in Dallas, Atlanta, Oklahoma and Tennessee were among the most affected.

Here's a look at the storm and how people are preparing for it, by the numbers:

The number of snowplows owned by the city of Jackson, Mississippi, where a mix of ice and sleet is possible this weekend. The city uses other heavy machinery like skid steers and small excavators to clear roads, said James Caldwell, deputy director of public works. Jackson also has three trucks that carry salt and sand to spread across roads before freezing weather.




The amount of ice — half an inch, or 1.27 centimeters — that can lead to a crippling ice storm, toppling trees and power lines to create widespread and long-lasting power outages. The latest forecasts from the weather service warn of the potential for a half-inch of ice or more for many areas, including parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee.

The number of Nashville snowplows named after country music legend and Tennessee native Dolly Parton (Dolly Plowton). Another snowplow in East Tennessee was named Snowlene after her classic hit song “Jolene” as part of a 2022 naming contest.

The number of layers needed to keep warm in extreme cold. AP video journalist Mark Vancleave in Minnesota explains the benefits of all three — a base layer, a middle layer and an outer shell — in this video.

The number of beet juice-dispensing trucks in the city of Chicago, according to Cole Stallard, Chicago's commissioner of Streets and Sanitation. The natural sugars of beet juice lower the freezing point of water, allowing salt mixtures to work at much lower temperatures and preventing refreezing, while also helping salt stick to the road longer.

The number of snow and ice removal trucks operated by Memphis, Tennessee's Division of Public Works. The city also has six trucks that spread brine, a mixture designed to melt wintry precipitation. Statewide, the Tennessee Department of Transportation has 851 salt trucks and 634 brine trucks, and most of the salt trucks double as plows.

The degree in Fahrenheit when water freezes, equivalent to 0 Celsius. This is a magic number when it comes to winter weather, said Eric Guillot, a scientist at the weather service. If the temperature is slightly above 32, it will be mostly liquid. But the colder it is below the mark, the more efficiently precipitation will freeze.

The number of snowplow trucks at the ready in Nashville, Tennessee, according to the Nashville Department of Transportation and Multimodal Infrastructure.

The windchill value — how cold it feels to a person when winds are factored in — that is expected in parts of the Northern Plains, the weather service projects. That equates to minus 45.6 Celsius and is forecast for parts of northern Minnesota and North Dakota.

“When the weather forecast says, ‘feels like negative 34,' it's just a matter of covering skin and being prepared for it,” said Nils Anderson, who owns Duluth Gear Exchange, an outdoor equipment store in Duluth, Minnesota.

The number of miles added last year to snowplow routes in Nashville, Tennessee. That was done “to get deeper into our neighborhoods — roads that had never been plowed before,” said Alex Apple, a spokesperson for Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell.

Texas has this number of pieces of winter weather equipment, including snowplows, motor graders and brine tankers, Texas Department of Transportation spokesperson Adam Hammons said. He said the agency also works with state partners and contractors to get more equipment when needed. In the Dallas area, “right now our main focus is treating our roadways in advance of the storm,” agency spokesperson Tony Hartzel said Wednesday.

The number of cubic yards of salt on hand at the Arkansas Department of Transportation. The state has 121 salt houses around the Arkansas, plus 600 salt spreaders and 700 snowplows, said Dave Parker, an agency spokesperson.

Before they even began the process of interviewing more than a dozen people for their coaching vacancy, the Baltimore Ravens knew plenty about Jesse Minter.

Now he has the job.

The Ravens hired the 42-year-old Minter on Thursday, just over two weeks after they fired longtime coach John Harbaugh. Minter is a familiar face, part of both Harbaugh's coaching tree and his brother Jim's. Minter's first four seasons (2017-20) as an NFL assistant were with the Ravens, and he spent the past two years as defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers.

“Jesse was impressive throughout our incredibly thorough interview process,” owner Steve Bisciotti said in a statement. “He clearly understands the values, high expectations and history of the Ravens, and he has a great vision for the future.”

Minter was a big name on the coaching market, interviewing virtually with several teams — including the Pittsburgh Steelers, who are looking for a coach after Mike Tomlin stepped down last week — before landing in Baltimore. His task with the Ravens includes helping two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson get back on track after an injury-plagued 2025 season in which Baltimore missed the playoffs.

“This is an organization whose values, culture and tradition of excellence reflect everything I believe about the game of football and how it should be played,” Minter said in a statement.

Minter was scheduled to have a second interview with Cleveland on Thursday before informing the Browns he was dropping out of consideration.




Baltimore was viewed as a top job opening because of Jackson's presence and the organization's stability over the years. The Ravens certainly talked to plenty of candidates, including Minter, Joe Brady, Anthony Campanile, Brian Flores, Vance Joseph, Kliff Kingsbury, Klint Kubiak, Mike McDaniel, Matt Nagy, Robert Saleh, Jim Schwartz, Nathan Scheelhaase, Chris Shula, Kevin Stefanski, Anthony Weaver and Davis Webb. Stefanski was hired by the Atlanta Falcons and Saleh by the Tennessee Titans.

The Ravens decided to move on from Harbaugh after his 18 seasons at the helm, but Baltimore did a lot right during those years. Mike Macdonald, a former defensive coordinator under Harbaugh, has been a big success as Seattle's head coach, with the Seahawks playing for the NFC title this weekend.

Minter and Macdonald were on the same staff in Baltimore. Minter advanced to the role of defensive backs coach before taking the defensive coordinator job at Vanderbilt. He spent one season with the Commodores before taking over as Michigan's defensive coordinator under Jim Harbaugh and spending two years there. The 2023 Wolverines won the national title, then Minter went to the Chargers when they hired Jim Harbaugh as their head coach.

Minter now becomes the fourth head coach in the Ravens' 31-year history.

“Jesse is a strong leader who possesses a brilliant football mind and a spirit that will resonate with our players and fan base alike,” Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said in a statement. “Jesse comes from a football family, with success at every level of the sport, and we are confident that he is the right coach to lead the Ravens forward.”

The Ravens were the fifth team to fill a head coaching vacancy this offseason. Arizona, Buffalo, Cleveland, Las Vegas and Pittsburgh still have openings. 

The Chargers were fifth in the league in total defense this season, allowing 285.2 yards per game. They allowed a league-low 17.7 points per game in 2024. Jim Harbaugh said during his season-ending news conference last week that it was only a matter of time before Minter would get his chance to be a head coach.

“The product that Jesse has established as the head coach of the defense, that's so good that we know it's a matter of when. We've been preparing for that,” Harbaugh said.

The Ravens endured a tumultuous 2025 season marked by a 1-5 start and major injuries, from Jackson to defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike. Baltimore still went into a Week 18 showdown with Pittsburgh with a chance to win the AFC North.

Rookie kicker Tyler Loop's potential game-winning field goal on the final play sailed wide right, handing the division crown to the Steelers.

John Harbaugh, the NFL's second-longest tenured head coach, was out of a job days later. Harbaugh didn't stay out of work long. He was hired to the same position by the New York Giants last week.

Although Jackson remains Baltimore's centerpiece, for the past couple of seasons the defense has lacked the ferocity the organization takes pride in. Minter will attempt to improve that, and it remains to be seen who he'll bring in to coach Jackson and the offense.

Rick Minter, Jeese's father, has more than 45 years of coaching experience in the college and pro ranks, including 10 seasons as the head coach at the University of Cincinnati.

During his time at Cincinnati, Minter had future NFL coaches John Harbaugh, Tomlin and Rex Ryan on his staff, as well as Jimbo Fisher. Harbaugh and Tomlin have each won a Super Bowl, and Fisher won a national title at Florida State.

The two leaders clasped hands for about 26 seconds.

President Donald Trump has turned up the heat on European leaders as he looks to ink a deal for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, including a specific focus on French President Emmanuel Macron in recent weeks. 

Trump was in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum Wednesday and Thursday, delivering a speech and holding bilateral meetings with foreign leaders at the annual conference that attracts foreign dignitaries, business leaders and celebrities to discuss the world's economy. 

The president's visit to Switzerland came as he threatened to impose tariffs on eight European nations if no deal on the U.S. acquiring Greenland was achieved by Feb. 1. Initial tariffs would have begun at 10% on goods from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was set to increase to 25% by June 1 if there is no deal by that point. 

Trump has put many of Europe's top leaders on notice as he looks to secure the deal, but he has taken an outsized focus on Macron.

The French president has meanwhile vowed from Davos that France will stand up to ""bullies"" and added that U.S. threats to impose tariffs in a bid to acquire Greenland was ""fundamentally unacceptable.""

Trump announced Wednesday that he would not impose tariffs that were set to take effect, citing a ""framework of a future deal"" with NATO involving Greenland and the Arctic region.

""Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

The French president was pulled into more U.S. headlines in early January, after the U.S. military successfully captured Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and his wife, which opened the floodgates to heightened discussions of the U.S. making moves to acquire Greenland from Denmark. 

Days after Maduro's capture and as talks of Greenland mounted, Trump joined House Republican lawmakers Jan. 6, when he imitated Macron's accent while recounting how Trump pressured Macron to raise drug prices in France in 2025 as the U.S. looked to bring parity to its sky-high prescription costs compared to other nations.

""He's a nice guy,"" Trump said before launching into an accent and recounting their conversation in a viral moment. 

Trump again put on a French accent to recount the same conversation he held with Macron Jan. 16 during a rural healthcare roundtable at the White House. 

""I said, ‘Emmanuel,'"" Trump recounted. 

""'Yes, Donald, Donald. Thank you so much for calling,'"" he continued, using an accent to indicate Macron was speaking.

""I said, 'You're not going to like this call,'"" Trump continued. 

TRUMP'S ‘SMALL ASK' FOR GREENLAND WOULD BE THE REAL ESTATE DEAL OF A LIFETIME

Trump recounted the story to show his long history as the deal-maker-in-chief and pressure Macron to raise France's ultra-low government-set prices that Trump said let pharmaceutical companies shift costs onto Americans. 

France was listed among eight countries facing additional tariffs if no Greenland deal is made. Trump singled out France early Tuesday morning when he shared a text message Macron sent Trump, which included the French leader saying, ""I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.""

""My friend, We are totally in line on Syria(.) We can do great things on Iran(.)"" Macron wrote, according to the screenshot. ""I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland(.) Let us try to build great things: 1) i (sic) can set up a g7 meeting after Davos in Paris on thursday afternoon. I can invite the ukrainians, the danish, the syrians and the russians in the margins 2) let us have a dinner together in Paris together on thursday before you go back to the us.""

The president also shared a text from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on social media, who told Trump that he was ""committed to finding a way forward on Greenland.""

""It just made my point,"" Trump said in an interview with The New York Post of why he shared the messages. ""They're saying, ‘Oh gee, let's have dinner, let's do this, let's do that.' It just made my point.""

Simultaneous to talks on potentially acquiring Greenland, Trump extended invitations to a swath of foreign leaders to join the Gaza Board of Peace, which is styled as a new oversight body tied to the next phase of the Gaza peace plan that the Trump administration ironed out in 2025.

Macron turned the invitation down, with his office saying the Board of Peace proposal ""goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question,"" according to Politico.  

TRUMP CHALLENGES CARNEY AT DAVOS, ASSERTS CANADA SHOULD BE 'GRATEFUL' FOR GOLDEN DOME MISSILE DEFENSE

Trump, again, targeted Macron with fiery comments when asked about the declined invitation. 

""Oh, did he say that? Well nobody wants him, because he's gonna be out of office very soon. That's alright. What I'll do is if they feel like hostile, I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes and he'll join. But he doesn't have to join. If he said that, you're probably giving it to me a little bit differently, but if he actually did say that — but as you know, he's gonna be out of office in a few months,"" Trump said.

Macron's term ends in 2027, and he is unable to run for a third consecutive term under French law. 

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on the president's rhetoric focused on Macron and France's role in a potential Greenland deal but did not immediately receive a reply. 

Trump underscored from his speech in Davos Wednesday that ""no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States."" Trump is looking to acquire the island from Denmark for national security purposes, citing its strategic location among the United States, Russia and China.

""All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,"" Trump said Wednesday from his speech at the World Economic Forum. ""Where we've already had it as a trustee, but respectfully returned it back to Denmark not long ago after we defeated the Germans, the Japanese, the Italians and others in World War II, we gave it back to them.""

Trump also took a shot at Macron during his address to the body, remarking on the French president wearing sunglasses during public events before again recounting his prior discussion with him regarding drug prices. 

TRUMP TELLS DAVOS US ALONE CAN SECURE GREENLAND, INSISTS HE WON'T 'USE FORCE'

""I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses,"" Trump said to the crowd. ""What the hell happened?"" 

Macron spoke before the World Economic Forum Tuesday while wearing aviator sunglasses, sparking mockery and memes online. Macron's office said he had worn them due to a burst blood vessel and need to protect his eyes. 

""Competition from the United States of America through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions, and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe,"" Macron said from Davos in a hit on Trump. ""Combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable – even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty.""

Marques Armstrong, the husband of Nekima Levy Armstrong, speaks out following her arrest on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. 

The husband of a woman whom Attorney General Pam Bondi said ""played a key role"" in the storming of a church in Minnesota this week by an anti-U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) mob is now speaking out, slamming the ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" prosecution. 

Marques Armstrong made a reference to the cult MTV sitcom as he spoke Thursday following the arrest of his wife Nekima Levy Armstrong. Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly were also taken into custody. 

""Continue to pray for us. Understand that this is not our first rodeo. Threats on our lives have been coming since we have been doing this work,"" Armstrong said.  

""I won't go into too much detail about the Beavis and Butt-Head show for the prosecution,"" he continued.

""We are making a statement, we are making a stand not just for the individuals here, not just our state, but for this entire nation. I want to encourage us to continue to stand up and peacefully protest. We cannot afford to take the bait,"" Armstrong added. ""I repeat, we cannot afford to take the bait and be provoked into violence. That will give the people over in the administration the green light to unleash more hell upon our state."" 

FBI Director Kash Patel said Armstrong's arrest was in connection with an alleged violation of the FACE Act, which prohibits interfering with the exercise of religion at a place of worship. Kelly allegedly stormed the Cities Church service in St. Paul and berated congregants, according to video posted online, while Allen is a member of the St. Paul School Board who also helped organize the protest. 

""Minutes ago at my direction, HSI and FBI agents executed an arrest in Minnesota,"" Bondi wrote on X on Thursday, adding, ""We have arrested Nekima Levy Armstrong, who allegedly played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.""

""Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,"" Bondi also said. 

Marques Armstrong said on Thursday that, ""My wife wasn't taken."" 

""She gave herself up, tall, no crime. Y'all know who she is. She is fierce, she is strong, and she is powerful. That is how she stood. We have the videos to prove that, to dispel the lies and the twisting of the truth that this administration constantly does on a consistent basis. And for those of you who are following this group of liars, criminals, thieves, shame on you,"" he said. 

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.

""The actions of Chauntyll Allen, my wife, Nekima Levy Armstrong, and all of the protesters were not criminal, violent, or destructive,"" Armstrong also said. ""They did not harm any person or animal, damage property, or incite chaos. Their conduct remained nonviolent, verbal, restrained, which matters both morally and legally. What motivated their action was not lawlessness but consciousness.""

Former ATF special agent Bernard Zapor evaluates the Trump administration's crusade against criminal gangs on ‘Fox Report.'

A Venezuelan national accused of threatening Arizona residents at gunpoint while claiming control over part of a Maricopa County community is facing multiple felony charges, including terrorism, authorities said.

Arizona Department of Public Safety investigators allege Javier Enrique Erazo-Zuniga, 27, claimed control over part of Maricopa and threatened residents with deadly weapons in an effort to extort money, according to reporting by InMaricopa and statements from state authorities.

DPS spokesperson Bart Graves told InMaricopa detectives began investigating Erazo-Zuniga in December after receiving information that he was ""claiming Hidden Valley in Maricopa as his territory and demanding money from victims.""

Investigators allege Erazo-Zuniga was tied to a series of violent incidents involving residents who were targeted at their homes. In one 2024 incident, authorities say he put a victim in a headlock and held a knife to the person's neck, leaving a cut. Last month, investigators allege he waited at the end of another victim's driveway and held the victim at gunpoint.

During a search of Erazo-Zuniga's bedroom, detectives recovered a firearm believed to have been used in the December gunpoint incident, Graves said.

Erazo-Zuniga was booked into the Pinal County Jail, where jail records show he remains in custody on a $250,000 secured bond. He was later indicted by a Pinal County grand jury.

Court records obtained by the outlet show the grand jury charged Erazo-Zuniga with aggravated assault involving a firearm, two counts of forgery and two counts of misconduct involving weapons, including possession of handguns while prohibited. Prosecutors allege the aggravated assault charge qualifies as a dangerous felony because it involved the use or threatened exhibition of a firearm.

DPS has also stated that Erazo-Zuniga is charged with assisting a criminal street gang and terrorism, though those allegations were outlined by the agency rather than detailed in the indictment documents released by the Pinal County Superior Court. Authorities have said additional charges could be forthcoming, potentially at the federal level.

According to a minute entry filed in superior court, Erazo-Zuniga is scheduled to be arraigned Friday.

Graves said investigators believe there may be multiple additional victims, but that some have been afraid to come forward.

""We encourage them to contact our tip line,"" Graves said. DPS asked anyone with information related to the case to call 602-644-5805.

Authorities have not confirmed whether the investigation could expand beyond Maricopa.

The case comes amid heightened national law enforcement scrutiny of Venezuelan criminal groups following a series of high-profile investigations in Colorado in 2024 and 2025.

Federal prosecutors there indicted Venezuelan nationals accused of participating in organized robberies, kidnappings, extortion schemes and firearms offenses tied to the transnational gang Tren de Aragua. While some early claims of gang ""takeovers"" were later disputed or clarified, authorities have confirmed multiple violent cases involving coordinated criminal activity and armed suspects.

Chef Coombs talks about delicious and easy-to-make soups for guests on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

Amid pricey groceries and packed schedules, many Americans are gravitating toward simple, affordable meals rooted in tradition, connection and comfort.

From pot roasts to casseroles, ""grandma-style cooking"" is quietly taking over kitchens across the country. Dubbed ""nonna-stalgia"" online, the trend reflects a growing appetite for meals that warm the heart and home, especially in the cold winter months.

Experts told Fox News Digital the shift is a response to years of fussy food culture and constant trend-chasing.

CHICKEN SOUP OR TOMATO SOUP? DIETITIANS SAY ONE IS THE HEALTHIER CHOICE

""When the things around us feel overwhelming, we crave comfort and reach for the things that feel familiar and simpler,"" said Emmy Clinton, a Colorado-based recipe creator and founder of Entirely Emmy. 

""Grandma-style cooking represents comfort and memories that can make us feel safe and life feel a lot less complicated.""

Americans are returning to ""grandma-style cooking"" this winter, according to many. (iStock)

Her favorite is a pot roast. ""You can find hundreds of pot roast recipes online, but they all have the same grandma logic: time, simple ingredients and ‘let it cook.'""

Others say the fading tradition of daily family dinners is helping fuel the trend. 

Dorina Lantella, an Italian American entrepreneur born in Washington, D.C., and CEO of Dorina's Kitchen, has built her career around restoring shared tables and traditional cooking. She was inspired by the ""Roseto Effect,"" a phenomenon linked to Roseto, Pennsylvania.

THIS BUDGET-FRIENDLY VEGETABLE IS BECOMING ONE OF 2026'S BIGGEST FOOD TRENDS

""People are yearning for traditional family meals and shared table experiences because we are starving for connection,"" said Lantella, whose go-tos are lasagna and a simple pot of soup.

Many agree the pull is emotional. California chef Jessica Randhawa, founder of the food blog ""The Forked Spoon,"" said returning to family recipes helped her cope with the loss of her parents.

""For me, grandma-style cooking has been both a healing process after losing both my parents in the last four years, and a way to pass on family traditions, flavors and food smells to my son,"" Randhawa said.

That yearning shows up clearly in the recipes resonating most right now. 

Here are five grandma-style dishes to consider this winter.

Today's home cooks are embracing the same mindset that shaped family meals in the 1960s, said Lanie Smith, the Kansas-based creator of TheVintageCook.com.

""Families wanted real meals, but they also wanted time together,"" she said. ""They did not want to invest in 15 ingredients for a single dish or spend two hours in the kitchen after getting home from a long day at work.""

Smith's recipe for chicken and dumplings calls for just a few ingredients: rotisserie chicken, Bisquick mix, milk and chicken bouillon powder. 

""It's a hearty meal in 30 minutes,"" she said.

The dish comes together by simmering rotisserie chicken in a thickened chicken broth, then dropping spoonfuls of Bisquick-and-milk dough on top and letting them steam into fluffy, biscuit-like dumplings.

Smith also recommends a fun take on two American classics — hot dogs and chili — that come together as an easy, inexpensive and comforting meal.

""There is a return to cooking that respects people's time and budgets,"" she said.

Her six-ingredient hot dog chili includes inexpensive, higher-fat ground beef to create a sauce specifically for topping hot dogs. ""People love it because it feels like the food they grew up with,"" Smith added.

Some recipes shouldn't be reinvented, Randhawa said, such as her dad's cream of mushroom pork chops.

The dish is made with pan-seared pork chops simmered in canned cream of mushroom soup and milk, just as he cooked it when he was feeding his kids on a tight budget.

""It is pure, nourishing, easy and accessible comfort food,"" Randhawa said.

She insists on using Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup. 

""Using a homemade cream of mushroom soup simply will not do.""

Also known as snert, split pea soup is a traditional Dutch dish that Randhawa's mother grew up eating in a small Iowa community. 

After her mother died, the wholesome soup began appearing more often in Randhawa's kitchen as part of her grieving process, she said.

Made with a leftover ham bone, vegetables and split peas, the recipe reflects the kind of practical, nourishing cooking that stretches ingredients, improves with time and is rooted in family tradition.

Randhawa's Grandma's Spaghetti Sauce with Meat is a no-frills, extra-meaty sauce passed down from her grandmother to her father and now to her.

It is made by browning ground beef and Italian sausage, then simmering it with canned tomato sauce, tomato paste, onions and basic seasonings.

""It makes me happy to know that, even though my son never met his great-grandma, he loves her recipe,"" Randhawa said.

Joel Klatt and Colin Cowherd discuss the importance of Indiana winning the National Championship, and whether or not Miami can rebound following their loss. 

The result of the College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday marked a historic night for the sport, but no one expected it to be the Indiana Hoosiers making it happen. 

The Hoosiers became the first-ever 16-0 college football team, as Curt Cignetti's squad defeated the Miami Hurricanes, 27-21, at Hard Rock Stadium. When Jamari Sharpe read Carson Beck's deep pass with 44 seconds left on the clock and picked it off, that kneel down to the ground cemented one of the great stories in college sports. 

But despite how great this season has been for the Hoosiers, some question whether this is sustainable. Can Indiana continue its dominance like it did in 2025, securing the No. 1 overall seed in the CFP and winning a national title?

One of its players has no doubt. 

""I was just talking to one of the guys, and I was just saying, ‘I wouldn't be surprised if Indiana makes it back next year,'"" Hoosiers cornerback D'Angelo Ponds told Fox News Digital before his celebratory ""shift"" alongside Sharpe and receiver Elijah Sarrat at Raising Cane's in Bloomington on Thursday. 

Ponds told reporters his plan is to enter the 2026 NFL Draft, ending his college career on the highest note possible as a national champion, but the main reason behind his thought about a potential college dynasty falls on his belief in his head coach. 

INDIANA'S D'ANGELO PONDS REACTS TO MIAMI'S MARK FLETCHER JR THROWING PUNCH AFTER CHAMPIONSHIP LOSS: ‘SHOCKED'

Ponds was with Cignetti during his freshman year at James Madison University, and when ""Coach Cig"" made the move to the Hoosiers' program, the 5-foot-9, 173-pound cornerback went to Bloomington with him.

Cignetti went viral during his introductory press conference at Indiana for his answer after a reporter said what his pitch would be to recruit players to a program that had gone a combined 9-27 over its last three seasons before his arrival. 

Cignetti, coming off a 19-4 career at JMU, including an 11-1 campaign in 2023, was blunt with his response. 

""It's pretty simple. I win. Google me,"" he said.

The proof is in the hardware now.

""I felt like nobody expected us to do this, especially us coming from JMU,"" Ponds added. ""But I trusted in Coach Cig and his process, and knew that we were going to be successful. Him just believing in himself and the guys he brought with him, we brought the standard to Indiana and made history.""

Sharpe was already at Indiana when Cignetti took over, and he learned quickly what his new coach was all about. After a 3-9 season in 2023, Cignetti led the Hoosiers to the CFP with an 11-2 record, followed by a perfect season this year. 

""This year has taught me a lot — brotherhood,"" he said. ""It was a long year, and sticking together with my teammates to be able to go 16-0 and be able to win the national championship. It was a good season for us, and I'm just glad we were able to get it done.""

So why can Indiana do it again in 2026 and beyond? 

""Just from Coach Cig and his process — he's a process-oriented guy. He doesn't dwell on the past. He's going to get right back to work and I wouldn't be surprised we go back to back,"" Ponds responded.

Police in Indiana announced the arrest of five suspects in the shooting of an Indiana judge and his wife at their home earlier this week. 

The Lafayette Police Department said Raylen Ferguson, 38, and Zenada Greer, 61, both of Lexington, Ky., and Thomas Moss, 43, Blake Smith, 32, and Amanda Milsap, 45, all from Lafayette, Ind., were taken into custody following the Jan. 18 attack on Tippecanoe County Judge Steven Meyer and his wife Kimberly. Steven Meyer sustained an arm injury, while Kimberly Meyer had a hip injury. Both are now in stable condition, police said. 

Ferguson, Moss and Smith were arrested on charges including attempted murder, aggravated battery and intimidation with a deadly weapon, with gang and firearm enhancements. Police also listed Moss and Smith as ""habitual offenders."" 

Milsap was arrested on bribery and obstruction of justice charges, while Greer was charged with assisting a criminal and obstruction of justice.

""These arrests are the result of a comprehensive, collaborative effort among multiple agencies,"" the Lafayette Police Department said. 

Sunday's incident marked the first recorded act of violence against the judge, according to the Lafayette Police Department. Officials had no records of previous threats against Meyer or 911 calls from the judge's Mill Pond Lane address, a department spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital.

Dispatch audio obtained by Fox News Digital showed that the unidentified shooter allegedly knocked on the door of Meyer's home around 2:15 p.m. Sunday, then fired gunshots through the door. Before firing the gun, the suspect said, ""We have your dog,"" according to the audio. 

""I am so grateful for the outpouring of support from friends, the community, court colleagues, and law enforcement,"" Judge Meyer said in a statement Wednesday in his first public comments since the shooting. ""I want to express my heartfelt thanks to my medical team. I am receiving excellent care and I am improving. Kim is also deeply appreciative for the community support, and she too is healing.""

EXCLUSIVE — Vice President JD Vance told the Washington Examiner that the public hostility exhibited by European leaders regarding President Donald Trump's demands for Greenland is simply “posturing,” and that they've expressed more “reasonable” responses to the president's plan in closed-door discussions.

The vice president sat with the Washington Examiner for a half-hour interview while flying from Toledo, Ohio, to Minneapolis on Thursday morning. While speaking in Toledo, Vance largely reiterated the administration's points that acquiring Greenland would boost American national security interests and its critical minerals supply chain.

The Washington Examiner asked the vice president, whom Trump has tapped alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio to continue negotiations with Europe on a “framework” for a new Greenland deal following the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, how he and Rubio are game-planning the negotiations, given Europe's open hostility to Trump's demands.

“They've been incredibly hostile in public, and a lot of this is posturing, right? If you're a European leader, they have to seem like a tough guy against Donald J. Trump,” Vance responded. “So a lot of this, what we've seen, is more symbolic posturing for the Europeans. Behind the scenes, they're much more reasonable.”

The vice president added that, during private negotiations carried out by himself, Rubio, and other senior administration officials, European leaders readily “admit” that Greenland “is important to our shared NATO security alliance” and that both Russia and China have signaled designs to move on the island “over the next three to 15 years.”

VANCE: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL DISCIPLINE ICE AGENTS WHEN ‘JUSTIFIED'

“They've also acknowledged that, God forbid, something significant happened in Greenland, the United States would have to play the leading role in defending it,” he continued. “So there's a broad recognition that much of what we said about Greenland is actually true, and it's interesting to juxtapose the public posturing with the very reasonable private negotiations that we've had with the Europeans.”

“If Greenland were to fall into the hands of the Russians and the Chinese, something that even the Danes themselves have admitted could happen at least over the medium and long term, it would make our security weaker,” Vance suggested. “It would give them power projection abilities. It would make our missile defense weaker, and so these things all counsel in favor of us shoring up that area, making sure it's properly secure.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump has revoked his invitation to Canada to join the Board of Peace that was established at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland.

Trump made the surprise announcement in a brief “letter” posted on Truth Social late Thursday.

“Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,” he wrote to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

The president did not elaborate on what influenced his decision to revoke the offer, but it likely stemmed from Carney's defiant speech at the Davos summit earlier in the day.

“Canada and the United States have built a remarkable partnership in the economy, in security, and in rich cultural exchange,” Carney said while speaking from Quebec City. “But Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.”

The prime minister's statement came in response to Trump's words from the day before.

“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us. By the way, they should be grateful also, but they're not,” Trump said. “I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful — they should be grateful to us, Canada. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”

Adding further fuel to the strained tensions between the United States and Canada is Trump's rhetoric about acquiring Greenland, either forcibly or diplomatically. The Danish territory was a major topic of conversation between Trump and European leaders. Trump promised more details about a possible deal involving Greenland in the next two weeks.

Trump has also suggested that Canada become the 51st state of the U.S., a prospect that irks Carney.

Besides Canada, Trump has been critical of the NATO alliance. Despite finding some common ground on Greenland, Trump argued NATO should have perhaps sent its forces to protect the southern border from illegal immigrants.

“Maybe we should have put NATO to the test,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Invoked Article 5, and forced NATO to come here and protect our Southern Border from further Invasions of Illegal Immigrants, thus freeing up large numbers of Border Patrol Agents for other tasks.”

Canada was one of many nations that received Trump's invitation to join his Board of Peace. Carney previously said he agreed with the invitation in principle, but he remained hesitant to accept due to the mandatory $1 billion fee to become a permanent member.

TRUMP SINGLES OUT ‘UNGRATEFUL' MARK CARNEY DURING DAVOS SPEECH

Trump formally unveiled the Board of Peace at a Thursday morning signing ceremony in Davos. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Argentine President Javier Milei were among the 19 world leaders present for the signing of the board's founding charter. Carney departed before the event.

With Trump as its chairman, the Board of Peace is primarily designed to oversee the transition of power in post-war Gaza from Hamas to a Palestinian technocratic committee. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted Trump's offer to join the board, but he was notably absent from the signing ceremony. No Israeli representatives were present either.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Five people are being treated for gunshot wounds after a fight broke out on a Washington, D.C., bus Thursday evening. 

Interim Chief of Police Jeffery Carroll said two kids and three adults received non-life-threatening injuries during the incident in Northwest Washington, D.C. They were engaged in an argument on the bus when a driver kicked them off, and the situation escalated into a gun fight, he said during a news conference. The suspect remains at large. 

“This is not the way we resolve disputes. If there's any sort of conflict, obviously, we work things out. We don't pull out gunfire, and that's the issue we have — too many illegal firearms here in the community,” Carroll said.

The development comes as the Trump administration has sought to target the district's crime, which reached record highs in recent years. As part of the mission to support law enforcement, the White House has reportedly extended the deployment of about 2,500 National Guard members in the district through the end of this year. 

The crime on Thursday evening started on the bus, but escalated when it stopped and the passengers disembarked onto the sidewalk. As they fought on the sidewalk, a man pulled out a gun and fired several rounds, hitting five people. 

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TAKES CREDIT FOR LARGEST EVER DROP IN MURDER RATE

No one had been arrested as of Thursday evening. Investigators have not released a description of the shooter. The Washington Examiner reached out to Washington police for further details. 

The shooting occurred near Military Road and 16th Street, NW, a typically safe area near Rock Creek Park. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The surprising truth about corporate investment in housing.

Wall Street is “gobbling up” America's homes. Firms with names like BlackRock (or Blackstone or SablePebble) are shouldering their way into every suburban open house and offering 50 percent above asking price — in a bid to consolidate control of local markets and then jack up rents with impunity. As a result, America's young families have been locked out of homeownership, while its renters have been price-gouged into poverty. If we want to make housing affordable again, we must ban Big Finance from buying single-family homes.

This is one of the most influential accounts of America's housing crisis.

The narrative has spread virally for years on social media. More nuanced versions of the tale have appeared in major publications and congressional press releases. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump pledged to “ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes,” then signed an executive order Tuesday that heavily restricts such purchases. And progressive Democrats in the Senate are cheering him on.

Unfortunately, the story spurring these policies is largely false. Corporate investment in single-family homes is not a major driver of Americans' high housing costs. To the contrary, that investment has likely made housing in the United States more affordable. The “BlackRock ate our homes” narrative owes its popularity to its ideological convenience, not empirical validity.

Housing is unquestionably too expensive in the United States.

In 2024, the median price of a single family home hit a record $412,500 — five times the median US income. Back in the 1990s, such a property cost only about three times as much as the typical family earned.

Meanwhile, roughly one-third of Americans — and one half of renters — spend more than 30 percent of their earnings on housing. And this cost crunch is especially severe in vibrant coastal cities, where economic opportunity is concentrated.

Given these facts, if we want to explain America's housing crisis, we need to identify forces that have:

Wall Street investment in single-family homes meets neither of these criteria.

At the national level, such investment is miniscule. As of 2022, institutional investors owned 0.55 percent of single-family homes in the United States, and only 3 percent of single-family rentals. That year, the largest of these investors, Invitation Homes, held just 0.6 percent of America's rental houses.

We lack comprehensive data for more recent years. But we know the picture has not radically changed. The property intelligence company Cotality tracks all home purchases by investor size. And mega-investors have never accounted for as much as 4 percent of annual home sales (and that is including sales of multifamily homes, which large investors are more likely to own).

What's more, these sales have been concentrated in relatively affordable cities.

Institutional investors own a negligible share of single-family homes in New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where housing costs are exceptionally high. Meanwhile, they hold 27 percent of all single-family rental properties in Atlanta, 20 percent in Charlotte, and 22 percent in Jacksonville — all cities where rent-to-income ratios are close to the national average.

Thus, even if we stipulated that Wall Street investment reduces affordability, there simply wouldn't be enough of it — either at the national level or in America's highest-cost cities — for it to explain more than a tiny fraction of our housing problem.

A supporter of Trump's ban might reply: So what?

Perhaps institutional investors aren't the primary cause of high costs nationwide. But they are buying a lot of houses in some cities. And that surely nudges prices up in those places. So why not stop Wall Street from doing that? Why let Big Finance increase ordinary Americans' cost of living even a little?

These are reasonable questions. And there is indeed evidence that institutional investment in single-family homes has marginally increased home prices in some markets.

Nonetheless, such investment has likely done more to reduce rents than to increase prices — and thus, been net-positive for affordability.

All else equal, the more rental homes on the market, the lower rents will be. In theory, institutional investment in single-family homes should expand the rental stock through (at least) three mechanisms.

First, this investment often finances the construction of new houses. In the third quarter of 2025, the real estate trust American Homes 4 Rent acquired 92 percent of its new properties from its own in-house builder. America's largest landlord, Invitation Homes, has embraced similar practices: Of the 526 single-family homes it purchased last summer, 81 percent were new units that had been built to rent.

This investment expands the total stock of homes in the United States, increasing options for renters without reducing options for homebuyers by a commensurate amount. (To its credit, the Trump administration has exempted build-to-rent properties from its ban.)

Second, large landlords can increase the rental sector's productivity through economies of scale. Unlike a small-time landlord, a company that owns 1,000 houses in Atlanta can afford to employ full-time maintenance teams. As a result, when a resident moves out of one of their properties, they will be able to rapidly refurbish that unit and lease it out again — minimizing the amount of time their home lies vacant.

Through these sorts of efficiencies, institutional investors achieve lower operating costs than small landlords. And the less it costs a landlord to provide a single unit of housing, the more units they can profitably produce at any given level of rent. For this reason, large investors can expand rental supply more quickly in response to surges in demand.

Finally, and most controversially, institutional investors redistribute homes from the for-sale market to the rental market. Although Wall Street has shifted towards buying newly built homes in recent years, it does still compete with ordinary homebuyers for some existing houses. And that competition can nudge up prices.

But Big Finance isn't buying these homes because it needs places to store its gold. It's buying them to lease out. Every time Invitation Homes takes a house off the sales market, it adds one to America's rental inventory.

Ideally, we would make housing more affordable for both renters and prospective homebuyers. But Americans who can't qualify for a mortgage tend to be more cost-burdened and economically vulnerable than those who can. For this reason, if we want to minimize the number of Americans who cannot afford decent housing, reducing rents is more urgent than cutting prices.

And empirical research confirms that institutional investment lowers prices in practice, not just in theory. According to a 2025 paper from economists at Dartmouth College and the Department of Justice, rents in Atlanta would be 2.4 percent higher today, in the absence of Wall Street investment in its single-family housing stock.

A separate study from Baruch College's Joshua Coven reports similar findings. He estimates that, for every one percentage point increase in institutional investors' share of an area's single-family rental market, rents fall by 0.7 percent.

Notably, Coven's study accounts for the concern that large landlords may drive up rents by cornering rental markets. His paper suggests that concentrated ownership does lift rents at the margin. But this effect is swamped by institutional investment's positive impact on supply.

And this finding is intuitive. Even in cities like Atlanta — where institutional investment is exceptionally high — no single investor owns more than 5 percent of all single-family rentals. And it is difficult for any business to dictate prices when its rivals own 95 percent of the market.

In any case, Coven's study suggests that — at the national level — institutional investment in houses has reduced rents by a bit more than it has increased home prices. And this is likely to be even more true in the future: In the time period examined by Coven, Wall Street had yet to shift its focus away from buying up existing homes and toward financing new ones.

From a progressive standpoint, institutional investment in single-family homes has an additional benefit: It reduces racial and socioeconomic segregation.

Much of America's working-class lacks the credit necessary to qualify for a mortgage. They therefore cannot live in an area unless it hosts a lot of rental housing. Historically, most affluent suburbs have not fit the bill.

Only single-family housing is allowed on most of America's suburban land. And although large investors have always bought and rented out apartment buildings, they traditionally did not traffic in single-family homes.

Wall Street's entrance into the latter market has therefore opened up many previously class-segregated communities to less well-off Americans. A recent study from Federal Reserve economist Konhee Chang found that institutional investment in Southern suburbs reduced segregation by enabling lower-income, disproportionately nonwhite renters to move into neighborhoods where they couldn't afford to buy.

Likewise, Coven's paper shows that people who rent institutionally owned, single-family homes usually moved there from a poorer neighborhood with worse schools. And that can make a big difference in working-class kids' lives. According to research from Harvard University's Raj Chetty, children who move from impoverished areas to affluent ones are more likely to attend college and earn middle-class incomes as adults.

Of course, not everyone wants more integration. In Chang's study, when institutional landlords made an area more accessible to disproportionately nonwhite, working-class renters, homeowners nearby became more likely to move out, evidently “perceiving renters as a disamenity.”

It's hard not to suspect that this is, in part, what the backlash to Wall Street investment in single-family homes is really about. After all, there's relatively little complaint (outside socialist circles) about large investors buying and renting out apartments. It was only when they began purchasing houses — and thus, undermining the ability of affluent localities to keep out the hoi polloi through single-family zoning — that concern about Wall Street ownership of housing went mainstream.

In truth, housing in the US is expensive because it is scarce. And it is scarce because zoning restrictions outlaw apartment buildings on most residential land, red tape needlessly inflates the cost of housing production, and the government doesn't do enough to channel capital toward the real estate sector, either through subsidies or direct public investment.

Combine these shortage-inducing policies with income inequality, and you end up with homelessness, displacement, and lackluster wage growth.

We can escape this fate. But doing so will require Americans to accept some trade-offs. For housing to become abundant, many middle-class homeowners will need to tolerate more construction noise, traffic, and competition for parking in their neighborhoods. Taxpayers will need to swallow greater public investment in housing construction. Green groups will need to stomach restrictions on environmental review.

And of course, any successful effort to constrain housing prices will, by definition, make most American families' chief financial asset — their homes — less valuable than they otherwise would be.

Given the inconvenience of these truths, it's not surprising that politicians have gravitated toward myths. If you blame the housing crisis on a few conniving corporations, then you don't need to ask your constituents to contribute anything to its resolution. And taking this tack may also endear you to your party's populist activists, many of whom are spoiling for a fight with Big Finance.

The downside is just that your demagogy is liable to make housing even more expensive. Before backing Trump's ban, officials should ask themselves whether that is a price they're willing to pay.

The agency's meme-laced hiring campaign, explained.

In the last year, ICE has doubled in size, which is all part of President Donald Trump's agenda to turbocharge the government's mass deportation efforts.

But the agency's massive push for new agents has led to reportedly poor vetting of applicants and a lowering of the agency's standards. Washington Post reporter Drew Harwell recently got his hands on an internal ICE document outlining the agency's recruitment plans for 2026. The agency wants to find 14,000 new ICE employees — on top of the more than 20,000 officers and agents it currently has — by appealing to fans of NASCAR, UFC, and patriotic podcasts. They're calling it their “wartime recruitment” strategy, and Harwell says the meme-fied and macho tenor of ICE's online advertisements tell us a lot about who the agency is trying to bring into its fold.

Harwell spoke with Today, Explained host Noel King about ICE's recruitment efforts and what they say about the present and future makeup of the agency.

There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What's this internal ICE document and what's in it? 

This is an internal confidential document that ICE officers spread to each other that outlines what they call their “surge hiring recruiting strategy.” It lays out $100 million in recruiting spending that they want to pour into social media advertising and real-world advertising.

They want to reach pro-ICE influencers who can get the message out. They want to go to gun fairs, gun shows, hunting shows to reach people — to reach more than 10,000 potential deportation officers, lawyers, and other staffers that can help them carry out this giant deportation that the Trump administration has been promising.

They've never done anything like this. If you've gone on X or YouTube or Instagram, they have these really patriotic machismo ads that say the “enemies are at the gates,” [that] you need to join ICE to “defend the homeland” and repel these “foreign invaders.”

There's also these ads that they feel like will appeal to their sense of honor and patriotism and their aggression. A lot of these ads are in the model of video games and action movies, and there are these buff guys with guns who are shutting down the border. So they're really [giving] this cinematic, patriotic sheen to it all, when really these are government law enforcement jobs. They've never been framed in this way.

All right, so they're blanketing the internet. Then there's also real life. If I were to come upon one of these ads in real life, where would I be likely to be? Where would I be hanging out if I saw one of these things?

They've done “geofencing,” where they'll actually look at a specific event like a UFC fight or a gun show or a rodeo or a NASCAR race, some event where they feel like their target market is going to be, and they'll draw a circle around where that real-world event is. And then if you step foot inside that real-world circle, you're going to get a targeted ICE advertisement telling you to join the agency.

Do they talk openly in this document about the kind of person that they want for ICE?

The big thing they keep going back to is to “patriots.” They keep saying that the people they want are real hardcore border protectors who want to, in their words, “protect the American way of life.” On a lot of these posters, you will see the action movies and the video games. But there's also a line of marketing in their campaign that uses these very classic nostalgic Americana posters that almost look like wartime propaganda posters, where it's like old-timey white people on the frontier defending the homeland. Uncle Sam features very heavily in a lot of these.

There's also ones that use this cowboy imagery to make it like you are on the frontier, fighting these outlaws. One of them says, “Are you going to cowboy up or just lay there and bleed?” and it just speaks to this idea [that] your country is being taken from you by — as all these ads show — brown people, and you have to partner up with your fellow ICE agents to take these people out. And so they're really kind of appealing to this idea of frustration at a changing America and wanting to pull in people who want to fight that.

You reached out to DHS for comment. What was the response?

We've talked to a number of people who are currently inside ICE and DHS who are, to be honest, pretty unnerved and disturbed by how the agency has changed. And so we got a lot of reporting and a lot of documentation out of the agency, and we went to DHS and ICE and told them what we had. They wouldn't confirm or deny the document, which is pretty classic for them. They wouldn't dispute any of the claims we had pulled out from it.

But what they said was, we're thrilled that the Post is highlighting how successful this campaign has been. Their argument has been that this strategy is working. Their goal in the document was to hire 14,000 new people. And so their argument is, this model is working. We're ahead of schedule, we're under budget. We're getting hundreds of thousands of job applications in. We've put out 18,000 job offers.

So the patriotism and the machismo and some of the stuff that they've been criticised on, they're very proud of that. They feel like this is an ad campaign that they feel like Americans will support, that they have a mandate from the voters to lead this massive deportation operation. And so yeah, they feel like what they're doing is right, and they're proud to do it, and they're getting all the right people in.

You said that you also spoke to people inside of ICE who are kind of disturbed by this recruiting effort. What did they tell you? What's their complaint exactly?

ICE is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which was started after 9/11. It has always been a “Let's protect Americans” agency. Immigration is a component of DHS, but so is protection from a lot of other stuff, right? Cyber attacks, natural disasters. So it's always been a law enforcement triage operation. And under the Trump administration, it has been made into all immigration, all the time. So they're frustrated by that, but they're also kind of unnerved by this campaign and how bold it is.

With this kind of campaign, they feel like they're going on the internet and basically just saying, “Hey, if you want to pick up a gun and start shoving people around, you want to join us.” And their worry is that this appeal to aggression is going to be getting aggressive people who aren't trained, who have this idea in their head that they can start being this warrior on the street, when they realize that the reality on the ground should be a lot more nuanced and a lot more careful, because these are real people. These are real people's lives. This isn't just a meme.

How is the public responding to being hit with these in the wild and on the internet?

So you'll see on social media, a lot of people who are already kind of pro-Trump, pro-ICE, are celebrating them as like, “Yeah, let's really get out there and do this thing.” But you also see a ton of criticism and backlash, like [on] Spotify, where if you'll be listening to music on the free service, you'll get a commercial that'll pop up that'll say, “Join ICE.” And you can actually see on the Spotify message boards where people are outraged. They're saying, “I'm going to cancel my subscription. I don't want to hear this. I don't want to be thinking about this.”

You've also seen some of this because of this campaign being so targeted. Part of it is they're also targeting people to self-deport. So they're targeting genres of music they feel like will be listened to by people who may not be in the country legally. And so people will be listening to Latin music and they'll be getting a commercial in Spanish telling them to leave the country, and they just feel very disturbed by that. These commercials are basically finding their ways into a lot of people's daily lives, and they are angry at the reminder of what's happening around the country. And so they're lashing out and they're saying, any company that's taking money for this kind of ad campaign, we don't want to support it.

What did you learn about the imagery that ICE is using in these ads? What is it telegraphing? What is it trying to say?

On X especially, you'll see a lot of these very edgelord memes. These are like 4chan-style kind of dark jokes about “join ICE.” One of them says “deport illegals with your absolute boys.” And it shows a minivan. And it's just this joke about “join ICE and you can crack some skulls with your friends.”

And they're really flattening this conversation around immigration into this video game battle, right? I mean, one of the posters is from the video game Halo and it says, “destroy the flood.” And in it, basically, they're saying, if you join ICE, you become this super soldier protecting Earth from this flood of aliens, literally. And they're also making a joke of it.

I think this is the other thing. DHS has been putting out a lot of deportation memes, so has the White House. They're very common on X. You'll see them everywhere, and some people get a little laugh out of it, but it's also pretty disturbing because they'll end up using images of real people who are being deported out of the country, who may not have a criminal record, but are being called the worst of the worst. And so you see just the level of bile in the discussion around these people, and it just flattens this really nuanced policy issue into, again, this kind of good-versus-evil battle that they're framing like an action movie or a funny online joke, but is really so much more complicated.

This undersung service saves Americans $3.1 billion every year. Why aren't we funding them more?

Accidentally poisoning yourself is much easier than you might think.

Once, I took two antihistamine medications on the same night and panicked when Google told me that there might be an interaction between them. So, I called the toll-free Poison Help Line — 1-800-222-1222, listed on many household chemical bottles — and they told me that I was fine, saving me from an unnecessary emergency room visit and needless stress.

Beyond reassurance, the US Poison Center Network — a constellation of 53 regional centers serving every state and territory — offers lifesaving first aid guidance and useful data surveillance. Staffed by medical professionals trained in toxicology, many centers now also offer text and live chat services in multiple languages in addition to the traditional 24/7 helpline. From your grandma unwittingly eating your marijuana-laced brownie to your child swallowing an unknown pill, poison control is there to walk you through what to do next. Many accidental poison exposures are able to be safely managed at home with expert assistance.

In the past 30 days alone, there have been 201,545 reported poisonings in the US, according to the National Poison Data System.

With so many poisonings happening all of the time, the Poison Center Network is incredibly valuable. In fact, it saves about $3.1 billion every year in health care and productivity costs, according to a new report from RAND, a nonprofit policy think tank. It found that, for every dollar invested, American communities get $16.77 in benefits from lower emergency department use, less time spent in the hospital, better health outcomes, and lower risk of death.

Poison centers are an undersung public health win — a model that has worked, and evolved, over the past 70 years, even as Google and AI become many people's first go-to for information, even in a crisis.

However, recent budget cuts threaten poison centers' ability to carry out their lifesaving mission, and federal and state funding has not been adjusted for inflation in over a decade.

Poison control centers depend significantly on federal funding sources like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which have faced significant cuts in recent years. The average operating costs for a poison center ranges from $1.2 million to $7.2 million, excluding subsidized support. All together, federal funding for poison centers saves $450 million in health care costs alone annually, making them a pretty clearly good investment on the math alone — not to mention the lives and suffering saved.

The network also contributes an incredible wealth of health and safety information. Its crown jewel, its data system, is the only near-real time public health surveillance system of its kind in the US, with data uploaded every 4.97 minutes. It's helpful for that data to be as up-to-date as possible, because one poison exposure is reported to a center every 15 seconds.

And their mission has expanded. Poison centers have taken on a greater role in emergency preparedness and response, and many provide additional functions like operating a rabies and Covid-19 hotline, conducting research, and providing telehealth delivery. These “ancillary functions” can generate revenue for the centers providing them through government or industry contracts, helping them to cover operational costs, but they require the centers to offer additional services on top of their core toxicology work. Even with the current coverage, more than 100,000 people in the US died from preventable poisonings in 2023.

Since 2000, poison centers have averaged more than 3.3 million encounters each year. While total touchpoints have declined since the 2010s, probably because of new online information sources, the average severity of cases has increased. The report found that 30 percent of human exposure cases came from a health care facility or provider contacting poison control, suggesting that poison centers are spending more time and resources on the cases that come to them.

It can be hard to access health care services, and people need accurate and actionable information in a crisis. And with potentially unreliable and unvetted information online, poison centers, staffed by trained professionals, are a lifeline.

Amazon is planning to eliminate thousands of corporate employees, with cuts expected to begin as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the matter.

The reductions would mark the company's second wave of mass layoffs since October, when Amazon cut about 14,000 jobs. Two of the people said the company is expected to eliminate a similar number of roles in the coming round, bringing total job cuts to almost 30,000.

The latest cuts underscore Amazon's continued efforts to streamline operations and reset its culture.

Amazon first attributed the October job cuts to changes brought on by AI. But CEO Andy Jassy later said the layoffs were instead tied to cultural fit, not cost savings or AI.

Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce makes up a relatively small share, at about 350,000.

An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Reuters earlier reported this latest round of cuts could come as early as next week.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The TikTok deal is done. Here's what will change and what will stay the same.","https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-deal-finalized-what-changes-ownership-2026-1","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:02:00 GMT","

TikTok's US workers can finally breathe a sigh of relief.

The company announced Thursday that it has closed a deal to spin off parts of its US business in a new joint venture with an investor group.

""The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8, and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the US,"" the company said.

Adam Presser is leading the new venture, according to the company's announcement. Presser has worked at TikTok for nearly four years, most recently leading operations and trust and safety. The venture's seven-man, majority-American board includes TikTok's CEO Shou Chew.

The agreement should keep the US government off its back as TikTok's parent, ByteDance, now owns just under 20% of the new US venture. That ownership stake meets a divestment requirement set by a 2024 US sell-or-ban law targeting TikTok and other apps with owners based in countries like China, which the US has deemed a foreign adversary.

TikTok's new US owners include tech company Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, each of which owns 15% of the new venture. ByteDance will own around 20% of the entity, and affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will own around 30%, according to a December memo from Chew. Other investors include Michael Dell's family office and a venture run by the partners of growth investor Dragoneer.

What comes next is less clear.

While Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake will serve as managing investors in the new US joint venture, their focus will be on areas such as data security. Key commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will remain with ByteDance.

The company began splitting up its US staff into different legal entities in January based on whether their work would remain under ByteDance's purview, Business Insider first reported.

Following the announcement, President Donald Trump said in a Thursday night Truth Social post that he was ""so happy to have helped in saving TikTok.""

He said the deal had reached a ""very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.""

The deal has been in the works for a year.  At the start of Trump's presidency, TikTok went dark for its 170 million US users, but came back online soon after when Trump promised to delay a ban.

Since then, he has been pushing back the divest-or-ban deadline, saying tech leaders like Elon Musk and Oracle's CTO, Larry Ellison, could buy the app. He also floated giving China a tariff reduction if it cut a deal on TikTok.

OpenAI has pulled in a billion-dollar month from something other than ChatGPT.

Sam Altman said in a post on X on Thursday that OpenAI added more than $1 billion in annual recurring revenue in the past month ""just from our API business.""

""People think of us mostly as ChatGPT, but the API team is doing amazing work!"" the OpenAI CEO wrote.

OpenAI's API enables other companies and developers to embed its models into their own products, from internal productivity software to coding tools.

Many of Silicon Valley's high-profile startups rely on OpenAI's models as core infrastructure. Perplexity uses OpenAI's models to power parts of its AI search and answer engine. Harvey, one of the fastest-growing legal tech startups, is built on OpenAI's models to assist lawyers with research and drafting.

Altman's comments underscore how OpenAI's infrastructure business is emerging as a key growth engine, even as the company faces massive costs for computing power and data centers.

Those pressures have pushed OpenAI to look beyond consumer subscriptions.

Last week, the company said it is gearing up to test ads inside ChatGPT as it faces about $1.4 trillion in spending commitments over the coming years.

It's a notable shift for a company that once treated ads as taboo. Less than two years ago, Altman said advertising was a ""last resort.""

""Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,"" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. ""I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.""

Since then, Altman has struck a more open tone. In June, he said on OpenAI's podcast that he wasn't ""totally against"" ads, though he stressed it would need to be approached carefully.

Earlier this week, OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, raised the idea of ""licensing models"" that would let the company share in downstream sales if a customer's product succeeds.

""Let's say in drug discovery, if we licensed our technology, you have a breakthrough. The drug takes off, and we get a licensed portion of all its sales,"" Friar said in an episode of ""The OpenAI Podcast"" published Monday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","With 'Personal Intelligence,' Google finally admits how much it knows about you. It's scary-good.","https://www.businessinsider.com/google-personal-intelligence-admits-how-much-knows-about-you-ai-2026-1","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:32:00 GMT","

Google rolled out a powerful new feature to AI Mode in Search this week. It's called Personal Intelligence, and it weaves together many of the company's existing services in a radical new way.

This was also launched recently in Gemini, Google's AI chatbot. Business Insider's Pranav Dixit tried it and was blown away. Here's his review:

Personal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook.

With my permission, Gemini can tap into my Google account — Gmail, Photos, Search history, YouTube, and more — and reason across all of it to answer questions the way a human assistant might, except this one has years of receipts on my life.

This is something I've wanted since AI-powered chatbots blew up in late 2022. Back then, I'd pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer. Then, the bot would immediately forget I existed, like a genius goldfish. Over the last few years, OpenAI and Anthropic have enabled their chatbots to connect to services like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. But Google has home field advantage: it already has the broadest view of what you've actually done, searched, watched, and saved.

Gemini's ability to connect the dots is scary-good, well beyond what ChatGPT or Claude can do. When I asked it for sightseeing ideas for my parents, who have already visited the Bay Area a few times, it suggested museums and gardens, correctly inferring they've already done hikes and trips to redwood forests.

When I asked Gemini how it knew, it told me it deduced this based on ""breadcrumbs"" left across my Google account: Family emails, photos of Muir Woods, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for ""easy hikes for seniors.""

This is so powerful that Google is already trying to preempt the freak-out. VP Josh Woodward said Google takes ""steps to filter or obfuscate personal data"" from the conversations we have with Gemini.

""We don't train our systems to learn your license plate number; we train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it,"" he wrote recently.

So, I asked it for my license plate number and it was able to locate it, based on photos of my car in Google Photos.

I also asked Gemini when my car insurance was up for renewal and it correctly told me, based on emails from AAA in my Gmail inbox.

When I asked it to help me plan an upcoming trip, it accounted for the fact that we're traveling with an infant — because it already knows we have a new baby. Of course it does.

This is the future every AI company keeps promising. Last year, Meta said its new north star wasn't ""the metaverse"" — that alternate VR universe the company is literally named after — but ""personal superintelligence,"" an AI that ""knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them.""

One path to that vision: AI-powered glasses that can see and hear what you see and hear, turning everyday life into the raw material for an always-on assistant. To get there, Meta has poured billions of dollars into a hiring spree and into the data centers needed to run it all.

But Meta doesn't have a digital record of my life like Google does. I barely post on Facebook. I mostly swipe through Instagram Reels. WhatsApp is encrypted. And after Meta killed Supernatural, my favorite VR workout app, I have very little reason to use its Quest headset anymore.

Meta talks about ""personal superintelligence"" as a future goal. As far as I'm concerned, Google just shipped it.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sreeja Apparaju, a 24-year-old machine learning engineer at Snap living in New York. Business Insider has verified Apparaju's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

When I decided to pivot from finance to tech in the fall of 2022, a couple of things were working against me.

I was less than a year from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with a double major in computer science and economics, and some large tech companies had announced major layoffs before the end of the year. That made me nervous about the demand for new hires.

I also didn't have any tech internships to fall back on. The prior summer, I'd interned as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, but I realized that finance didn't feel like the right path; I was more excited about the kind of work happening in tech.

It felt like unfortunate timing to be searching for tech roles — but at least I didn't have to job hunt alone.

Given these challenges, I was fortunate to have the support of a close circle of four friends who were applying to many of the same software engineering roles. When one of us heard from a recruiter or HR professional, we'd share their contact information with the group.

That's how I connected with a Palantir recruiter. Within a week of applying, I received an online assessment and was scheduled for an interview. I didn't end up getting the job, but I'm confident that getting on the recruiter's radar helped boost my chances.

In job searching, there can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of others. In my experience, though, sharing what we knew and helping each other out made the process easier — and faster — for all five of us.

Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was the motivation I needed to keep pushing for a job offer. One landed a role at Amazon, and another joined Salesforce. However, by the end of 2022, I was still looking.

In early January 2023, I came across an opening at Snap Inc. — the company behind Snapchat — for a software engineering role. Snap had already been on my radar as a company I thought could be a good fit. The cousin of one of my friends in my job search circle worked there, and I immediately reached out to them, obtained their referral, and submitted my application within a couple of days of the role being posted.

However, February came around, and I still hadn't heard back from Snap. I decided to take action; I got on LinkedIn and searched for a recruiter at the company who specialized in hiring new graduates.

My goal was to reach out via email rather than a LinkedIn message. Since I didn't have a LinkedIn Premium account, I was limited in the number of characters I could use — and I worried that sending a short message would come across as superficial.

I eventually found someone who appeared to be the recruiter, but their email wasn't listed anywhere. However, I did have the email of my referral contact, so I decided to guess the recruiter's email address based on the same email format — a strategy that had worked for me in the past. If I guessed incorrectly, I'd get an error message, and then I'd try a different version.

I could have asked my referral for the recruiter's email, but I was already deeply grateful for their time and referral, and I felt uncomfortable asking for more.

Fortunately, it didn't take long for me to send an email that appeared to go through. It included my résumé and an expression of interest in the role.

Within a few days, I received a response from the recruiter and was given an online assessment to complete. Shortly after, I did my first interview — a one-hour technical and behavioral interview with an engineer.

That was followed by a final interview round, which included four one-hour technical interviews, a 30-minute Q&A session, and a 30-minute break between the third and fourth rounds — about five hours total in a single day.

By March, I had received and accepted an offer for the software engineering role. I started at Snap in August 2023 and am now a machine learning engineer.

One thing I like about Snap is that it's smaller than companies like Meta or Google, which means I'm given a lot of agency and independence on the projects I work on.

My top pieces of advice for other job seekers are:

I'm really glad I listened to my gut and decided to pivot to tech when I started to sense during my finance internship that it wasn't the right path for me, rather than continuing down the same road.

Additionally, I'd recommend leaning on others, whether that's friends or your broader network. Given the tough job market, I've found that many people are willing to help if you reach out to them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk says subscription prices for Full Self-Driving mode will go up, as Tesla kills Autopilot","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-fsd-subscription-price-rising-kills-autopilot-2026-1","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:43:00 GMT","

Elon Musk said Tesla will raise subscription prices for its Full Self-Driving software as it gets better, and it could cost more than $100.

The Tesla CEO said in an early Friday X post, ""I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD's capabilities improve.""

""The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD),"" he said. 

Tesla's FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that aims to enable its cars to be fully self-driving.

Customers can currently buy the system for $8,000 on a one-time basis, per the vehicle's listing on Tesla's website. However, this option will no longer be available from February 14.

The executive was responding to a post about Tesla killing its separate Autopilot service in the US.

Most of Tesla's vehicles previously came with Autopilot as standard. The software included traffic-aware cruise control, which maintains a set driving speed and slows down automatically in response to traffic, as well as features like Autosteer, which allowed Tesla's cars to automatically follow lane markings.

As of Friday, Tesla now only offers Traffic-Aware Cruise Control as standard, according to the company's website.

The move attracted backlash from some Tesla fans on X, with several pointing out that rival brands like Toyota offer lane centering technology as standard on many models.

It comes as Tesla pushes to drive subscriptions for FSD, which Musk has described as a critical part of the company's future.

Adoption of the technology has been sluggish, with Tesla's CFO telling investors in October that only around 12% of Tesla owners are paying for the assisted-driving feature.

Boosting FSD subscriptions is also a crucial part of Musk's massive Tesla pay package. Getting to 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions is one of the key milestones the Tesla CEO needs to hit to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.

Tesla currently makes it clear that FSD requires driver supervision. The company announced Thursday that it had begun offering fully autonomous rides without a safety monitor in its robotaxi service in Austin, and Musk has said that he expects ""unsupervised"" FSD to massively boost demand for Tesla's vehicles.

The automaker has faced regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits over its rollout of FSD and Autopilot. The US's auto regulator launched an investigation in October following reports that Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD were running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.

Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Ahead of the Super Bowl, you might be wondering which chain restaurant has the best boneless wings to chow down on while you watch the big game.

Boneless wings are one of the most popular options at chain restaurants on game day, and chains that specialize in chicken wings, such as Wingstop, are also experiencing significant growth.

The chicken chain has grown from 2,000 to 3,000 restaurants in the past two years, per the company, and saw a 10% increase in system-wide sales in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

We ranked boneless wings from five chain restaurants — Applebee's, Chili's, Buffalo Wild Wings, TGI Fridays, and Wingstop — based on taste and value.

I tried the same three flavors of wings from the five chains: Buffalo, garlic Parmesan, and barbecue.

At Buffalo Wild Wings, an order of 15 boneless wings, which included up to three different sauce flavors, cost $24.99, excluding tax.

Given that the chain is famous for its wings, I was surprised that the chain's boneless wings landed last in my ranking.

Some of the wings were meatier than others, but I thought Buffalo Wild Wings' wings were the smallest when compared to the other chains.

Still, I enjoyed the flavor of the boneless wings, particularly the classic Buffalo wings. They had a sweet buttery flavor without packing too much spice.

The wings had a slightly pungent garlic savoriness, but they weren't as flavorful as the ones I tried from the other chains.

The breading was crunchy and had a peppery flavor, but I thought it slightly overpowered the sauce.

Of the three kinds I tried from Buffalo Wild Wings, these were my favorite. The wings were sticky and sweet, thanks to the honey in the sauce, and paired nicely with the chain's creamy ranch.

The wings were juicy on the inside, which balanced nicely with the crunchy outer breading.

In some ways, these boneless wings reminded me of standard chicken nuggets.

Boneless wings are made exclusively from chicken breast, while nuggets are typically made from a blend of various chicken parts. These did taste better than most chicken nuggets I've had, though I wasn't blown away overall.

I'll go for the burger next time.

I ordered boneless wings from TGI Fridays in three flavors: Buffalo, garlic Parmesan, and apple-butter barbecue. I ordered them as part of the chain's combo platter, which lets you choose three appetizers.

At the TGI Fridays I visited in Massachusetts, the order cost $18.29, excluding tax, and came with eight of each flavor wing.

TGI Fridays doesn't seem to have its own house Buffalo sauce and instead douses its wings in Frank's Red Hot Buffalo sauce, a pretty standard grocery-store hot sauce.

I did enjoy the overall flavor, but these wings didn't bring the heat for me. Compared to the other Buffalo boneless wings I tried, these were just average.

The wings had a super crispy coating and were drenched in a savory, garlicky sauce.

The wings had a crunch when I bit in — which I didn't quite get with the Buffalo boneless wings — and paired excellently with the chain's ranch.

I could distinctly taste the apple butter in this sauce, which gave it a sweet, almost molasses-like flavor. Though the size varied, these wings also were slightly bigger and crunchier than the Buffalo wings.

The wings were reasonably thick, but the chicken and breading lacked seasoning or flavor on their own — the sauces provided the majority of the flavor, which wasn't necessarily a criticism but an observation.

Boneless chicken products like boneless wings, chicken nuggets, and tenders are having a moment right now.

However, Wingstop's senior director of culinary, Larry Bellah, told BI that the chain's bone-in traditional wings are still its most popular offering.

Bellah also said the five most popular sauce flavors at Wingstop are lemon pepper, Original Hot, hickory-smoked barbecue, garlic Parmesan, and hot honey.

I ordered 20 boneless wings, which allowed me to select up to three sauce flavors for $24.69, excluding tax.

They were smaller than the top two brands I tried, but they had a lot of flavor. Wingstop doesn't have a Buffalo sauce, but their Original Hot flavor is the chain's own spin on a classic.

They were buttery, with just the right level of spice.

I found the wings quite flavorful, but the Parmesan cheese stood out much more prominently than the garlic. The garlic flavor was subtle and almost overshadowed by the richness of the cheese.

The sauce had a bold, smoky flavor with a rich balance of sweet, tangy, and savory notes, and coated every square inch of the boneless wing.

Of all the sauces, this flavor paired best with the chain's ranch, which was creamy and mildly tart.

Though these wings were small, they were thick. I thought they were an excellent value. The chicken meat inside tasted high-quality and shredded apart with every bite.

Applebee's seriously delivered on flavor. However, the chain didn't clinch the win for me based on value.

I ended up ordering two separate orders of eight boneless wings, which cost $16.99 each, at my local Applebee's in Brooklyn. I also got another order of eight boneless wings as part of the chain's ""2 for $2X"" deal, which included an appetizer and two entrées for $30, excluding tax.

As of this past year, Applebee's also offers an Ultimate Combo appetizer platter, which would allow you to choose three different kinds of boneless wings in a smaller portion for $16.99 total — a much better value if you're looking to try multiple flavors.

In the end, I ended up paying more than at any other chain, so I could try multiple flavors by ordering them separately. Next time, I'll opt for the Ultimate Combo.

As the official grill and bar sponsor of the NFL, I expected the chain's boneless wings to be good — and they delivered.

Out of all the boneless Buffalo wings I tried, these were the spiciest and most flavorful. They paired well with the chain's ranch, which was tangy and creamy and perfectly balanced out the heat.

The outside of the wing was crispy and crunchy, and the garlic Parmesan sauce added a savory, nutty flavor to each bite.

The wings were perfectly balanced between sweet and smoky.

The wings were impressively large and packed with tender, juicy chicken.

When it came to flavor, Applebee's was exceptional. All three sauces I tried were well-executed and flavorful. However, the garlic Parmesan stood out as my favorite.

Its rich, creamy blend of nutty Parmesan and savory garlic created a bold and indulgent flavor that took the wings to another level. While the other sauces were delicious, the garlic Parmesan offered a perfect balance of crispy breading and zesty flavor that kept me going back for more.

I got 15 wings in three different flavors as part of Chili's popular Triple Dipper appetizer combo, which allowed me to select three appetizers for $17.89, excluding tax, at a Chili's in Massachusetts.

The chain had a successful 2025, marked by significant sales growth, increased restaurant traffic, and strong revenue growth. Executives say the viral popularity of its signature appetizer combo helped drive such growth.

Chili's also said the Triple Dipper and fried mozzarella ""bricks,"" which have also gone viral for their lengthy cheese pulls, are attracting younger customers and getting them to come back more often.

The wings appeared to be baked in the Buffalo sauce rather than tossed in it after cooking.

The Buffalo sauce was sweet and slightly spicy, with a light buttery flavor. I tasted a strong citrus flavor, which I also enjoyed.

I was again impressed by the size of the wings and thought the savory punch of garlic really came through. The wings were moist yet crispy, and I couldn't get enough of them.

Unlike the others, which were almost dry to the touch, these boneless wings came completely drenched in the chain's house barbecue sauce.

The sauce was smoky with a slight sweetness, but they could have benefited from a little acid for some brightness.

They were full of chicken meat, which made this an incredibly filling appetizer to share among a few people at a Super Bowl party … or to keep all to yourself while catching the game.

For under $20, the Triple Dipper delivered incredible value, with a generous portion of high-quality wings that didn't skimp on flavor or size.

For me, it's no surprise this menu item has become such a hit.

""I'll just let it die.""

It was nearly six in the morning on a Tuesday in mid-2023, and Jimmy Donaldson, better known to the world as MrBeast, had been up for hours sending a stream of frustrated texts about MrBeast Burger, his nearly three-year-old food venture.

The YouTuber was furious with his business partners over customer complaints of undercooked burgers, and tensions had reached a breaking point.

He was done.

""As long as I have no control, I couldn't care less about it,"" Donaldson, who is known to be exacting and kill projects he doesn't believe are up to snuff, texted a friend.

These texts — revealed as evidence in a legal battle between MrBeast and his partner Virtual Dining Concepts that could go to trial later this year — represent a stark departure from the grand ambitions Donaldson had described for the brand just six months earlier. They are part of thousands of pages of contracts, messages, and depositions that show how the partnership imploded and reveal a confrontational side of Donaldson far different from his polished, smiley persona on camera.

MrBeast Burger, a largely delivery-only venture that sells burgers and fried chicken sandwiches, was meant to be a cornerstone of a food empire that would ""run circles"" around Nestlé, Donaldson said in a text exchange with his cousin in December 2022.

""I want to go down the food rabbit hole and become a god in this space,"" he wrote. ""The king of healthy food innovation.""

By mid-2023, the promising fast-food endeavor had become a colossal headache for Donaldson.

""I was getting destroyed online, and it was impacting how people viewed me, and it made me chronically depressed,"" he later said of the experience in a deposition.

The MrBeast Burger saga provides a cautionary tale for independent creators about the potential downsides of handing over control to third parties, and to brands about working with influencers who insist on tight creative oversight.

Plenty of celebrity-brand deals have been fruitful, but for every Kim Kardashian and Skims partnership, there's a Kanye West and Gap flameout. Each partnership brings its own nuances and complexities, and ""virtual dining"" businesses like MrBeast Burger come with built-in risks.

MrBeast Burger's food is made by various ""ghost kitchen"" partners ranging from 7-Eleven and Red Robin to local mom-and-pops. That meant low overhead and few barriers to entry for the brand, but the potential for uneven food quality.

For social media creators, whose livelihoods depend on their relationships with fans, reputation is paramount.

""The inherent risk is, when you do these licensing deals, the creator's name is the product,"" said Keith Gelman, founder of entertainment marketing agency Talent Partnership Advisors, who has negotiated partnerships with celebrities including Snoop Dogg and Reba McIntyre. ""The audience doesn't distinguish between the operator and the creator.""

MrBeast and VDC came from different business and cultural worlds.

Donaldson was 22 when MrBeast Burger launched in 2020. He'd soared to internet fame through videos involving cash giveaways and stunts like being buried alive. His business was mainly run by family members, a close circle of friends, and his management team at Night Media.

VDC's founder, Robert Earl, is a British expat restaurateur and TV personality best known for founding Planet Hollywood before moving with his son into the virtual dining business. Often seen sporting colorful shirts, Earl is at home with movie stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. YouTubers like MrBeast were not in his orbit when his son signed the influencer for a burger partnership.

MrBeast Burger launched in 2020 with a bang.

Donaldson set up a pop-up version of the restaurant near his hometown of Greenville, North Carolina, where he slid wads of cash into burger bags and handed out free iPads. He posted a video of the event, which crossed 200 million views on YouTube — a marketer's dream.

""We were beyond slammed and ill-prepared for his incredible following and demand that ensued,"" Earl told Business Insider shortly after MrBeast Burger's launch. ""It was beyond any expectation.""

After selling over 1 million sandwiches in just a couple of months, the company expanded to over 1,000 restaurants in 2021.

Donaldson was giddy with excitement about the possibilities. Early on, he began musing about merging MrBeast Burger with his candy brand Feastables and going public.

He imagined a $10 billion IPO — and he wanted an even bigger stake in the business.

""I'll get my equity, everyone who built the channel will get their equity, and the investors will get sick returns,"" he wrote in a text in late 2022.

Despite a hot start, there were early signs of trouble.

Customer complaints about product quality — including undercooked burgers, soggy fries, and incorrect orders — began appearing on social media almost immediately.

The worst part for Donaldson: There was little he could do about it.

Many of the hundreds of restaurants that sold MrBeast Burger's food operated independently, which meant tracking down any mistakes was like playing a game of whack-a-mole.

The problems MrBeast Burger ran into are common for ghost kitchen brands with many locations, Rich Shank, a senior principal at the food-service consultant and research firm Technomic, told Business Insider.

""There's just a lot of variances and nuances in the ghost kitchen space that make it challenging,"" he said, including standardizing ingredients, cooking processes, and other factors that differ from kitchen to kitchen.

VDC used a variety of methods to monitor quality issues, including working with the guest feedback platform Tattle to analyze customer satisfaction. It hired a third-party firm, Intellishop, to send ""mystery shoppers"" to order from various MrBeast Burger locations and see what they delivered. At one time, about 5% of orders were coming back wrong, more than double VDC's target rate of around 2%, according to an email from VDC CEO Stephanie Sollers.

Sollers said in a deposition that incorrect orders were an unfortunate feature of ""most restaurant businesses."" For Donaldson, the complaints were personal.

""People were ridiculing me and saying I didn't care,"" Donaldson said in a deposition.

Donaldson's lawsuit compared his philosophy to that of Yankee great Joe DiMaggio: ""There is always a kid who may be seeing me for the first time. I owe him my best.""

Donaldson's solution was the same one he applies to his YouTube content: ""obsess over it"" until he figures out an answer.

He proposed to VDC that each restaurant could submit a photo of every item to verify its quality before sending it to customers, and he wanted to hire someone to make quality control their obsession.

That kind of micromanaging wouldn't be ""operationally prudent"" and would be ""a very quick way of having your line cooks want to quit,"" Shank said.

Undercooked food was not the only source of tension in MrBeast Burger land.

Donaldson accused VDC in his lawsuit of having used his name, image, and likeness in social posts and trademarks without his consent. He also told associates he wanted a larger ownership stake to gain control over MrBeast Burger's destiny and get out of what he called in a text a ""fucked deal.""

In November 2022, Donaldson made the first in a series of attempts to acquire nearly all of the company from VDC.

The stakes were high. Tech billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya, an investor in MrBeast's company, said in a 2023 email that the creator's media business was a break-even proposition that had ""some enterprise value but not much.""

""The real value is using it as a platform to launch CPG and other kinds of companies,"" Palihapitiya wrote. ""We need to own at least 80% of each company.""

The problem: Donaldson's company only owned 50% of MrBeast Burger, and the newest deal he'd signed made that agreement indefinite.

The negotiations, which dragged on for months, led to the complete fracturing of MrBeast's relationship with VDC.

During one meeting with VDC, Donaldson banged a clothes hanger on the table out of frustration. In another, the YouTuber claimed Earl showed him a desk drawer of lawsuits to make the point that he wasn't afraid of being sued. (Earl denied this.)

""Let's throw a grenade in the room of VDC,"" Donaldson wrote in one text as negotiations continued.

In the background, Donaldson took other steps to try to seize control. His lawyers shot a letter to VDC alleging breach of contract, and his team changed the passwords on the MrBeast Burger social accounts, cutting off VDC's access.

""Robert is dead to me once the deal closes,"" he texted his cousin during the negotiations.

""Fuck those pieces of shit,"" he wrote to a friend.

In June 2023, his rage went from texts to tweets when he fired off a string of posts about MrBeast Burger that would become central to VDC's countersuit.

MrBeast tweeted that if he had the ability to shut down MrBeast Burger, he ""would have done so a long time ago sadly."" He added that sometimes when you're young, ""you sign a shit deal.""

After Donaldson's tweets, one VDC investor pronounced the venture ""dead and buried."" VDC's complaint called it ""sabotage.""

Amid the feud, MrBeast Burger's ghost kitchen revenue fell from around $64 million in 2022 to about $45 million in 2023, court documents said.

As the negotiations stalled, Donaldson hatched a new plan. The first step was to go to court and request termination of the partnership and a ban on VDC using his name or image.

In a series of text messages, he called it ""the new giga brain play.""

The full plan went something like this: Win the VDC lawsuit, make a deal with Burger King or McDonald's for MrBeast Burger 2.0, do $100 million in sales, and eventually be bought out for $300 or $400 million.

The result, he wrote, would be ""a legendary dub"" — online speak for ""win.""

In July 2023, Donaldson's company sued VDC, portraying the YouTuber as a victim seeking to escape an unfair contract that had tarnished his reputation as a philanthropic, family-friendly entertainer.

VDC fired back soon after with its own lawsuit, saying Donaldson had walked away from a promising deal and failed to meet various contractual obligations, including appearances and promos.

""But for Donaldson's opportunism, disparagement, and interference, MrBeast Burger would have continued its explosive growth,"" VDC's suit says.

The MrBeast Burger brand lost customers and market partners after Donaldson went scorched earth, Earl said in a deposition. A deal with Red Robin fell through, and a plan to distribute the burgers in supermarkets, which could bring in $500 million a year, never materialized, he added.

Donaldson's lawsuit said that VDC had earned millions from the endeavor, while the creator hadn't earned ""a dime."" Earl said in a deposition that Donaldson's mother and financial manager instructed VDC to reinvest the money in the business.

Donaldson, meanwhile, moved on. By the time of the lawsuit, his focus had turned to Feastables, the candy line he launched in 2022.

""I'm never giving up control of Feastables so I can always do what's best for my fans,"" he said in a July 2023 tweet contrasting the business with MrBeast Burger. ""Harsh lesson to learn.""

So far, it's been a winning strategy. Feastables generated over $200 million in 2024 and was profitable, according to investor materials from early 2025 viewed by Business Insider.

""I just obsess over the product,"" he said during a deposition when asked why Feastables had been successful.

Donaldson has taken more control of his company, Beast Industries. The company, now some 450 employees strong, is mostly centralized in Greenville. Donaldson made Silicon Valley vet Jeff Housenbold his in-house CEO and parted ways with his external management company.

In large part thanks to Feastables, Beast Industries was valued at about $5 billion in a 2024 capital raise.

Donaldson's plans for Beast Industries will again put control at odds with expansion.

His road map includes launching in new categories like mobile phones and financial services — with help from $200 million in fresh funding from a crypto company — that will require bringing on partners.

In investor pitch materials from early 2025, Beast Industries said its plan for Beast Financial was to partner with a ""scaled fintech partner to white label a suite of products,"" tailored to MrBeast's audience and supported by financial literacy content. Partnership is simply a necessity for creators with big business ambitions.

""There's no way that a lot of these creators could just on their own build and run a hundred million or billion dollar brand,"" Eric Bogard, CEO of talent-firm UnderCurrent Management, which operates a product division called Viral Goods, told Business Insider. ""You absolutely need a third party.""

As for MrBeast Burger, it marches on amid the winding legal fight, long after Donaldson stopped promoting it. You can still order his Beast Style crinkle-cut fries and smash burgers from hundreds of ghost kitchens around the world — from Singapore to Switzerland — according to its website, which still features photos of a beaming Donaldson.

MrBeast's zombie brand lives on, even if it's dead to its creator.

As the first cohort to enter the workforce with AI tools at the ready, many Gen Zers are torn.

Some 68% of these young professionals are anxious about AI automation, while 58% use AI tools at least three to four times a week, according to new research from think tank Oliver Wyman Forum. Nearly half of Gen Zers also say AI has already changed the caliber or type of work expected from them.

The findings, released earlier this week, are based on survey responses from 300,000 consumers and workers collected over the past five years, including 45,000 adult members of Gen Z. The most recent survey was taken last year.

Today's youngest workers are leaning into AI more so than their older counterparts, who are less anxious about the technology and use it less often, the study shows.

Compared with boomers, for example, Gen Zers are 1.7 times more likely to participate in AI training and 2.3 times more likely to report a productivity increase from using AI at work.

Young workers have good reason to be on high alert. At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, the CEOs of Google DeepMind and Anthropic each said they're starting to see AI minimize the need for some junior roles at their companies.

Anthropic's chief, Dario Amodei, also said at the conference that he hasn't changed his prediction from May, when he warned that AI could erase half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years.

Meanwhile, economist Marc Sumerlin said in November that companies may pause hiring young workers as they await the benefits of AI, and that ultimately the technology could lead to fewer jobs for recent graduates. Already, some companies have cited AI directly or indirectly as a reason for layoffs.

The grim outlook comes as the unemployment rate for recent college graduates in the US remained elevated at 5.3% in the third quarter, according to the latest analysis from the New York Federal Reserve.

Some corporate leaders are more optimistic about AI's impact on Gen Zers' careers.

Earlier this month, Figma CEO Dylan Field said on the podcast ""In Good Company"" that AI skills give young professionals a hiring advantage and that the technology won't wipe out entry-level jobs.

Similarly, Reid Hoffman, the venture capitalist who cofounded LinkedIn, said in a video posted to his YouTube channel in June that young people should use their familiarity with AI as a selling point when seeking work.

Some Gen Z workers say AI is helping them advance faster in their careers than they likely would have otherwise.

Lindsay Grippo, 28, credits the technology for helping her practice big-picture strategic thinking when drafting newsletters, blog posts, and other copy for her editor role at Codeword, a New York-based digital marketing agency. She views the AI's output as if it's from a more junior creative.

""I'm assessing how well it meets a project's goals, similar to how my manager might review my work,"" she said. ""It is training me to think like a more senior-level creative.""

Kyle Monson, a founding partner at Codeword, said the agency hasn't changed its hiring plans in response to AI, and that young employees like Grippo seem to be among the most proficient users of the technology.

A 46-year-old Gen Xer, Monson sees AI fluency as an advantage for young workers that makes him jealous. When he started his career, he said he had to do a lot of grunt work, such as data entry and note-taking, before he could advance.

AI can now do those kinds of tasks, allowing junior talent to tackle higher-value assignments, which he described as those that require making judgment calls.

""That's when your career really starts to take off,"" said Monson.

In this article

Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said his business relationship with President Donald Trump's family has been ""misconstrued"" in the wake of his pardon. 

""There's no business relationships whatsoever,"" Zhao told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on Thursday in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

The former Binance CEO served four months in prison after pleading guilty in 2023 to charges he enabled money laundering during his time leading the company. Zhao was released in September 2024.

Trump's pardon in October 2025 drew attention to Binance's ties to World Liberty Financial, a crypto company run by the president's family.

The connection stems from a $2 billion investment in March 2025 by state-owned firm MGX of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, into Binance. MGX paid using USD1, a stablecoin created by World Liberty Financial.

Zhao stepped down as Binance's CEO in 2023 as part of the plea deal and $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. He remains a major shareholder.

""MGX is the investor. They choose USD1,"" Zhao told CNBC. ""My request to them was they pay us in crypto. I don't want to deal with banks, really.""

""Many people misconstrued that,"" he added.

Zhao told CNBC the company has since converted that investment out of USD1 in portions over time.

""Stablecoin is just a currency for payment. Just because I accepted that, it doesn't mean I invested in the issuer of that,"" he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported following the pardon that in addition to MGX's investment using USD1, Binance also helped build the technology behind the stablecoin, citing sources familiar with the matter.

""A lot of people say that he wasn't guilty of anything,"" Trump said, when asked later why he issued the order. ""And so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.""

NBC News reported the week of Trump's pardon that Binance had recently hired lobbyist Charles McDowell's firm, Checkmate Government Relations. McDowell is a friend of Donald Trump Jr., the president's son.

Checkmate disclosed that it was paid $450,000 for work that included lobbying the White House and Treasury Department for ""executive relief"" and ""financial services policy issues relating to digital assets and cryptocurrency.""

""There is a lot of media saying that there is some deal in place to get me the pardon,"" Zhao told CNBC at Davos. ""As far as I know, that does not exist at all.""

CNBC has reached out to World Liberty Financial for comment.

Zhao told CNBC at Davos that he has still not spoken directly with Trump.

""The closest that I got to him was today when he was doing the Board of Peace session,"" Zhao said. ""I was in the audience, about 30 to 40 feet away from him.""

In a CBS ""60 Minutes"" interview in November, Trump affirmed that he did not know Zhao.

""I have no idea who he is,"" Trump said. ""I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.""

In this article

A former official of U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration is planning a multi-billion-dollar data center project in a remote corner of Greenland, as hyperscalers scramble to build out capacity across the globe to keep up with the AI rollout.

The data center is aiming to be operational at 300 megawatts (MW) by mid-2027, before further expansion would see it hit 1.5 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2028.

While that's currently several times the power capacity of any active data center in the world, there are plans to build multiple 1 GW-plus facilities across the globe over the next two years as the race to develop AI infrastructure continues to gather pace.

The Greenland data center project will cost billions of dollars to complete and has binding commitments with investors to finance half of its initial phase of development and half of the final phase, Drew Horn, a senior aide to Trump's first-term vice president Mike Pence and CEO of GreenMet, a company that's offering strategic support to the project, told CNBC. 

The venture is eyeing a buildout in the Kangerlussuaq area, a small settlement at the end of a deep fjord on the southwest coast of the Arctic island, with an airport, he added.

Technical partners have been enlisted to help with the physical buildout, but the project has yet to secure land or approvals from the local authorities, Horn said. He declined to share the names of the other companies involved in the venture because the information isn't public yet.

Commercial opportunities in Greenland have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Arctic island has become the center of a geopolitical firestorm after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on acquisition talk. 

Critical minerals mining and freshwater reserves have been touted as potential prospects, though skeptics point to logistical challenges around tapping into them with Greenland's limited infrastructure.  

Data center deals hit a record $61 billion in 2025 amid a rush to build out the infrastructure needed to power energy-intensive AI workloads. Big tech firms, including Meta, OpenAI, Oracle, AWS, Microsoft and Google are investing huge sums into developing facilities across the globe. 

Work on plans for the Greenland data center project began a year ago, and Horn told CNBC it has secured technical partners to assist with construction, operation and supplying energy.

Committed financing, which is in the form of debt and equity, is contingent on the project meeting key milestones, including securing permits from local government, said Horn — who was also a senior advisor to both the energy and intelligence departments towards the end of Trump's first term.

Other former senior Trump employees also have stakes in GreenMet, which says on its website that it helps companies with government and private funding and strategic partnerships.  

George Sorial, who was an executive vice president and chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization until 2019, and Keith Schiller, who was a longtime bodyguard for Trump and director of Oval Office operations during the U.S. president's first term, helped set up the company in 2021 and remain shareholders.

""We are not actively involved with GreenMet or Greenland,"" Sorial told CNBC. ""We are passive minority shareholders in GreenMet and have no management role in the company."" Schiller had not responded to a CNBC request for comment as this story went live.

The GreenMet CEO has been developing relationships with officials in the Greenlandic and Danish administrations as he looks to advance the project. He met the Danish Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen on Wednesday, as part of a ""continuing dialogue,"" to discuss the data center, Horn said. CNBC has approached Denmark's U.S. embassy for comment.

While officials on all sides have been supportive of the project, the ""issue is not so much on the private side, it's on the diplomatic,"" Horn said, pointing to the geopolitical tensions surrounding the U.S. push to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

Tensions have cooled since Trump backtracked on plans to impose tariffs on several European nations over the issue, but questions still remain as negotiations around U.S. military and economic involvement in Greenland continue.

""Our effort, which is purely private, it succeeds only if we have the buy-in from the relevant affected parties and countries,"" Horn said.

""Larger corporate entities"" will be taking the lead on the construction and development of the data center, but GreenMet will continue to be involved as an advisor as the project looks to secure government investment from nations including the U.S., Greenland, Denmark, and other NATO countries, Horn told CNBC. 

""We've spent about a year putting together everything from the power to the technology components, [and] we have a Greenlandic partner on the ground,"" Horn said. ""Right now we're waiting on approvals from the Greenlandic side.""

A big challenge for projects of this scale in Greenland is access to power. For the first phase of the project, which is targeting 300 MW power capacity, the plan is to use specialized barges carrying Liquefied Natural Gas to the fjord, Horn said.

The venture plans to build a hydroelectric facility — 70% of the island's energy comes from such facilities — to power the second phase, which would see the data center hit 1.5 GW capacity. Permits and approvals from the Greenlandic government are still pending for both the barges and the facility. Greenland's Ministry of Business has been approached for comment.

Horn argues that if local authorities greenlight the large hydroelectric facility, energy prices will make the project commercially viable long-term. 

There are some significant advantages to building data centers in an environment with low temperatures, analysts told CNBC.

""The biggest value sits in its resource profile, specifically in hydro for electricity generation and a 'free cooling' proposition given the lower ambient temperature,"" Noah Ramos, strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, told CNBC.

But there are hurdles the project will have to overcome. ""Building in the Arctic is capital intensive; construction seasons are short, and the heat from the servers can melt the very ground the building sits on... specialized engineering is needed,"" Ramos said.

Nvidia is also touting a new generation of chips that require less cooling. ""It's early days, but if future generations of chips are even more efficient in this regard, it could negate the need for expensive data centre build outs in places like Greenland,"" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC.

In this article

Intel shares plunged more than 15% on Friday after the chipmaker issued lackluster guidance and warned of a supply shortage.

During a fourth-quarter earnings call with analysts Thursday, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company wouldn't be able to meet full demand for its products. He said production efficiency, or yield, is also below his targets. 

""We are on a multiyear journey,"" he said. ""It will take time and resolve.""

The chipmaker expects first-quarter revenue to range between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share to break even. That was below LSEG expectations for earnings of 5 cents per share and $12.51 billion in revenue. 

Over the last year, Intel shares have rallied more than double on hopes of a turnaround for the embattled American chipmaker, following investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia.

The company's foundry business has long underperformed competitors, which are profiting massively from the data center artificial intelligence boom. 

Investors were looking for clarity on foundry customers as the next momentum mover for the stock. The company's foundry business creates chips for other companies. 

CFO David Zinsner told CNBC that Intel expects customers for its next-generation 14A technology to appear in the second half of the year. 

But analysts at RBC Capital Markets warned that a ""meaningful revenue contribution"" from 14A customers may not pop up until late 2028. 

""We appreciate the recent excitement around opportunity for INTC but still don't see a clear path forward given further share loss, no AI strategy and unclear fab/packaging opportunities,"" wrote analysts at Jefferies.

Despite the soft outlook, Intel topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings and revenue expectations.

Shares of Czech-based defense firm Czechoslovak Group (CSG) soared over 30% on its stock market debut on Friday, underscoring sustained investor interest in defense companies amid Europe's growing push for military sovereignty.

CSG, one of the world's fastest-growing defense firms, made its debut on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 

Shares rose as much as 32% in the session before closing the session up 31.4%.

The Prague-based company, which makes armed vehicles, ammunition and advanced defense systems, raised a total of 3.8 billion euros in its initial public offering. 

Euronext said the listing marked the world's largest defense IPO ever recorded, both in terms of amount raised and market capitalization.

""Today marks a historic milestone for CSG as we join the Euronext Amsterdam market and we welcome the confidence shown in us by investors,"" Michal Strnad, chairman of CSG, said in a statement.

""Becoming a publicly listed company demonstrates our commitment to high standards of transparency, disclosure and corporate governance and strengthens our ability to invest in innovation, expand our global reach and deliver on our mission to be a critical long-term supplier of advanced defence and industrial solutions to NATO states and Government partners worldwide,"" he added.

The listing comes after weeks of mounting geopolitical tensions, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to use military force to seize Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. 

In a surprise development on Wednesday, however, Trump said he had agreed to a framework of a future deal with respect to the self-governing Danish territory. 

In Europe, meanwhile, investors have continued to pile into defense stocks, fueled by a mix of European Union, national and private capital funding.

Strategists have cited Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the end of the U.S. defense umbrella in Europe as underpinning a so-called ""mega-trend in the making.""

Happy Friday. With TikTok guaranteeing its presence in the U.S. (which we cover below), it looks like my screen time will remain far higher than it should be.

Stock futures ticked lower this morning. The market is coming off another winning day.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

As investors continue to breathe easier amid easing geopolitical and trade tensions, inflation data released yesterday gave traders another reassuring sign. The latest stats were in-line with expectations, though they were still above the level deemed healthy by the Federal Reserve.

Here's what to know:

Trump is taking JPMorgan Chase and its CEO Jamie Dimon to court. 

In a lawsuit filed yesterday, the president alleged that the bank's closure of his and related accounts in early 2021 was politically motivated. Trump told reporters yesterday that Dimon ""debanked"" him, saying that he's ""not allowed to do what he did."" Trump is seeking at least $5 billion in civil damages as part of the suit, which was filed in Florida state court. 

As CNBC's Hugh Son and Dan Mangan note, JPMorgan's closure of Trump's accounts followed the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and Trump's departure from the White House later that month. ""While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit,"" JPMorgan said in a statement to CNBC.

Intel surpassed Wall Street's expectations on both lines for the fourth quarter, but the chipmaker offered soft guidance for the current quarter which sent shares sinking 13% in overnight trading.

CFO David Zinsner told CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos that the company's weak outlook was due in part to supply constraints. While Intel doesn't have the materials to meet seasonal demand this quarter, supply should improve in the next three-month period, he said. 

The stock's pullback follows a huge run: Shares of Intel have surged nearly 150% over the last 12 months. Trader excitement has been driven by investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia in the California-based company last year.

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

Big technology news last night: TikTok announced it officially formed a joint venture that will keep it operating in the U.S. Thanks to a law signed in 2024, the short-form video platform faced an effective ban in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company ByteDance divested from the company's American business.

Adam Presser — TikTok's head of operations and trust and safety — will become CEO of the venture, which the company said will operate as an ""independent entity.""  TikTok CEO Shou Chew will be a director, and Americans will comprise a majority of the seven-member board.

As CNBC's Dylan Butts reports, TikTok continued to dominate in the U.S. last year despite the potential ban. It was the second most-downloaded app in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2025, according to Sensory Tower data.

After Trump's market-moving announcement that he reached a ""framework"" of a deal with NATO over Greenland, European leaders are trying to get the nitty-gritty.

European parliament member Bernd Lange told CNBC yesterday that the European Union needed ""greater clarity"" on what the agreement entails and that ""nobody knows"" the details. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen similarly said he did not know the specifics of the framework, but that the island's sovereignty and territorial integrity were ""red lines"" that couldn't be crossed.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called out European leaders in a strongly worded Davos address. ""Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost trying to convince the U.S. president to change,"" Zelenskyy said yesterday.

Between Davos and the Greenland deal framework, there's been no shortage of news to keep up with. Here are some stories you might have missed:

The sudden collapse last fall of a string of American companies backed by private credit has thrust a fast-growing and opaque corner of Wall Street lending into the spotlight.

Private credit, also known as direct lending, is a catch-all term for lending done by nonbank institutions. The practice has been around for decades but surged in popularity after post-2008 financial crisis regulations discouraged banks from serving riskier borrowers. 

That growth — from $3.4 trillion in 2025 to an estimated $4.9 trillion by 2029 — and the September bankruptcies of auto-industry firms Tricolor and First Brands have emboldened some prominent Wall Street figures to raise alarms about the asset class.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in October that problems in credit are rarely isolated: ""When you see one cockroach, there are probably more."" Billionaire bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach a month later accused private lenders of making ""garbage loans"" and predicted that the next financial crisis will come from private credit.

While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven't lifted completely.

Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital, as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR, still trade well below their recent highs.

Private credit is ""lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it's growing really fast, which doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,"" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. 

Private credit's boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient.

Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. 

But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector's competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes.

After all, it's the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. 

""The double-edged sword of private credit"" is that the lenders have ""really strong incentives to monitor for problems,"" said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay.

""But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,"" she said.

De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it's difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said.

""This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it's not a public market,"" she said. ""We're not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.""

In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero.

Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report.

And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis.

Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.

After investment bank Jefferies, JPMorgan and Fifth Third disclosed losses tied to the auto industry bankruptcies in the fall, investors learned the extent of this form of lending. Bank loans to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs, reached $1.14 trillion last year, per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

On Jan. 13, JPMorgan disclosed for the first time its lending to nonbank financial firms as part of its fourth-quarter earnings presentation. The category tripled to about $160 billion in loans in 2025 from about $50 billion in 2018.

Banks are now ""back in the game"" because deregulation under the Trump administration will free up capital for them to expand lending, Moody's Zandi said. That, combined with newer entrants in private credit, might lead to lower loan underwriting standards, he said.

""You're seeing a lot of competition now for the same type of lending,"" Zandi said. ""If history is any guide, that's a concern ... because it probably argues for a weakening in underwriting and ultimately bigger credit problems down the road.""

While neither Zandi nor de Fontenay said they saw an imminent collapse in the sector, as private credit continues to grow, so will its importance to the U.S. financial system.

When banks hit turbulence because of the loans they made, there is an established regulatory playbook, but future problems in the private realm might be harder to resolve, according to de Fontenay.

""It raises broader questions from the perspective of the safety and soundness of the overall system,"" de Fontenay said. ""Are we going to know enough to know when there are signs of problems before they actually occur?""

TikTok has just announced a new U.S. venture that will keep it operating there after years of concerns about its links to China. But even as it was nearly banned and faced scrutiny from officials, the short-video platform still dominated in 2025.

The app, owned by Beijing-headquartered ByteDance, was the second-most-downloaded app across Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store in the U.S. in 2025, according to Sensor Tower data, defying a near-ban in the market.

Another ByteDance app, CapCut, ranked fourth, with the video editing tool climbing three places from a year ago.

Other China-linked apps also had strong showings across U.S. app stores in 2025, with major e-commerce players like Temu and Shein thriving even as they were targeted by policy changes, Sensor Tower data showed.

Temu, which ran a high-profile Super Bowl ad campaign in 2024, fell from the top position that year, but still ranked in seventh place in 2025, even as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs upended its business model.

Although Shein did not rank among the top 10 most downloaded apps overall, it was the most downloaded app in the apparel shopping category in the U.S. in 2025.

Separately, OpenAI's ChatGPT was America's most downloaded app last year, as adoption of generative artificial intelligence continued to expand.

Sensor Tower's data shows that U.S. consumers continue to favor apps coming out of China, often synonymous with addictive algorithms, affordability, and convenience.

""2025 showed that these China-originated apps aren't just policy arbitrageurs, but are adaptive ecosystems with governance capabilities on both the demand and supply sides,"" Liang Chen, a Professor of Strategy & Entrepreneurship at Singapore Management University, told CNBC.

Before Thursday's announcement of the U.S. joint venture, TikTok faced months of uncertainty in 2025. The Supreme Court upheld a law in January that effectively banned the video-sharing app from U.S. app stores unless ByteDance divested from the platform.

The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April 2024, cited risks of the Chinese government accessing user data for surveillance or influence operations. 

Although TikTok briefly went dark in January, the law was never enforced. Upon taking office, Trump repeatedly extended the law's deadline as he negotiated a divestment deal.

The threat of a TikTok ban also drew increased attention to Chinese alternatives such as Xiaohongshu, known in English as RedNote.

Despite the uncertainty, not only did interest in TikTok's app hold steady, but it managed to expand its e-commerce business, TikTok Shop, which allows users to purchase products directly through videos and live streams. 

The company has said that, under the new joint venture plans, TikTok Global's U.S. entities will continue to manage certain commercial activities, including e-commerce and advertising. 

According to data from retail consulting firm Coresight, TikTok's U.S. revenues, including ad revenue, in-app purchases and commerce, rose 26.2% year over year to $13.9 billion, following 25.7% growth in 2024.

""TikTok's success in 2025 demonstrates a path to navigate geopolitical headwinds despite the continuously deteriorating U.S.-China relationship — a rare case of clever commercial strategy triumphing over politics,"" said Xiaomeng Lu, director of geo-technology at Eurasia Group. 

The app looks poised to close its deal with U.S. investors, with multiple Trump-Xi meetings planned throughout the year, she added. 

TikTok Shop competitors Temu and Shein also remained major players in the U.S. last year despite new tariffs and increased government oversight of labor practices, supply chains, and product safety. 

The most significant of these headwinds was the Trump administration's closure of the ""de minimis"" trade loophole on May 2 and the imposition of broader tariffs on imports from China. The ""de minimis"" rule had allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the United States duty-free.

Although Shein and Temu have moved their headquarters out of China in recent years, much of their operations and suppliers remain in the country.

Analysts said both companies adjusted to tariffs by negotiating lower supplier prices, absorbing some of the levy costs, and expanding supply networks beyond China, including in the United States.

Coresight estimates Shein's U.S. revenue increased 16.8% year over year to $14.6 billion in 2025. Meanwhile, Temu's gross merchandise values increased by 21.8% year over year to $27.4 billion.

""[Policy] shocks in 2025 didn't really make demand disappear. Rather, they proved that these platforms can adapt their logistics, merchant mix, and incentive design faster than consumer habits shift,"" said Singapore Management University's Chen. 

Analysts said the staying power of apps such as TikTok, Temu and Shein stems from their attention-driven platforms and algorithms.

""The success of Temu, Shein, and TikTok Shop fundamentally reflects a shift in demand generation: moving away from legacy marketing tactics like simple ad-spend and display campaigns to a continuous, attention-economy strategy,"" said Scott Miller, CEO of e-commerce consulting firm pdPlus. 

""Their growth shows that American consumers now discover products through highly engaging, viral, and personalized content, making demand creation a function of entertainment and constant digital presence rather than traditional top-down branding,"" he added. 

Those same algorithms and features have also drawn scrutiny from U.S. regulators. For example, officials have raised national security concerns over TikTok's recommendation algorithm, citing its potential for manipulation by the Chinese government. 

Regulators have also flagged data privacy and national security risks tied to Temu and Shein's data collection practices.

Despite those concerns, the apps have continued to capture the attention of U.S. users and shoppers. 

""American consumers overall don't really care an app's association with any specific country as long as they can find something they want at an affordable price,"" said Yao Jin, an associate professor of supply chain management at Miami University.

""[That] is exactly the competitive advantage of most China-originated apps.""

In this article

U.S. President Donald Trump's warning that a U.S. ""armada"" is heading toward Iran has deepened concern of potential military action in the Middle East, pushing oil prices higher amid fears of supply disruption.

""We're watching Iran,"" Trump told reporters Thursday on Air Force One. ""You know we have a lot of ships going in that direction just in case. We have a big flotilla going in that direction and we'll see what happens.""

The U.S. president also repeated his push for Tehran not to restart its nuclear program, echoing comments made to CNBC at the World Economic Forum earlier in the week. 

Oil prices, which fell around 2% in the previous session, were trading higher Friday morning. 

International benchmark Brent crude futures with March delivery rose 1.8% to $65.20 per barrel at around 1:04 p.m. London time (8:04 a.m. ET). U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery, meanwhile, were last seen up 1.8% at $60.44.

Trump's comments come as the death toll from Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests reached at least 5,002, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency, with nearly 27,000 arrested. HRANA, a U.S.-registered nonprofit, relies on an activist network inside Iran for its reporting. 

The demonstrations, which began in Tehran's bazaar on Dec. 28, have been fueled by growing frustrations over a long-running economic crisis, particularly the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices.

Trump appeared to back away from threats of military action against Iran last week, telling reporters that he'd been informed by ""very important sources"" in Tehran that ""the killing has stopped.""

The U.S. president's latest warning to Iran, however, alongside a U.S. naval buildup in the Gulf region, has put energy market participants on tenterhooks. Iran, a member of OPEC, is a major player in the global oil market, producing more than 3 million barrels of crude a day. 

Aditya Saraswat, MENA research director at Rystad Energy, said in a research note that there were three likely scenarios for Iran's oil flows: sustaining the status quo, making progress in negotiations with the Trump administration, or preparing for regime change sparked by U.S. intervention.

""Iran's familiar tactics, such as closing the Strait of Hormuz, banking on its trade with China and threatening nuclear escalation, are still on the table, yet must be weighed by their own potential for backfiring on the regime,"" Saraswat said Monday.

The Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, is recognized as one of the world's most important oil chokepoints. 

Blocking the waterway, even temporarily, can ratchet up global energy prices, raise shipping costs and cause significant supply delays. 

For Iran, Saraswat said, the ""only redeeming factor"" is China's role as a key driver of export revenues.

""As it stands, China accounts for 90% of Iran's oil exports, with even a portion of cargoes booked for 'unknown' destinations ending up in China. Although the current export model looks feasible in the near term, its sustainability is becoming more conditional,"" he added.

Energy analysts told CNBC last week that market participants were braced for further price swings amid heightened geopolitical tensions, saying a U.S. military strike was unlikely to materially affect Iranian oil production.

""Material interruptions to Iranian oil production would boost prices, although the impact would still be limited given global market oversupply,"" analysts at Fitch Ratings said Jan. 16. 

Speaking to CNBC's Dan Murphy on Wednesday, Amin Nasser, CEO of Saudi oil firm Aramco, also said the energy sector has been ""very resilient in terms of managing any volatility that could happen."" 

Nasser said the market is ""well supplied,"" when asked about the risk of disruption to Iranian oil supplies.

""If you look at the last decade and how many disruptions we had, the market continued to be well supplied because the sources are distributed also,"" he added.

Shares of Adani Group companies fell between 5 to 13% on Friday as court filings showed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to send summons to founder Gautam Adani and nephew Sagar Adani on charges of bribery and fraud.  

Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, chair of India's Adani Group and one of the world's richest people, was indicted with seven other men in New York federal court in November 2024 on charges related to a massive bribery and fraud scheme.

The SEC has approached a U.S. District Judge, Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, seeking permission to issue a legal summons to Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani and the executive director of Adani Green Energy, Sagar Adani, according to court filings. CNBC has reached out to Adani Group and the U.S. SEC for comment.

Shares of Adani Green Energy ended the session nearly 14% lower, while those of the flagship company Adani Enterprises closed 10.7% lower on Friday. Shares of Adani Power dropped 5.7%.

The Adani Group executives are charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about their company's compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption practices, as they raised more than $3 billion in capital to fund those energy contracts.

India's Ministry of Law and Justice has twice refused last year to deliver the summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani under the Hague Convention, the SEC told the court. ""The Ministry appeared to suggest that the SEC lacks authority to invoke the Hague Convention or seek service of the Summonses,"" it said.

Adani and several other defendants are accused of having paid Indian government officials more than $250 million in bribes to obtain solar energy supply contracts worth more than $2 billion in profits.

BEIJING — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang plans to visit China in the coming days ahead of the mid-February Lunar New Year, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC. 

The trip comes as questions persist over the U.S. chip giant's ability to sell in the Chinese market, which once accounted for at least one-fifth of revenue from Nvidia's data center business.

U.S. export restrictions have prevented Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China as Washington seeks to maintain an edge over Beijing in chips used to develop cutting-edge artificial intelligence.

Huang is expected to attend an Nvidia company party in Beijing on Monday, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to speak about the trip.

He is also set to meet with potential buyers in China and discuss recent logistical challenges in supplying U.S.-approved Nvidia chips into the market, according to a person with direct knowledge of the travel plans. 

The Information reported last week, citing sources, that China would only approve local purchases of Nvidia's H200 AI chips for limited purposes such as research. When asked about the report Thursday, China's Commerce Ministry claimed it was unaware of the situation. 

Bloomberg first reported news of Huang's China trip earlier this week. Nvidia declined to comment on executive travel plans. 

Huang visited mainland China at least three times last year, including in January for Lunar New Year celebrations.

Amid the recent uproar over U.S. President Donald Trump's aim of annexing Greenland, it's easy to lose track of another geopolitical tension that's been raging on the European continent for nearly 4 years: the Russia-Ukraine war.

On Friday, Ukrainian, Russian and U.S. ambassadors will hold trilateral talks in the United Arab Emirates that will last until Saturday. 

Notably, Europe won't be involved in the meetings. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Thursday accused Europe of being ""lost"" and trying to persuade Trump to help them, rather than uniting for their own defense.

On another front, Denmark on Thursday signaled it was open to talks with the U.S. over its ""Golden Dome"" missile defense plan, which is part of the ""deal"" regarding Greenland that U.S. President Donald Trump had announced a day earlier.

But Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that he doesn't know what's in the agreement — a response shared by many analysts and political watchers.

Ed Price, senior non-resident fellow at New York University, told CNBC on Thursday that striking a deal ""requires two people to tango,"" describing Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, as ""a monologue not a dialogue.""

Still, Trump walking back on his tariff threats on EU countries and toning down the rhetoric on Greenland has lifted markets globally, reviving talks of TACO — ""Trump Always Chickens Out"" — trade.

The U.S. president also signed his Gaza ""Board of Peace"" into being on Thursday — and withdrew his invitation to Canada to join the board, conceived as a means to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after a two-year war with Israel.  

There's a slight dip in the temperature around Greenland, but geopolitical heat persists elsewhere.

— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger, Anniek Bao, Lucy Handley and Hugh Leask contributed to this report.

Trump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Canada. The move comes after Canadian Prime Minster Mark Carney gave an address in Davos warning against economic coercion by the world's superpowers. Carney said last week he intended to join the board.

TikTok forms U.S. joint venture. This means the video-sharing app will be allowed to continue operating in the U.S. The new venture, which will run as an ""independent entity,"" will be headed by Adam Presser, who has been serving as TikTok's head of operations and trust and safety. 

The Bank of Japan raises economic forecast. Economic expansion in the fiscal year ending March 2026 is expected to hit 0.9%, up from the 0.7% estimated in October. The BOJ also held interest rates steady. Meanwhile, inflation in December cooled, and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi dissolved parliament on Friday.

U.S. stocks extend gains. On Thursday, leading U.S. indexes climbed for a second day after Trump called off Europe tariffs. Asia-Pacific markets rose Friday, but tech stocks, such as SoftBank Group and Lasertec, fell after Intel shares plunged in extended trading.

[PRO] Stocks that look poised to surge. CNBC Pro screened for names that have been upgraded to buy or overweight by at least three more analysts since the end of last year. A major trading platform and Wall Street bank showed up on the list.

India's largest airline, Indigo, that cancelled more than 2,500 flights within days last month causing massive disruptions, reported a 78% drop in profit in the December quarter, sending its shares down more than 3%.

The company, which reported results after market close on Thursday, made a provision of 5.8 billion rupees ($63 million) toward compensation following flight disruptions in December. 

The larger impact on its earnings, however, was from a one-time charge owed to the implementation of new labor code and forex losses, together amounting to about 20 billion rupees. 

The lack of progress on the U.S.-India trade deal has hurt investor confidence, contributing to capital outflows, and has weighed on the rupee, making it Asia's worst performing currency last year — down about 5%. 

The currency was last trading at 91.52 and experts predict it to slip further to 92 rupee per dollar level by end of March, which could spell more trouble for forex-exposed businesses including Indigo.

The March quarter for the airline is ""expected to be weaker"" despite a 10% rise in available seat kilometers, or ASK, according to a report by Jefferies on Thursday. ASK is a key metric for measuring passenger capacity.

The brokerage added that the airline will see a ""moderation"" in passenger revenue per available seat kilometer (PRASK) and increase in cost per available seat kilometer as the company ""continues to add aircraft.""

Jefferies maintains a buy rating on the stock with a target price of 6,140 rupees per share.

Airlines in India face pressure on both costs and revenue fronts as a majority of the airlines get nearly 65% of their revenue from domestic travel, for which passengers pay in Indian rupees, but most of the costs are in dollars.

Indigo is adding more capacity because they need to grow, but the next 6-12 months will be tough, as we expect the rupee to weaken further and fuel costs to rise, said Mark Martin, founder and CEO of aviation consulting firm Martin Consulting.

He told CNBC that Indigo may need to fly on more international routes to improve its dollar earnings. This was also hinted at in the company's earnings call, with the management saying that new seat additions will be skewed toward international routes.

Labor reforms in India, which have expanded the scope and eligibility of social security benefits for employees, also weighed on Indigo's earnings as it recognized one-time charges of 9.7 billion rupees. 

Several large Indian companies, such as Tata Consultancy Services and ICICI Bank, have reported a one-time hit on earnings due to the labor reforms during the December quarter. 

In November, the Indian government announced reforms, consolidating 29 separate labor laws into four comprehensive codes, walking a tightrope between balancing business interests and employee welfare.

Under these codes, fixed term or contract employees will now qualify for benefits available to permanent workers, including leave, medical, and social security.

However, this was not the only change in government regulation that impacted Indigo during the last quarter.

In November last year, government implemented flight duty time limitation norms under which airlines were mandated to operate fewer late-night flights and rest time for crew was increased from 36 hours to 48 hours.

In the first week of December, Indigo cancelled thousands of flights, blaming it on the changes to the pilot rest policy. Early December was the ""the most challenging weeks"" in Indigo's history, said Pieter Elbers, chief executive of the Indigo.

Last week, India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered the airline to pay a penalty of 222 million rupees in connection with the operational disruptions, which is part of the one-time provisions. 

Currently, Indigo is operating 2,100-2,200 daily flights, said Elbers, who had come under fire following the disruption in December, adding that the airline will be able to comply with the government's flight duty time limitation norms by February.

Indigo served 124 million customers in 2025, up 9% on year, according to its statement.

In this article

Chinese tech giant Xiaomi saw its shares pop over 2% in trading on Friday after it announced a stock buyback program worth up to HK$2.5 billion ($321 million). 

The repurchase plan comes as the electric vehicle and smartphone maker looks to reassure investors amid intensifying competition, rising component costs and recent product safety concerns. 

Despite Friday's gains, Xiaomi's shares are down over 8% so far this year, reflecting sustained pressure on its valuation.

The company has regularly repurchased shares in recent years, including 4 million shares for HK$152 million on Jan. 13.

Critics of stock buybacks argue that the practice can boost share prices without improving a company's underlying business. They say buybacks divert cash from other investments, such as employee pay, factory expansion, job creation and innovation.

Xiaomi's latest buyback begins Jan. 23 and will be executed on the open market, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals, according to a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange late Thursday. 

The Beijing-based firm is one of China's largest consumer technology companies, with businesses in smartphones, electric vehicles and smart home devices. 

Analysts say the stock has faced pressure recently as a looming memory chip shortage threatens to push up component costs for its consumer devices, particularly smartphones. 

""[The shortage] has caused margin compression for smartphone manufacturers and a number of independent industry forecasters have lowered their outlook for smartphones,"" said Dan Baker, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.

The memory shortage is only expected to worsen this year, as manufacturers continue to focus on the growing memory demands of the AI industry, diverting capacity from electronics manufacturers.

""2026 is going to be challenging not just for Xiaomi but for many Chinese [Original Equipment Manufacturers] as domestic Android players remain most vulnerable to chip shortages,"" said Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. 

Last year, Xiaomi's shares had also faced pressure following reports of accidents involving its vehicles that went viral on social media. More broadly, the company has been affected by an ongoing price war in China's EV market, which has weighed on margins across the sector. 

Regarding its EV business, Kyna Wong, a China technology analyst at Citi Research, said that investors had also been disappointed by Xiaomi's modest 550,000-unit vehicle delivery target for 2026. 

She added that margins on the company's vehicle sales are likely to trend down due to changes to Beijing's EV subsidy policies in 2026. 

Meanwhile, Xiaomi has been investing heavily in longer-term initiatives, including an internal semiconductor division. Last year, the company committed at least 50 billion yuan over the next 10 years, starting in 2025, to develop its own chips.

Xiaomi also plans to expand its electric vehicles business globally over the next few years, following the launch of its premium SU7 Ultra.

ByClem Chambers,

Senior Contributor.

You know I'm a bitcoin bear, so you know which of the following trajectories I think is coming. I have no material position, so I'm not “talking my book,” unless you feel that having negligible skin in the game is a position in its own right.

Bitcoin is for flight, but it would seem that Venezuelans no longer need to consider a fast exit, and the Iranian troubles that might shatter the regime appear to have come to a bloody ending – for now. So who is on the horizon that might need to consider going on the lam? To me, the answer is no one obvious, which in turn means bitcoin price weakness in my model given its role as the key driver of crypto prices.

So these are the two main scenarios:

On balance, there is more downside than upside, even if you are neutral. Of course, you have to believe in voodoo charts – but as someone who has been rewarded heavily for being a disciple, I take it as foundational.

However, the upside is certainly helped by the entropy coming out of the U.S., though the next leg of that seems to be Europe-focused, which would not elevate bitcoin.

Meanwhile, the focus of financial-market meme-chasing appears to have shifted from bitcoin to gold. Simply put, the FOMO mindset that has driven crypto for so long has landed in the precious metals arena. This is certainly a drain on bitcoin and will continue for an extended period, as gold is likely to remain exciting for a long time ahead.

The moon crew and their bags are now ogling instant “generational wealth” through a precious-metal lens, which is great for precious-metal stackers but not so great for the diamond-hand HODLers of bitcoin.

Meanwhile, the main risk in the markets is that the current U.S. geopolitical chaos will hole stock markets below the waterline. The equity haven for this is precious-metal proxies, but the mainstream won't be able to hide so easily in crypto if the Magnificent Seven get damaged by a rupture in the Western consensus.

However, all this guessing will be pre-empted by the price action in bitcoin and gold, because those closest to the reality of what's coming next will move prices long before they move headlines. I see metals up, crypto down.

So we draw our own lines in the sand and wait.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Nasdaq is moving to scrap position limits on Bitcoin and Ether ETF options, aiming to treat crypto funds like other commodity-based ETFs.

Nasdaq has filed a rule change with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeking to remove position and exercise limits on options tied to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, a move that would further integrate crypto-linked products into traditional derivatives markets.

The proposal, originally filed on Jan. 7 and made effective this week on the 21st, eliminates the current 25,000-contract cap on options linked to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed on Nasdaq. 

Affected products include funds from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, ARK/21Shares and VanEck, according to the filing.

The SEC waived its standard 30-day waiting period, allowing the rule change to take effect immediately, while retaining the authority to suspend it within 60 days if further review is deemed necessary. 

A public comment period is now open, with a final SEC determination expected by late February unless the rule is paused.

Nasdaq argued that lifting the limits would allow crypto ETF options to be treated “in the same manner as all other options that qualify for listing,” eliminating what it described as unequal treatment without undermining investor protections. 

The exchange said the change would support market efficiency while maintaining safeguards against manipulation and excessive risk.

Options are derivative contracts that give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price before a set expiration date. Position and exercise limits are typically imposed to prevent concentrated positions that could amplify volatility or destabilize markets.

The filing builds on Nasdaq's approval in late 2025 to list options on single-asset crypto ETFs as commodity-based trusts. While that decision allowed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF options to trade on the exchange, existing position limits remained in place.

Nasdaq has steadily expanded its involvement in crypto markets in recent years. 

In November, the exchange filed a separate proposal to raise position limits on options tied to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to as much as one million contracts, citing growing institutional demand and increased use of options for hedging strategies.

The exchange has also pushed into crypto indexing and tokenization. In January, Nasdaq and CME Group announced plans to unify their crypto benchmarks under the Nasdaq-CME Crypto Index, which tracks major digital assets including Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, Cardano and Avalanche.

If approved permanently, the latest rule change would mark another step toward normalizing Bitcoin derivatives within U.S. regulated markets, further blurring the line between traditional financial instruments and crypto-native assets.

Some fear massive consequences for financial markets.

When the biggest and ""safest"" investments in the world start to get questioned, it's necessary to take a hard look at what the idea of ""safety"" actually means.

On that note, if major foreign holders in the European Union reduce their exposure to U.S. Treasuries as a result of the Trump administration's constant barrage of controversial actions at home and abroad, Bitcoin (BTC +1.39%) could well end up in the conversation as an alternative store of value. But the coin's recent track record suggests a far less flattering first reaction is also probable, so let's examine what's most likely to happen if a real Treasury sell-off ends up playing out.

Image source: Getty Images.

Before we get into Bitcoin specifically, we'll first need to set the stage. U.S. Treasuries are the bonds issued by the U.S. government, and they anchor pricing across global finance. The Treasury market is among the largest in the world, with nearly $30 trillion in marketable debt outstanding, and policymakers, as well as central bankers, watch its liquidity closely because disruptions can and do ripple into other markets.

Foreign investors hold about $9.4 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities in total. That puts foreign holdings at roughly 31% of that marketable stock.

If foreign selling ever accelerates due to irritation with the U.S., or a lack of confidence in its economy or its leadership, all of which are risks that are currently in play, the near-term impact is usually that the stock and crypto markets pivot to being risk-off, meaning that investors pull capital from higher-risk assets and reallocate their capital to safer ones as quickly as they are able. So let's take a look at what that would do to Bitcoin.

If there's a genuine Treasury sell-off, the bullish scenario is that some investors will want an asset outside any one country's control, and Bitcoin becomes a beneficiary of that preference. In theory, that would channel capital away from fiat currencies like the dollar. The channeling process could take quite a while, though.

The bearish scenario is far worse. Bitcoin's correlation with the U.S. stock market can and does spike sharply from time to time, especially in times of crisis. Thus, the most likely immediate outcome of a true U.S. Treasury sell-off is that Bitcoin would drop sharply, and take a long period to recover.

Over an even longer horizon, perhaps on the order of a couple of years, Bitcoin could still benefit massively if global diversification away from the U.S. dollar continues. So in closing, take this risk seriously. If it happens, it won't be pretty, but those who buy the blood, as I plan to do, will probably be better off for it eventually.

Bitcoin is hovering near a crucial technical level, raising the risk of a deeper pullback if support fails, according to market analyst Gareth Soloway, chief strategist at Verified Investing.

Soloway said that while he has remained broadly bullish on Bitcoin in recent months, current price action shows the market sitting at a make-or-break zone. Bitcoin briefly slipped below a trend line earlier this week before moving back above it, a development he described as encouraging but far from decisive.

“The bigger pattern still matters,” Soloway said, noting that the recent short-term uptrend sits inside a larger bearish formation. “If Bitcoin confirms a break below this level, the downside risk opens up quickly.”

According to Soloway's analysis, a confirmed breakdown could push Bitcoin into a lower support range between $74,000 and $69,000. He pointed to multiple historical price pivots in that area, suggesting it would act as the next major zone where buyers may step in.

At the same time, he stressed that a breakdown has not yet been confirmed. If Bitcoin manages to hold the current trend line and rally higher, the bearish setup could fail. A move back above the upper boundary of the current price channel would invalidate what he described as a classic “bear flag” pattern and restore bullish momentum.

Ethereum is showing a similar technical picture, Soloway said. The token is trading near a short-term support line that has held multiple times in recent weeks. A confirmed break below this level, he warned, could send Ethereum toward its next major support near $2,100.

“If that level gives way, the downside could accelerate,” Soloway said. On the upside, any rebound would likely face resistance along a descending trend line that has capped recent rallies.

XRP has been more volatile, after a short-term breakout earlier this month was followed by a sharp pullback. Soloway said the focus now is on a clearly defined support zone between roughly $1.77 and $1.61.

“As long as that zone holds, bulls still have a case,” he said. However, a decisive break below that range could expose XRP to much steeper losses, with little meaningful support until much lower levels. On the upside, Soloway identified $2.20 as the first major resistance area traders should watch.

“I don't care about being bullish or bearish,” he said. “The charts tell us where the odds are, and right now, several major crypto assets are sitting at levels that demand close attention.”

Oops, something went wrong

Swiss banking giant UBS Group AG will open up crypto investing to some of its private banking clients, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg. 

Moves by UBS tend to align with the interests and demand from some of the world's wealthiest banking clients, because the bank is the world's largest wealth manager. It oversaw roughly $4.7 trillion worth of assets as of September for high net-worth and ultra-high net-worth clients.

The core business focuses on private banking and advisory services for wealthy individuals and their families, rather than mass retail banking.

UBS's clout grew significantly in 2023 when Swiss authorities forced the bank to merge with Credit Suisse after years of scandals had eroded confidence in the 167-year-old lender. In 2021, Credit Suisse experienced two big failures: A $5.5 billion loss after the Archegos Capital family office imploded, and a $10 billion loss when Greensill Capital supply-chain financing was frozen.

When the rushed deal was done, UBS saw its assets under management jump by roughly $1.5 trillion almost overnight.

The unnamed sources said the bank is still working on the final decision on how to roll out crypto access for clients. When it does roll out, the source said, crypto trading would be available to select clients in Switzerland to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum. After that, it might then be rolled out to the Asia-Pacific region.

The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading for $90,132 after having fallen nearly 5% in the past week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. And Ethereum has dipped to $2,967 after having sunk 10% since last week.

Switzerland has become one of Europe's more accommodating jurisdictions for crypto businesses. In November, the Swiss National Bank quietly increased its Bitcoin exposure.

And some U.S. firms saw Switzerland as a safe haven after two crypto-friendly U.S. banks were shut down in 2022—Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank. Swiss banks told Reuters at the time that there had been an uptick in inbound requests from U.S. companies looking abroad for banking partners.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

An address poisoning scam is one in which bad actors send small amounts of crypto from wallet addresses that are similar to those frequently used by the victim, in hopes that the victim will accidently send funds to the scammer's address in future transactions, according to the report.

Trends on ethereum that suggest that such a campaign may be underway include a record-breaking surge in transactions and active addresses at a time when bitcoin activity has been trending lower, a large share of the transactions being worth less than $1, and low transaction fees that make it inexpensive for attackers to send out their small payments, per the report.

“This transaction trend is often associated with ‘address poisoning' scam campaigns,” the Citi analysts said, per the report.

Blockchain data firm TRM Labs said in July 2024 that an attack in May 2024 at the Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin, which led to the theft of coins valued at upwards of $300 million, may have involved an address poisoning scam.

“While the exact cause of the attack remains unknown, potential vectors include stolen private keys or address poisoning — a tactic wherein attackers send tiny amounts of cryptocurrency to a victim's wallet to create fake transaction histories, potentially confusing users into sending funds to the wrong address in future transactions,” TRM Labs said at the time.

FBI Denver said in April 2024 that it had seen criminals creating cryptocurrency tokens that impersonate well-known tokens but have no value and using those impersonation tokens to send to victims as part of an address poisoning attack.

“Because of the way cryptocurrency wallet software truncates addresses, the first few alphanumeric characters and the last few alphanumeric characters might be identical to a familiar address; however, the middle alphanumeric characters in the address will be different,” the agency said in a press release. “Impersonation tokens increase the likelihood that address-poisoning attacks will work against both experienced and newer cryptocurrency users.”

Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and serves as the foundational infrastructure for decentralized applications, smart contracts, decentralized finance, and non-fungible tokens. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a store of value and settlement layer, Ethereum operates as a programmable blockchain that allows developers to build and deploy applications without centralized intermediaries. This utility driven design makes Ethereum both a technology platform and a financial asset, which often causes its price behavior to reflect a blend of macro risk sentiment and internal network developments.

From a macro perspective, Ethereum remains sensitive to global liquidity conditions, real interest rates, and overall risk appetite. Periods of easing financial conditions and expanding liquidity tend to support higher valuations across crypto assets, while tightening cycles often pressure speculative positioning. Recent sentiment has been mixed as markets balance expectations around central bank policy, regulatory clarity in the United States, and ongoing discussions around Ethereum scaling upgrades and network efficiency. Headlines related to spot ETF flows, regulatory enforcement actions, or significant protocol upgrades can quickly shift sentiment and short-term positioning.

Ethereum maintains a strong correlation to Bitcoin, particularly during broad risk on and risk off phases. Bitcoin often leads directional moves, with Ethereum following at a higher beta. However, Ethereum can outperform during periods when attention shifts toward smart contract platforms and decentralized finance growth. Relative to other large cap altcoins such as Solana and XRP, Ethereum is viewed as more institutionally established, though it can lag faster moving narratives tied to transaction speed or payments focused use cases.

• Market has been in a large multi-year sideways range between the 4000 and 2300 area since December 2024.

• In August 2025, the market was able to bid above daily level 1, which also marked the top of this range near 4000, and printed new all-time highs (ATHs).

• However, the market was unable to accept above the 4000 level and subsequently, rotated back toward the 3800 to 4000 zone where buyers and sellers engaged in a prolonged battle between 3750 (bid block 1 high) and 4250 (offer block 1 low), forming offer block 2 in October 2025

• Buyers attempted to defend this region while sellers stepped down offers, eventually forcing long liquidation as price auctioned lower.

• In November 2025, buyers responded at the yearly VWAP, but sellers continued to apply pressure and prices rotated further down toward bid block 1, where buyers once again stepped in.

• Since November 2025, the market has balanced in a two-way auction between 3500 (daily level 2), and 2700 (daily level 3), with sellers defending at offer block 2 and buyers defending at bid block 1.

• Since the start of 2026, price has tested lower, crossed above the yearly VWAP to print new highs, and has since rotated back to chop around VWAP. The flatness of VWAP suggests indecision and ongoing balance.

Key levels to watch remain the top and bottom of the current balance range at 3500 and 2750, corresponding to daily levels 2 and 3.

• Without volume and velocity at the edges of 3500 and 2750, expect continued two-way balanced auction within the range.

• Price is likely to rotate around range mid and VWAP as both buyers and sellers remain responsive rather than initiative.

• Flat VWAP would continue to signal market indecision and acceptance of current value.

• A test of 3500 accompanied by increasing volume and pace would increase the probability of a breakout attempt.

• Acceptance above 3500 could open a move toward 3800 and potentially extend to the 4100 area.

• Responsive sellers are expected at offer block 2, which may slow or cap upside momentum.

• If sellers begin holding below range mid and VWAP, it would suggest that downside control is developing.

• An approach toward 2750 with expanding volume and speed on the tape would increase the likelihood of a breakdown.

• A failure at daily level 3 could result in price auctioning lower toward the 2250 area (daily level 4).

• Buyers are expected to respond at bid block 1, potentially leading to another period of balance.

Ethereum remains technically balanced while macro forces continue to dictate broader risk sentiment. Flat VWAP and sustained two-way trade suggest the market is waiting for a catalyst, whether from liquidity conditions, regulatory clarity, or renewed institutional flows. A decisive move beyond the current range will likely require both technical acceptance and supportive macro alignment, making patience and level awareness critical in the weeks ahead.

As the crypto market faces uncertainty and continues in a consolidation phase, market expert Sam Daodu has issued a report examining the potential for XRP, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) to emerge as frontrunners if a new altcoin season arises in 2026. 

XRP, ETH, And SOL Price Forecasts

Daodu began his analysis by pointing out that Bitcoin's (BTC) dominance is currently hovering around 59%, alongside an Altcoin Season Index reading of 55. These indicators suggest that 2026 could herald a substantial rotation towards altcoins, mirroring significant shifts experienced during cycles in 2016-2017 and 2020-2021.

The expert outlines several bullish scenarios for each. For XRP, he envisions a potential surge past the $6-$8 range if exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows maintain a monthly average exceeding $400 million and RippleNet continues to expand its influence in global banking. 

ETH, on the other hand, could see itself climbing toward $12,000-$18,000 if Layer 2 (L2) adoption unlocks broader usage and ETF inflows rebound. 

Daodu highlights that active addresses are at cycle highs, indicating organic demand that may translate to higher prices once institutional sentiment shifts positively.

For SOL, the outlook is similarly optimistic. Solana might rocket to the range of $500-$800 if its transaction finality of 150 milliseconds and low fees attract a new wave of applications. Additionally, the rise in ETF filings could lead to significant capital inflows.

Potential Risks Ahead 

In more stable scenarios, Daodu suggests that XRP might consolidate between $2.50-$3.50 if institutional adoption progresses steadily without dramatic catalysts. 

He also speculates that Ethereum could trade within the range of $5,000-$9,000, benefiting from consistent demand driven by staking yields and decentralized finance (DeFi) growth.

Meanwhile, Solana might trend between $200-$350, assuming that developer growth and retail adoption continue at their current pace without major breakthroughs. 

However, Daodu cautions that XRP could fall below $1.50 if demand for ETFs wanes or if regulatory uncertainties arise. Similarly, ETH could fall below $2,500 if scalability issues arise or if regulatory challenges become more pronounced. SOL could drop below $100 if outages persist or if it faces increased competition from other Layer 1 platforms.

What AI Models Anticipate

AI predictions provide additional insight into the expected performance of these altcoins. For XRP, forecasts vary significantly, with ChatGPT estimating a range of $0.80-$3.00, while Grok presents a more bullish outlook with a target of $1.50-$6.00. 

Ethereum's AI predictions show a range of $3,000-$9,000 from ChatGPT, while Gemini anticipates a high of $7,000-$18,000 through increased tokenization. 

Lastly, Solana's predictions range from $120-$350 from ChatGPT to a more optimistic $300-$800 from Gemini, depending on the growth of consumer applications.

XRP was trading at $1.93 at the time of writing, down 2% in the previous 24 hours. ETH traded at roughly $2,952, while SOL traded at $128, both experiencing comparable declines during the same time period.

The final weekend of the month is expected to be relatively calm as geopolitical tensions ease. With concerns surrounding Greenland subsiding, crypto markets may regain stability and find clearer direction.

BeInCrypto has analyzed three altcoins that appear positioned for a potentially positive weekend ahead.

XTZ enters the weekend with a major catalyst ahead as the Tallinn upgrade goes live. The update aims to enhance network efficiency, speed, and security. Protocol upgrades often influence short-term price action, making Tezos a closely watched asset as traders position for potential volatility.

Technical indicators support the possibility of a breakout. Bollinger Bands are converging, signaling compressed volatility. If expansion coincides with the Tallinn upgrade, the XTZ price could push above $0.59 and $0.62. A successful breakout may drive Tezos toward the $0.66 resistance level.

The bullish scenario depends on market reaction. If traders fail to respond positively, the price may remain range-bound. Under that outcome, XTZ would likely continue consolidating between $0.55 and $0.62, reflecting neutral sentiment despite the protocol upgrade.

SKR delivered a strong performance this week, surging 335% after launch and setting a new all-time high at $0.0597. The rapid rally attracted speculative interest before profit-taking emerged. Early momentum positioned SKR as a high-volatility asset, drawing active participation from short-term traders.

After the peak, SKR corrected 23.6% and now trades near $0.0390, holding above the $0.0385 support. Selling transactions currently outweigh buying activity. If this imbalance persists into the weekend, downside pressure could intensify, sending SKR toward the next major support level near $0.0205.

A reversal remains possible if sentiment shifts. Renewed buying interest could stabilize price action and trigger a rebound. Reclaiming $0.0517 would mark a decisive move, opening the door for SKR to retest the previous high and potentially establish a new all-time high.

CC is among the few altcoins showing bullish momentum heading into the weekend. The Money Flow Index indicates strengthening buying pressure, signaling rising investor interest. This accumulation phase suggests CC may sustain upward movement as market conditions stabilize and traders rotate into assets showing relative strength.

CC trades near $0.142 at the time of writing, just below the $0.148 resistance level. A successful breakout could push the price toward $0.164. Such a move would place CC closer to its $0.177 all-time high, which remains about 24% above current levels.

The bullish outlook depends on clearing resistance. Failure to breach $0.148 could trigger renewed selling pressure. Under that scenario, CC price may retreat toward the $0.133 support level, invalidating the bullish thesis and postponing any attempt to approach the all-time high.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum, the smart contract blockchain, now handles more daily activity than its cheaper side chains, called Layer -2 networks. But this comeback has a catch – not all of that Ethereum activity appears to reflect genuine user demand.

The number of daily active addresses on Ethereum climbed toward the 1 million mark earlier this month, briefly peaking above 1.3 million on Jan. 16 before settling closer to 950,000, according to data source Token Terminal.

That puts Ethereum ahead of popular scaling networks such as Arbitrum, Base and OP Mainnet, reversing much of the narrative that users had permanently migrated off L1.

Active addresses are the unique blockchain wallets that make transactions, like sending, receiving cryptocurrencies, or interacting with smart contracts, in a given time period, let's say daily. Analysts track the metric to study the real network usage beyond the token price hype.

Layer 2 scaling networks are like side roads or express lanes built on top of the main blockchain highway, Ethereum. These sidechains handle tons of transaction traffic quickly and cheaply off the main chain, and then communicate the final tally back to the main chain for security.

The rebound in Ethereum activity follows December's Fusaka upgrade, which sharply reduced transaction fees and made it cheaper to transact directly on Ethereum again. Lower costs have helped revive on-chain activity, particularly for stablecoins, which remain the dominant use case for day-to-day transfers.

At face value, the numbers suggest a “return to mainnet” moment. But analysts caution that raw address counts can be misleading, especially when fees fall far enough to make spam economical.

Imagine spam calls flooding your phone. your call log looks busy, but most are junk, not real conversations. Something similar has been happening on Ethereum, as a significant portion of January's address growth is tied to address poisoning attacks rather than organic adoption.

Security researcher Andrey Sergeenkov said in a post earlier this week that the spike aligns closely with a rise in dusting activity, where attackers send tiny stablecoin transfers to millions of wallets.

Address poisoning works by exploiting human behavior. Attackers generate wallet addresses that closely resemble a victim's real address, often matching the first and last characters.

They then send small “dust” transfers, usually under $1, so the fake address appears in the victim's transaction history. When the victim later copies an address from that history instead of a trusted source, funds are mistakenly sent to the attacker.

Sergeenkov's analysis found that the number of new Ethereum addresses jumped to roughly 2.7 million during the peak week of Jan. 12, about 170% above normal levels. Around two-thirds of those addresses received dust as their first stablecoin transaction, a strong signal of poisoning activity rather than real onboarding.

The attack has already resulted in more than $740,000 in confirmed losses, with most of the stolen funds coming from a small number of victims. Lower fees following Fusaka appear to have made these campaigns viable, allowing attackers to spray transactions at scale with limited upfront cost.

The takeaway is not that Ethereum usage is fake, but that headline metrics need context.

Lower fees have clearly brought activity back to mainnet, especially for stablecoins. At the same time, cheap transactions also enable abuse, inflating address counts and transaction volumes.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is steadily turning the idea of a fully connected world into reality. Billions of physical devices, from tiny sensors to self-driving vehicles and industrial machines, now collect and exchange data online. Keeping that information secure and unchanged is critical, which is why engineers are increasingly exploring blockchain technology. Although blockchain is best known for powering cryptocurrencies, its core function is much broader. It acts as a decentralized digital ledger where data is shared and maintained across many computers rather than controlled by a single organization.

Despite its security advantages, most blockchain systems operate too slowly for many real-world IoT applications. Smart devices often need to respond in fractions of a second, but current blockchain networks cannot always keep pace. Researchers have found that the main source of these delays is not the blockchain software itself. Instead, the problem lies in how devices communicate within peer-to-peer networks. In particular, earlier studies have largely overlooked how the overall structure of these connections, known as network topology, affects performance in IoT blockchain systems.

Studying Network Design to Reduce Delays

To tackle this issue, a research team led by Associate Professor Kien Nguyen from the Institute for Advanced Academic Research/Graduate School of Informatics, Chiba University, Japan, examined ways to improve efficiency in IoT blockchain networks. Their findings were published in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management on December 17, 2025. The study analyzes how different network topologies influence speed and introduces a new technique designed to keep data flowing smoothly. ""We aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical design and practical deployment of IoT-blockchain systems by identifying the fundamental causes of their high latency and proposing a decentralized solution that is both simple and effective,"" says Dr. Nguyen. The research was co-authored by Koki Koshikawa, Yue Su, and Hiroo Sekiya, all from Chiba University.

To pinpoint the cause of slowdowns, the team created simulations with blockchain clients connected using a variety of network structures. Their analysis revealed that decentralized IoT networks frequently transmit the same data multiple times. Current methods for sharing transactions (the individual data entries) and blocks (the larger collections of verified records) can lead to an explosive increase in duplicate copies. As these duplicates spread through overlapping communication paths, networks become congested and data begins to queue, significantly increasing delays.

Dual Perigee Lets Networks Organize Themselves

To solve this problem, the researchers developed a decentralized and lightweight algorithm called ""Dual Perigee."" This method allows each device in the network to make smarter decisions about which neighboring devices it connects to. Rather than relying on random connections, a device using Dual Perigee evaluates its peers based on how quickly they deliver transactions and full blocks. Consistently slow connections are dropped and replaced with better-performing ones. Over time, the network naturally reshapes itself into a faster configuration, all without relying on a central authority.

When tested in a simulated 50-node IoT environment, Dual Perigee reduced block-related delays by 48.54% compared to the standard method used by the Ethereum blockchain. It also exceeded the performance of advanced approaches, including the original Perigee algorithm, by more than 23%. Importantly, these improvements did not increase the workload on IoT devices. The algorithm depends on passive measurements of data already being received and requires only minimal processing.

Enabling Real-Time and Mission-Critical Systems

The implications of this work extend across many technology sectors. Faster data confirmation and sharing allow blockchain systems to support applications where timing is critical. ""The proposed decentralized latency-aware peer-selection mechanism can serve as a foundation for future blockchain platforms that support real-time, mission-critical IoT services, ultimately enabling more secure, responsive, and trustworthy digital infrastructures,"" explains Dr. Nguyen.

Preparing for the Next Generation of IoT

As IoT networks continue to expand and grow more complex, the demand for decentralized and reliable communication methods will increase. The researchers believe Dual Perigee could play an important role in upcoming technologies. ""Our approach can be applied to emerging IoT-based services that require fast and reliable data sharing, such as smart cities, smart homes, industrial monitoring, healthcare systems, and supply-chain tracking,"" says Dr. Nguyen.

This research was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) (Grant Number: 23H03377) and partially by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) through the establishment of university fellowships towards the creation of science and technology innovation (Grant Number: JPMJFS2107).

Insider Brief

Coinbase is moving early to confront  the rise of large-scale quantum computers, a risk that still sits years away but could upend the foundations of blockchain security.

The crypto exchange said in a company blog post that it is forming an independent advisory board to assess how advances in quantum computing could affect blockchains and to provide guidance to developers, users and institutions long before the technology becomes practical. The move reflects growing concern that the cryptographic systems protecting today's digital assets may not remain secure indefinitely.

Coinbase said the new Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain will bring together leading researchers in quantum science, cryptography and distributed systems to evaluate risks, publish position papers, and respond to major scientific developments as they occur. The company framed the effort as part of a long-term security strategy rather than a reaction to any immediate threat.

If they can be built at sufficient scale and reliability, quantum computers are expected to solve certain mathematical problems far faster than classical machines. Those capabilities could have wide effects across industries such as finance, healthcare, materials science and national security. For blockchain systems, the concern is that many of these systems rely on cryptographic techniques that could eventually be weakened or cracked by quantum algorithms.

Most major blockchains today use elliptic-curve cryptography to secure wallets and verify transactions. According to Coinbase, these systems remain secure against current computers, but a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could one day undermine them. Preparing for that possibility requires years of advance planning, new cryptographic standards, and coordination across the industry, the company said in the post.

The advisory board is intended to operate independently and to provide public-facing analysis rather than internal advice alone. Coinbase said the group will publish assessments of the state of quantum computing, issue recommendations for developers and organizations, and provide timely guidance following major breakthroughs in the field.

The board includes researchers whose work spans quantum theory, applied cryptography, and blockchain security. Members include Scott Aaronson, a leading theorist in quantum computing; Dan Boneh, a specialist in modern cryptography and blockchain research; and Justin Drake, who focuses on the long-term security of blockchain networks.

Other members include Sreeram Kannan, founder of EigenLayer; Yehuda Lindell, who leads cryptographic research at Coinbase; and Dahlia Malkhi, an expert in resilient distributed systems.

Coinbase said a key role of the group is to provide independent insight rather than promotional endorsement. The board's work will be made public and aimed at the broader blockchain ecosystem, not just Coinbase products.

The first output from the advisory board is expected in the coming months, when it plans to release a position paper establishing a baseline assessment of quantum risk and outlining early steps toward resilience. That paper is intended to serve as a reference point for developers and organizations that are beginning to think about post-quantum security, according to the post.

The advisory board is one part of what Coinbase described as a broader post-quantum roadmap. Some measures are already being implemented. These include updates to how Bitcoin addresses are handled and changes to internal key management systems to align with what the company described as the strongest protections available today.

At a research level, Coinbase said it is working to support post-quantum cryptographic schemes within secure multiparty computation systems. These approaches aim to distribute cryptographic trust across multiple parties, reducing the risk that a single compromised key could expose assets. One example cited by the company is ML-DSA, a type of digital signature scheme designed to remain secure even against quantum attacks.

The company also highlighted the importance of independent oversight as quantum computing research accelerates. Rather than waiting for standards bodies or regulators to mandate changes, Coinbase said it wants to help shape industry understanding of the issue early, when there is still time to migrate systems gradually.

Key Takeaways

Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency that began as a meme and has since evolved into a broader blockchain ecosystem.

The SHIB token runs on Ethereum and can be used for trading, payments, and community projects.

Shiba Inu has an active and strong global community that drives much of its growth.

Investing in Shiba Inu carries significant risk due to price volatility and market hype.

Long-term success depends on real use cases, adoption, and continued development. 

What Shiba Inu is about is understanding its role as a community-driven cryptocurrency and why it continues to remain a frequent topic in crypto conversations. You've probably seen SHIB mentioned alongside online hype or stories of early buyers who turned small amounts into fortunes. Shiba Inu has grown from a simple meme idea into a full crypto project with its own ecosystem and one of the largest communities in the crypto space. 

If you're thinking about buying SHIB, this guide walks you through how Shiba Inu works, its uses, the risks involved, and what the future holds for investors like you. 



Shiba Inu is a digital currency that launched in August 2020. It was inspired by Dogecoin (DOGE) and named after the Shiba Inu Japanese dog breed. While Dogecoin runs on its own blockchain, Shiba Inu is built on the Ethereum network, which allows it to work with many existing crypto apps and tools. 

The main token is called SHIB. Many people call it the Shiba Inu coin, even though it's the token. SHIB was created with a very large supply (1 quadrillion tokens), which explains why its price per token is very low. 

In its early days, Shiba Inu was mostly seen as just a meme coin. Over time, that perception began to change. A fast-growing user base, a strong social media presence, and an active community have made it stand out among the top meme tokens with real utility plans. 

Today, Shiba Inu has grown into a broader ecosystem with multiple tokens, platforms, and community-led projects. This shift has helped SHIB move from internet humor toward real-world use and long-term relevance.

Shiba Inu operates on the Ethereum blockchain, which acts as a digital ledger that records and verifies transactions. As an Ethereum-based token, SHIB follows the same standards as other ERC-20 tokens and is stored in crypto wallets that support Ethereum assets.

When you send or receive SHIB, the transaction is processed and recorded on the Ethereum network. This provides security and reliability, as Ethereum is one of the most widely used and tested blockchains.

Unlike Bitcoin, you can't mine Shiba Inu, you can only buy, sell, or hold. Most people choose to buy SHIB safely on major exchanges before trading it on crypto exchanges, where prices are driven by supply and demand.

In short, Shiba Inu works like other Ethereum tokens. It allows users to trade, hold, and participate in a broader, community-driven ecosystem.  

Shiba Inu has grown into a full ecosystem with several key parts:

There are multiple use cases of the Shiba Inu token across its ecosystem:



Shiba Inu and Dogecoin started as meme-inspired tokens, but they've grown in very different ways. 

Here's how they stack up:

Like many cryptocurrencies, SHIB offers opportunity alongside uncertainty. Knowing these risks can help you set realistic expectations and make more informed investment decisions: 

Shiba Inu prices change very quickly. It can rise fast and fall just as fast. This makes it risky for people who cannot handle sudden losses. Even short-term events, like social media trends or celebrity mentions, can trigger big swings in price.

Some critics argue that SHIB still relies too much on hype. If real use, like payments, NFTs, or DeFi activity, does not grow, long-term value could suffer. Without broader adoption, the token's appeal may remain mostly speculative.

The low price per SHIB token, often just a fraction of a cent, can be misleading. Owning millions or even billions of SHIB does not automatically mean high value. Market capitalization and overall demand matter far more than the number of tokens in your wallet.



It's very unlikely that the Shiba Inu coin will reach $1 in 2030. In 2026, SHIB trades at around $0.00000807. To reach $1, the price would need to increase by more than 120,000 times. That would require a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 940% every year for the next five years, which is an extremely high bar for any asset.

There are also about 590 trillion SHIB tokens in circulation. At $1 per token, that would put Shiba Inu's total value in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. That figure is far beyond what any cryptocurrency has ever reached and much larger than the world's biggest economies. For comparison, the U.S. economy, the largest globally, recorded about $30 trillion in GDP in 2025. 

Several developments are shaping what lies ahead for Shiba Inu:

While burns and upgrades could tighten supply and strengthen the community, broader market conditions and adoption will ultimately determine its long-term trajectory.

Investing in Shiba Inu in 2026 comes with both opportunities and risks. You could see big gains, but sharp losses are possible too. SHIB has a strong community, a growing ecosystem, and wide recognition. At the same time, price swings and uncertainty about long-term value are real challenges. 

If you understand the risks and are comfortable with uncertainty, SHIB could be worth exploring. If you prefer steady, predictable returns, it may not be the right choice. Always do your research, invest only what you can afford to lose, and keep your expectations realistic. 

The purpose of the SHIB token is to power the Shiba Inu ecosystem. You can use it for trading, staking on ShibaSwap to earn rewards, or making payments in supported stores. SHIB also enables faster, cheaper transactions on Shibarium.

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin work differently. SHIB runs on Ethereum, giving it access to smart contracts, DeFi apps, and NFTs. Dogecoin runs on its own network and is mainly used as a digital currency. If you value ecosystem features and community projects, SHIB offers more options. For simplicity and long-term recognition, Dogecoin has the advantage.

It's extremely unlikely that SHIB will reach $0.01 given its current supply. With over 590 trillion tokens in circulation, reaching that price would require an unrealistic market value far bigger than the global economy. Even with burns and adoption, hitting $0.01 would require massive growth, which is highly improbable over the next few years.

The Shiba Inu coin is used in many ways. You can trade or hold it as an investment, stake it on ShibaSwap to earn rewards, use it for payments where accepted, buy and trade NFTs like Shiboshis, and interact with games and the Shibarium Layer-2 network.

Shiba Inu can be a high-risk, high-reward investment. Its value depends on community growth, ecosystem adoption, and market sentiment. It might appeal to investors comfortable with volatility who want exposure to other meme coins with real ecosystem features. It may not suit those looking for stable or predictable returns.

Anas is a crypto native journalist and SEO writer with over five years of writing experience covering blockchain, crypto, DeFi, and emerging tech.

US prosecutors have formally dropped their case against former OpenSea manager Nathaniel Chastain following an appeals court reversal that dismantled what was once positioned as the first NFT insider trading prosecution in American history.

According to sources, the Justice Department announced Wednesday it would enter a one-month deferred prosecution agreement before dismissing the indictment with prejudice.

The decision closes a chapter that began in June 2022 when Chastain was arrested and charged with wire fraud and money laundering for using confidential information to purchase NFTs before they were featured on OpenSea's homepage.

The case attracted widespread attention as prosecutors attempted to apply traditional financial crime statutes to emerging digital asset markets.

Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton, a former SEC chair, told the federal court that prosecutors would not retry the case given Chastain had already served three months in prison and agreed not to contest forfeiture of 15.98 ETH worth $47,330. 

“The interest of the United States will be best served by deferring prosecution of this matter and not retrying the case,” Clayton wrote in the court filing.

The collapse stems from a July 2024 appeals court decision that found the trial jury received flawed instructions. 

The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that jurors were improperly told they could convict Chastain based solely on unethical behavior rather than actual theft of property with commercial value. 

Judge Steven Menashi wrote last year August that the lower court erred by allowing conviction even if the information Chastain used lacked tangible value to OpenSea.

The appeals panel sharply criticized jury instructions that permitted conviction based on violations of “broad notions of honesty and fair play,” warning such standards could criminalize nearly any deceptive act. 

The court found the featured NFT data was not monetized by OpenSea and was not treated internally as a valuable asset, making it too “ethereal” to qualify as property under federal wire fraud statutes.

Chastain was convicted in May 2023 after prosecutors accused him of exploiting his role to buy dozens of NFTs shortly before they appeared on OpenSea's homepage between June and September 2021.

After tokens were featured and prices increased, he sold them at two- to five-times profit using anonymous wallets. The government alleged he made over $57,000 through the scheme.

US Attorney Damian Williams had described the case as a warning to digital asset markets when announcing charges. “NFTs might be new, but this type of criminal scheme is not,” Williams said. 

“As alleged, Nathaniel Chastain betrayed OpenSea by using its confidential business information to make money for himself.“

The conviction came after a week-long trial, with prosecutors charging wire fraud rather than securities fraud since NFTs have not been legally classified as securities. 

More than 300 defense attorneys had filed letters supporting dismissal, arguing that treating confidential business information as property would “criminalize a broad swath of conduct.“

The dropped prosecution aligns with a broader shift in federal crypto enforcement under the Trump administration. 

As reported by Cryptonews earlier today, a Cornerstone Research report found the SEC initiated just 13 crypto-related actions in 2025, down 60% from 33 in 2024 and the lowest level since 2017. 

The agency has dismissed multiple high-profile cases including those against Coinbase, Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland DRW.

The SEC also closed its investigation into OpenSea in February 2025 after issuing a Wells notice in August 2024 that alleged the platform functioned as an unregistered securities marketplace.

🌊 The SEC has officially ended its investigation into NFT marketplace @OpenSea, according to the company's founder, @dfinzer.#SEC #OpenSeahttps://t.co/OtOT6c3WMd

At that time, OpenSea founder Devin Finzer called the closure “a win for everyone who is creating and building in our space.“

For now, Chastain will not face supervision by US Pretrial Services and can seek return of the $50,000 fine and special assessment paid following his conviction.

Notably, the global NFT market cap currently stands at $2.56 billion, down 6.72% in the last 24 hours with total sales volume reaching $3.68 million, according to CoinGecko data.

The figure represents an 84.78% decline from the market's peak of $16.82 billion in April 2022, when digital collectibles were among the hottest assets in crypto and the Chastain case was first unfolding.

The US Department of Justice has formally closed its case against Nathaniel Chastain, the former OpenSea executive at the centre of the first insider trading prosecution involving non-fungible tokens. 

Prosecutors will not pursue a retrial after his conviction was overturned last year.

In a filing submitted to a Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, prosecutors said they had reached a one-month deferred prosecution agreement with Chastain. 

Once that ends, charges will be dismissed.

Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton, who also previously served as SEC Chair, noted in a letter to the court that the government's decision factored in Chastain's partial completion of his original sentence. 

The former OpenSea manager served three months in federal custody and had to forfeit 15.98 ETH, valued at roughly $47,000, which prosecutors claim represented the proceeds from his NFT trades. 

Chastain also agreed not to challenge that forfeiture.

According to Clayton, “the interest of the United States will be best served” by ending the prosecution at this stage, rather than seeking a retrial.

Chastain was initially convicted in May 2023 of wire fraud and money laundering after federal prosecutors accused him of using advance knowledge of which NFT collections would be spotlighted on OpenSea's homepage to purchase them in secret before flipping them for profit.

The jury found that Chastain used anonymous wallets and burner accounts to make at least 15 such trades between June and September 2021, earning around $57,000 from the scheme. He served his time later that year while preparing to appeal.

But in July 2025, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, siding with Chastain's defence team, which had long argued that the NFT placement data he accessed didn't meet the legal threshold for “property” under federal wire fraud statutes.

The appellate court ruled that the jury had been misdirected, effectively convicting Chastain for ethical lapses rather than for fraud tied to misappropriated property with clear commercial value to his employer. 

Judge Steven Menashi, who was overseeing the case, concluded at the time that deceptive behaviour alone does not constitute criminal fraud without a demonstrable property interest at stake.

Chastain was later released from court supervision and is now eligible to seek the return of the $50,000 fine and $200 special assessment he paid after his 2023 conviction.

At one point, prosecutors also looked into whether OpenSea itself might be on the hook for Chastain's conduct.

However, it later concluded that the company had acted swiftly to investigate the misconduct, requested Chastain's resignation, and cooperated with investigators throughout.

Since late 2024, the US regulatory agencies have steadily backed away from their most aggressive crypto cases, as they pivoted away from their regulation-by-enforcement approach under new leadership.

For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission ended its yearlong investigation into OpenSea last year, which had stemmed from the same events. 

The commission had issued a Wells Notice against OpenSea, alleging that OpenSea was offering NFTs as unregistered securities. However, after the change in agency leadership and priorities, the case was dropped.

January 23, 2026 8:41 am


The UK Information Commissioner's Office “softly, softly” approach has been exposed once more with a new report showing GDPR fines in the EU topped €1.2bn (£1bn) in 2025, and have now surpassed €7.1bn (£6.2bn) since the regulation came into force in May 2018, compared to just £65m in the UK.
According to the latest “GDPR Fines & Data Breach Survey” published by DLA Piper, from January 28 2025 to the present, Europe's data protection authorities received an average of 443 personal data breach notifications a day.
That is up 22% on the previous year, and marks the first time daily reports have pushed past 400 since the regulation came into force. Meanwhile, total fines have inched up from £996m in 2024.
The ICO's record is not quite so impressive: UK GDPR-specific fines reached just £1.1m in 2024, although last year saw a better performance, with penalties rising to £19.6m from seven major cases, including a notable October settlement involving Capita. Even so, most are being appealed.
The DLA Piper report blames EU geopolitics, repeated cyber incidents, and cheap attack tools, with regulatory overload sitting in the background. Organisations are now juggling GDPR alongside a growing set of incident reporting regimes under new laws such as NIS2 and DORA.
In terms of enforcement, Ireland once again dominates the league table, with fines issued by the Irish Data Protection Commission now reaching €4.04bn since GDPR came into force, accounting for well over half of all fines issued across Europe during that period. France and Luxembourg are next in line, but quite a way back, showing how much of GDPR enforcement is being driven by a handful of regulators.
The Irish DPC also handed down the biggest single penalty of 2025, a €530m fine against TikTok over unlawful international data transfers, although the current record, set two years earlier, remains the €1.2bn penalty against Meta. Tech giants remain the biggest miscreants, with the report noting that this sector accounts for nine of the ten largest GDPR fines so far.
DLA Piper UK data, privacy, and cybersecurity practice chair Ross McKean said that the numbers should be read as a warning, not just another set of stats. “Confirmation of such a significant increase in personal data breach notifications in black and white is, for me, the quieting canary
“Coupled with the slew of new cybersecurity laws impacting business, some of which impose personal liability on members of management bodies, our report underscores the urgency and need for organisations to optimise cyber defences and operational resilience.”

Despite a thaw in the regulatory and political climate surrounding digital assets, companies offering digital asset services to consumers still face substantial compliance obstacles. 

At the forefront of these challenges is the fragmented federal and state money transmission licensing regime that regulates inherently national businesses through a de facto 50-jurisdiction patchwork.

Many states have extended money transmission licensing regimes or adopted standalone virtual currency statutes to cover digital asset services. These laws are designed to protect consumers but, in practice, they produce a duplicative and often contradictory regulatory environment. 

Companies providing custody, stablecoin payments, or exchange services must navigate 50-state surveys and compliance reviews, and inconsistent statutory requirements. Furthermore, digital asset companies often combine functions that are traditionally separated in banking. The absence of a single federal prudential regime and federal preemption amplifies the complexity.

Two new federal pathways offer meaningful movement toward rationalization.

First, the GENIUS Act creates a federal licensing framework for payment stablecoin issuers. It also provides limited preemption of state money transmission laws for stablecoin issuance. Depending on GENIUS Act rulemaking, becoming a federally chartered payment stablecoin issuer could function as a national licensing “passport” for stablecoin issuance and related activities.

Second, fintech companies are increasingly pursuing national bank or national trust charters from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Federally chartered entities benefit from substantial federal preemption for activities within the scope of their authorized powers. For instance, the OCC concluded that, in appropriate circumstances, a national charter can preempt state money transmission licensing requirements. 

Although federal preemption under the National Bank Act is broad, it's activity- and fact-specific, and doesn't extend to state consumer financial laws more generally.

Both federal pathways promise streamlined supervision and regulatory consistency, but they come with significant tradeoffs. Chartered entities submit to bank-style supervision, capital and liquidity requirements, governance standards, multiple regulators, and ongoing examinations—costs that may place these options out of reach for smaller firms. 

Both pathways also carry some legal uncertainty, particularly regarding whether preemption would extend to state virtual currency-specific statutes.

The complexity of state regulation extends beyond just licensing.

At the federal level, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network requires money services businesses, which include many types of digital asset companies, to register and maintain Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering programs. But FinCEN's regime targets illicit finance, not consumer protection. States fill that gap through money transmission laws, each with its own definitions that capture varying subsets of virtual currency activity.

States' divergent rules create threshold uncertainty: The same business model may be regulated in one state, arguably regulated in another, and unregulated in a third. For fast-moving digital asset firms, this necessitates continual legal review and often results in products being launched only in certain states.

States' substantive obligations also vary. Permissible investment rules, net worth thresholds, and bonding requirements often diverge, sometimes forcing multi-state licensees to hold capital that exceeds any one state's minimum. Some states impose in-kind reserve mandates for virtual currency obligations, complicating treasury management. Others have adopted bespoke cybersecurity requirements. 

Critically, reserve requirements keyed to a company's nationwide customer base, rather than just in-state customers, can force multi-state licensees to structure their balance sheets around the most restrictive state in which the company is licensed, regardless of where most customers reside. 

Recognizing these inefficiencies, the Model Money Transmission Modernization Act was introduced to harmonize definitions and obligations. But adoption was uneven, modifications common, and treatment of digital asset activity inconsistent between states. Hence, the patchwork remains.

Federal preemption offers a potential escape for some firms, but its contours are unsettled.

Even if a GENIUS Act license or OCC charter preempts aspects of state money transmission licensing, it's unclear whether that preemption extends to virtual currency-specific laws, such as New York's BitLicense or California's Digital Financial Assets Law. These statutes regulate activities not traditionally associated with banking, including custody, validation, staking, and exchange services. 

States may argue that these activities fall outside the business of banking and aren't preempted. And GENIUS Act preemption, by its terms, applies only to payment stablecoin issuance; other activities would likely remain subject to state regimes absent separate federal authority.

Federal preemption under the National Bank Act also applies only to activities within a national bank's powers or incidental to those powers. If a chartered company's activities in part fall outside traditional banking functions, preemption may not apply.

The result is another murky patchwork: Federal preemption may apply in some contexts but not others, all subject to evolving statutes, rulemaking, and litigation. For firms that rarely operate in narrow silos, the compliance problem persists.

For companies unable to obtain federal licenses or charters, constitutional arguments may eventually come to the fore.

The Dormant Commerce Clause prohibits state regulation that discriminates against interstate commerce or imposes burdens clearly excessive relative to local benefits. Courts have invalidated laws that force businesses to comply with conflicting state requirements – precisely the dynamic created when, for instance, states impose unique capital or reserve requirements based on nationwide activity.

Courts generally have been deferential to state consumer protection laws, and Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine has narrowed, particularly after Nat'l Pork Producers Council v. Ross. A successful Dormant Commerce Clause argument would likely require a substantial extraterritorial burden. 

Nevertheless, challenges to state money transmission laws that impose nationwide capital or reserve requirements, rather than limiting obligations to in-state activity, remain plausible. Regimes that effectively regulate conduct outside a state's borders or force compliance with inconsistent mandates could present the kind of extraterritorial burden warranting invalidation. 

Digital assets challenge regulatory geography. The question isn't whether states have a legitimate interest in protecting residents, but whether a 50-state patchwork remains viable for inherently national firms. 

Absent state action, courts or Congress may ultimately resolve these tensions. For now, state lawmakers have a window to modernize and harmonize their regimes proactively.

LAS VEGAS (FOX5) — Las Vegas Valley businesses are accepting Bitcoin as payment as the cryptocurrency continues to grow in popularity, from restaurant chains like Steak and Shake to small businesses like a juice bar in the southwest valley.

At Cane Juice Bar and Cafe on Rainbow near Windmill, district manager Tyler Peterson serves fresh pressed sugar cane juice. It can be paid for with cash, card or Bitcoin.

“It's been about 8 months now that we've had Bitcoin implemented as a payment,” Peterson said. “Bitcoin is getting very popular with mainstream people, not just the people that are actually into things like cryptocurrencies… it's just something to help us move forward.”

Peterson said customers who normally wouldn't know about his shop come in specifically to use Bitcoin.

“Absolutely, yeah. I get calls all the time. People come in, they inquire and they ask me if we're accepting Bitcoin,” Peterson said. “So actually some customers we have generated off of accepting Bitcoin… That Bitcoin map is helping us out a lot.”

Jeremy Querci, a Bitcoin consultant with Sovreign, said businesses accepting Bitcoin range from medical practices to juice bars to children's play places. Querci explained paying with Bitcoin is simple and requires just a few taps on a phone.

“At the time of checkout, you say you want to pay in Bitcoin and the business can bring up a QR code that you scan with your phone with any Bitcoin app,” Querci said. 

“It's one of those things where it's going to get easier and easier to use. It's the future,” Peterson asserted. 

In November, Square enabled roughly 4 million merchants across the US to accept Bitcoin payments with zero processing fees through 2026. Businesses can avoid credit card processing fees, which average 2.5 to 3.5 percent, by using Bitcoin.

People can find businesses accepting Bitcoin through Bitcoin maps or through Cash App.

  January 23, 2026

SHENZHEN – China began paying interest on its digital renminbi from 2026, a move aimed at making the little-used currency more attractive to consumers in a market dominated by online payment giants WeChat Pay and Alipay.

By offering interest similar to demand-deposit rates at banks, Beijing is recasting the e-CNY, its name for digital renminbi, from a cash-like instrument into something closer to a deposit.

“The e-CNY has had broad trials but still hasn't generated regular users,” said Mr Winston Ma, an adjunct law professor at New York University. The overhaul signals that “China is taking much bolder steps to make it more mainstream”, he said.

Analysts say the move gives consumers and banks more reason to use the digital currency, but it remains unclear how far this will move the needle for a technology that has struggled to find a place in people's lives.

China has been piloting the e-CNY since 2019, becoming the first major economy to roll out a central bank digital currency. Trials began in cities such as Shenzhen and Suzhou, and have since expanded to most major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai.

To spur adoption in a digital payments market already dominated by WeChat Pay and Alipay, some local governments have given out e-CNY via lotteries or paid salaries with it.

But while its use has been growing, its reach remains a fraction that of the super-apps. The e-CNY's cumulative transaction volume reached 16.7 trillion yuan (S$3.1 trillion) by end-November 2025 – but WeChat Pay and Alipay are estimated to account for over 90 per cent of China's mobile payments market.

“Adoption has certainly been slower than we've expected,” said finance professor Charles Chang of Fudan University. For consumers largely used to paying with existing apps, “there is a big so-what factor”, he added.

The latest overhaul seeks to address some of these shortcomings.

E-CNY balances will earn interest aligned with demand-deposit rates, instead of sitting idle. Those rates are currently about 0.05 per cent, and are similar to what users of the super-apps would get if they pay out of their deposit accounts.

Banks also have more commercial incentive to push the e-CNY, now that they have the same legal status as deposits. This means they can bring e-CNY holdings onto their balance sheets and loan some of it out.

China's leaders view the national digital currency as an important project, writing that “the e-CNY should be steadily developed”, in policy suggestions released in October 2025 for the country's upcoming economic blueprint.

Domestically, one reason the e-CNY was first developed was for the control and visibility it would give Beijing over the flow of funds across the economy, said Mr Zennon Kapron, director of fintech consultancy GL Insight.

The technology allows the authorities to not only track where money is going, but also programme how it flows, he said.

That opens the door to more targeted consumption stimulus, for example, by placing conditions on how and where e-CNY handouts can be spent.

It also enables smart contracts, in which funds are automatically released once specificed conditions are met.

Internationally, China sees the e-CNY as a way to support wider global use of the renminbi as interest in digital currencies grows.

It is testing a cross-border payment platform, known as Project mBridge, with central banks in Hong Kong, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. In 2025, it also launched a “digital yuan international operation centre” in Shanghai to promote the internationalisation of the e-CNY.

Still, capital controls and limited yuan convertibility continue to constrain uptake abroad, analysts note.

China's renewed bid for e-CNY adoption comes amid rising global interest in stablecoins, another type of digital currency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset, such as the US dollar.

In July 2025, the US made a push for US-dollar backed stablecoins by signing into law a regulatory framework known as the GENIUS Act, seen to be aimed at entrenching dollar dominance in the digital economy.

China, by contrast, classifies stablecoins as cryptocurrencies, which are banned on the mainland.

On the ground, signs of a pick-up remain limited for now.

Two weeks after China rolled out its e-CNY upgrade, little had changed at a neighbourhood mall in Shenzhen, one of the first cities to pilot the digital currency. A Straits Times survey of 22 stores found that only three would accept payments via e-CNY.

“I've heard of it, but have never seen anyone use it,” said shop assistant Qiu Shui, 28, of the e-CNY. She added that her photo studio did not offer this payment option because no customer had asked for it, and that she, too, had not seen a reason to try it.

Analysts caution that while it is too early to judge the impact of the added interest feature, there are limits to how useful it may be.

The e-CNY is a good piece of technology, but it is “not solving any payment problem” given that WeChat Pay and Alipay already exist, said Dr Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

For overseas users, uptake will also hinge on whether businesses and consumers are willing to use more renminbi, observers note.

“Beyond digital innovation, progress also depends on other factors such as established habits, market inertia, and broader economic influence,” said Mr Andrew Fei, a partner at law firm King & Wood Mallesons in Hong Kong who advises companies on digital asset-related transactions.

The e-CNY is important to China's overall strategy for renminbi internationalisation, “although it is best viewed as a key component, rather than the whole solution”, he said.

Globally, countries are experimenting with different modes of digital money. While China is promoting its sovereign e-CNY, others like the US are leaning towards private-sector alternatives such as stablecoins.

“In 2026 and beyond, we will see this dichotomy in digital currency experiments,” said Mr Ma. “There's no clear winner yet.”

NATO x Greenland — Secretary General Mark Rutte's successful mediation at Davos has temporarily defused a major transatlantic tariff crisis.

Greenland ""Total Access"" Deal — A new NATO-brokered framework grants the US rights for mining and missile defense in Greenland, aimed at countering Russian and Chinese Arctic influence.

The ""Sell America"" Shift — Markets were earlier bracing for a potential reduction in the $27 trillion 'long USA' position over the current geopolitical tensions.

Apple's Wearable Response — Responding to OpenAI's hardware rumors, Apple reveals it is developing a dedicated screenless AI wearable to further integrate Siri.

Trump Sues JPMorgan for $5B — President Trump has filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and CEO Jamie Dimon, alleging ""political debanking"" and blacklisting following the events of Jan 6.

Tech Buzz Editorial

World leaders and financial giants gathered in Davos this week for the World Economic Forum to discuss the future of the global economy. The headlines focused on AI and trade with Iran and Trump's new Greenland-related EU tariffs threat and the ensuing conflict. However another key thread was Trump's pledge to ensure the US remains a global leader in the cryptocurrency space – as the crypto capital of the world. 

President Trump took the stage at Davos to deliver a clear message, pledging to ensure the United States remains the crypto capital of the world. In his speech, Trump mentioned that China is also fighting for this market which is forcing the U.S. to be more friendly toward Web3 developers. He added that Congress was accelerating work on legislation covering crypto market structure and Bitcoin.

“Now Congress is working very hard on crypto market structure, legislation, Bitcoin, all of them, which I hope to sign very soon, unlocking new pathways for Americans to reach financial freedom.”

The halls of Davos also saw a fierce debate between the old guard of finance and these new digital leaders. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong sparred with Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau over whether stablecoins should be allowed to pay interest. Armstrong argued that users have a right to earn a return on their own money and that banning rewards would push innovation to competitors like China.

Villeroy warned that private tokens paying interest pose a systemic risk. He believes they could trigger a ""deposit flight"" where people move their money out of traditional banks. This disagreement is at the heart of the current CLARITY Act negotiations. The banking industry sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a loophole to the GENIUS Act, while crypto firms like Coinbase have recently withdrawn support for the bill, calling it a ""bad bill"" that favors big banks.

Also, speaking of taking on legacy finance, president Trump yesterday sued, JPMorgan Chase and CEO Jamie Dimon, alleging ""political debanking"" and blacklisting following the events of January 6. It's clear the battle lines are being drawn for the control of the new economy. 

While politicians talked this week, the web 3 builders took action. Two of the biggest names in decentralized social media changed leadership this week. First, Lens Protocol was handed over to Mask Network to focus more on consumer products like the Firefly app. Then, in an even bigger move, Neynar acquired the Farcaster protocol and its AI tool, Clanker.

Neynar is the infrastructure giant that powers almost every app in the Farcaster ecosystem - a social media platform with in-built crypto trading functionality via Clanker and Base ecosystem. Neynar is taking over the code, the app, and the underlying protocol. This is a massive shift. Farcaster was recently valued at $1B, yet it only made about $2.8M in total revenue. Neynar brings a professional, business-first mindset to a social network that used to feel like a science experiment.

The acquisition carries implications beyond Farcaster itself. Farcaster's social layer is deeply integrated into Coinbase's Base app, which pivoted toward trading functionality in late 2025 after discovering wallet features outperformed social engagement. With Neynar now controlling both Farcaster's protocol and its developer infrastructure, the company becomes a critical dependency for Base's social stack.

The most interesting part of this transition is what it means for SocialFi. Clanker, the AI token launchpad that is now part of Neynar, is already a powerhouse. It ranks as the fourth-largest protocol on Base by weekly revenue, generating over $482,000 in weekly revenue on the Base network. Since October 2025, it has made over $50M in fees.Clanker ranks as the fourth-largest protocol on Base by weekly revenue, generating over $482,000 weekly through token deployment fees.

Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has been very vocal about this issue of late too. He recently stated he is going fully back to decentralized social media. He believes we need tools that help people find agreement rather than fighting in an endless info warzone. He wants an economy that supports high-quality creators without creating price bubbles around them.Meanwhile, in a related move Elon Musk's X officially banned InfoFi (Information Finance) applications from its platform. X Head of Product Nikita Bier announced that the company has revoked API access for any apps that reward users with crypto for posting or engaging. Likely this move is because X plans on launching its own rival system that is more vetted and less susceptible to scams.

Brand new data from CoinGecko shows that the total crypto market cap sits at $3T. Even though prices have been volatile, the infrastructure is expanding. Stablecoins grew by 48.9% this year, hitting a record $311B. These digital dollars are the fuel for apps like Lens and Farcaster. 

Earlier this week another historic event was the New York Stock Exchange moving to blockchain based trading, which fundamentally changes how the world's largest stock market works. By launching a venue for tokenized securities, the NYSE is ditching the old 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM schedule for an always on 24/7 model. The biggest deal here is instant settlement. Instead of waiting two days for a trade to clear, transactions happen in real time, freeing up billions in capital that used to be stuck in waiting periods. For investors, this means the ability to trade any stock at any hour and buy fractional shares using stablecoins, finally bringing the speed of the crypto world to Wall Street.While there may not be unanimous agreement on the nature of the rollout, it appears we are moving into a new phase in the rollout of the crypto-native economy and its integration into legacy markets. 

We are particularly interested in this issue as we have been closely watching and alerting readers to WYDE, a Clanker and Farcaster-based decentralized exchange and the first crypto 501(c)(4) nonprofit. WYDE is changing the charitable giving market through innovation in the form of cause coins, or “impact tokens” with the launch of its first flagship token $EAT End Hunger raising over 5000 meals for charity in under a month via trading fees and hit its all time high ($14.4M FDV).

The confession arrived on LinkedIn, of all places. Lichtenstein, 38, didn't sugarcoat his past. “Ten years ago, I decided that I would hack the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world,” he wrote. His startup was struggling financially. Stealing seemed easier than earning. It wasn't.

“This was a terrible idea. It was the worst thing I had ever done,” Lichtenstein admitted. “It upended my life, the lives of people close to me, and affected thousands of users of the exchange. I know I disappointed a lot of people who believed in me and grossly misused my talents.”

The numbers are staggering. In 2016, Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, executed a scheme that drained 120,000 bitcoins from Bitfinex. At today's prices, that haul exceeds $10 billion. The couple pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy in 2023, a year after federal agents arrested them at their Manhattan apartment.

Prison changed Lichtenstein's trajectory. He became an informant, helping the government recover the stolen cryptocurrency and consulting on additional crypto investigations. The experience surprised him.

“When I was a black hat hacker, I was isolated and paranoid,” he wrote. “Working with the good guys, being part of a team solving a bigger problem felt surprisingly good. I realized that I could use my technical skills to make a difference.”

His 60-month sentence took him through some of America's toughest federal facilities. To stay sharp, he devoured math textbooks in prison libraries. Earlier this month, authorities transferred him to home confinement.

Lichtenstein isn't the first convicted hacker to seek redemption through legitimate security work. Kevin Mitnick, once the FBI's most-wanted computer criminal, built a respected career as a penetration tester and security consultant after his release. He ran his own firm until his death in 2023.

The path forward won't be simple. Lichtenstein acknowledges as much.

“Now begins the real challenge of regaining the community's trust,” he wrote, making his pitch to potential employers. “I think like an adversary. I've been an adversary. Now I can use those same skills to stop the next billion-dollar hack.”

Whether the cybersecurity industry will embrace a reformed billion-dollar thief remains an open question. His technical credentials are undeniable. His ethics, less certain.

AI CEOs Transformed Davos: The Stunning Tech Takeover of the World Economic Forum

DAVOS, SWITZERLAND — January 23, 2026: The World Economic Forum's annual meeting underwent a dramatic transformation this year as artificial intelligence executives and conversations dominated the Alpine gathering, fundamentally reshaping what has traditionally been a forum for global economic and political dialogue. The shift was immediately visible along the Promenade, where technology companies replaced traditional financial institutions in prominent storefronts, signaling a profound change in both the event's atmosphere and substantive discussions. This year's Davos meeting saw AI topics consistently overshadow traditional WEF pillars including climate change mitigation, global poverty reduction, and geopolitical stability talks, marking what many observers describe as a pivotal moment in the forum's five-decade history.

The physical transformation of Davos began with prominent storefront takeovers by technology giants. Meta and Salesforce established highly visible installations along the main promenade, creating immersive experiences that drew constant crowds of attendees. Meanwhile, AI company executives occupied center stage in both formal sessions and informal networking events, fundamentally altering the conversation dynamics throughout the week. These leaders didn't merely participate in discussions—they actively shaped the agenda with public criticisms of international trade policies, warnings about potential AI investment bubbles, and bold predictions about the industry's trajectory.

Observers noted that the traditional balance between public and private sector voices shifted noticeably toward technology leadership. Where previous forums featured equal representation between government officials and corporate executives, this year's conversations frequently centered on how AI development should proceed rather than whether it should be regulated. The change reflected both the technology's rapid advancement and the substantial economic influence now concentrated in the hands of AI companies and their leadership teams.

Session topics at Davos 2026 revealed the depth of this transformation. While climate change and poverty reduction remained on the official agenda, attendance and engagement metrics showed significantly higher participation in AI-focused discussions. Panel sessions exploring artificial intelligence ethics, development frameworks, and economic impacts consistently reached maximum capacity, while some traditional development sessions saw reduced attendance. This substantive shift extended beyond session selection to include the nature of conversations themselves, with AI safety, alignment research, and computational governance emerging as dominant themes where macroeconomic policy once prevailed.

While AI executives transformed Davos discussions in Switzerland, parallel developments in Silicon Valley highlighted the industry's extraordinary momentum. AI startup Humans& secured a $480 million seed funding round despite having no commercial product on the market—a development that would have been unthinkable just three years earlier. The company's founding team includes former employees from Anthropic, Google, and xAI, lending credibility to their vision for “social intelligence” artificial intelligence systems. This funding round represents one of the largest seed investments in technology history and signals investor confidence in AI's long-term potential despite current market uncertainties.

The Humans& funding exemplifies a broader trend in AI investment patterns. Venture capital firms increasingly prioritize founding team credentials and technological vision over traditional metrics like revenue or user growth. This shift reflects both the extraordinary capital requirements of AI development and investor belief that early positioning in foundational AI technologies will yield substantial returns as the market matures. However, some Davos participants expressed concerns about this approach, noting that similar investment patterns preceded previous technology bubbles.

The transformation of Davos conversations carries significant implications for the global AI industry. First, the increased visibility of AI executives at traditionally policy-focused forums suggests growing recognition that technological development cannot be separated from broader societal considerations. Second, the substantial funding flowing to pre-product AI companies indicates investor belief that current development cycles justify unprecedented risk-taking. Third, the public nature of policy criticisms from AI leadership marks a departure from previous corporate approaches to regulation, suggesting more direct engagement with governance processes moving forward.

Several specific developments emerged from Davos discussions that will likely shape the industry throughout 2026:

Technology analysts observing the Davos transformation note several important considerations. First, the shift toward AI discussions reflects genuine technological progress rather than mere hype—foundational models have reached capabilities that justify serious policy attention. Second, the physical presence of technology companies along the Promenade represents strategic positioning for influence, not just marketing. Third, the substantial funding flowing to pre-revenue AI companies indicates investor belief that current development windows create unique opportunities for first-mover advantages in what may become defining technologies of the coming decade.

Industry observers also highlight potential risks associated with these developments. The concentration of both conversation and investment in artificial intelligence could divert attention from other critical global challenges. Additionally, the substantial funding for companies without products raises questions about investment discipline and potential market corrections. Finally, the increased corporate influence on policy discussions at traditionally multilateral forums may complicate efforts to establish balanced governance frameworks that consider diverse stakeholder perspectives.

The 2026 transformation continues a longer-term trend of increasing technology presence at the World Economic Forum. Technology companies first gained prominence at Davos during the late 1990s dot-com era, though their influence diminished following the 2000 market correction. A second wave emerged during the 2010s with the rise of social media and platform companies, though these firms typically participated within broader business delegations rather than as primary conversation drivers. The current AI-focused transformation represents a third and more substantial wave, with technology executives not just attending but actively shaping both formal and informal agendas.

This historical progression reveals important patterns about technology's integration into global economic discussions. Initially treated as a specialized sector, technology has gradually moved toward the center of economic thinking as its transformative potential has become increasingly apparent across industries. The 2026 emphasis on artificial intelligence specifically reflects recognition that AI represents not just another technological advancement but potentially a fundamental shift in economic production, labor markets, and innovation processes—topics that naturally align with the World Economic Forum's mission to address global challenges.

The 2026 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos demonstrated how thoroughly AI CEOs transformed the gathering from its traditional focus on macroeconomic policy and global challenges to a technology-forward conference centered on artificial intelligence's development and implications. This transformation manifested physically through storefront takeovers, substantively through conversation dominance, and financially through parallel Silicon Valley developments like the record Humans& funding round. While the long-term implications remain uncertain, the Davos shift clearly signals artificial intelligence's arrival as a primary concern for global economic leadership—a development that will likely influence investment patterns, regulatory approaches, and technological development throughout the coming year and beyond. The AI industry's growing influence at traditionally policy-focused forums suggests we have entered a new phase in technology's relationship with global governance, one where technical development and societal consideration increasingly intersect at the highest levels of economic discussion.

Q1: How exactly did AI CEOs transform Davos in 2026?AI executives transformed Davos through physical presence along the Promenade, domination of session topics and attendance, public policy criticisms, and shifting conversation priorities away from traditional WEF focuses toward artificial intelligence development, safety, and governance discussions.

Q2: What was significant about the Humans& funding round mentioned in Davos discussions?The $480 million seed round for pre-product AI startup Humans& represents one of the largest seed investments in technology history and signals investor confidence in founding teams with strong research credentials from companies like Anthropic, Google, and xAI, despite the absence of traditional metrics like revenue or user growth.

Q3: Did traditional Davos topics like climate change disappear completely?Traditional topics remained on the official agenda but received significantly less attention and engagement compared to AI-focused sessions. Climate change and poverty reduction discussions continued but no longer dominated conversations as they have in previous years.

Q4: What are the potential risks of AI dominating global economic forums?Potential risks include diversion of attention from other critical challenges, excessive influence by corporate perspectives on governance discussions, investment patterns that may not reflect sustainable market fundamentals, and reduced diversity of viewpoints in policy formulation.

Q5: How does the 2026 Davos transformation compare to previous technology presences at the forum?The 2026 transformation represents a more substantial shift than previous technology waves. Unlike dot-com era or social media company presence, AI executives in 2026 actively shaped both formal and informal agendas rather than simply participating in existing discussions, reflecting the technology's perceived fundamental importance to economic futures.

AI CEOs Transformed Davos: The Stunning Tech Takeover of the World Economic Forum

DAVOS, SWITZERLAND — January 23, 2026: The World Economic Forum's annual meeting underwent a dramatic transformation this year as artificial intelligence executives and conversations dominated the Alpine gathering, fundamentally reshaping what has traditionally been a forum for global economic and political dialogue. The shift was immediately visible along the Promenade, where technology companies replaced traditional financial institutions in prominent storefronts, signaling a profound change in both the event's atmosphere and substantive discussions. This year's Davos meeting saw AI topics consistently overshadow traditional WEF pillars including climate change mitigation, global poverty reduction, and geopolitical stability talks, marking what many observers describe as a pivotal moment in the forum's five-decade history.

The physical transformation of Davos began with prominent storefront takeovers by technology giants. Meta and Salesforce established highly visible installations along the main promenade, creating immersive experiences that drew constant crowds of attendees. Meanwhile, AI company executives occupied center stage in both formal sessions and informal networking events, fundamentally altering the conversation dynamics throughout the week. These leaders didn't merely participate in discussions—they actively shaped the agenda with public criticisms of international trade policies, warnings about potential AI investment bubbles, and bold predictions about the industry's trajectory.

Observers noted that the traditional balance between public and private sector voices shifted noticeably toward technology leadership. Where previous forums featured equal representation between government officials and corporate executives, this year's conversations frequently centered on how AI development should proceed rather than whether it should be regulated. The change reflected both the technology's rapid advancement and the substantial economic influence now concentrated in the hands of AI companies and their leadership teams.

Session topics at Davos 2026 revealed the depth of this transformation. While climate change and poverty reduction remained on the official agenda, attendance and engagement metrics showed significantly higher participation in AI-focused discussions. Panel sessions exploring artificial intelligence ethics, development frameworks, and economic impacts consistently reached maximum capacity, while some traditional development sessions saw reduced attendance. This substantive shift extended beyond session selection to include the nature of conversations themselves, with AI safety, alignment research, and computational governance emerging as dominant themes where macroeconomic policy once prevailed.

While AI executives transformed Davos discussions in Switzerland, parallel developments in Silicon Valley highlighted the industry's extraordinary momentum. AI startup Humans& secured a $480 million seed funding round despite having no commercial product on the market—a development that would have been unthinkable just three years earlier. The company's founding team includes former employees from Anthropic, Google, and xAI, lending credibility to their vision for “social intelligence” artificial intelligence systems. This funding round represents one of the largest seed investments in technology history and signals investor confidence in AI's long-term potential despite current market uncertainties.

The Humans& funding exemplifies a broader trend in AI investment patterns. Venture capital firms increasingly prioritize founding team credentials and technological vision over traditional metrics like revenue or user growth. This shift reflects both the extraordinary capital requirements of AI development and investor belief that early positioning in foundational AI technologies will yield substantial returns as the market matures. However, some Davos participants expressed concerns about this approach, noting that similar investment patterns preceded previous technology bubbles.

The transformation of Davos conversations carries significant implications for the global AI industry. First, the increased visibility of AI executives at traditionally policy-focused forums suggests growing recognition that technological development cannot be separated from broader societal considerations. Second, the substantial funding flowing to pre-product AI companies indicates investor belief that current development cycles justify unprecedented risk-taking. Third, the public nature of policy criticisms from AI leadership marks a departure from previous corporate approaches to regulation, suggesting more direct engagement with governance processes moving forward.

Several specific developments emerged from Davos discussions that will likely shape the industry throughout 2026:

Technology analysts observing the Davos transformation note several important considerations. First, the shift toward AI discussions reflects genuine technological progress rather than mere hype—foundational models have reached capabilities that justify serious policy attention. Second, the physical presence of technology companies along the Promenade represents strategic positioning for influence, not just marketing. Third, the substantial funding flowing to pre-revenue AI companies indicates investor belief that current development windows create unique opportunities for first-mover advantages in what may become defining technologies of the coming decade.

Industry observers also highlight potential risks associated with these developments. The concentration of both conversation and investment in artificial intelligence could divert attention from other critical global challenges. Additionally, the substantial funding for companies without products raises questions about investment discipline and potential market corrections. Finally, the increased corporate influence on policy discussions at traditionally multilateral forums may complicate efforts to establish balanced governance frameworks that consider diverse stakeholder perspectives.

The 2026 transformation continues a longer-term trend of increasing technology presence at the World Economic Forum. Technology companies first gained prominence at Davos during the late 1990s dot-com era, though their influence diminished following the 2000 market correction. A second wave emerged during the 2010s with the rise of social media and platform companies, though these firms typically participated within broader business delegations rather than as primary conversation drivers. The current AI-focused transformation represents a third and more substantial wave, with technology executives not just attending but actively shaping both formal and informal agendas.

This historical progression reveals important patterns about technology's integration into global economic discussions. Initially treated as a specialized sector, technology has gradually moved toward the center of economic thinking as its transformative potential has become increasingly apparent across industries. The 2026 emphasis on artificial intelligence specifically reflects recognition that AI represents not just another technological advancement but potentially a fundamental shift in economic production, labor markets, and innovation processes—topics that naturally align with the World Economic Forum's mission to address global challenges.

The 2026 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos demonstrated how thoroughly AI CEOs transformed the gathering from its traditional focus on macroeconomic policy and global challenges to a technology-forward conference centered on artificial intelligence's development and implications. This transformation manifested physically through storefront takeovers, substantively through conversation dominance, and financially through parallel Silicon Valley developments like the record Humans& funding round. While the long-term implications remain uncertain, the Davos shift clearly signals artificial intelligence's arrival as a primary concern for global economic leadership—a development that will likely influence investment patterns, regulatory approaches, and technological development throughout the coming year and beyond. The AI industry's growing influence at traditionally policy-focused forums suggests we have entered a new phase in technology's relationship with global governance, one where technical development and societal consideration increasingly intersect at the highest levels of economic discussion.

The biggest explosions in the universe, ranked

From planet-scorching stellar outbursts to cataclysms so powerful they shiver the very fabric of spacetime, these are some of the biggest blasts our cosmos has to offer

The universe is exploding.

Or parts of it are. The night sky may seem calm, even serene, but that masks events of a catastrophic and nearly unimaginable scale. Across the galaxy and even the cosmos itself, immense outbursts of energy occur that could easily vaporize our planet. Happily, space is vast, and the terrible distance between these events and us diminishes what we see to a faint glow—usually. It's very rare for our Earth to be touched directly by such explosions, but it does happen, though with generally minimal effect.

As Douglas Adams wrote in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, “Don't panic.”

That said, some of these events are maybe a cause for some small amount of concern. How worried you should be about any given cosmic paroxysm depends upon how powerful it is—and thus how nearby it must be to pose a planetary hazard. With that in mind, let's peruse the rogues' gallery of astrophysical assaults, laying them out in order of destructive potential.

Locally, the sun is capable of some epic tantrums. Solar storms are eruptions that release some of the energy stored in the sun's strong magnetic field. These can create intense, localized explosions called solar flares, or much more powerful and dangerous coronal mass ejections, which spread out over a far larger volume. Both generate blasts of high-energy subatomic particles that can slam into Earth's magnetic field, causing widespread problems such as blackouts, loss of satellites, and more.

They also create spectacular auroras, so at least there's an upside.

How much energy is released in such an event? Over the course of a few hours in 2003, the most powerful solar flare ever directly measured released as much energy as the entire sun does in about one fifth of a second. That may not sound like much, but it's the equivalent to simultaneously detonating about 17 billion one-megaton nuclear bombs. While that's not nearly enough to, say, melt the world, it's still a phenomenal event.

Happily, solar storms at this scale are rare and can miss Earth even when they happen, but we should still take them seriously.

Mind you, too, that these are the first and therefore smallest explosions on our list. Things get pretty apocalyptic from here.

When the sun finally runs out of nuclear fuel and dies, some seven or so billion years from now (mark your calendars), it will undergo a series of short-lived eruptions and eventually fade away, cooling over many billions more years. But some stars are much more tempestuous.

A white dwarf is the core of a star that was once like the sun, now exposed to space. This object is massive and tiny, giving it Herculean gravity. If it happens to orbit a normal star, it can siphon off material that then piles up on the white dwarf's surface. If enough matter accumulates, it can be squeezed so tightly that it ignites nuclear fusion. The result is a seriously powerful explosion called a nova. It can emit as much energy when it explodes as the sun does over many centuries.

I'll note that there are also recurrent novae, which blow up like this again and again, some even millions of times.

While novae are powerful, some stars really go out with a bang. A supernova occurs when a massive star ends its life. The stellar core collapses, unleashing a truly staggering amount of energy that causes the star to explode; in an instant, several octillion tons of matter are flung outward at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light. The energy released in total can be millions of times that of a nova, enough to outshine an entire galaxy of billions of stars.

A novalike situation can become a supernova as well: if enough material piles up on the surface of a white dwarf, the ensuing explosion can be so large it tears the star itself apart, coincidentally blowing up with an energy roughly the same as a core-collapse supernova.

Being near a supernova can ruin your day. It's not entirely clear how close one has to be to deleteriously affect our planet, but around 160 light-years of space between us is probably a good estimate. This happens pretty rarely, but close calls have happened: radioactive elements have been found in material from the seafloor that can only be created in a supernova, meaning that some millions of years ago, at least one star flipped its lid close enough to Earth to spray us with a few hundred tons of mildly radioactive material. That's not really dangerous—we're still here, after all—but it's sobering to think something so powerful can reach out to touch us from more than a quadrillion kilometers away.

We've been touched by a cosmic monster more recently, too. In December 2004 astronomers were shocked when a huge blast of energy swept over Earth, jostling our planet's magnetic field and increasing the ionization of its atmosphere. The culprit was a magnetar, a super-magnetized neutron star located about 50,000 light-years away. For reasons still not wholly understood, these ultradense objects—each about the mass of our star squeezed into a bizarre, city-sized ball of degenerate quantum matter—undergo starquakes in which the material on the surface shifts a bit like in an earthly tremor. That shift may only be a centimeter or so, but the enormous mass and ridiculously strong gravity (billions of times that of Earth's!) release vast amounts of energy, mostly in the form of gamma rays and x-rays. I'm glad this particular starquake occurred halfway across our galaxy—and that only a handful of such objects are known in the Milky Way, most of which are more quiescent.

Black holes make this list as well, in a surprising variety of ways. Core-collapse supernovae can make stellar-mass black holes, and the birth announcement is loud: a gamma-ray burst is the impulsive release of supernova-level energy, but instead of blasting away in all directions, the burst is concentrated into a pair of tightly focused beams. These are more dangerous at farther away than the previous items on our list; closer than 6,000 light-years or so gets dicey. They are so intense they can be seen from incredible distances; one, called GRB 080319B, erupted 7.5 billion light-years from Earth. Yet even from so far away, it was briefly visible to the naked eye!

Sometimes stars wander too close to a large black hole, and the gravity can rip them apart. Called tidal disruption events, these also erupt with energies around that of a supernova. Astronomers have found quite a few of these, all (so far) happily in very distant galaxies.

But it's hard to beat when two supermassive black holes collide. This can happen when two large galaxies collide; their central monsters can eventually merge, creating a larger black hole. When that happens, a substantial fraction of their mass, about 10 percent, is instantaneously converted into energy. This amount of energy is way, way beyond what the human mind can grasp; the blast from the merger of two one-billion-solar-mass black holes emits as much energy as the sun does in three billion trillion years. That number stopped me cold; my brain started panicking and running around in circles in my skull. That's far more than the energy emitted by every single star in the entire universe. It's literally the most powerful bang since the big one.

Why haven't we seen one of these explosions? All that energy is emitted in invisible gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of the universe. These giant waves weaken with distance, and such mergers are sufficiently rare that they tend to occur billions of light-years away.

It all seems rather violent, doesn't it? But take hope! There's a cycle to the universe. When stars explode, they create and scatter heavy elements such as iron, calcium, and more, all of which are necessary for life as we know it, and in fact, your blood and bones exist because of these explosions. Supernovae can also compress interstellar gas around them, helping form new stars; black hole eruptions can do the same.

These cosmic explosions may ostentatiously announce a catastrophic ending, but they can also usher in a new beginning. I find that rather heartening.

This is the most complete skeleton yet of our ancestor Homo habilis

A partial skeleton dating back more than two million years is the most complete yet of Homo habilis, one of the earliest known species in our genus

By K. R. Callaway edited by Andrea Thompson

The bones of the Homo habilis skeleton found in found in the Lake Turkana Basin of Kenya.

Adapted from ""New partial skeleton of Homo habilis from the upper Burgi Member, Koobi Fora Formation, Ileret, Kenya,"" by Grine, et al., in The Anatomical Record; January 13, 2026

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

A skeleton found in the Lake Turkana Basin area of northern Kenya is the most complete set of remains ever found of Homo habilis, a species that was one of the earliest members of the Homo genus and lived more than two million years ago. Its large brain and flat face—attributes found in today's humans—have long set the species apart from earlier hominins such as Australopithecus africanus. A new study analyzing the uniquely complete skeleton, however, suggests H. habilis' body looked much less modern.

The analysis of the bones, published on January 13 in the Anatomical Record, affirms previous assumptions about the species, such as that H. habilis had long and strong arms that were more similar in proportion to those of apes than to those of modern humans. Additionally, H. habilis was small—perhaps even smaller than Lucy, a 3.2-million-year-old hominin specimen known for her tiny size.

“A finding like this does give hope,” says William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. “It's been tough with Homo habilis, as there are very limited, scrappy remains. It shows us that hard work in the field, and constantly looking for them, reaps important dividends.”

Some of the skeleton's teeth were first found in the sediments of Lake Turkana by Arbollo Aike of the Koobi Fora Research Project in 2012. Over the next couple of years, the study authors followed a trail of bone fragments downslope for several meters, discovering more teeth and a series of larger bones from the upper body. The fully excavated skeleton includes a nearly complete set of lower teeth, both collarbones, both upper arm and forearm bones, and fragments of the shoulder blades and pelvis.

Analyzing the bones took more than a decade, study co-author Ashley Hammond said in a statement. First researchers had to ascertain that all the bones came from the same individual and that the individual was from the H. habilis species. “Fortunately for us, the teeth are one of the most diagnostic parts of the skeleton for identifying hominin species,” says study co-author Carrie Mongle, an assistant professor of anthropology at Stony Brook University.

Still elusive is the build of H. habilis' lower body. The pelvic fragment found with the new skeleton suggests the species might have been able to walk more upright than earlier hominins, Mongle says. Still, more information about the lower body is needed to learn exactly where the species fits into the evolution of humanlike posture and gait.

Because H. habilis is one of the earliest members of our genus, understanding more about this species helps to shed light on the evolution that led to our own, researchers say.

“This study underlines how crucial individual fossil discoveries can be,” says Rebecca Wragg Sykes, an honorary archeology researcher at the University of Cambridge and the University of Liverpool in England, who was not involved in the study. “Just a few new fragments can transform our view not only of that species but [of] their evolutionary context, too.”

In the shadow of nuclear disaster, these canines show remarkable resilience to the deadly disease.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

On April 26, 1986, disaster struck the small Ukrainian-Belarusian border town of Chernobyl, (then part of the Soviet Union) when a series of steam explosions led to a nuclear meltdown. The apocalyptic event impacted hundreds of thousands of people and greatly impacted the surrounding environment. 

But 40 years later, something strange is happening. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), a roughly 1,000 square mile perimeter around the nuclear plant, is slowly becoming one of the world's biggest science experiments for exploring the long-term effects of ionizing radiation. While humans might've abandoned the area, other animals stuck around. 

In 2016, a study found that the Eastern tree frogs (Hyla orientalis) in the CEZ exhibit different characteristics than their neighboring cousins, and in 2023, another study discovered distinct genetic differences between Chernobyl dogs and dogs living only 10 miles away in Chernobyl City. Now, Princeton University biologists Cara Love and Shane Campbell-Stanton are exploring another strange mammalian characteristic of the CEZ—its unexpectedly thriving wolf population. The results of the decade-long study were presented at the Annual Meeting of Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology in 2024.

Analyzing wolves in the CEZ is particularly interesting because they're apex predators, a.k.a. the top of the food chain. This is usually a privileged position in an ecosystem, but when that ecosystem is inundated with radiation, these animals are forced to eat irradiated prey that ate irradiated plants that grew out of irradiated soil. Basically, it's radiation all the way down. 

This would seem to suggest that wolves would be particularly impacted in the CEZ, but Love says that isn't happening. In fact, she told NPR that wolf populations in the CEZ are actually seven times more dense than in protected wildlife areas in neighboring Belarus. 

“Gray wolves offer a really interesting opportunity to understand the impacts of chronic, low-dose, multigenerational exposure to ionizing radiation,” Campbell-Stanton said in an NPR interview. “As an evolutionary biologist, the very first question in my mind was whether or not this radiation was enough of a stressor to actually be a selective pressure.”

In 2014, the Princeton team attached collars to these CEZ wolves with both GPS and radiation dosimeters, in an effort to understand the population's response to Chernobyl's cancer-causing radiation. They discovered over time that the wolves were consistently exposed to radiation six times higher than the legal limit for humans. 

Love and Campbell-Stanton's theory is that wolves are experiencing a kind of rapid natural selection, one likely caused by the equally rapid change in their surrounding environment. Some wolves within the CEZ contained genes that made them more resistant to cancer than other wolves. While still getting cancer at the same rate, these resilient canines simply weren't as impacted, allowing them to pass on those genes to a future generation.

“So in general, we found that the fastest-evolving regions within Chernobyl are in and around genes that we know have some role in cancer immune response or the anti-tumor immune response in mammals,” Campbell-Stanton told NPR. 

While the data shows a clear genetic cause behind the CEZ wolves' cancer-resistance, Campbell-Stanton is quick to point out that these wolves are also free from other biological pressures—most notably, humans. The team is currently working with cancer specialists to see how these results could impact human health. 

For decades, Chernobyl has been characterized as an immense ecological disaster (which it definitely was), but in the past decade, the CEZ has also looked more and more like an unprecedented scientific opportunity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A brain glitch may explain why some people hear voices","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260122074033.htm","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:48:37 GMT","

A new study led by psychologists at UNSW Sydney offers the clearest evidence so far that hearing voices in schizophrenia may arise from a breakdown in how the brain recognizes its own inner voice. The research suggests that the brain may be misidentifying internally generated thoughts as sounds coming from the outside world.

Published in the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin, the study also points toward a possible path for identifying biological markers of schizophrenia. This is important because there are currently no blood tests, brain scans, or lab based biomarkers (signs in the body that can tell us something about our health) that uniquely identify the condition.

Professor Thomas Whitford of the UNSW School of Psychology has spent years studying how inner speech works in both healthy individuals and people living with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

""Inner speech is the voice in your head that silently narrates your thoughts - what you're doing, planning, or noticing,"" he says.

""Most people experience inner speech regularly, often without realizing it, though there are some who don't experience it at all.

""Our research shows that when we speak - even just in our heads - the part of the brain that processes sounds from the outside world becomes less active. This is because the brain predicts the sound of our own voice. But in people who hear voices, this prediction seems to go wrong, and the brain reacts as if the voice is coming from someone else.""

Brainwaves Reveal a Longstanding Theory

According to Prof. Whitford, these findings strongly support a theory that has existed in mental health research for decades: that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia may result from a person's own inner speech being mistaken for external speech.

""This idea's been around for 50 years, but it's been very difficult to test because inner speech is inherently private,"" he says.

""How do you measure it? One way is by using an EEG, which records the brain's electrical activity. Even though we can't hear inner speech, the brain still reacts to it - and in healthy people, using inner speech produces the same kind of reduction in brain activity as when they speak out loud.

""But in people who hear voices, that reduction of activity doesn't happen. In fact, their brains react even more strongly to inner speech, as if it's coming from someone else. That might help explain why the voices feel so real.""

Testing How the Brain Predicts Sound

To explore this effect, the researchers divided participants into three groups. The first included 55 people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who had experienced auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) within the past week. The second group included 44 people with schizophrenia who either had no history of AVH or had not experienced them recently. The third group consisted of 43 healthy individuals with no history of schizophrenia.

Each participant wore an EEG (electroencephalography) cap while listening to sounds through headphones. At specific moments, they were asked to imagine saying either 'bah' or 'bih' silently in their minds while hearing one of those same sounds played aloud. Participants did not know in advance whether the sound they imagined would match what they heard.

In healthy participants, brain activity dropped when the imagined syllable matched the sound played through the headphones. This reduced response appeared in the auditory cortex, the region responsible for processing sound and speech. The pattern suggests the brain correctly predicted the sound and lowered its response, similar to what happens during normal speech.

The opposite pattern appeared in participants who had recently experienced auditory hallucinations. Instead of showing reduced activity, their brains reacted more strongly when the imagined sound matched what they heard.

""Their brains reacted more strongly to inner speech that matched the external sound, which was the exact opposite of what we found in the healthy participants,"" Prof. Whitford says.

""This reversal of the normal suppression effect suggests that the brain's prediction mechanism may be disrupted in people currently experiencing auditory hallucinations, which may cause their own inner voice to be misinterpreted as external speech.""

Participants in the second schizophrenia group, those without recent hallucinations, showed brain responses that fell between the healthy group and the hallucinating group.

What This Means for Schizophrenia Research

The researchers say the results provide the strongest confirmation yet that people living with schizophrenia may be experiencing imagined speech as if it were coming from outside themselves.

""It was always a plausible theory - that people were hearing their own thoughts spoken out loud - but this new approach has provided the strongest and most direct test of this theory to date,"" Prof. Whitford says.

Looking ahead, the research team plans to explore whether this brain response pattern could help predict who may later develop psychosis. If successful, it could help identify individuals at high risk earlier, allowing treatment to begin sooner.

""This sort of measure has great potential to be a biomarker for the development of psychosis,"" Prof. Whitford says.

""Ultimately, I think that understanding the biological causes of the symptoms of schizophrenia is a necessary first step if we hope to develop new and effective treatments.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Rare rocks beneath Australia reveal the origins of a critical metal","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260122074028.htm","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:09:15 GMT","

Scientists studying rare rocks buried deep beneath central Australia have uncovered how one of the world's most promising new sources of niobium came to be. Niobium is a critical metal used to strengthen steel and support clean energy technologies, and its origins are tied to dramatic geological events that unfolded more than 800 million years ago.

The research, led by Curtin University, shows that these newly identified niobium-rich rocks formed during the early stages of a massive continental breakup. At the time, Earth's ancient supercontinent Rodinia was beginning to pull apart, creating deep fractures in the crust.

How Tectonic Forces Brought Metal to the Surface

According to the study, molten rock rich in niobium rose from deep within the Earth through long-standing fault zones. These pathways opened during a period of tectonic stretching and rifting that eventually split Rodinia apart. The molten material solidified into rare igneous rocks known as carbonatites, locking valuable metals into the crust.

Lead author Dr. Maximilian Dröllner, from the Timescales of Mineral Systems Group within Curtin's Frontier Institute for Geoscience Solutions and the University of Göttingen, said the discovery offers new insight into how rare, metal-rich magmas reach the surface.

""These carbonatites are unlike anything previously known in the region and contain important concentrations of niobium, a strategic metal used to make lighter, stronger steel for aircraft, pipelines and EVs and a key component in some next-generation battery and superconducting technologies,"" Dr. Dröllner said.

Pinpointing an 800-Million-Year-Old Geological Event

By examining drill core samples, the research team used several isotope-dating methods to determine when the rocks formed. Their results show the carbonatites were emplaced between 830 and 820 million years ago, during a key phase of continental rifting before Rodinia fully broke apart.

""Using multiple isotope-dating techniques on drill core samples, we found that these carbonatites were emplaced between 830 and 820 million years ago, during a period of continental rifting that preceded the breakup of Rodinia.

""This tectonic setting allowed carbonatite magma to rise through fault zones that had remained open and active for hundreds of millions of years, delivering metal-rich melts from deep in the mantle up into the crust.""

Reconstructing Half a Billion Years of Earth History

Curtin co-author Professor Chris Kirkland, also from the Timescales of Mineral Systems Group, said the study highlights how advanced analytical techniques can untangle extremely complex geological timelines.

""Carbonatites are rare igneous rocks known to host major global deposits of critical metals such as niobium and rare earth elements. But determining when and how they formed has historically been difficult due to their complex geological histories,"" Professor Kirkland said.

""By analyzing isotopes and using high-resolution imaging, we were able to reconstruct more than 500 million years of geological events that these rocks experienced.

""This approach allowed us to pinpoint when the carbonatites formed and separate those original magmatic events from changes that happened later in the rocks.""

The findings were published in Geological Magazine under the title 'Multi-method geochronology and isotope geochemistry of carbonatites in the Aileron Province, central Australia'.

Earthquakes and seismically-induced landslides accelerate carbon export from mountains by eroding hillslope soil carbon. However, a quantitative understanding of their net contribution to carbon cycling remains incomplete. Using the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake which generated the largest landslide volume in recent history, we quantify its carbon mass balance accounting for storage, loss, and transport within the ensuing sediment cascade. Thanks to post-event revegetation and extensive intermontane sediment storage, we show that the earthquake boosted Longmenshan carbon mass by ~10%. Given the stability of these deposits and low rates of carbon export, we anticipate this landslide carbon will persist for centuries to millennia before gradually declining. In effect, we demonstrate that earthquakes and landslides function as capacitors, regulating carbon storage and discharge across mountain belts over time. This suggests frequent landslides in seismically-active mountains may lead to a net carbon sequestration, providing a critical and direct link between tectonics and the carbon cycle.

Guinea-Bissau will implement a universal birth-dose policy for the Hepatitis B vaccine in 2027.Credit: Enrique Lopez-Tapia/Nature Picture Library/Alamy

Public health authorities in Guinea-Bissau say that they have suspended a controversial US-funded hepatitis B vaccine study that has raised questions about who has authority over clinical research conducted in Africa. At a press conference held today, officials from Guinea-Bissau's ministry of health said that the study was being suspended pending a technical and ethical review by its national public health institute. The announcement followed weeks of conflicting statements as to whether or not the trial would proceed. 

“There has been no sufficient coordination in order to take a final decision regarding the study,” said Quinhin Nantote, the minister of public health for Guinea-Bissau. “Faced with this situation, we decided to suspend it.” 

The meeting, convened by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), comes after an official with the organization signalled last week that the trial would not proceed. In an e-mail to Nature today, officials at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a prominent funder of the research, said that the study was still on track, leaving the trial's status still uncertain.

Hotly anticipated US vaccine meeting ends with confusion — and a few decisions

Hotly anticipated US vaccine meeting ends with confusion — and a few decisions

“The study is proceeding as planned and we continue to work with our partners to finalize the study's protocols,” wrote Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the HHS. 

The continuing row shines a spotlight on long-standing tensions for clinical research trials in Africa. African scientists say that the Guinea-Bissau study shows how political pressure, funding interests and fragmented oversight can push local health priorities aside.

The hepatitis B vaccine trial was designed by researchers at the Bandim Health Project (Projecto de Saúde) out of the University of Southern Denmark, and funded in part through a US$1.6 million research grant from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, part of the HHS. The study aims to randomize 14,000 newborns in Guinea-Bissau starting in early 2026 to either receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth or not, before the country's planned universal birth-dose vaccine policy begins in 2027.

The Bandim researchers have said that the study is a chance to investigate whether the vaccine has broader effects on infant health outcomes.

But several scientists have argued that by randomizing newborns to not receive the vaccine, the trial denies a safe and life-saving intervention to infants in Guinea-Bissau, which has a hepatitis B prevalence of about 19%. The immune systems of newborns are immature and about 90% of people infected at birth go on to develop chronic, lifelong infections which may lead to liver disease and early death.

Researchers who oppose the study argue that it is structured in a way that increases the likelihood of detecting harm from the birth dose, even if that harm is not real or clinically meaningful. “They're trying to use African children to prove a case for reducing vaccines in the US,” says Seye Abimbola, a professor of health systems at the University of Sydney in Australia, who researches decolonizing global health. “That's problematic.” The United States removed its own recommendations for a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine earlier this year.

Bandim Health did not respond to Nature's request for comments on the study design. Hilliard at the HHS said that the research “is based on the highest scientific and ethical standards”.

Our experiences contain countless details that may be important in the future, yet we rarely know which will matter and which will not. This uncertainty poses a difficult challenge for adaptive decision-making, as failing to preserve relevant information can prevent us from making good choices later on. One solution to this challenge is to store detailed memories of individual experiences that can be flexibly accessed whenever their details become relevant. By allowing us to store and recall specific events in vivid detail, the human episodic memory system provides exactly this capacity. Yet, whether and how this ability supports adaptive behaviour is poorly understood. Here we aimed to determine whether people use detailed episodic memories to make decisions when future task demands are uncertain. We hypothesized that the episodic memory system's ability to store events in great detail allows us to reference any of these details if they later become relevant. We tested this hypothesis using a novel decision-making task in which participants encoded individual events with multiple features and later made decisions based on these features to maximize their earnings. Across 5 experiments (total n = 535), we found that participants referenced episodic memories during decisions in feature-rich environments and that they did so specifically when it was unclear at encoding which features would be needed in the future. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental adaptive function of episodic memory, showing how its rich representational capacity enables flexible decision-making under uncertainty.

Charge transfer across interfaces constitutes the rate-determining step in electrochemical systems. Sluggish kinetics triggers side reactions and hazardous surface morphologies, as represented by dendritic/dead lithium (Li0) in Li-metal batteries (LMBs), especially under ultrafast charging (UFC). Here we report an approach to accelerate interfacial charge transfer by redesigning the solvent molecular structure into a distinctive planar coordination of lone-pair electrons (LPEs) with alkaline cations (Li+ or Na+). This planar-aligned electron channel (PAEC) greatly strengthens the coupling between LPEs and Li+, promoting Li+/Li0 redox reaction kinetics and reversibility. The designed electrolyte dramatically enables stable cycling of industrial 2 Ah Li||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells at an ultrahigh rate of 4 C, achieving 100% full charge within 15 min at a charging power density of 1,747.6 W kg−1. We establish a link between the solvation electronic structure and charge-transfer dynamics, highlighting a potential strategy for electrolyte design under extreme electrochemical conditions.

Myriad, Microscopic and Marvellous



Geertje Dekkers Reaktion (2025)

In 1674, microbiologist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek made “his most sensational discovery”, writes historian Geertje Dekkers in her revealing, finely illustrated biography. Examining water from a lake under a microscope, van Leeuwenhoek observed single-celled life forms racing in all directions: bacteria and protozoa. He also described red blood cells, capillaries, striated muscle fibres, spermatozoa and the eye's crystalline lens accurately. On his death in 1723, the UK Royal Society wrote that it had lost its most valuable correspondent.

Naturekind



Melissa Leach & James Fairhead Princeton Univ. Press (2025)

Exploring the study of meaning in sign systems, known as semiotics, anthropologists Melissa Leach and James Fairhead ponder on people's encounters with chickens, horses, bees, bats and plants. In ‘naturekind' — “the communities and cultures through which humans are inescapably interconnected with wider life” — the authors consider forests, seas, soils and cities, which contain both living and non-living entities. In doing so, they develop biosemiotics by linking biological findings to structural linguistics, social semiotics and anthropology.

The Book of Memory



Mark Rowlands Pegasus (2025)

The morning after the 1986 Challenger space-shuttle disaster, a psychologist recorded how first-year undergraduate students learnt of the explosion. In 1989, replying to the same questionnaire, 11 out of 44 students totally misremembered. This is one of many observations on memory in philosopher Mark Rowlands' stimulating analysis. “Memory is the ability to read the book of you,” Rowlands proposes. “You are, therefore, both the book and the one who reads the book. You are the reader and the read. You are the remembering and the remembered.”

The big AI companies promised us that 2025 would be “the year of the AI agents.” It turned out to be the year of talking about AI agents, and kicking the can for that transformational moment to 2026 or maybe later. But what if the answer to the question “When will our lives be fully automated by generative AI robots that perform our tasks for us and basically run the world?” is, like that New Yorker cartoon, “How about never?”

That was basically the message of a paper published without much fanfare some months ago, smack in the middle of the overhyped year of “agentic AI.” Entitled “Hallucination Stations: On Some Basic Limitations of Transformer-Based Language Models,” it purports to mathematically show that “LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity.” Though the science is beyond me, the authors—a former SAP CTO who studied AI under one of the field's founding intellects, John McCarthy, and his teenage prodigy son—punctured the vision of agentic paradise with the certainty of mathematics. Even reasoning models that go beyond the pure word-prediction process of LLMs, they say, won't fix the problem.

“There is no way they can be reliable,” Vishal Sikka, the dad, tells me. After a career that, in addition to SAP, included a stint as Infosys CEO and an Oracle board member, he currently heads an AI services startup called Vianai. “So we should forget about AI agents running nuclear power plants?” I ask. “Exactly,” he says. Maybe you can get it to file some papers or something to save time, but you might have to resign yourself to some mistakes.

The AI industry begs to differ. For one thing, a big success in agent AI has been coding, which took off last year. Just this week at Davos, Google's Nobel-winning head of AI, Demis Hassabis, reported breakthroughs in minimizing hallucinations, and hyperscalers and startups alike are pushing the agent narrative. Now they have some backup. A startup called Harmonic is reporting a breakthrough in AI coding that also hinges on mathematics—and tops benchmarks on reliability.

Harmonic, which was cofounded by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Tudor Achim, a Stanford-trained mathematician, claims this recent improvement to its product called Aristotle (no hubris there!) is an indication that there are ways to guarantee the trustworthiness of AI systems. “Are we doomed to be in a world where AI just generates slop and humans can't really check it? That would be a crazy world,” says Achim. Harmonic's solution is to use formal methods of mathematical reasoning to verify an LLM's output. Specifically, it encodes outputs in the Lean programming language, which is known for its ability to verify the coding. To be sure, Harmonic's focus to date has been narrow—its key mission is the pursuit of “mathematical superintelligence,” and coding is a somewhat organic extension. Things like history essays—which can't be mathematically verified—are beyond its boundaries. For now.

Nonetheless, Achim doesn't seem to think that reliable agentic behavior is as much an issue as some critics believe. “I would say that most models at this point have the level of pure intelligence required to reason through booking a travel itinerary,” he says.

Both sides are right—or maybe even on the same side. On one hand, everyone agrees that hallucinations will continue to be a vexing reality. In a paper published last September, OpenAI scientists wrote, “Despite significant progress, hallucinations continue to plague the field, and are still present in the latest models.” They proved that unhappy claim by asking three models, including ChatGPT, to provide the title of the lead author's dissertation. All three made up fake titles and all misreported the year of publication. In a blog about the paper, OpenAI glumly stated that in AI models, “accuracy will never reach 100 percent.”

Right now, those inaccuracies are serious enough to discourage the wide adoption of agents in the corporate world. “The value has not been delivered,” says Himanshu Tyagi, cofounder of an open source AI company called Sentient. He points out that dealing with hallucinations can disrupt an entire work flow, negating much of the value of an agent.

Yet the big AI powers and many startups believe these inaccuracies can be dealt with. The key to coexisting with hallucinations, they say, is creating guardrails that filter out the imaginative bullshit that LLMs love to produce. Even Sikka thinks that this is a probable outcome. “Our paper is saying that a pure LLM has this inherent limitation—but at the same time it is true that you can build components around LLMs that overcome those limitations,” he says.

Achim, the mathematical verification guy, agrees that hallucinations will always be around—but considers this a feature, not a bug. “I think hallucinations are intrinsic to LLMs and also necessary for going beyond human intelligence,” he says. “The way that systems learn is by hallucinating something. It's often wrong, but sometimes it's something that no human has ever thought before.”

The bottom line is that like generative AI itself, agentic AI is both impossible and inevitable at the same time. There may not be a specific annum that will be looked back upon as “the year of the agent.” But hallucinations or not, every year from now on is going to be “the year of more agents,” as the delta between guardrails and hallucinations narrows. The industry has too much at stake not to make this happen. The tasks that agents perform will always require some degree of verification—and of course people will get sloppy and we'll suffer small and large disasters—but eventually agents will match or surpass the reliability of human beings, while being faster and cheaper.

At that point, some bigger questions arise. One person I contacted to discuss the hallucination paper was computer pioneer Alan Kay, who is friendly with Sikka. His view is that “their argument was posed well enough to get comments from real computational theorists.” (A statement reminiscent of his 1984 take on the Macintosh as “the first personal computer good enough to be criticized.”) But ultimately, he says, the mathematical question is beside the point. Instead, he suggests people consider the issue in light of Marshall McLuhan's famous “Medium is the message” dictum. “Don't ask whether something is good or bad, right or wrong,” he paraphrases. “Find out what is going on.”

Here's what's going on: We may well be on the cusp of a massive automation of human cognitive activity. It's an open question whether this will improve the quality of our work and our lives. I suspect that the ultimate assessment of that will not be mathematically verifiable.

A database containing 149 million account usernames and passwords—including 48 million for Gmail, 17 million for Facebook, and 420,000 for the cryptocurrency platform Binance—has been removed after a researcher reported the exposure to the hosting provider.

The longtime security analyst who discovered the database, Jeremiah Fowler, could not find indications of who owned or operated it, so he worked to notify the host, which took down the trove because it violated a terms-of-service agreement.

In addition to email and social media logins for a number of platforms, Fowler also observed credentials for government systems from multiple countries as well as consumer banking and credit card logins and media streaming platforms. Fowler suspects that the database had been assembled by infostealing malware that infects devices and then uses techniques like keylogging to record information that victims type into websites.

While attempting to contact the hosting service over the course of about a month, Fowler says the database continued to grow, accumulating additional logins for an array of services. He is not naming the provider, because the company is a global host that contracts with independent regional companies to expand its reach. The database was hosted by one of these affiliates in Canada.

“This is like a dream wish list for criminals, because you have so many different types of credentials,” Fowler told WIRED. “An infostealer would make the most sense. The database was in a format made for indexing large logs as if whoever set it up was expecting to gather a lot of data. And there were tons of government logins from many different countries.”

In addition to the 48 million Gmail credentials, the trove also contained about 4 million for Yahoo accounts, 1.5 million for Microsoft Outlook, 900,000 for Apple's iCloud, and 1.4 million for .edu academic and institutional accounts. There were also, among others, about 780,000 logins for TikTok, 100,000 for OnlyFans, and 3.4 million for Netflix. The data was publicly accessible and searchable using just a web browser.

“It seemed like it captured anything and everything, but one thing that was interesting was that the system seemed to automatically classify each log with an identifier, and these were unique identifiers that didn't reappear,” Fowler says. “It seemed like the system was organizing the data automatically as it went for easier searching.

Though Fowler emphasizes that he did not determine who owned or used the information and for what purpose, such a structure would make sense if the data were being queried for cybercriminal customers paying for different subsets of the information based on their scams.

There is a seemingly endless flow of mistakenly unsecured and publicly accessible databases online that expose sensitive information for anyone to access. But as data brokers and cybercriminals amass ever greater troves, the stakes of potential breaches only grow. And infostealing malware has added to the problem by making it simple and reliable for attackers to automate the collection of login credentials and other sensitive data.

“Infostealers create a very low barrier of entry for new criminals,” says Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at security firm Recorded Future. “Renting one popular infrastructure, we've seen costs somewhere between $200 to $300 a month, so for less than a car payment, criminals could potentially gain access to hundreds of thousands of new usernames and passwords a month.”

I first encountered the Freecash app after clicking on a sponsored TikTok video with dubious claims. The advertisement didn't promote this app by name, rather it showed a young woman expressing her excitement about seemingly getting hired by TikTok at $35 an hour to watch videos on her “For You” page.

When I tapped the link to “order now,” it sent me to a website with TikTok and Freecash logos, featuring a download link for the Freecash app. “Get paid to scroll,” read the site. “Join thousands earning daily by watching TikTok videos and cashing out instantly.”

In the first month of 2026, Freecash has rocketed to popularity among US users. This week it reached the number two position on Apple's free iOS download charts, nestled between ChatGPT and Gemini. The bump in downloads coincides with a spree of ads promoting the Freecash app.

The app appears to utilize the familiar strategy of offering rewards to users who share their information or complete online tasks. As a child, I remember entering my dad's email and address into some pop-ups for a free iTunes giftcard, which never shipped us the promised $20 in downloads and likely just clogged his inbox with spam. (Please forgive me.)

While Freecash does actually pay out money to users, it's not for scrolling social media. The app's business model is centered around getting new users to play mobile games and then providing the players with monetary rewards. Those promises of direct payments to scroll aimlessly on TikTok sound too good to be true, because they are.

Ben Rathe, a spokesperson for TikTok, says the Freecash ads violate TikTok's rules barring financial misrepresentation. Rathe says the ads in question were removed, after WIRED reached out, for what the company deemed as deceptive marketing. The social media platform forbids ads designed “to scam individuals out of money or personal data,” according to TikTok's advertising policies.

The company behind Freecash claims that it did not directly produce the ads that I encountered on TikTok. Rather, the marketing was “generated by third-party affiliate partners,” says a spokesperson for Freecash's parent company. “We're reviewing activity with relevant partners and tightening monitoring.”

Back on my TikTok feed, after I tapped on that first sponsored post, the barrage of boosted videos promoting Freecash grew incessant. A post with over 150,000 likes showed a mom and her young son traveling to the store together, because she could buy her “son whatever he wants now that I'm paid to watch TikTok.” Other sponsored videos showed more people enthusiastic about the amount of cash they are getting paid to scroll TikTok.

It's not clear if the women and children appearing in the TikTok ads are actually the people promoting Freecash. Many of the ads originated from TikTok accounts with minuscule followings or accounts with zero other publicly viewable videos.

When I finally downloaded the app, rather than immediately finding ways to receive some kind of kickback for scrolling on TikTok, I was directed to download multiple mobile games, like Monopoly Go and Disney Solitaire.

Then, I was finally given the option to complete challenges in a limited amount of time to earn money. The Monopoly Go challenges included cash rewards ranging from $0.01, for playing the game for two minutes each day, to $123, for reaching level 300 in less than three months.

The company behind Freecash, called Almedia, is based in Berlin. Almedia operates the Freecash app as an advertising platform that matches mobile game developers with new users who not only install the apps but will also spend money.

CEO Moritz Holländer told PocketGamer.biz in 2024 that if the app had data about how “you spent money in a certain genre,” Freecash wouldn't match you with games that stray from your preferred picks. Why? “Because we know that your expected value that you would generate for this type isn't so high, and we would disappoint the advertiser,” he told the publication.

Freecash seems to nudge users to start spending money in the mobile games it promotes. The sole tip for users included on the Monopoly Go challenges page is the suggestion to “make purchases to reach these faster!” The second time I opened the Freecash app, a pop-up offered me 33 percent more in rewards money if I would just make that first in-game purchase.

Beyond the contents of Freecash's marketing, Lena Cohen, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is concerned about how users may be targeted by apps like this one in manipulative ways that hinge on exploiting personal data. “Some of the data brokers sell lists of people who might be susceptible to scams or who might be addicted to online gaming,” says Cohen. In Freecash's privacy policy, the information it automatically collects about you may include facts about your race, religion, sex life, sexual orientation, health, and biometric data.

In addition to Freecash, each additional new mobile game you download on your path to earn the rewards comes with its own set of privacy policies and collected user data. “If you're being paid to use an app,” she says. “Chances are high that the app is harvesting and monetizing your personal data.”

Even after TikTok said it was removing the offending ad for Freecash, I still encountered similar posts promoting it in my feed. It's notable that Freecash does offer an affiliate payout program to people who promote the app online.

In the official Discord server for Freecash, the key moderator with a “FC Staff” badge recently sent encouragement to a #hustler who was worried their network was too limited to be a successful affiliate marketer.

“You don't even need a huge network tbh,” the moderator wrote on January 15 in the Discord channel for affiliates. “You can buy TikTok/YouTube accounts, use Al, etc. Nowadays, anything is possible.”

Consumer advocates have reservations about Freecash's claims about not being involved with the misleading marketing on TikTok. Eden Iscil, a senior public policy manager with the National Consumers League, has seen similar moves in the past from sports betting apps that appear to attempt to dodge rules through third-party affiliate partnerships. “Ultimately the responsibility is on the advertiser,” says Iscil.

United States Customs and Border Protection is paying General Dynamics to create a prototype of “quantum sensors” alongside a “database with artificial intelligence” designed “to detect illicit objects and substances (such as fentanyl) in vehicles, containers, and other devices,” according to a contract justification published in a federal register last week.

“This database and sensor project will integrate advanced quantum and classical sensing technologies with Artificial Intelligence and ultimately deploy proven concepts and end products anywhere in the CBP environment,” the justification document reads. “Under this requirement, CBP will take additional steps to enhance its ability to detect, and thus, significantly reduce the harms of illicit contraband entering the United States of America, thus bolstering national security.”

The document redacts the name of the company developing the prototype; however, contract details included in the federal register entry reveal that the justification is for a $2.4 million General Dynamics contract that has been public since December 2025.

CBP and General Dynamics did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment.

CBP's request for a prototype of “quantum sensors” with an AI database—which comes amid a widespread push within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “to support the adoption and scaling of AI technologies,” according to a strategy memorandum published last year—involves a real and growing area of scientific and technological research.

Last week's justification does not get into detail about which methods its “quantum sensors” would use or what information the AI database would store and analyze. However, it does provide hints about detection methods the agency has considered.

The document claims that CBP conducted market research from April through October of 2025. In July, CBP published an information request seeking a vendor for exactly 35 handheld ""Gemini” analyzers, sold by Thermo Fisher Scientific, which are designed to identify unknown chemicals and narcotics.

DHS has also tested the Gemini in previous years, according to reports published in 2021 and 2023. The July request—which notes that the devices would be used to identify substances like fentanyl, ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, diazepam, and MDMA—makes no mention of artificial intelligence or a database.

“The detection equipment will be used by CBP Officers in non-intrusive testing to detect a wide range of narcotics, controlled substances, unknown substances, and general organic materials,” the request reads, noting that the agency “continues to seize an increasing number of opioids at the nation's borders.”

The July request for information claims that the Gemini analyzers use “Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),” which measures how much infrared light a sample absorbs, and “Raman spectroscopy,” which measures how light scatters off the surface of a sample when a laser is directed at it.

Last week's contract justification says that the agency found an American company that creates a “handheld analyzer” for identifying dangerous chemicals but claimed it “cannot detect fentanyl.” It's unclear whether this was referring to Gemini or one of the more than 10 other devices DHS tested in 2021 and 2023. But when reached for comment, Thermo Fisher Scientific said that its Gemini analyzers “are designed to detect fentanyl.”

It's also unclear whether the General Dynamics prototype may use FTIR or Raman spectroscopy. But a 2024 working paper about a laboratory-based fentanyl-detection method (unrelated to CBP, General Dynamics, or Thermo Fisher Scientific) notes that “portable Raman spectrometers” and other handheld devices—though convenient, fast, and inexpensive—can “struggle with detection of fentanyl” and may be prone to “false-positive and false-negative results.”

While it remains ambiguous what exactly last week's justification was referring to with its mention of “quantum” sensors, there are fentanyl detection methods based in quantum chemistry. The 2024 paper, for instance, explains how “quantum dots” and fluorescent dye can be used to detect fentanyl and 58 of its analogues.

Matthew Webber, an engineering professor and molecular science researcher at the University of Notre Dame and one of the coauthors on the 2024 paper, tells WIRED that the “quantum dots” are an artificially made, graphene-based nanomaterial. When combined with a fluorescent dye and a synthetic molecule that acts like a “basket,” Webber says, there's visible and quantifiable fluorescence. When a few micrograms of fentanyl are added to this mixture, Webber says, it sticks to the quantum dots and “outcompetes” the fluorescent dye, causing a loss of fluorescence.

Webber notes that all fentanyl-related lab research is conducted in a “super-controlled environment,” and never entails large quantities of fentanyl for legal, practical, and safety reasons. He emphasizes the sensitive nature of discussing fentanyl research, and says that labs like his never have bags of fentanyl laying around, an incorrect impression some people may have.

When asked about CBP's request for an “AI database” accompanying the quantum sensors, Webber says that AI could potentially help with matters like “spectral deconvolution.”

“If you have signals coming from multiple agents within a mixture, the eye may not be able to see to deconvolve the spectra into individual components, Webber says. “But there's potentially AI-based specialty convolution frameworks that could be powerful in that context.”

In other words, since new street drugs can constantly move the goalposts of detection, an AI-based system that processes images and recognizes patterns may catch fentanyl in situations where a human could miss it.

8/10

I'm always on the hunt for cheap gaming laptops that don't suck, but let's be real—many of them do. The Nvidia RTX 5060 graphics card at least guarantees you'll get decent performance at 1080p resolution, as long as the system receives the full 115 watts of power, and that's exactly what Lenovo's LOQ 15 laptop delivers.

It's not the prettiest laptop in the world, nor is it the most powerful. But for a gaming laptop under $1,000, it doesn't get better than this.

The Lenovo LOQ 15 looks generic, but I appreciate that it's fairly mellow. Nothing overly striking or ambitious, without a hint of flashing RGB lighting. That gives a modern, if plain, aesthetic. Naturally, it's awfully thick and heavy at 0.96 inches at its thickest point and weighing just over 5 pounds. You'll pay an extra $1,000 for a thin and light gaming laptop with similar components, such as the Razer Blade 14. Like many laptops of this size, though, it feels well-built and sturdy.

Rating: 8/10

Touch pads and keyboards are often compromised on cheaper machines, but not here. The 1.5-mm keyboard switches feel like they have a low actuation point, which is combined with rigid keycaps, giving it a very precise feel. It might take some getting used to, but I prefer this over the mushy keys found in lots of cheap gaming laptops. The layout is spacious, offering a 10-key number pad, media control, and full-size arrow keys. The only thing it's missing is a fingerprint reader or an IR camera. The LOQ 15 doesn't support Windows Hello, so you'll have to rely on a password. It has a surprisingly responsive, large touch pad, the surface of which feels nice and smooth to drag your finger across. The click is too loud, though.

The LOQ 15 has several ports, none of which are on the left side. On the right, you get a USB-A port (5 Gbps), a headphone jack, a USB-C port (10 Gbps), and a webcam shutter switch. Most of the ports are on the back, in between the large vents. That's where you get the power jack, which looks similar to a USB-A, an Ethernet port, HDMI 2.1, and a USB-A (5 Gbps). These are convenient locations for these ports, especially if you don't plan on moving your laptop around too much.

The LOQ 15's display is its most important and distinctive feature. Unlike so many gaming laptops under $1,000, Lenovo didn't cut corners. You're getting a quality IPS display with a 144-Hz refresh rate, a max of brightness of 347 nits, and the kicker: really solid color performance. It's every bit as good as the non-gaming laptops at this price, covering 100 percent of the sRGB color space and 78 percent of AdobeRGB. That translates to colors that look natural and accurate. Other competitors I've tested, like the Acer Nitro V 16 and MSI Cyborg A15, suffer in this regard.

My only complaint with the screen is that it's a 16:9 aspect ratio, 15.6-inch panel instead of a 16:10 16-inch size. That means it has an abnormally large bottom bezel and less screen real estate in the same size footprint on the table.

Unsurprisingly, the 5-megapixel webcam and speakers are both pretty basic. I recommend using an external camera and computer speakers.

The LOQ 15 has a few different configurations in the wild, including an Intel or AMD option for CPU, as well as RTX 5050 or 5060 for graphics. My unit came with the AMD Ryzen 7 250, RTX 5060, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of storage. The memory is single-channel, meaning there's an open slot available to add more RAM. There's also a secondary storage slot to add an extra SSD, either in the standard 2280 or shorter 2230 size. Having all of this upgradable gives you lots of options in the future.

Rating: 8/10

Surprisingly, the LOQ 15 with the RTX 5060 outperformed the Razer Blade 14 with the RTX 5070 in my tests. If performance is what you care about, save your money and buy the LOQ 15. These games were tested without Nvidia's DLSS or ray tracing on, showing the raw performance of the system. While I wished it could get over 60 frames per second in games like Marvel Rivals and Monster Hunter Wilds at Ultra settings, I walked away impressed by the performance. It can handle more or less any game at decent frame rates and image quality, as long as you're willing to tweak the settings a bit.

Because it's in the same price range, it's worth mentioning that this is a big step up from the RTX 5050 laptops out there. For example, this Lenovo LOQ 15 performs 40 percent better in the 3DMark Steel Nomad benchmark than the MSI Cyborg A15 with the RTX 5050 I tested it against. The LOQ 15 is also really good at managing heat, keeping the palm rests cool even during long gaming sessions.

Battery life is decent. It only comes with a 60-watt-hour battery, unfortunately, but it lasted for a little under nine hours in my local video playback test. That's in line with other gaming laptops, but toward the back of the pack. That battery length is cut in half when using the laptop for heavier applications or multitasking, but you'll be able to spend a few hours away from the wall when needed.

I always say that you should lower your expectations when shopping for a gaming laptop under $1,000, but the Lenovo LOQ 15 surprised me. The quality of the display, combined with the solid performance, makes it the best gaming laptop you can buy under $1,000, and the option many people should consider first before spending more.

As this year's Oscar nominations rolled out this morning, I told my boyfriend that Sinners, with 16 noms in total, had made history. “Woke is back,” he replied.

He was joking (don't come for him!), but his quip highlights a pretty stark dichotomy. Last year, as everyone from President Donald Trump down harped on about the perils of DEI, the biggest cultural breakthroughs—Sinners, KPop Demon Hunters, Heated Rivalry, One Battle After Another—all showcased diversity in fresh ways. And it succeeded. These works weren't just popular among leftists or critics, they were bona fide cultural phenomena.

Sinners, a horror movie set in the Jim Crow South, used vampires as a metaphorical device to explore systemic racism and cultural theft—and director Ryan Coogler scored a feat in his deal with Warner Bros. that gives him the rights to the film in 25 years. KPop Demon Hunters, a story by a female Korean-Canadian director who'd been waiting over a decade for her chance to direct a feature, placed a huge emphasis on authenticity and brought the already-massive subculture around K-pop even more into the mainstream. Heated Rivalry, a small Canadian television production picked up by HBO, had an extremely subversive take on hockey by chronicling the horny-yet-poignant love story between two closeted pro players. And One Battle After Another—decried by conservative commentators who felt it lionized left-wing violence—offered complicated views on motherhood and activism while skewering ICE-like agent Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw and his desperate attempts to fit in with other racists.

In a year when the White House issued multiple executive orders doing away with DEI programs in the federal government, the successes of those projects felt like a form of resistance. Corporate media followed Trump's suit, with Warner Bros. Discovery, Amazon, Paramount Global, and Disney all reportedly scaling back on their diversity efforts. Skydance, founded by David Ellison, son of billionaire Trump supporter Larry Ellison, acquired Paramount, which briefly removed Jimmy Kimmel from the air due to his joke about Charlie Kirk supporters and gave CBS News a seemingly conservative makeover. Meanwhile, shows that offered red meat in the form of farmers, grumpy MAGA adherents, cowboys, and Christian values were greenlit and promoted.

“There is a feeling from ... this administration that the only stories that matter are stories of straight white men, and that is just simply not the case,” says Jenni Werner, executive artistic director of the New Harmony Project, which develops theater, film, and TV projects and says it is committed to anti-oppressive and anti-racist values.

“Audiences want to feel transformed. You want to be able to sit down and watch something, whether it's in your home or in a theater, that takes you into a new place and maybe gives you a new understanding of something.” She adds that she has faith that artists will keep making “boundary-pushing work,” even if it keeps getting harder.

Even before Trump's second term, trying to get out-of-the-box stories made in Hollywood has been a slog. According to UCLA's Hollywood Diversity Report, released last February, nearly 80 percent of directors of theatrical movies in 2024 were white, along with about 75 percent of leading actors.

The report also suggests this discrepancy is leaving money on the table, noting that BIPOC moviegoers “were overrepresented as ticket buyers for films that had casts of more than 20 percent BIPOC.” Sinners grossed $368 million at the box office, a feat that puts it in the “horror hall of fame,” per The New York Times.

Less diversity also means less buzz, according to a UCLA report on diversity in television, released in December.

“If a show features some kind of underrepresented story, such as a women-centered story, the median total interactions for these shows were talked about on social media more than five times than shows without,” said Michael Tran, sociologist and coauthor of the diversity report, in a press release about the research.

With media conglomeration increasingly turning the industry into one big network in a MAGA hat, it's hard to know if Hollywood will get the message. (To that end: Paramount Skydance is currently on a quest to outbid Netflix and take over Warner Bros.)

In December, I asked Wicked director Jon Chu, who had just signed a three-year deal with Paramount Skydance, whether he was worried about Ellison's DEI crackdown. Chu's decision to cast Cynthia Erivo, a Black woman, as Elpheba was just one of the controversial calls he has made in a career that has championed diversity. His response, essentially, was that money talks.

“The thing about the box office, which I love about movie theaters, is that reviewers can say whatever they want, people in a conference room can say whatever they want, business affairs can say whatever the fuck they want,” he said. “But when you put it in a movie theater, if it makes money, if it creates a cultural phenomenon, it becomes a fact, then there's nothing you can say about it. There's no more argument.”

The Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics will be a magnet for all types of online threat actors, from nation-state spooks to petty scam artists, according to a report released Monday by Palo Alto Networks.

Attackers will include ransomware gangs, predicted the report by Palo Alto's Unit 42, its threat intelligence and incident response group.

“Ransomware is just one type of financial crime that will likely be conducted during the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games,” the researchers at Unit 42 reported. “Scams and phishing campaigns against attendees will be common, using fake websites, bogus QR codes, fraudulent apps, and other tools to scam victims out of their cash.”

Events like the Winter Games create ideal conditions for disruption because even a minor outage can cause broadcast interruptions, entry delays at venues, and transportation chaos, commented Mike Carr, a field CTO at Xona, a provider of secure remote access for critical infrastructure in Hanover, Md. “Attackers know defenders have low tolerance for downtime, making extortion more effective,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Nation-state actors will also be getting in on the action, as well as hacktivists.

“Celebrities, politicians, and business leaders will likely be in attendance,” the report explained. “Well-resourced nation-state actors may take advantage of this rare opportunity for close access and mount sophisticated attacks to compromise and surveil these VIPs and/or their staff. The stakes are high, in terms of strategic intelligence and impact.”

“The global geopolitical scene is rife with conflict,” the report added. “The Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games draw billions of eyes. For hacktivist groups, perhaps no occasion offers as much exposure and publicity for their ideology.”

The report pointed out that the sheer volume of people, systems, money, and data surrounding the 2026 Winter Games creates a target-rich environment for attackers. “Cybercriminals may cast a wide net with their scams and phishing campaigns,” it noted. “Like a futbol striker, making one out of a thousand attempts can make the difference.”

“The large number of athletes and fans, the computer and security systems involved, their related data, and the large amount of money spent on such an event make it a popular target,” added Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy, a publisher of online consumer security and privacy guides.

In addition to scams, he identified other tools that threat actors might deploy at the Games. “Deepfakes and other types of misinformation could be used to discredit Olympic officials and executives, athletes, and other high-profile attendees at the events,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Global events like the Winter Olympics create the perfect cover for cybercriminals, added Diana Rothfuss, global solutions strategy director for risk, fraud, and compliance at SAS, an analytics and artificial intelligence software company in Cary, N.C.

“The volume of digital activity around such events skyrockets with ticketing, travel, streaming, and payments,” she told TechNewsWorld. “That noise makes it much easier for scammers to exploit overburdened systems and distracted consumers. Criminals can blend their illicit activities into high traffic volumes and social buzz, which makes detection more challenging.”

“AI only continues to raise the stakes,” she added. “Europol warns that AI-driven cybercrime is evolving into a digital arms race, where attackers can scale and automate scams faster than ever.”

Rothfuss expects to see a full spectrum of scams at the Winter Games, from fake ticket sites to bogus streaming links to impersonation scams. “With the advance of generative AI, fraudsters can now spin up convincing fake apps, websites, donation pages, and athlete ‘fundraisers' in minutes,” she said.

Phishing attempts will increase, she predicted, with scammers sending emails pretending to be from official Olympic organizations, airlines, or hotels, asking for personal information or payment details.

Impersonation scams involving athletes, staff, and even vendors will also surge as criminals mimic Olympic officials, national teams, or sponsors to solicit fees or sensitive information that can be exploited to commit other crimes, she continued.

Rothfuss warned that charity or humanitarian fraud-type scams tied to athlete foundations or national causes will also pop up. “They'll embed a heavy emotional pull, preying on people's goodwill and the spirit of global unity inspired throughout the Games,” she said.

She also cautioned to watch out for illicit links promising free Olympics coverage that instead deliver malware or enable credential harvesting. “Keep in mind that modern scams don't target the transaction anymore, they target the person,” she explained. “Social engineering is the real threat, and all [kinds] of scams will see a boost from social engineering tactics.”

“Fake ticketing and travel scams will proliferate as fraudsters set up convincing but bogus sites selling tickets, accommodations, and transportation,” she added.

“Olympic-related scams aren't just about fake tickets. They're about context and timing,” observed Gabriel Friedlander, CEO of Wizer, a cybersecurity awareness training company in Boston.

“When you post that you're traveling, attackers know you're out of the office and may contact your team pretending to be you,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“If you vent on social media about a flight or hotel issue, scammers can jump in posing as ‘official support' to steal credentials or payment details,” he continued. “They may call hotels claiming to be the front desk with a ‘payment problem,' or use public announcements, sponsorship news, or even finals appearances to craft convincing spear-phishing emails and meeting invites.”

“At the extreme end, nation-state actors can exploit travel and networking events to approach targets under the guise of sponsors or partners, while others spin up fake apps in minutes or deploy rogue Wi-Fi to infect phones and track movements,” he added. “Big events don't just attract fans, they attract attackers who thrive on urgency, visibility, and trust.”

Phishing and online scams are two of the biggest cyberthreats to fans, noted Darren Guccione, CEO of Keeper Security, a password management and online storage company in Chicago. “Leading up to, and throughout the event, cybercriminals may send phishing emails or text messages with malicious links or attachments disguised as updates on certain events and medal counts,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown sources.”

He added that scammers may also use social media to learn more about you or request money. “They may impersonate a friend or family member claiming to be in urgent need of money to buy tickets or place bets, or even impersonate the athletes themselves,” he warned.

Guccione also advised that, in addition to being wary of fake tickets, fans should be careful about fake contests that promise large prizes to winners. “Once they collect your entry fee or personal information, scammers will disappear, and the winners never receive their prizes,” he said.

Threat actors can be a nettlesome problem for the enterprise during the Olympics, too. “Cybercriminals know employees will be streaming events and engaging on mobile devices during the Olympics,” explained Krishna Vishnubhotla, vice president of product strategy at Zimperium, a mobile security company based in Dallas. “Fake betting apps, fraudulent login pages, and malicious streaming links can easily bypass traditional security layers.”

“Enterprises must take a mobile-first approach to security, ensuring threats are detected in real-time before they impact users or corporate networks,” he told TechNewsWorld. “With employees engaging in Olympics-related activities on mobile devices, security blind spots increase. Cybercriminals take advantage of this with phishing attacks, fake apps, and malicious links that traditional security solutions often miss.”

He recommended businesses implement mobile security that continuously monitors for threats — on and offline — to keep both devices and corporate data safe.

“Events like the Olympics are typically surrounded by meticulous planning, strong security controls, and well-designed redundancy,” observed Martin Jartelius, AI product director at Outpost24, a continuous threat exposure management company. “Organizers know they have the eyes of the world on them and generally prepare accordingly.”

“Overall, most activity will focus on exploiting public attention rather than directly attacking Olympic infrastructure,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Scams and financially motivated cybercrime tend to follow visibility and opportunity, while the core systems of the Games are typically well defended and closely monitored.”

“The biggest risk isn't just technical, it's psychological,” added Ensar Seker, CISO of SOCRadar, a threat intelligence company in Newark, Del.

“Attackers exploit urgency, excitement, and trust in well-known brands,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Organizations involved in the Olympics should assume they are targets, harden their digital perimeter, and actively monitor for brand abuse, impersonation, and emerging threat narratives throughout the event.”

New year, new Startup Radar.

We're back with our regular spotlight on early stage startups sprouting up in the Seattle region. For this edition, we're featuring Axel AI, DrunR, Eluum, and profileAPI.

Read on for brief descriptions of each company — along with pitch assessments from “Mean VC,” a GPT-powered critic offering a mix of encouragement and constructive criticism.

Check out past Startup Radar posts here, and email me at [email protected] to flag other companies and startup news.

Founded: 2024

The business: A self-described “reasoning layer” for retail media sales teams that aims to translate messy data into commercial narratives and proposals. The idea is to help sales teams spend less time on manual analysis and preparation. The bootstrapped company officially launched its MVP at CES and NRF 2026 earlier this month.

Leadership: CEO and co-founder Bobby Figueroa previously founded Gradient, another Seattle-based commerce insights company that was acquired by Criteo. He was also an exec at Amazon. Axel's leadership and advisory team includes former sales and advertising leaders at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

Mean VC: “You're targeting a real friction point — sales teams juggling fragmented data with limited time to craft a compelling narrative. The pedigree helps, but long-term success will hinge on whether your product drives actual revenue lift, not just cleaner decks. I'd focus on embedding directly into the sales team's existing workflow — don't make users open another tool, make yours the one that quietly does the heavy lifting behind the scenes.”

Founded: 2024

The business: A nutrition app that provides personalized guidance based on users' goals and preferences, particularly while dining out or ordering food online. DrunR is running a closed beta in Seattle with restaurants and users, including people using GLP-1 medication. The startup is part of the WTIA Founder Cohort 13 program.

Leadership: Founder and CEO Yaya Ali is a financial analyst at Perkins Coie and previously worked for King County and Amazon. He also has food operations experience. David Greene, the company's CTO, is a software engineer at Capital One and previously worked at Moody's.

Mean VC: “The intersection of nutrition, personalization, and GLP-1s is timely — especially as eating habits shift alongside new weight-loss drugs. The challenge will be making the app feel essential day-to-day, not just ‘nice to have' after a restaurant meal or clinic visit. I'd zero in on a high-frequency use case — something that keeps users opening the app daily, not just when they're thinking about dinner.”

Founded: 2024

The business: A new take on social media with a product that helps people organize their personal memories, stories, and digital artifacts into one user-controlled system. Built on community-driven moderation and works across different platforms. The bootstrapped company is onboarding early users and plans to launch a MVP later this year. 

Leadership: CEO and co-founder Bilkay Rose was a VP at tax software company Avalara and a director at Clearwire. Other co-founders include CTO Dale Rector, who spent three decades at Microsoft, and Jennifer Gianola, also a former exec at Avalara. 

Mean VC: “The concept taps into a real emotional need — people are overwhelmed by digital clutter and increasingly skeptical of algorithm-driven feeds. The key will be showing how your platform earns daily use without relying on dopamine loops. I'd push to define a sharp use case first — memory curation is broad, so lead with one thing people urgently want to preserve, then expand once you've earned their trust.”

Founded: 2024

The business: A business data layer for developers building AI-native chat, copilot, and agentic tools for go-to-market. Its platform tracks more than 10,000 signals across more than 10 million companies and 500 million professionals. The company, which was previously a sales AI agent product called Truebase, has raised $2 million in funding. 

Leadership: Founder and CEO Wissam Tabbara has sold two startups and spent more than six years at Microsoft in the 2000s. 

Mean VC: “The shift from product to platform is smart — selling infrastructure to power GTM copilots has stronger upside than building another agent. But you'll need to show that your data isn't just broad, but relevant and timely enough to drive meaningful in-app decisions. I'd focus on becoming the plug-and-play GTM brain — make integration dead simple, and let other tools build magic on top of your stack.”

Microsoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, Forbes reported on Friday.

Many modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is enabled by default. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off. 

But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft's cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.

The case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects' hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker. 

A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year. 

Apart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft's cloud infrastructure — something that has happened several times in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.

“It's 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a post on Bluesky. “Microsoft's inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has signed a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to form a majority American-owned joint venture to keep the social app operating in the U.S. The deal ends a six-year political saga that started in 2020 when President Donald Trump tried to ban the app over national security concerns during his first term.

Adam Presser, who was TikTok's head of operations and trust and safety, will be the CEO of TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. TikTok CEO Shou Chew will serve as a director. 

The venture's three managing investors, Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment company MGX, will each hold a 15% stake. Other investors include Michael Dell's family investment firm, along with several smaller investors.

TikTok USDS Joint Venture “will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,” TikTok said. 

The joint venture will operate as an independent entity governed by seven members. In addition to Chew, the board includes Timothy Dattels of TPG Global, Mark Dooley of Susquehanna International Group, Egon Durban, co-CEO of Silver Lake, Raul Fernandez, CEO of DXC Technology, Kenneth Glueck of Oracle, and David Scott of MGX.

Trump celebrated the deal in a post on Truth Social, stating that the app “will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice.”

Tesla has discontinued Autopilot, its basic driver-assistance system, as the company tries to boost adoption of a more advanced version of the technology that it calls Full Self-Driving (Supervised).

The decision comes as the company faces a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in its largest U.S. market, California. A judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD for years. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.

Autopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves. 

Tesla's online configuration site now states new cars now come standard with only Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It's not clear if current customers are affected.

The decision comes one week after the company said that starting on February 14, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software's capabilities improve.

Musk believes that Tesla's newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though texting while driving is illegal in almost all states. 

On Thursday, Tesla rolled out the first robotaxi versions of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company's driving software and are still followed by the company's cars for supervision.

Tesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla's chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” required for Musk to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. Tesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s after talks broke down between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant's then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on all of its vehicles in April 2019.

Across the decade-plus of Autopilot's existence, Tesla struggled with communicating the software's capabilities. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning to visit India in mid-February, his first visit to the country in nearly a year, TechCrunch has learned. The visit comes as New Delhi prepares to host a major AI summit expected to draw top executives from Meta, Google, and Anthropic.

India is hosting its first major AI event — the India AI Impact Summit 2026 — in New Delhi between February 16 and 20, bringing together global technology leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei alongside key Indian business figures like Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, per the summit's website. Altman is not currently listed as a confirmed attendee.

But TechCrunch has learned that OpenAI is separately planning to host closed-door meetings on the sidelines of the summit in New Delhi, where Altman is expected to be present. The company is also hosting an OpenAI event in New Delhi on February 19, with venture capitalists and industry executives invited, one person familiar with the matter said.

Altman's visit has not been publicly announced and plans could still change, the sources said.

Several other U.S. companies are also planning side events around the summit week. Anthropic is hosting a developers' day in Bengaluru on February 16, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Nvidia is also set to hold an evening event in New Delhi during the summit week, people familiar with the plans told TechCrunch. (The GPU maker did not respond to requests for comment.) The cluster of events underscores how global AI firms are seeking to engage India's enterprise customers, startup ecosystem, and developer community.

The trip would mark Altman's first visit to India in nearly a year, after he traveled to the country in February 2025. Altman had previously said he planned to return later in 2025 following OpenAI's August announcement of a New Delhi office, but that trip did not take place.

Altman's visit also comes as India has emerged as a key growth market for American AI companies. In recent months, Anthropic announced an office in Bengaluru and named former Microsoft India managing director Irina Ghose as its local head, while Google and Perplexity have struck partnerships with Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, respectively, to bundle premium AI subscriptions for millions of telecom users.

OpenAI has been expanding its India presence in recent months, hiring across enterprise sales, technical deployment, and legal roles focused on AI regulation. The company is currently listing openings in New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. India has emerged as ChatGPT's biggest market by downloads and second largest by users. Still, OpenAI has faced challenges converting that demand into paid subscriptions, introducing a lower-priced “ChatGPT Go” plan last year priced under $5 and offering it free for a year to drive uptake.

Altman is expected to meet key tech executives, startup founders, and government officials during the trip, the sources said, as OpenAI looks to expand ChatGPT's enterprise adoption while still broadening its reach as a mass-market product. The company has been engaging with multiple sectors in India, including education and media, the people added.

OpenAI is also looking at India as a potential base for infrastructure expansion, the sources said. Last year, both Google and Microsoft announced multibillion-dollar investments in India to expand their AI and cloud footprint. But India's data-center ambitions face constraints, including uneven power availability, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating costs for cloud providers.

Still, the Indian government is hopeful that the upcoming summit will cement India's status as a destination for large-scale AI investment. The country's IT minister said in a recent interview that the event could help attract as much as $100 billion in investment. The federal government is also pushing domestic startups to build smaller models for local use cases, eventually reducing reliance on U.S.-based systems.

OpenAI, India's IT ministry, and the AI summit's organizers did not respond to requests for comment.

The idea of streams as a cloud storage primitive resonated with a lot of folks, but not having an open source option was a sticking point for adoption – especially from projects that were themselves open source! So we decided to build it: https://github.com/s2-streamstore/s2s2-lite is MIT-licensed, written in Rust, and uses SlateDB (https://slatedb.io) as its storage engine. SlateDB is an embedded LSM-style key-value database on top of object storage, which made it a great match for delivering the same durability guarantees as s2.dev.You can specify a bucket and path to run against an object store like AWS S3 — or skip to run entirely in-memory. (This also makes it a great emulator for dev/test environments).Why not just open up the backend of our cloud service? s2.dev has a decoupled architecture with multiple components running in Kubernetes, including our own K8S operator – we made tradeoffs that optimize for operation of a thoroughly multi-tenant cloud infra SaaS. With s2-lite, our goal was to ship something dead simple to operate. There is a lot of shared code between the two that now lives in the OSS repo.A few features remain (notably deletion of resources and records), but s2-lite is substantially ready. Try the Quickstart in the README to stream Star Wars using the s2 CLI!The key difference between S2 vs a Kafka or Redis Streams: supporting tons of durable streams. I have blogged about the landscape in the context of agent sessions (https://s2.dev/blog/agent-sessions#landscape). Kafka and NATS Jetstream treat streams as provisioned resources, and the protocols/implementations are oriented around such assumptions. Redis Streams and NATS allow for larger numbers of streams, but without proper durability.The cloud service is completely elastic, but you can also get pretty far with lite despite it being a single-node binary that needs to be scaled vertically. Streams in lite are ""just keys"" in SlateDB, and cloud object storage is bottomless – although of course there is metadata overhead.One thing I am excited to improve in s2-lite is pipelining of writes for performance (already supported behind a knob, but needs upstream interface changes for safety). It's a technique we use extensively in s2.dev. Essentially when you are dealing with high latencies like S3, you want to keep data flowing throughout the pipe between client and storage, rather than go lock-step where you first wait for an acknowledgment and then issue another write. This is why S2 has a session protocol over HTTP/2, in addition to stateless REST.You can test throughput/latency for lite yourself using the `s2 bench` CLI command. The main factors are: your network quality to the storage bucket region, the latency characteristics of the remote store, SlateDB's flush interval (`SL8_FLUSH_INTERVAL=..ms`), and whether pipelining is enabled (`S2LITE_PIPELINE=true` to taste the future).I'll be here to get thoughts and feedback, and answer any questions!

Adding a database, multiple components, and Kubernetes to the equation seems like massively overengineering.What value does S2 provide that simple TCP sockets do not?Is this for like ""making your own Twitch"" or something, where streams have to scale to thousands-to-millions of consumers?

ED: no k8s required for s2-lite, it is just a singe binary. It was an architectural note about our cloud service.

So you frame the data into records, save the frame somehow (maybe with fsync if you're doing it locally, or maybe you outsource it to S3 or S3-compatible storage?), then ack and start sending it to clients.  Therefore every frame that's acked or sent to clients has already been saved.Personally I'd add an application level hash to protect the integrity of the records but that's just me.At first glance I wondered if a hash chain or Merkle tree might be useful but I think it's overkill.  What exactly is the trust model?  I get the sense this is a traditional client-server protocol (i.e., not p2p).  Does it stream the streams over HTTP / HTTPS, or some custom protocol?  Are s2 clients expected to be end-user web browsers, other instances of s2 or something else?

Are s2 clients expected to be end-user web browsers, other instances of s2 or something else?

Regarding S2 generally (not just s2-lite), the intent behind it is to turn the core data structure from streaming platforms (like Kafka) into a serverless primitive -- kinda similar to what object storage did for file storage.So if you are already in the world of working with streaming platforms, S2 gives you a simpler API, bottomless storage (S2 itself uses object storage for durability), and no limits on the quantity of streams you can create and work with. Streams also all have URIs and are directly accessible over REST with granular access controls.This enables new types of patterns for working with streams, other than just the traditional ones where people typically reach for streaming platforms (like CDC, ETL pipelines, etc). An agent can have its own stream to serialize state onto, for instance; you can use a stream as a durable transport layer -- e.g., you want to reliably provide a flow of data (tokens from a model, financial ticker data, etc) to a user and allow them to resume from exactly where they left off if they are disconnected, for instance; you could use streams as a durable ingest buffer, for collecting data that will eventually reside in an OLAP like Clickhouse.

The durability is for being able to replay the stream, a hash will not let you reconstruct the original message(s).If you just need ephemeral comms, making it persistent is indeed overkill. But reliability challenges often come up with seemingly ephemeral comms too – think streaming responses from an LLM. The last mile can be pretty flaky e.g. iOS will cancel connections when users background an app. Using a durable stream for persisting the tokens means a client can ask to resume from where it left off / from the beginning of the stream, and the data would be available without having to re-inference.

Yes, this can be a good building block for broadcasting data streams.s2-lite is single node, so to scale to that level, you'd need to add some CDN-ing on top.s2.dev is the elastic cloud service, and it supports high fanout reads using Cachey (https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment/comments/1nh1go...)

And it has the durability of object storage rather than just local. SlateDB actually lets you also use local FS, will experiment with plumbing up the full range of options - right now it's just in-memory or S3-compatible bucket.> So I'd try so share as much of the frontend code (e.g. the GRPC and REST handlers) as possible between these.Right on, this is indeed the case.

I have had an AI assistant reverse engineer a complex TCP protocol (3-simultaneous connections each with a different purpose, all binary stuff) from a bunch of PCAPs and then build a working Python server to speak that protocol to a 20-year-old Windows XP client.

In the original design, the beams of the fourth-floor walkway had to support the weight of the fourth-floor walkway, with the weight of the second-floor walkway supported completely by the rods.

I genuinely feel less nervous about working on those categories of software if I can bring coding agents along for the ride, because I'm confident I can use those tools to help me write software that's safer and less likely to have critical bugs.Armed with coding agents I can get to 100% test coverage, and perform things like fuzz testing, and get second and third opinions on designs, and have conversations about failure patterns that I may not personally have considered.For me, coding agents represent the ability for me to use techniques that were previously constrained by my time.

They can also help reduce the number of devs a company needs to operate and arguably reduce the skill level needed to generate software changes that provide business value. While it is true that these tools could lead to companies keeping the staff count and increasing productivity, the reality is that the productivity increase from these tools isn't big enough to offset the big dev team expense while the tools are argubly increasing productivity high enough that you can do more with less.And yes, companies laying off folks because AI might suffer in the next decade or two.

I am not outsourcing my understanding to the LLM, I am outsourcing the typing of the code.What you are describing is not engineering, it's (pardon the phrase) vibe coding. Claude Code is just a tool, and everyone is going to use that tool differently. There is nothing inherent in the tool itself that requires you to surrender your agency and understanding. If you do, that's on you, not Claude.

My point is, though, it occurred to me why he's excited about it. He has no ability whatsoever to write music in notes, or song lyrics. But with his tool, he's able to make music that he finds decent enough to feel excited about helping to shape it.No criticism to those who can't do a thing on their own, but are excited to be able to do it with a tool. And yes, you can certainly elaborate on and debate craftsmanship, and the benchmarks and measures of quality of an end result when made through expert skill and care, or by amateurs with a powerful (and perhaps imperfect or imprecise) tool.So personal anecdote, using generative code has not interested me personally, because I love writing code, and I'm very good at it, and I'm very fast. Of course machines can do things faster than me (once I learn the different skill of prompting), but speed hasn't really been a massively limiting factor for me when trying to build things. (There are lots of other things that can get in my way!)I'm reminded of the oft used quote, ""He who can, does; he who cannot, teaches"" - George Bernard Shaw.

I'm as critical of AI code generation as the next guy, but unfortunately we live in a world of lots of accidental complexity forced on us, and it's not surprising that a lot of people are simply relieved that they can leave some of the boring and frankly exhausting footwork to collect all the necessary boilerplate to some assistant. That allows them to focus on high level understanding and the actual creative part, rather than the opposite, as OP suggests here.

This comes with the assumption that everyone is vibe coding. Which just isn't the case in the professional circles I'm part of. People are steering tools and putting up guard rails to save time typing. The “creating” part of coding has very little to do with the code, in fact my perspective is that it's the most insignificant part of creating software.At the end of the day, how code gets into a pr doesn't matter. A human should be responsible to review, correct, and validate the code.

FWIW I find these statements trivializing of the craft and the passion. Some of us do like the craft of creating a massive structure that we understand from the pylons to the nuts and bolts. Reviewing AI-generated code doesn't bring us close to the understanding of the problem that comes from having solved the problem ourselves.If this level of detail-orientation doesn't interest you, that's fine, and it perhaps shouldn't bother you to have someone say that? We can agree these are subjective values.

I'd much rather get into the intricacies of the business use cases, game mechanics, architectural paradigms, than to focus on typing something I've done dozens of times before. I think that's where I'm at with it.

reply

OK, in that case you make a fair point. I'm not averse to the typing autocompletion either. But most of the work I've been involved with has been research-oriented where the AI's offer to help solve the problem is neither welcome nor useful. So it's a different orientation altogether.

I, personally, don't understand what it is people enjoy about using these tools. I find them tedious, boring, and they often make me angry: subtle bugs and outright lies in the output and no prompt can resolve the problem so I end up having to fix it by hand anyway. It's not pleasant for me.But other people do and while I don't get it I try not to yuck in their yum too much.There is no empathy from companies though. They don't care about code and never have.They should though. Every line of code is a liability. And now we have tools that can generate liability on demand faster than a team of dedicated humans who are trying to be conservative about managing that liability. You still have to be careful of course but now you're taking responsibility for what the machine generates. You're not the one driving anymore and using a tool. You're a tool being used. At least, that's how I feel about it.Of course to capital holders and investors this doesn't matter, so we may end up being forced to use these tools even if they're not sufficient or useful. Even if they generate liability. We're rather good, as an industry, at deflecting the consequences of liability.

Not necessarily. I sometimes have a very clear vision of what I want to build, all the architecture, design choices, etc. It's simply easier to formalize a detailed design/spec document + code review if everthing follow what I had in mind, than typing everything myself.It's like the ""bucket"" tool in Paint. You don't always need to click pixel by pixel if you already know what you want to fill.

Whatever your design document/spec, there are generally a lot of ways and variations of how to implement it, and programmers like the OP do care about those.You don't have Paint perform the flood fill five times and then pick the result you like the most (or dislike the least).

You could make the same argument about compilers : whatever is the code you wrote, your compiler may produce assembly instructions in an undeterministic way.Of course, there are many ways to write the same thing, but the end performance is usually the same (assuming you know what you are doing).If your spec is strong enough to hold between different variations, you shouldn't need to worry about the small details.

reply

The difference is that the compiler is bound by formal (or quasi-formal) language semantics. In terms of language semantics, you always get precisely the same result, regardless of how the compiler implements it. When you change the source code, you can reason and predict with precision about how this will change the behavior of your compiled program. You can't do that reasoning with AI prompts, they don't have that level of predictability.

reply

Bit of a stretch, I think, because the compiler guarantees it will follow the language spec. The LLM will be influenced by your spec but there are no guarantees.

For instance, I use a React form library called Formik. It's outdated and hasn't seen a real commit in years. The industry has moved onto other form libraries, but I really like Formik's api and have built quite a bit of functionality around it. And while I don't necessarily need a library to be actively worked on to use it, in this instance, it's lack of updates have caused it to fall behind in terms of performance and new React features.The issue is that I'm also building a large, complex project and spend 80-90% of my waking time on that. So what do I do? Do I just accept it and move on? Take the time to migrate to a form library that very well be out-of-date in a year when React releases again? Or, do I experiment with Claude by asking it to update Formik to using the latest React 19 features? Long story short, I did the latter and have a new version of Formik running in my app. And during that, I got to watch and ask Claude what updates it was making and most importantly, why it was making those updates. Is it perfect? No. But it's def better than before.I love programming. I love building stuff. That doesn't change for me with these tools. I still spend most of my time hand-writing code. But that doesn't mean there isn't a place for this tech.

For a second thing, I don't think doing the manual labor of playing a smarter dependabot is as valuable as you think it is. Formik still has 3 million weekly downloads with its latest release being 2 months old, why don't you upstream your changes?

For a second thing, I don't think doing the manual labor of playing a smarter dependabot is as valuable as you think it is. Formik still has 3 million weekly downloads with its latest release being 2 months old, why don't you upstream your changes?

This is straight from the article: ""People who love using AI to create software are loving it because they don't value the act of creating & understanding the software."" 
How is my response that this is missing the point wrong? I have no personal feelings about AI. I don't ""love"" it. And I also value the act of creating and understanding software, but I don't have the time to do all of that.

Hold up, does this mean outlook sends your full credentials to Microsoft when you try to set up an outlook account? I'm sure they pinky promise they keep your credentials secure, but this feels like it breaks all sorts of security/privacy expectations.

Not just an “outlook account” - any account in outlook, with default settings at least.I run a mail server, mainly for me but a couple of friends have accounts on there too, and a while ago one friend reported apparently being locked out and it turned out that it was due to them switching Outlook versions and it was connecting via a completely different address to those that my whitelists expected sometimes at times when they weren't even actively using Outlook. Not only were active connections due to their interactive activity being proxied, but the IMAP credentials were stored so the MS server could login to check things whenever it wanted (I assume the intended value-add there is being able to send new mail notifications on phones/desktops even when not actively using mail?).> but this feels like it breaks all sorts of security/privacy expectations.It most certainly does. The behaviour can be tamed somewhat, but (unless there have been recent changes) is fully enabled by default in newer Outlook variants.The above-mentioned friend migrated his mail to some other service in a huf as I refused to open my whitelist to “any old host run by MS” and he didn't want to dig in to how to return behaviour back to the previous “local connections only, not sending credentials off elsewhere where they might be stored”.

It looks like Microsoft Edge had the _ability to disable_ this added in 2020 or 2021, but it isn't currently the default and the Group Policy unintuitively only applies to unencrypted HTTP Connections.

Are you talking about NTLM hashes? It's a weak hash, but not the same as ""sending your password"". The biggest difference is that even a weak hash can't be reversed if the password has high enough entropy.

Already many years ago I remember installing a firewall on my phone and noticing in surprise that Outlook was not connecting at all to my private mail server, but instead only sending my credentials to their cloud and downloading messages from there.The only Android mail client not making random calls to cloud servers was (back then) K-9 Mail.

It's like when .dev became a gTLD, knowingly breaking a bunch of setups for a mix of vanity and a cash grab. Obviously dropped the ball on the engineering side.

reply

But also, yes Microsoft documentation used .local before mDNS reserved it, and IIRC Microsoft was also involved in suggesting it for mDNS as mDNS came out of the multi-company standardization efforts from Apple's Bonjour. That said, my impression of most of that documentation from that time is that it was incorrectly using .local as a fake TLD where they should have been using .example or .example.com and also pointing people to the RFCs that those were not valid choices in a real setup. A problem with such documentation is that it is too easy to take literally. A follow up problem was sort of the ""accidental security through obscurity"" benefits of using non-globally resolvable addresses becomes ""best practice"" through essentially stubbornness and status quo (related to all the recent rediscussions on HN about NAT44 is not a firewall except by accident and you can have very good firewalls that aren't NAT44).

reply

Support patiently explained .local is reserved for something else and kindly provided Wikipedia links.They never responded why they used .local in their docs, trainings, webinars they provided, though :)

I always use the ISO-3166 ""user-assigned"" 2-letter codes (AA, QM-QZ, XA-XZ, ZZ), with the theory being that ISO-3166 Maintenance Agency getting international consensus to move those codes back to regular country codes will take longer than the heat death of the universe, so using them for internal domains is probably safe.

Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters, summarises its mechanisms and intent quite succinctly: “This is the path that Viktor Orbán took in Hungary, where you use the power of the state to ensure that the media is compliant, that outlets are either curbed and become much less willing to be critical, or they are sold to owners who will make that happen.""

- Do something wildly unacceptable- Media writes an article declaring the action is indefensible- Those involved complain publicly about the unfair nature of the story; their supporters back them up- Next time to avoid controversy media writes a slightly more fair storyIt doesn't even require state power because technically in the US they cannot. There is clearly threat of power kicking journalists out of the  pentagon is a clear example. But it's much more about creating a permission structure through public airing of grievances.

Democrats, too. They, collectively, made decisions that allowed a guy like Trump to win, twice. They screamed about the risks every day, but that was only a campaign tactic. It was massively selfish and incompetent for them not to make major policy pivots with the goal of just annihilating Trump and his movement. Instead they just treated it as a regular election, where the goal was to eek out a victory for their partisans.When when you say your opponent is a fascist, it's time to tell your partisans to be quiet, and expand your tent massively.> This is precisely the thing they voted for.Come on, that's obviously false.

IIRC, Biden hemmed and hawwed on border environment until like a couple months before the election, when he issued some executive orders that actually had an impact.

No.Except that was misunderstanding ""republican voters"" and the energy Trump was tapping into.

- trying to appeal to the ""center"" instead of going the other way and channelling the more radical elements' rage against Trump. I believe Bernie would have beaten Trump as the nominee. Yes, the GOP would have painted him as a ""Communist destroying the American Way of Life"", but they did that to Harris anyway so being centrist gave the Dems nothing.- not focusing on prices and jobs from day one, in simple terms the average uneducated worker could understand, and mostly, trying to say ""things are good/better"" which may have been true, but everyone else thought they were not when they went to buy eggs- Biden trying to stay in for a second term instead of bowing out at the start

It sounds a lot like you actually agree; those are all reasons why every Democrat constituent should be livid with the party ""establishment"". Instead, any time this point is brought up, people respond instantly with the ""it's not a 'both sides' issue"" thought-terminating cliché. In this case, one person says, ""Okay, but obviously the other people shot themselves in the foot"" and the response is ""I disagree, here's how they shot themselves in the foot"".

reply

I think so. Something more in the Sanders direction would have been way better, though with a keener eye towards not alienating working-class folks (like putting a massive student loan forgiveness plan front-and-center did), with Trump's rejection of free-trade dogma, and jettisoning the social justice activism that loses rural areas and many working-class voters.



""Both sides"" is also often a thought-terminating cliche. It is always important to look at the larger context these points are being made in.Here, the original comment was taking individual Republican voters to task for supporting this performatively-cruel societally-destructive con man with a proven track record. This is something that every individual Republican voter directly did, while Democrat voters did not do and would not have ended up doing [had Harris won]. Harris, for all of her faults and would-have-been letdowns, is not a piece of human trash who openly ran on a platform of destroying our society. Reasonable people can disagree with her policies, but she appeared to be poised to at least lead the country rather than deliberately divide us.But the comment responding to that then tried to equivocate that blame to ""both sides"", going so far as to use the word ""collectively"" to try and bootstrap personal responsibility from the (obviously terrible) actions of the Democratic party.And no, that is not an equal criticism in the context of criticizing Republican voters who actively voted for overt evil! The many failings of the Democratic party is something that definitely needs to be discussed, but not in the context of the much larger and more serious problems in the Republican party. Rather, bringing it up here seems like yet another instance of the only-Democrats-have-agency fallacy.(I presume the downvotes without comment are just the same old fascists trying to protect their own egos by continuing to lie to themselves about what they voted for. The funny part is I'm no friend of the Democratic party either - I'm a libertarian who actually believes in many of the issues Trump abuses to rabble-rouse. But my country called, so I swallowed my own independent individualist pride and answered that call rather than falling for the siren song of destructionist grievance politics)

And I a key point is: rejection of Trump is not an endorsement of the Democrats, let alone a full-throated one. A Trump-like Democratic power grab is just as unacceptable to many people, and putting voters in the position of choosing between two unacceptable power grabs to not a recipe for resounding electoral success. It's likely a recipe for failure.

> Others were likely motivated by things Trump is willing to say out loud ... his policies actively make all those problems worseThese two things are not mutually exclusive, but rather they are directly related. Republicans reflexively categorizing people into ""good people"" and ""other"" is exactly what made them not listen to any of the substantive criticism of Trump's ""policies"" in the context of what he claimed they would achieve [0]Racism, misogyny, etc form the main structure of this dynamic, because they are straightforward categories that can be quickly judged. Even without any societal history of racism, it's straightforward to adopt a 90% rule that white -> ingroup, and nonwhite -> outgroup. Since this categorization system now has ""predictive power"" [1], it becomes worth augmenting it with more rules and exceptions. A non-white person can become ""one of the good ones"" by ""acting white"".

These two things are not mutually exclusive, but rather they are directly related.

That said, I think ""Trump's voters are all assholes"" is a talking point NOT of liberal voters, but of the Democratic party, because it conveniently avoids any discussion of policy, particularly where the party and its typical voters may differ.Trade is a good example.  The bipartisan consensus since Clinton has largely been that unfettered trade is good.  However, if you work in manufacturing, or are in a labor pool that competes with former manufacturing workers (or workers who might have chosen a career in manufacturing, or mechanical engineering, or processing engineering), then there are certainly some drawbacks to consider.To be clear: I do not in any way endorse Trump's policy.  I am not trying to discount ""owning the libs"", or violent racism, certainly both motivators for a good chunk of the MAGA camp.  I am saying that it is worth considering policy issues that may have convinced people to vote for him.  Especially if you separate campaigning from implementation.  Trump's foreign policy has been intervention-heavy, but his rhetoric was frequently isolationist.

I agree with what you said, that's definitely a talking point meant to maintain a feeling of righteousness while avoiding self-reflection.I disagree with distinction between the ""Democratic party"" and ""liberal voters,"" if anything, I'd say it's the opposite. By and large, I'd expect the professionals of the party to not be so stupid to use ""Trump's voters are all assholes"" as a talking point (even if they think it). IMHO, it's a talking point of extremely polarized liberal voters, who are letting their emotions get the better of them, and themselves thinking and acting in a more Trump-like manner.Both the party and its voters seem extremely reluctant to think about their role in this, and seem to prefer to continue to make the same mistakes, hoping luck or other-side incompetence brings them a better result next time. It's so stupid.

1. ""Defends"" suggests some level of explanation and justification; the White House did not present any here.2. ""AI image showing arrested woman"" could mean a fully-generated image of a woman, rather than editing an image of an existing person under law enforcement control to disguise the actual facts. The first one would be bizarre, the second one is much more problematic.

In 2026, states will go head to head with the White House's sweeping executive order.

MIT Technology Review's What's Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation. 

Trump's executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren't flinching. On December 19, New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation's first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It's on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump's radar or can't afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won't be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump's bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal. 

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says. 

While AI accelerationists in Trump's orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump's executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It's an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann. 

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump's proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users' age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots. 

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act. 

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They'll follow the crypto industry's playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America's borders, for years to come.

The best and worst thing Wonder Man has going for it is that it's a Marvel show. It's a good thing because, obviously, it's Marvel, which has such a rich history across all media. Lots of great stories to draw from, lots of fond memories, and lots of expectations to live up to. However, the bad thing is that over the past few years, Marvel projects—especially on streaming—have left much to be desired. So, a Marvel show releasing somewhat randomly in late January without any big hoopla could lead you to assume the worst. You could very easily assume that Wonder Man wasn't any good. And, actually, that's true. Wonder Man isn't good. It's freaking fantastic.

Recent Marvel shows have made the conscious decision to, for the most part, detach themselves from the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. The hope is that audiences who haven't seen all the movies or shows could tune in and still enjoy the show on its own. So far, the results have been a mixed bag, but those lofty ambitions reach their purest form with Wonder Man, a show that works on so many other levels before you get to its MCU connections; the fact that it's a Marvel show at all isn't even the point.

In Wonder Man, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II plays Simon Williams, a struggling actor who has reached a point in his career where he's just about ready to give it up. We've all been there. He's tried his best, nothing has worked, and he realizes maybe it's time to face reality and stop chasing an unattainable dream. But, just then, he learns that his favorite movie of all time, a throwback B-grade action movie called Wonder Man, is being remade and its legendary director, Von Kovak (Zlatko Buric), is looking for someone to star. It's the part Simon was born to play, but can he make it happen?

Oh, and Simon has superpowers that he has to hide; otherwise, he'll be automatically denied everything he's ever worked for.

At its heart, that's what Wonder Man is about. It's a show about struggle. About chasing your dreams. About creating relationships that help you get there. That happens in the person of Trevor Slattery, played by Sir Ben Kingsley. Slattery is the show's most obvious and direct connection to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe because he's appeared in both Iron Man 3 and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. And if you know that about him, that's great. But if you don't, it doesn't matter because, as we saw in those movies, Trevor is also a struggling actor, which is why he took the role of the Mandarin in the first place. He meets Simon at an audition; the two bond over their struggles and become fast friends.

And so we live and die with Simon and Trevor's desperate attempts to star in this new mega movie, which, it's probably only a minor spoiler to reveal, eventually happens. And when it happens, Wonder Man becomes about something else. It becomes a story of ultimate wish fulfillment. We marvel, pun intended, as we watch a character we've come to love achieve the most incredible thing he's ever imagined.

However, as you might expect, things don't go smoothly for Simon and Trevor. That's in large part due to Simon's powers, which, if revealed, would cause a big problem. We assume that's because of everything people in this world have been through (the Battle of New York, being snapped out of existence, etc.), but there's more to it. A stunning bottle episode later in the series shows how an actor uses his powers for fame and fortune and why the world will never allow that kind of thing to happen again.

Unfortunately for Simon, though, that is his true self. Yes, he's an actor. Yes, he's a human. But he's also got powers, so he goes through life harboring and hiding this secret that could destroy him, figuratively and literally. And that becomes yet another poignant throughline in Wonder Man: being forced to hide who you really are out of fear.

Simon is a complex character who is portrayed beautifully by Abdul-Mateen II. We're used to seeing the Watchmen and Aquaman actor as an imposing force, and he brings some of that to this role. But, more so, he's able to infuse Simon with a heartbreaking innocence that makes you both root for and cry for him as he goes through these trials and tribulations. The performance is only bolstered in tandem with the Oscar-winning Kingsley, who explores and reveals more about Trevor than ever before. Together, they're a true dynamic duo.

Then, on top of all of that, Wonder Man also works as a show with some meta commentary about Hollywood and superhero fatigue. It's not the point of the show, but it's there. And when you put that together with everything else the show is saying and doing, something happens.

There was a point about six episodes into the eight-episode season where I got a horrible feeling. The show is so good, so smart, and so fun that I got this pit in my stomach that there was no way Marvel could pay everything off by the end of the season. I feared that all the goodwill the show had earned might go away because there was too much left to be resolved. I almost didn't want to watch the rest out of fear that the show would end with some wild cliffhanger for a season two that will never come.

Thankfully, that doesn't happen. While the show does certainly leave the characters places to go if they do return, for the most part, season one of Wonder Man ends perfectly. It builds to a worthy conclusion that wraps up all the major beats in ways that are satisfying on every level.

Basically, Wonder Man is the perfect case study of what Marvel Studios wants to do with its shows. It tells a relatable, enjoyable, emotional story with lots of great superhero specificity that works whether you know the world of Marvel or not. In fact, I'd argue that not knowing what's happening outside of this story might even make the show better. Wonder Man doesn't need Marvel as much as Marvel needs Wonder Man, and if this is all we ever see of these characters, well, that would be the opposite of wonderful. This might just be Marvel's best and most complete show yet.

All eight episodes of Wonder Man drop January 27 on Disney+.

We've all been there. We lost some part of our digital life, perhaps because we accidentally deleted it or a system failed us in some way. Well, a professor in Germany lost a large amount of work recently after changing his settings with OpenAI's ChatGPT, writing about it this week in Nature. But social media users don't seem very sympathetic. In fact, they're now repeatedly dunking on him for using AI in the first place.

Marcel Bucher, a professor of plant sciences at the University of Cologne, writes that he signed up for a paid ChatGPT plan two years ago and found the AI tool tremendously useful.

“Having signed up for OpenAI's subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, I used it as an assistant every day — to write e-mails, draft course descriptions, structure grant applications, revise publications, prepare lectures, create exams and analyse student responses, and even as an interactive tool as part of my teaching,” wrote Bucher.

He acknowledged that ChatGPT, like all large language models, could be inaccurate, but liked it because it could remember the context of conversations, and he valued the “continuity and apparent stability of the workspace.” Then he tinkered with the settings for data consent.

From Nature:

But in August, I temporarily disabled the ‘data consent' option because I wanted to see whether I would still have access to all of the model's functions if I did not provide OpenAI with my data. At that moment, all of my chats were permanently deleted and the project folders were emptied — two years of carefully structured academic work disappeared. No warning appeared. There was no undo option. Just a blank page. Fortunately, I had saved partial copies of some conversations and materials, but large parts of my work were lost forever.

Bucher went on to explain that he initially thought it was a mistake and assumed that he would be able to recover his years of data. He reinstalled the app, tried different browsers, and tinkered with more settings. But nothing worked. He then tried to contact OpenAI but was predictably met with an AI agent, which couldn't help him. He eventually was able to contact a human, but they couldn't help him either. The data was gone.

Again, this is the kind of story that would've likely elicited some sympathy in another era. But here in 2026, when AI is often seen as a slop machine for generating wrong answers and child sexual abuse material, there are more than a few people who will revel in someone losing all their AI chats.

“Amazing sob story: ‘ChatGPT deleted all the work I hadn't done',” one Bluesky user wrote.

“Maybe next time, actually do the work you are paid to do *yourself*, instead of outsourcing it to the climate-killing, suicide-encouraging plagiarism machine,” wrote another another. Others floated the possibility that the essay in Nature wasn't even written by Bucher.

“This is the dumbest shit I've read in a quite a while,” a Bluesky user wrote. “(But, in his defense: there is no particular reason to assume that the guy who published this actually wrote it himself.)”

Bucher did make the point that he was being encouraged to use AI in his work, and there's validity to that complaint. Large institutions are telling their workers to incorporate AI more often under the theory that it's some kind of inevitable future:

We are increasingly being encouraged to integrate generative AI into research and teaching. Individuals use it for writing, planning and teaching; universities are experimenting with embedding it into curricula. However, my case reveals a fundamental weakness: these tools were not developed with academic standards of reliability and accountability in mind.

If a single click can irrevocably delete years of work, ChatGPT cannot, in my opinion and on the basis of my experience, be considered completely safe for professional use.

It remains to be seen whether generative AI will truly transform the workplace in ways that actually matter, especially as workers are more skeptical and bosses try to insist on its use. Whatever happens, there will likely be plenty of AI skeptics around to celebrate when someone loses a bunch of work.

A new entity has been created that will allow ByteDance to sell a majority stake in the U.S. operations of TikTok to a group of investors outside of China, according to new reports from the New York Times and Bloomberg. It moves a deal one step closer to completion, following years of uncertainty over whether the app would be banned in the U.S., though TikTok was quick to note that this isn't a final deal to sell the company.

The entity will be called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, according to a press release from TikTok, and the major investors include Oracle, the UAE investment firm MGX, and the investment firm Silver Lake, which will own more than 80% of the company, according to the New York Times. Michael Dell is also involved, according to the Times.

The press release announcement notes that the new joint venture “will retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data. The content recommendation algorithm will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment.” It's not entirely clear what that means, but obviously there are concerns that Trump and the U.S. government will tinker with the platform to make it more MAGA friendly.

Congress passed a bipartisan law in 2024, signed by President Joe Biden, that required TikTok to be sold to U.S. interests or be banned in America over national security concerns. The first deadline for the sale/ban was Jan. 19, 2025, but President Trump extended that until April. And then Trump signed an executive order extending it yet again until June. When June rolled around, that was extended again until September. After they blew through that deadline, it was extended again to January 22.

Trump had no authority to just keep extending the deadline, but he did it anyway, which seems to be a theme of this presidency. He had initially tried to ban TikTok during his first term, but that got tied up in the courts and fizzled out. Trump then pulled a 180 while campaigning for the presidency in 2024, insisting that he liked TikTok because it was popular with young people and he had a lot of supporters there who could help him win the election.

It's entirely possible that this news is in many ways another headfake, given the fact that we've heard about a “done deal” many times since President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second time in January 2025. Back in October 2025, we heard the same thing. A month earlier, there was a big announcement that a “framework” for a deal had been reached.

And when Gizmodo reached out to TikTok on Thursday after the New York Times first broke the news, our email asked about a finalized deal. “I saw your question and want to call out that ‘deal to sell' isn't accurate framing. Please see language used in the press release,” a spokesperson for the company wrote.

Financial injections helped Intel in 2025, but what about supply constraints in 2026?

Intel reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2025, closing the year with $52.9 billion in revenue, its weakest annual result since 2010. Despite earnings declines both in Q4 and for the whole year, Intel says that its earnings in the fourth quarter exceeded expectations as demand outstripped supply, due to the ongoing AI buildout.

Furthermore, the company reports a GAAP net loss of $300 million in 2025. Compared to its staggering $18.8 billion loss in 2024, this can be framed as a breakthrough. However, this is not quite yet a turnaround, as the result came with important caveats.

""We exceeded Q4 expectations across revenue, gross margin, and EPS even as we navigated industry-wide supply shortages,"" said David Zinsner, chief financial officer at Intel. ""We expect our available supply to be at its lowest level in Q1 before improving in Q2 and beyond. Demand fundamentals across our core markets remain healthy as the rapid adoption of AI reinforces the importance of the x86 ecosystem as the world's most widely deployed high-performance compute architecture.""

In Q4 2025, Intel earned $13.7 billion in revenue, unchanged from the previous quarter and down 4% year-over-year (YoY), as the company's shipments were constrained by wafer supply from its own fabs and TSMC. Due to strong competition and unfulfilled demand, the company reported a GAAP loss of $600 million for the quarter, as gross margin declined to 36.1%, compared to 39.2% a year earlier. For the full year, revenue was $52.9 billion, essentially flat compared to 2024, but gross margin improved to 34.8%.

However, Intel's near breakeven result was made possible by roughly $20.4 billion in external financial injections, including $2 billion from SoftBank, $4.46 billion from Silver Lake (for a 51% stake in Altera), $5 billion from Nvidia, and $8.9 billion from the U.S. government. Even with external funding, Intel still ended the year in the red, but without the injections, its losses would have deepened.

Taking a closer look at different business units, performance varied across business segments. The Client Computing Group (CCG) posted $8.2 billion in Q4 revenue, down both sequentially and YoY, its operating income declined to $2.2 billion as operating margin dropped to 27%. While client CPU demand in Q4 was traditionally very strong, Intel deliberately redirected constrained internal wafer capacity toward higher-margin data center products, thus increasing reliance on externally sourced wafers for client processors, which hit margins of the CCG business unit badly.

 




Meanwhile, this strategy benefited the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI), which posted $4.7 billion in Q4 revenue, up 15% sequentially and 7% YoY. Operating income surged to $1.3 billion, lifting margins to 26.4%, a dramatic improvement from 8.6% a year earlier and the best result for DCAI in quarters. Again, Intel had to acknowledge that demand for Xeon processors exceeded supply and expects this imbalance to persist into 2026 due to demand from the AI segment.

Intel Foundry generated $4.5 billion in Q4 revenue, up 6.4% sequentially, supported by growing shipments of Intel 3-based Xeon 6 CPUs, Intel 4-based Arrow Lake, and (to a minimal degree) early Panther Lake wafers. EUV-based processes now account for over 10% of foundry revenue, up from less than 1% in 2023. However, as usual, the foundry business posted a $2.5 billion operating loss due to a mix of factors, including ongoing capacity investments and the early ramp-up of Intel's 18A.

 




Looking ahead into the first quarter, Intel forecasts revenue of $11.7 billion – $12.7 billion, which is down from the same quarter a year ago.

 




The prediction stems from continued supply constraints and the lack of buffer inventory that Intel sold in Q3 and Q4 2025. As a consequence, Intel will sell whatever it can get throughout the first quarter of 2026, something that inevitably hits margins, and they are projected to decline to 32.3% (as it will be harder to get as many of the premium SKUs out as possible). The good news is that the company's management expects supply conditions to improve starting in Q2.

Lian Li Industrial Co., Ltd., founded in 1983, is a Taiwanese company renowned for its premium computer cases, power supplies, and PC accessories. As one of the oldest players in the PC hardware market, Lian Li is recognized for its commitment to high-quality craftsmanship, innovative aluminum-based designs, and solutions tailored to both industrial and consumer markets. Their product lineup includes mid-tower and full-tower cases, compact enclosures for smaller builds, and cutting-edge PSUs, all acknowledged for their modularity, durability, and forward-thinking features. Among PC enthusiasts, Lian Li's reputation for blending functionality with aesthetics has established them as an industry leader.

This review examines the RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU, representing Lian Li's most sophisticated approach to power supply design. Would this cutting-edge design earn it a spot in our list of best power supplies? The RS1200G introduces a rotatable AC power receptacle, a world-first innovation that fundamentally rethinks PSU orientation and cable management. This mechanism allows the modular cable connectors to exit from either the rear or left side of the chassis, adapting to different case architectures. The implementation appears more versatile than competing solutions, though it introduces its own compatibility requirements. Complementing this mechanical innovation is an optional magnetic USB hub that can mount directly to the PSU, expanding connectivity options for modern systems.

The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU arrives in a sizable cardboard box with a predominantly black theme and blue accents. The unit itself dominates the front side, establishing immediate visual recognition. Protection is substantial, with the PSU enclosed in a protective pouch and surrounded by dense foam packaging inserts designed to withstand shipping stresses.

 




The bundle is comprehensive, exceeding typical PSU inclusions. Beyond the standard AC power cable and mounting hardware, Lian Li provides a magnetic USB hub capable of mounting anywhere within the chassis or directly on the PSU. Two USB cables accompany the hub, offering users a choice between internal motherboard header connection or rear panel USB routing. A specialized backplate with a cable routing notch enables clean exits when necessary. Magnetic cable organizers are included to replace traditional zip ties, offering repositionable cable management. Cable combs arrive pre-attached to select cables, with additional units included for user customization. Finally, Lian Li includes some basic cable ties as well.

All cables utilize an all-black aesthetic with black connectors and wires. The cables employ a flat, ribbon-line construction that simplifies routing in tight spaces. The ATX 24-pin and PCIe 12V-2x6 cables receive premium treatment with per-wire sleeving and factory-installed combs. The cable configuration proves conservative for a 1200W unit, providing one 12V-2x6 connector and five 6+2 pin PCI Express connectors distributed across four cables. The unit's maximum output rating at 40 degrees Celsius and the number of connectors hint that it is not a platform meant to be severely stressed.

The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU measures 150mm in length, barely exceeding standard ATX dimensions. This compact form factor is remarkable for a 1200W unit. The matte black chassis paint job demonstrates excellent finishing quality, with smooth surfaces free from manufacturing defects.

The design philosophy diverges dramatically from conventional PSU architecture. Modular cable connectors populate virtually every side of the chassis, enabled by the rotatable AC power receptacle. This receptacle represents the unit's defining feature, allowing users to shift modular cable connectors between rear and left-side positions. The implementation permits direct cable routing to the motherboard panel's backside in compatible cases. This appears more sophisticated than competing solutions, as users maintain orientation control based on case requirements. Cases supporting side cable routing can utilize that configuration, while traditional cases can employ rear routing.

A significant limitation exists. The 24-pin connector location inverses relative to other connectors depending on AC receptacle orientation. When standard connectors exit rearward, the 24-pin exits left. When standard connectors exit left, the 24-pin exits rearward. This necessitates cases always accommodate at least the 24-pin connector routing behind the motherboard, effectively eliminating universal compatibility.

 




The right side is perforated, as rotational capability means this surface can become the front depending on AC receptacle positioning. The fan finger guard integrates directly into the chassis, displaying a unique geometric cutout pattern mixing squares and rectangles. The rear side, which alternates with the left depending on inlet orientation, incorporates a specialized slot for the USB hub. When positioned here, the USB hub draws power directly from the PSU without requiring a SATA connector.

 




The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU employs a Hong Hua 135mm fan utilizing a fluid dynamic bearing engine. FDB designs represent optimal acoustic-to-reliability balance, maintaining low operational noise at elevated speeds while delivering strong mean time between failure figures. The fan specification includes a high 2300 RPM maximum speed, though the unit's zero-RPM mode means extended periods of fanless operation while the system is idling.

 




The PSU originates from Sirfa, a Chinese OEM whose designs have graced numerous mid-to-top tier power supplies over the past two decades. Sirfa's experience shows in the platform's assembly quality and component selection, though some choices reflect cost optimization rather than absolute premium positioning.

The input filtering stage provides adequate protection with four Y capacitors, two X capacitors, and two filtering inductors. Most filtering components mount on a vertical daughterboard, optimizing spatial efficiency and freeing the AC receptacle for movement. Two rectifying bridges are installed on a substantial heatsink immediately following the filtration stage.

 




The APFC circuitry employs two SRC60R608BS MOSFETs and a diode, positioned on a large heatsink spanning the PCB edge. One encased inductor and two EPCOS (TDK) capacitors totaling 1210 μF comprise the passive components. The total capacitance is massive and EPCOS component quality is top-tier. These German-manufactured capacitors offer superior thermal and mechanical stress resistance compared to most alternatives but are very costly and we rarely see their products even in top-tier units.

 




In the primary stage, two SRC60R095BS MOSFETs form a half-bridge primary inversion topology. These components are on a separate heatsink positioned after the APFC bulk capacitors. Heatsink dimensions are generous, providing substantial surface area for heat dissipation even under sustained high-power operation.

 




The secondary stage utilizes eight Infineon 10N04NM6 MOSFETs distributed across two vertical daughterboards, generating the primary 12V rail through synchronous rectification. The absence of dedicated heatsinks for these components hints their exceptional efficiency characteristics. DC-to-DC converter circuits on another vertical daughterboard generate the 3.3V and 5V rails from the primary 12V output.

 




Secondary side capacitors originate entirely from Teapo, a reputable Taiwanese manufacturer. While Teapo lacks the prestige of premium Japanese manufacturers like Nippon Chemi-Con or Rubycon, they maintain solid reliability records and appropriate specifications for this application. This represents a pragmatic compromise between cost and quality for a unit with a 10-year warranty.

For the testing of PSUs, we are using high precision electronic loads with a maximum power draw of 2700 Watts, a Rigol DS5042M 40 MHz oscilloscope, an Extech 380803 power analyzer, two high precision UNI-T UT-325 digital thermometers, an Extech HD600 SPL meter, a self-designed hotbox and various other bits and parts.

The Lian Li RS1200G PSU achieves average nominal load efficiency of 90.0% with 115 VAC input and 92.0% with 230 VAC input, measured across the 10% to 100% load range. These results comfortably satisfy 80 Plus Gold and CLEAResult Gold certification requirements. The unit received Cybenetics Platinum certification based on average efficiency calculations, though efficiency dips at maximum load prevented higher certifications from the other two certifying bodies. Lian Li markets this as Gold-certified, likely avoiding internal competition with their premium product lines.

Efficiency peaks near 40% load and maintains fairly good stability across most operational ranges. Very low load efficiency remains good, an important characteristic for modern systems spending significant time in idle states. The fan initiates rotation when load exceeds approximately 300 Watts but maintains very low speeds up to 800 Watts. Beyond 900 Watts, fan speed increases substantially though it still remains below half maximum capability.

During elevated ambient temperature testing, the Lian Li RS1200G PSU exhibits notable efficiency degradation. Average nominal load efficiency drops to 88.4% with 115 VAC input and 90.3% with 230 VAC input. Signs of thermal stress emerge at maximum load, though they remain within acceptable operational parameters. This is a product rated for maximum output at 40°C and, although it can reach its maximum output at a higher temperature, the signs of stress are apparent.

Fan behavior shifts considerably under thermal stress. Activation occurs earlier, engaging at approximately 250 Watts load. The fan maintains slow rotation up to 600 Watts, after which speed increases progressively until reaching maximum at 90% load. Maximum load operation produces significant noise levels, though this represents expected behavior for a compact, Gold-certified 1200W unit under thermal stress. Internal temperatures remain within acceptable operational levels throughout testing.

The Lian Li RS1200G demonstrates outstanding power quality performance. Maximum ripple measured 26 mV on the 12V rail, 14 mV on the 5V rail, and 14 mV on the 3.3V rail, all substantially below industry safety limits and representing excellent performance considering test conditions and massive power output capability. Voltage regulation proves equally impressive, maintaining 0.9% on the 12V rail, 0.7% on the 5V rail, and 0.6% on the 3.3V rail. These figures indicate exceptional power quality across all voltage outputs under varying load conditions.

During our thorough assessment, we evaluate the essential protection features of every power supply unit we review, including Over Current Protection (OCP), Over Voltage Protection (OVP), Over Power Protection (OPP), and Short Circuit Protection (SCP). OCP activates at 126% on the 3.3V rail, 128% on the 5V rail, and 112% on the 12V rail. OPP triggers at 110% during hot testing. These protection thresholds are exceptionally sharp, particularly for an ATX 3.1 certified unit.

The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU represents genuine innovation in power supply design, addressing cable management challenges through mechanical ingenuity rather than incremental improvements. The rotatable AC inlet provides unprecedented installation flexibility, adapting to diverse case architectures while maintaining compact ATX dimensions. This feature alone distinguishes the RS1200G from conventional offerings, though it introduces specific compatibility requirements that potential buyers must carefully evaluate. The 24-pin connector placement creates an inherent limitation. Cases must accommodate behind-motherboard routing for at least the primary ATX cable, eliminating compatibility with chassis lacking appropriate cable management provisions. This restriction is not insurmountable but requires careful case selection, potentially limiting the RS1200G's appeal to builders with existing incompatible cases.

 




The magnetic USB hub adds practical value for builders requiring additional connectivity and cable management. Direct PSU mounting eliminates SATA power requirements when positioned in the dedicated slot, simplifying cable management. Alternative mounting locations throughout the chassis provide flexibility for specific layout requirements. This feature addresses modern system connectivity demands elegantly, though its utility varies significantly based on individual build requirements. Cable configuration proves conservative for a 1200W unit. One 12V-2x6 connector and five 6+2 pin PCIe connectors accommodate most GPU requirements but may prove limiting for some top-tier builds. Flat ribbon cables with magnetic cable organizers simplify routing in constrained spaces, representing thoughtful attention to practical installation concerns.

Electrical performance proves exceptional across all metrics. Voltage regulation maintains sub-1% deviation across all rails, demonstrating precise control under varying loads. Ripple suppression achieves outstanding results, particularly given the unit's 1200W output capability and compact form factor. Protection circuits respond with sharp precision, balancing safety with practical operational requirements. The OCP threshold is rather conservative but this unit is certified to handle ATX 3.1 transients. Efficiency results merit recognition. Cold testing efficiency of 90.0% with 115 VAC and 92.0% with 230 VAC comfortably exceeds Gold certification requirements, with Cybenetics awarding Platinum certification based on average efficiency calculations. Hot testing reveals significant but predictable efficiency degradation to 88.4% and 90.3% respectively, with thermal stress signs at maximum load, even though the figures remain within acceptable parameters.

 




Thermal management proves adequate though not exceptional. The compact 150mm chassis and overall topology, although paired with a 135mm fan and good heatsinks on the primary side, create inherent cooling challenges at maximum power output. The fan remains inactive or operates at minimal speeds under moderate loads, contributing to excellent low-load acoustics. High load operation produces significant noise levels, particularly under elevated ambient temperatures when the fan reaches maximum speed. Overall, the thermal control circuitry is very reasonably programmed and responsive.

Component selection demonstrates pragmatic engineering. EPCOS APFC capacitors and Infineon MOSFETs represent premium choices in critical high-stress positions. Teapo secondary capacitors occupy a middle ground between economy and premium Japanese alternatives, appropriate for the 10-year warranty period but not representing absolute top-tier specification. This mixed approach balances cost optimization with reliability requirements.

 




Pricing positions the RS1200G at approximately $180, representing premium positioning justified by innovative features and solid electrical performance. Competition exists from conventional high-wattage units offering lower pricing but lacking the RS1200G's distinctive capabilities. Value assessment depends heavily on individual compatibility requirements and appreciation for the rotational design innovation.

The Lian Li RS1200G ATX 3.1 PSU succeeds in delivering meaningful innovation beyond incremental specification improvements. Exceptional electrical performance, comprehensive protection features, and thoughtful accessory inclusion demonstrate engineering competence. The unit's performance at maximum load suggests the platform may be a little stressed at 1200 Watts, although it can deliver its maximum power output under adverse circumstances if necessary. Case compatibility limitations represent the primary concern, requiring careful evaluation before purchase. For builders with compatible cases seeking innovative solutions and exceptional power quality, the RS1200G merits serious consideration despite its premium pricing.

Analysts say 'tailwinds' are the reason Toto shares are up. That's also how Toto's signature Washlet product line dries your derrière.

Toilet manufacturer Toto has seen its shares soar at their most rapid pace in five years, as it benefits from AI memory market tailwinds. The Japanese sanitaryware maker might be one of the most unlikely beneficiaries of the AI boom. However, its ceramics expertise is useful in semiconductor manufacturing. Specifically, according to the Japan Times, Goldman Sachs analysts are crediting the 11% stock surge yesterday to Toto's electrostatic chucks used in NAND chipmaking.

 




Best known for its Washlet-branded cleansing toilets and heated toilet seat accessories, Japan's Toto has smartly invested and diversified into businesses related to the semiconductor and display supply chain. Its ceramics expertise makes it a surprisingly natural fit for the development of these products. Moreover, this isn't something new to Toto; it has been mass-producing the aforementioned electrostatic chucks since way back in 1988.

Toto's chucks are used to hold silicon wafers in place during chipmaking, while minimizing contamination. Over the years, analysts have charted this once side-gig for Toto ramping up to contribute over two-fifths of its operating income, based on March 2025 figures compiled by Bloomberg. It looks like investors are positive and eager to see an update to these figures, as everything the AI industry touches turns to gold, for now.

The Goldman analysts quoted by the Japan Times say that Toto is likely to see “significant profit growth,” as they raised the rating of the firm from neutral to buy. Ratcheting up their hopes, they see a tight supply-demand environment in the memory industry as a tailwind for Toto. Indeed, Toto is also said to expect the current wave of AI data center construction to boost its electrostatic chuck business.

Interestingly, the source name checked a few other unlikely Japanese companies that are benefitting from the AI boom. An MSG seasoning maker also makes chip-insulating films, for example. Meanwhile, cosmetics brand Kao's expertise in facial cleansers has an unexpected twin: the company also makes cleaning agents for semiconductor wafers.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) demonstrated diagnostic discordance with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in 74% of patients, identifying heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in 46% of patients with normal TTE findings. CMR markedly improved diagnostic precision by identifying specific cardiac conditions that TTE frequently missed or incorrectly diagnosed.

""CMR markedly improves diagnostic precision and subphenotyping in patients with elevated LVFP [left ventricular filling pressure], identifying key conditions like HFpEF, IHD, and specific cardiomyopathies that [echocardiography alone cannot detect],"" the authors wrote.

""These findings underscore the essential role of CMR in refining diagnosis and guiding clinical management,"" they added.

The study was led by Aradhai Bana, University of East Anglia, Norwich, England. It was published online on January 14, 2026, in BMJ Open.

The study cohort came from a single-centre prospective registry, a design that may have introduced referral bias by including only patients who underwent both TTE and CMR. The study focused on patients with elevated CMR-derived left ventricular filling pressure, limiting generalisability to populations with normal filling pressures or early-stage disease. The absence of an independent reference standard to adjudicate discrepancies between CMR and TTE may have biased the definition of diagnostic discordance in favour of CMR. Additionally, the lack of systematically collected clinical outcome data prevented the assessment of the findings' impact on patient outcomes.

The study was funded by the Wellcome Trust. One author disclosed serving as a clinical advisor for Pie Medical Imaging and Medis Medical Imaging and working as a consultant for Anteris Technologies and Edwards Lifesciences. The other authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Women family physicians in Ontario spend more time per patient, on average, than their male counterparts do, a new study indicated. This finding could help explain the pay gap between female and male family physicians in the province.

The results of a survey completed by 1055 family physicians revealed that for 19 of 20 common medical services, female family physicians reported longer average service times than their male counterparts. The difference between the two groups ranged from 15% to 20%. For the most frequently billed service (ie, intermediate assessment), female family physicians devoted an average of 3.9 minutes (22.3%) more than male family physicians. This difference was statistically significant.

The additional time that female family physicians spend with patients likely contributes to the pay gap between female and male family physicians in Ontario, according to lead author Boris Kralj, PhD, health economist and adjunct assistant professor in economics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.

“I think it's 2 hours a day extra that a female [family physician] needs to work to make the same money” as a male family physician, Kralj told Medscape News Canada. “We feel that type of uncompensated time drives burnout.”

Only five respondents to the survey questionnaire identified as nonbinary, so the sample size was insufficient for a statistical analysis of this physician population.

The findings were published on January 14 in Canadian Family Physician.

Patient expectations and cultural norms have been offered as explanations for the sex-based difference in time spent per patient visit, said Kralj.

“Patients, particularly female patients, tend to expect female doctors to give them more time than male doctors,” said Kralj. Female physicians have a greater proportion of women in their patient rosters than male physicians. “Also, female doctors more than male doctors tend to focus on the patient's psychosocial issues and their social circumstances.”

Interestingly, the difference between male and female family physicians in time spent per patient was not statistically significant among international medical graduates. “We know from other literature that your communication style and practice style are influenced by your training environment,” said Kralj. “The practice norms and communication norms in Canada may be different than they are in other countries.”

The study authors pointed out that the current fee-for-service compensation model may result in lower hourly earnings for female family physicians because it matches compensation to the type of service delivered, as opposed to the time spent per patient. They suggested that a time-compensation payment model would address the pay gap.

“You can have the fee-for-service model but have different tiers or the same code based on time spent [with a patient],” said Kralj, adding that physicians should be able to select the compensation model they want for themselves.

The study's limitations include nonresponse bias because not all Ontario family physicians participated in the study, as well as recall bias or measurement error, given that the duration of time spent on a patient visit was self-reported and could have been underestimated or overestimated.

The study highlights the persistent pay inequity between men and women in family medicine, Tara Kiran, MD, family physician and scientist at St Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, told Medscape News Canada. Kiran, who did not participate in the study, and who also is the Fidani Chair of Improvement and Innovation at the University of Toronto in Toronto.

“A number of studies in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere have looked at this issue of the gender pay gap within medicine,” she said. Studies within Canada, specifically in Ontario, have confirmed the gap's existence. One study in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded that female primary care physicians produce less visit revenue because of factors such as a decreased volume of patients and increased time spent on per patient.

In the analysis by Kralj and colleagues, 71.6% of respondents worked in a capitation model, said Kiran. Under this model, physicians receive a fixed annual payment for every patient added to their rosters, and variables such as patient age and complexity affect the amount of payment.

Nevertheless, the current study suggests that the difference in time leads to a gap in remuneration between male and female family physicians. It raises the question of prioritizing patient volume over time per patient, with respect to compensation, said Kiran.

The time difference “is a contributor to the gender pay gap because if women are spending more time with patients in a fee-for-service setting, [which] means that they are potentially seeing lower volumes,” said Kiran. “In a capitation setting, it potentially means that they are rostering fewer patients.”

The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Kralj and Kiran reported having no relevant financial relationships.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Dr Rob Hicks

An online therapy programme can be offered to people aged 16 or over with eating disorders while they wait for specialist NHS treatment, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said.

In new guidance, the regulator said the programme could be used in the NHS in England while further clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence is generated.

The Overcoming Bulimia Online unguided self-help programme is aimed at people who binge eat, including those with bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and similar conditions. It is based on eating-disorder-focused cognitive behavioural therapy and is designed to be completed independently over eight sessions.

NICE said early access to treatment could help prevent symptoms from becoming more severe, particularly for patients facing long waits for specialist care. Unguided digital self-help could begin as soon as an eating problem is identified.

""This recommendation is really important for eating disorder care at a time when services are under huge pressure,” said Dr Anastasia Chalkidou, health technology programme director at NICE.

She said the programme could give patients immediate access to evidence-based therapy, rather than having to wait months for specialist treatment.

At least 1.25 million people in the UK have an eating disorder. Guided self-help is currently the first treatment offered, or considered, for people with binge eating disorder and for adults with bulimia nervosa.

NICE assessed three digital technologies: Digital CBTe, Overcoming Bulimia Online, and Worth Warrior. It said Digital CBTe and Worth Warrior required more evidence before they could be recommended for NHS funding, although they may be available through research studies.

NICE said Overcoming Bulimia Online could be used during the evidence-generation period for people with binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and related conditions with similar clinical features, including other specified feeding or eating disorder.

The programme should only be offered after an initial assessment in primary care or by specialist eating disorder services, and alongside usual waiting list care, including regular check-ins and routine physical monitoring.

NICE added that use would be conditional on ongoing evidence generation and appropriate regulatory approval, including meeting NHS England's Digital Technology Assessment Criteria.

Unguided self-help is not intended for people with severe eating disorders or those at high medical risk, and it is not suitable for anyone with anorexia nervosa, NICE said.

Evidence reviewed by NICE showed that people using Overcoming Bulimia Online had fewer binge-eating episodes and reduced symptom severity compared with those on waiting lists.

The programme could give people support “sooner and at their own pace,” said Dr Adrian James, NHS England's national medical director for mental health and neurodiversity.

“Wait times can still vary wildly between age groups and locations,” said Umairah Malik, clinical and co-production manager at the eating disorder charity Beat. “Digital treatment can help to address some of these gaps, allowing more people to access support on a waiting list, whilst still benefiting from regular check-ins and routine monitoring.”

Among 2800 help seekers for gambling-related problems in Finland, women showed higher rates of suicidal ideation than men (25.5% vs 16.4%), with gambling-related debts and the lack of social support emerging as significant risk factors for both sexes. At-risk alcohol use increased the risk for suicidal ideation only in women, highlighting the need for sex-specific prevention strategies.

""Our results suggest that alcohol consumption increases the risk of gambling-related suicidal ideation amongst women, but not men. Indebtedness and lack of social support were risk factors for gambling-related suicidal ideation amongst both genders,"" the authors wrote.

""To effectively prevent gambling harm in societies, policy action is needed to reduce and prevent financial harm from gambling that can contribute to increased suicidality,"" they added.

This study was led by Virve Marionneau, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. It was published online on January 13, 2026, in Addictive Behaviors.

This study was limited by its focus on help seekers in Finland, who may not be representative of the broader population affected by gambling-related problems. The MADRS measured only suicidal ideation over a 3-day period rather than assessing lifetime or past-year prevalence. Additionally, the analysis was limited to the most prevalent gambling products, potentially missing associations with other gambling forms or combinations.

The authors of this study were funded by the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health through provisions of the Finnish Lotteries Act. Additional funding was provided by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Pain in neonates after circumcision decreased significantly after the implementation of a comprehensive nurse practitioner (NP)-led management.

“This NP-led EBPQI [evidence-based practice quality improvement] initiative can guide health care providers to improve pain in circumcised newborns, with potential for addressing other clinical problems within practice settings,” the authors wrote, adding that “this NP-led initiative underscores the critical need for further exploration of effective pain management in circumcised newborns, particularly in the absence of universal guidelines.”

This study was led by Renu Mathews Philip, DNP, APRN, CPNP, EBP-C, Parkland Health, Plano, Texas. It was published online on December 3, 2025, in the Journal of Pediatric Health Care.

The initiative was conducted at a single site, which limited generalizability. Although pain scores immediately post-circumcision showed improvement, the researchers did not collect or analyze pain scores during the recovery period.

No funding information was provided for the study. The authors declared having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Anne Gaëlle Moulun

 January 23, 2026  

Following the fatal fire that occurred on New Year's Eve in a bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, several French hospitals agreed to treat injured patients.

Among them was the Burn Treatment Center at Hôpital Saint-Louis in Paris, France, part of the Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, where the medical director, François Dépret, MD, PhD, anesthesiologist-intensivist in AP-HP's Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care and Burn Unit at Hôpital Saint-Louis, detailed the complex care of patients with severe burns to Medscape France.

Since January 1, the transfer of severely burned patients and their distribution in French hospitals were coordinated by the operational center for regulation and response to health and social emergencies of the health crisis center (CORRUSS) in close collaboration with a physician specializing in severe burns and Regional Health Agencies, while ensuring that a coherent healthcare offer was maintained throughout France.

Hospitals receiving patients included the Burn Treatment Center at Hôpital Saint-Louis; the Centre des brûlés de Lyon Pierre Colson at Hôpital Édouard Herriot, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France, which currently treats five patients; and Hôpital Mercy, part of the CHR Metz-Thionville, in Ars-Laquenexy, France.

As of January 8, a total of 20 patient transfers to French hospitals had occurred, according to figures provided to Medscape France by the Ministry of Health. In these highly specialized units, patients are managed by multidisciplinary teams for variable but generally prolonged periods.

“We define severe burns as involving at least 20% of the total body surface area. A burn is considered critical when a third-degree injury affects more than 5% of the body surface area,” said Dépret.

Additional risk factors include smoke inhalation, which can be life-threatening, high-voltage electrical burns, and deep burns in areas with high functional risk, such as the hands, face, feet, and perineum.

“Care for these patients is multidisciplinary,” Dépret said. “In our unit, we have about 15 anesthesiologist-intensivists, five plastic surgeons, several dozen nurses and nursing assistants, a psychologist, physical therapists, and a nutritionist.”

Dressings must be changed every 48 hours, a process that requires extensive expertise, staffing, and time. “Changing a single dressing can take up to 2 hours and requires three to four nurses and nursing assistants,” he explained. “Training a burn unit nurse takes about 1-1.5 years before full autonomy is achieved. They were highly qualified professionals. If someone is absent, you cannot simply replace them with staff from another ward.”

However, deep burns often require surgical grafting. “The surgeon removes third-degree burned skin, harvests a very superficial layer of skin from an unburned area, then expands it to increase surface area,” Dépret said. “It forms a mesh-like structure that is placed over an excised area. Skin cells then gradually fill in the gaps.”

Multiple grafting procedures may be required during hospitalization. These interventions have prolonged systemic effects, followed by a rehabilitation phase that requires specialized physicians, occupational therapists, and physical therapists. Psychological support is also offered to patients, their families, and healthcare staff.

The length of hospital stay varies widely and may extend to several months post-injury. “A rough estimate is about 1 day of hospitalization per percentage point of burned skin,” Dépret said. “That translates to roughly 2 months for a patient with 60% total body surface area burned.”

Early complications depend on the phase of care provided. “The initial complication is hypovolemic shock because burn patients lose large amounts of fluid very quickly,” he said. “Fluid resuscitation is required for 24-48 hours.”

Smoke inhalation, as seen in the Crans-Montana fire, carries a risk for airway burns and respiratory failure. “Patients may require oxygen or even intubation,” he added.

Patients with burns may also experience toxic exposure due to smoke inhalation. Management includes removal of exposure and oxygen therapy. High-flow oxygen is required in cases of carbon monoxide poisoning.

“In cases of cyanide derivative poisoning, we administer an antidote, vitamin B12,” Dépret said. “We do not truly know how effective it is because randomized clinical trials in large patient populations are not feasible given the emergency setting and the rarity of these events.”

Complications are primarily infectious. “Skin is our barrier to the external environment,” he said. “Without this, bacteria and fungi have direct access. Infection remains the leading cause of death.”

In the case of patients injured in the Crans-Montana fire, young age represents a favorable prognostic factor.

“The abbreviated burn severity index score helps estimate survival probability,” Dépret said. “Two major favorable factors are age and burned surface area. With the same burn size, a man aged 0-20 years with 40%-50% total body surface area burned has an 80%-90% chance of survival compared with 50%-70% in a man aged 60-80 years.”

Smoke inhalation and preexisting conditions also influence prognosis.

Over the past 20 years, advances in intensive care have improved the outcomes of patients with severe burn injuries. “Ultimately, what saves lives is covering the burns, grafting, and achieving healing,” Dépret said. “There has been no major revolution in this area in recent years.”

Future progress may depend on the ability to culture skin from small patient samples to produce sufficient graft material without rejection. “The most extensively burned patients, with little healthy skin available, are the hardest to save,” he added. “After skin harvesting, we must wait for the donor sites to heal before grafting again. Patients lose weight and develop infections due to burn injuries. It is a race against time.”

Currently, cell culture techniques are not sufficiently advanced for routine clinical use.

Experts are warning that there's no more time to waste in reaching an agreement over how public hospitals should be funded. The situation is urgent, they say.

While states and territories are responsible for running Australia's public hospitals, funding is provided by the Commonwealth and state and territorial governments. 

A new funding agreement for public hospitals was achieved in principle in 2023. It would have seen the federal government increase its share of funding to 42.5% by 2030 and to 45% by 2035. In exchange, states would help to ease the pressure and co-fund new disability services outside the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). But subsequent negotiations stalled.

Two years on, the federal government and states are at loggerheads over the Commonwealth's contribution to the next 5-year funding agreement. The Commonwealth has offered an additional $20 billion over 5 years, as well as additional top-up payments and $2 billion extra to address older patients who are staying in the hospital for extended periods. The states reply that this amount is equivalent to just 35% of costs, which “will impact the states' and territories' ability to provide the hospital services that Australians rightly expect.” According to the latest data available, in 2023-24, the Commonwealth's share of funding was 38%.

What can be agreed upon is that public hospitals are struggling with staff shortages, bed shortages, rising healthcare costs, stranded patients, long wait times, more complex cases (thanks to an aging population), and emergency departments flooded with cases that are not emergencies.

Danielle McMullen, MBBS, general practitioner and head of the Australian Medical Association, told Medscape News Australia she wanted the government to keep its word. “We want the Commonwealth to stick to its previous promise of 45% funding, but by 2030. Our health system can't wait,” she said, adding that the organization was also calling for the 6.5% cap on annual funding growth to be lifted.

“Hospital funding needs to meet demand. Asking people to do more with less isn't the way to generate effective change. The urgency is real. The strain on public hospitals is palpable on the ground.”

Structural issues within the healthcare system are at the heart of the disagreement, Francesco Paolucci, PhD, professor of health economics and policy at the University of Newcastle, told Medscape News Australia. “The system is completely disconnected, fragmented, and broken. Public funding can't keep up. States don't have the ability to raise taxation, so they're trying to manage a system with fewer and fewer resources and high prices,” he said.

“For me, there needs to be structural change,” Paolucci continued. “If you want everyone to access a service, you need to fix it. To do that, you need to make it equitable in access and fund it in a progressive way. We need to look at the system and understand it's broken in funding and provision, and come to some hard decisions.”

A primary concern for public hospitals across the country is that they are filled with hundreds of aged care and NDIS patients who are supposed to be looked after by the federal government. Instead, they're stranded in a hospital, waiting for a bed to be available in residential aged care or disability services. 

State governments have reported that as much as 10% of their bed days are taken up by patients waiting to be discharged somewhere else. The average NDIS participant waits 16 days in hospital after they are ready to leave.

A report commissioned by the Australian Board of Treasurers last year found that the protracted length of stay in public hospitals “increases cost by significantly impairing the productivity of public hospitals to deliver core acute services, increases the labor intensity of their care (relative to providing appropriate care in an alternative setting), and requires health services to access costly alternative care pathways in order to maintain access for other patients.”

“We're watching this tsunami of people getting older, and we're not prepared,” McMullen said. “It's a big contribution to our hospital logjam. We need more aged care beds, and we need better home care support, with better integration of general practitioner (GP) and care teams so people aren't bouncing in and out of hospital.”

Australia should follow countries such as England, Sweden, and Norway in imposing financial penalties for keeping people stranded in hospital, said Peter Breadon, health program director at the Grattan Institute, an independent think tank in Carlton. “In Australia, the federal government could pay for a patient's extra days in hospital after they are ready to leave, plus the cost of temporary accommodation arranged by hospitals or state governments. The rules could be set out in the National Health Reform Agreement, and there might be a role for the independent pricing authority to monitor implementation,” he told Medscape News Australia. “Studies have shown it can have a big impact on getting healthy patients home sooner.”

For Paolucci, part of the issue is cultural. Australians are used to sending their aging parents or loved ones to residential care, when a lot of care could be provided in the home if adequate structures were in place.

“We need to find solutions that are home-based because the old system is obsolete. We can treat people at home. We can learn from countries that do this efficiently. And rewarding family members for providing informal care may be another attractive way to look at the problem,” he said.

“But until we look at all the different formal models of care, which are clearly done for reasons other than the health of Australians, we need to come in with a huge investment to try and take pressure off the system and move as much as we can to home-based care,” Paolucci added.

Adequate funding could give rise to innovation such as “hospital in the home” programs and same-day hip and knee replacements, which public and private hospitals in Brisbane and Perth are now performing, said McMullen. 

Same-day surgeries are one of the biggest opportunities for reducing costs while helping patients, according to Breadon. But fewer than one in every 100 Australian hip replacement patients head home on the same day they arrived. In Canada, it's around one in every three.

“It's not just about hips,” said Breadon. “For a wide range of surgeries, we are far behind most other countries when it comes to sending people home the same day. Thousands of bed days could be freed up by sending patients home sooner while also protecting patients from infections and falls in hospital and helping them recover faster.”

Many other countries have adjusted the prices that hospitals are paid to promote same-day care, which would show the federal government “that value for money will improve, giving them more confidence to tip in the billions of dollars of extra funding the system needs.”

To further reduce the strain on hospitals, McMullen encouraged more focus on and resources for preventing patients from getting sick in the first place. “GPs are the bedrock of prevention. We need, as a health system, to invest in longer consultations and to allow GPs to work more effectively with teams of nurses and allied healthcare professionals. There's lots to do, but we have to do it. What's more important than investing in people's health?”

McMullen, Paolucci, and Breadon reported having no relevant financial relationships. ","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

In patients admitted to the burn ICU, cholestasis was common, and the development of burn‑associated cholestasis (BAC) type B or C, characterised mainly by high bilirubin levels, was associated with increased risks for in‑hospital and overall mortality after 2 weeks.

""Although simple criteria for clinical routine should be encouraged, we show that cholestasis in burn patients is highly dynamic. Here, trajectories of cholestasis parameters, especially bilirubin, seem to provide early prognostic information and should be further exploited,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Lorenz Semmler, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. It was published online on January 14, 2026, in Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics.

The study was retrospective in nature, and limitations regarding standardised documentation and potential loss of information may have occurred. Treatment was not standardised, and the availability of laboratory parameters depended on the length of hospital stay. Data on preexisting liver disease were limited to patient records and self-report, likely underestimating the actual prevalence.

This study did not report any specific funding. One author reported receiving travel support from Amgen. Another author reported receiving grant and travel support, honoraria for consulting, and speaker fees from various companies including Albireo, AbbVie, Novartis, and GSK; he also reported being a co-inventor on patents for the medical use of 24-norursodeoxycholic acid filed by the Medical University of Graz.

In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) without prior cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure (HF) accounted for 16.8% of first major CV events. The occurrence of HF was more strongly associated with older age, higher BMI, and increased albuminuria ― a set of risk factors distinct from those associated with initial atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) events. 

“HF events were observed as the first major CVD events in a sufficiently large proportion of people with [T2D] that HF should not be overlooked in primary prevention. Importantly, this CVD subtype has unique risk factors, which raises the prospect of differentiating its likelihood from CVD that presents first as an ASCVD event,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Julian W. Sacre, PhD, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia. It was published online in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

The study could not differentiate between HF subtypes, such as preserved vs reduced ejection fraction. The analysis drew from two CV outcomes trials that prioritized ASCVD risk in participant selection. Additionally, combining data from two trials conducted a decade apart may have introduced data harmonization issues. 

This study was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and the Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support Program. The trials were sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company and Sanofi. Some authors reported receiving grants, funding, consulting fees, or honoraria from various pharmaceutical companies. One author reported holding shares in Novo Nordisk, and another reported holding a leadership position and a patent.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello. I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I'd like to discuss a very interesting, provocative article that was recently published in JCO Oncology Practice, titled, “Pharmacist-Led Video Consultation to Identify and Mitigate Drug Interactions Among Patients Initiating Oral Anticancer Drugs.” 

I think we all realize that patients, and certainly older adults, in whom cancer is most common, may take multiple medications. The question then comes, what are the potential interactions between anticancer therapies and these drugs? The answer is that we don't really know. 

What we're talking about here is a small study, but a very provocative and important one. It's a single-arm telehealth intervention of a one-time, 30-minute, pharmacist-led video consultation for patients starting oral anticancer drugs at a major academic cancer program. There were 58 patients who were eligible, and 43 patients, or 74%, actually completed the intervention. Again, I want to emphasize this is a small number, but you'll hear the data in a moment.

The median number of medications that these patients were on was nine. I repeat, nine medications was the median for this population. Of the patients, 98% were taking at least five prescriptions — five, minimum.

During this consultation, the pharmacist noted medication errors in the list, based on what was in the electronic medical record, including the drugs and the doses. The median number was two errors, with a range of zero to 16. There was at least a single error in the medication list in 76% of the population and more than one error in 42%; included in these potential interactions were drug metabolism, drug elimination, and drug absorption.

Recognizing the limited number of patients in this survey, many of these patients because of these medications, along with the chemotherapy, required close monitoring or an actual change in the treatment from what was ordered. 

Importantly, the patients who participated in this pilot project noted high satisfaction with intervention. This is not surprising because somebody was actually helping them deal with potential concerns about the medications. 

I think the message here is very clear. This is potentially a really serious problem that we don't have a clue to the extent of it and the potential risks to our patients if we give them anticancer medications and we don't know.

These are pharmacology interactions. Those are not the expertise of these oncologists. The question is, how can we, in a cost-effective manner, bring in someone with the expertise of a pharmacist that can advise patients and doctors to prevent potential serious interactions?

Oral medications are becoming increasingly common anticancer therapies. Patients are taking these medications for much longer, and that's good news because they've been effective, but these potential interactions are real. 

I believe this small study should be a wake-up call for the oncology community to figure out how we can take this limited pilot study with clear cost implications and figure out how we can allow our patients to potentially benefit from that expertise that comes from people actually understanding the interactions between these drugs at the level of the pharmacist. 

I thank you for your attention.

A newly sequenced genome of the bacterium that causes syphilis, Treponema pallidum, highlights the deep antiquity of treponemal diseases in the Americas. The findings, based on a 5,500-year-old specimen from Colombia, suggest syphilis's emergence was not dependent on the agricultural intensification and population crowding often linked to the spread of infectious disease. Instead, it was dependent on social and ecological conditions of hunter-gatherer societies. ""Reframing syphilis, alongside other infectious diseases, as products of both localized and highly specific evolutionary, ecological, and biosocial conditions and globalization may represent critical steps toward reducing stigma and improving public health,"" write Molly Zuckerman and Lydia Ball in a related perspective.

Treponemal diseases, such as syphilis, yaws, bejel, and pinta, have afflicted human populations across much of the world for thousands of years. However, much about the global antiquity and distribution of these diseases, as well as the evolutionary history of the bacteria that cause them, remains unknown. Among the most debated questions is the geographic origin and global spread of syphilis, which is caused by the bacterium T. pallidum. Some argue that the disease originated in the Americas and was brought to the Eastern Hemisphere following European contact in the late 15th century. Others maintain that Treponema was already present in Europe before contact. Yet the rarity and ambiguity of skeletal evidence of these diseases and the technical difficulty of recovering ancient bacterial DNA from affected remains has made addressing these questions difficult.

David Bozzi and colleagues present a 5,500-year-old Treponema genome recovered from Middle Holocene-age human hunter-gatherer remains from Colombia. The new evidence extends the known genetic record of this pathogen by roughly 3,000 years. According to Bozzi et al., phylogenetic analysis shows that this genome (TE1-3) represents a previously unknown branch of T. pallidum that split off before all other known subspecies emerged. Although it falls clearly within the T. pallidum species, TE1-3 is genetically diverse and distinct from modern strains. Notably, the authors found that TE1-3 also carries the full suite of genetic features associated with virulence in modern T. pallidum.

Moreover, the findings suggest that T. pallidum predates the rise of agriculture in the Americas, indicating that the pathogen's emergence was not dependent on the agricultural intensification and population crowding often linked to the spread of infectious disease. Instead, the TE1-3 lineage is associated with the social and ecological conditions of hunter-gatherer societies, including high mobility, small community interactions, and close contact with wild animals. According to Bozzi et al., the study's findings expand the temporal, ecological, and social framework for understanding treponemal disease worldwide.

Analyzing nearly 11.5 million births across four decades, researchers use rigorous methods to show that fluoridated drinking water is not linked to lower birth weight.

Study: Community Water Fluoridation and Birth Outcomes. Image credit: Tatjana Meininger/Shutterstock.com

While fluoridated water is widely considered a public health benefit, its potential association with reduced birth weight has often raised concern. A recent study published online on JAMA Network Open explores this question in a large nationwide study.

The concept of community water fluoridation (CWF) is based on the observation that naturally higher water fluoride levels are associated with lower rates of dental caries at the community level. This large-scale public health experiment began in 1945, when Grand Rapids, Michigan, fluoridated its municipal water supply, with Muskegon, a nearby town, serving as the control.

The original experiment demonstrated its efficacy, with a 60 % reduction in pediatric dental caries in Grand Rapids by 1950. This triggered the widespread rollout of CWF, which covered 63 % of the US population by 2018, up from 3.3 % in 1951. The actual reduction in dental caries is likely to be somewhat lower, at 25 % to 35 %, probably because other fluoridated products are widely available.

Some adverse effects of fluoride are also well documented, such as fluorosis (teeth discoloration) with excessive intake. This is rare with CWF.

Other scientists have suggested that prenatal and early-life fluoride exposure could be associated with impaired cognitive development. Notably, observational studies have produced conflicting findings and have been subject to significant confounding. The current study does not directly evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes but instead focuses on birth outcomes as indicators of early-life health.

The current study used birth weight as an alternative, complementary measure of the putative adverse effects of prenatal fluoride exposure. Birth weight is a reliable marker of overall infant and long-term health. Moreover, it rapidly and sensitively reflects prenatal exposures, reducing biases due to cumulative exposures or other unmeasured confounding factors operating after birth.

Birth weight is also a universally documented measure in the US, along with the mother's county of residence, allowing accurate evaluation of community-level CWF exposure.

Observational studies have reported decreases in birth weight associated with higher fluoride levels in pregnant women. Maternal fluoride exposure raises fetal fluoride levels, potentially inducing oxidative stress. Fluoride may also alter maternal thyroid function or impact placental function. Thus, it may affect birth weight through multiple mechanisms, although these pathways were not directly examined in the current analysis.

The study used a cohort design spanning 1968 to 1988. The researchers chose an event-study analysis with a difference-in-differences (DID) approach. This technique tracks outcome differences in the intervention vs control groups at multiple time points before and after the specified event.

This statistical method is one of several that reduce confounding, demonstrating its value in assessing public health intervention outcomes, especially when experimental research is not feasible. The study design was made possible by the staggered initiation of CWF across US counties. Exposure rates were measured using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Fluoridation Census, which indicates the proportion of county residents who were supplied with fluoridated water.

Birth outcomes before and after the onset of fluoridation were compared within each county in the intervention group. Counties that had never implemented it or had not yet implemented it were in the control group. The researchers primarily evaluated the mean birth weight. Secondary outcomes included the rate of low birth weight, the mean gestational length, and the prematurity rate.

The study included 11,479,922 singleton births across 677 counties, with a mean birth weight of 3.34 kg and a mean gestational age of 39.5 weeks. CWF was implemented in 408 counties, comprising 60 % of the total.

The number of exposed counties increased steadily, covering 46 % of the population. However, 100 % fluoridation did not occur since not all water sources serving a given county were fluoridated at the same time, if ever. On average, CWF increased the proportion of county residents with access to fluoridated water by 32 percentage points.

Significantly, birth weights in the years preceding and after CWF rollout followed similar trends across exposed and control counties. Thus, the study found no evidence of an association between CWF and reduced birth weight.

The current study used a robust statistical technique that reduced the risk of confounding. These results support the interpretation that CWF has no detectable causal effect on birth weight, provided that the timing of CWF within a county is independent of other factors that drive birth weight.

Factors favoring this assumption include the staggered timing of CWF that was apparently systematically unrelated to other public health programs in the county. The study also uses comparisons within rather than between municipalities, yielding an intention-to-treat estimate at the community level rather than an estimate of individual fluoride exposure.

Additional evidence supporting internal validity includes the absence of differences in birth weight trends across counties, regardless of later CWF implementation, and multiple sensitivity analyses.

Limitations of the study include potential misclassification of exposure, as the researchers measured community access to fluoride rather than individual fluoride exposure based on biomarker use. It is possible that other environmental regulations were put into force, which improved water and air quality concomitantly with CWF, confounding the effect on infant health. However, these influences are limited by their national rather than water-district-level impact.

Further support comes from the various sensitivity analyses, which fail to confirm the hypothesis even when restricted to counties with more than 90 % fluoridation coverage, when model alternative exposures, or when accounting for changes in the overall composition of births. Even the most negative estimates discussed represent less than a 1 % change in mean birth weight, suggesting limited clinical significance.

Finally, other exposures, such as disinfectants or anti-corrosion agents added to the water supply, could impair the results of this analysis. However, the consistently null findings across all outcomes make this explanation unlikely.

The study finds no evidence that community water fluoridation during pregnancy adversely affects birth weight, and adds to the body of evidence suggesting no detectable harm for this outcome. It also underlines the need for scientific rigor while framing safety studies to assess public health interventions. This is necessary to avoid drawing causal conclusions from less reliable observational study findings, which may be vulnerable to residual confounding and fade under more stringent quasi-experimental analysis.

Future research should attempt to provide more objective fluoride exposure measurements and capture non-CWF sources of fluoride intake, improving the generalizability of the results.

By analyzing bowel movement frequency in more than 268,000 people, researchers uncover how thiamine-processing genes shape gut motility, link constipation and diarrhea to shared biology, and point to new therapeutic possibilities for IBS and related disorders.

A recent study in Gut focused on identifying genes and mechanisms involved in gut motility to uncover how vitamin B1 processing influences bowel movement frequency (stool frequency, SF) and identifies potential treatment targets for common digestive disorders that affect millions of patients worldwide.

Gastrointestinal (GI) motility refers to the coordinated muscle contractions that move food, liquids, and waste through the digestive system. This process, known as peristalsis, is controlled by the enteric nervous system and modulated by signals from the brain.

Proper digestive motility is essential for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. This complex process is regulated by interactions among the gut-brain axis, the immune system, and the gut microbiome, with additional influences from diet, exercise, and medications.

Disrupted motility underlies irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), other gut-brain interaction disorders, and severe conditions like chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Even though these are common disorders, clinicians experience significant challenges in their treatment, primarily due to a lack of understanding of their root causes. By studying the genetics of gut motility, researchers hope to identify new treatment targets that go beyond symptom management.

Researchers believe that a comprehensive understanding of the genetics of gut motility could help identify new treatment targets. A previous study developed a unique strategy that focused on measurable disease traits, such as gut motility, to identify genes affecting gut function in IBS patients.

Gut motility can be precisely measured by colonic transit time; however, this method is not practical for large-scale genetic studies needed to discover new genes. In contrast, the current study used a more accessible measure of stool frequency (SF), which estimates how often people have bowel movements.

While SF is not a perfect stand-in for gut motility, it correlates with colonic transit time and captures the full range of motility problems, from constipation to diarrhea. A previous proof-of-study tested this approach by analyzing SF genetics in five European populations. This study successfully identified biological pathways and cell types that control gut contractions. The current study aimed to expand the research by using larger datasets, including an East Asian biobank, to enable broader genetic insights.

The current study analyzed questionnaire data from 268,606 people across six biobanks, five European ancestry groups, and one East Asian group. SF ranged from 0.98 to 1.42 bowel movements per day across the different populations. IBS prevalence followed a U-shaped pattern, with constipation predominant IBS at one end of the frequency spectrum and diarrhea predominant IBS at the other.

In the European meta-analysis, a total of 7,879,955 genetic variants were analyzed, yielding 3,083 significant genetic markers at 12 independent genomic locations, including two that had never been linked to SF. Separate analyses by sex did not reveal any additional genetic signals.

Genetics accounted for about 7 percent of the variation in SF among Europeans. A significant genetic overlap was observed with 164 conditions spanning digestive, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurological, and psychiatric domains. SF also showed genetic connections to various pain-related traits.

Combining all 268,606 participants in a multi-ancestry analysis revealed 479 significant markers across 18 genomic locations. Together, these corresponded to 21 independent genetic signals, including 10 newly identified loci, nearly doubling the number previously linked to stool frequency. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed bidirectional causal effects between SF and diverticular disease, while also showing that SF has causal effects on IBS, but IBS does not causally influence SF. Hemorrhoids were found to have a negative causal effect on SF, suggesting a protective effect against higher stool frequency. A total of 21 genetic locations were identified along with 197 protein-coding genes.

Fine mapping determined specific genetic variants that influence GI motility. The analysis pinpointed three specific genetic variants with high confidence: rs12407945 in Europeans, and rs2581260 and rs12022782 in the multi-ancestry analysis.

The top variant affects SLC35F3, a gene that transports vitamin B1 into cells, influencing expression in the brain and digestive tract and potentially integrating central and enteric nervous system control of motility. The second variant links to hemorrhoids, but its mechanism remains unclear. The third affects XPR1, a phosphate exporter also linked to blood pressure. Phosphate export by XPR1 is essential for converting thiamine into its biologically active form, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Other notable genes include KLB, which regulates bile acid metabolism and colonic transit, and COLQ, which controls gut nerve signaling and is associated with diverticular disease risk.

SLC35F3 transports thiamine into cells, while XPR1 exports phosphate needed to activate it. Analysis of 98,449 participants confirmed that higher thiamine intake was associated with higher SF in observational dietary data, with the effect depending on which gene variants a person carried. This suggests these genes regulate how the body uses vitamin B1 to control gut motility rather than acting through a single organ or pathway.

Drug signature analysis computationally prioritized 831 compounds that could speed up or slow down gut motility based on gene expression patterns. These could be further explored for better treatment opportunities, but have not yet been tested experimentally in this context.

This genetic analysis of SF reveals new insights into how the gut controls motility. The study uncovered a surprising role for vitamin B1 metabolism in gut motility. This discovery opens possibilities for dietary or drug interventions targeting thiamine pathways.

Because SF is a questionnaire-based proxy for motility, and dietary thiamine intake was assessed observationally rather than through intervention trials, the authors emphasize the need for mechanistic studies and clinical validation. Many existing medications, particularly cardiovascular drugs, could be repurposed to treat IBS and other gut motility disorders, but further experimental and clinical investigation is required.

For more than a century, oral insulin has been considered a ""dream"" therapy for diabetes, hindered by enzymatic degradation in the digestive tract and the absence of a dedicated intestinal transport mechanism. Consequently, many patients must rely on daily insulin injections, which can significantly reduce their quality of life.

A research team at Kumamoto University, led by Associate Professor Shingo Ito, has developed a breakthrough drug-delivery platform using a small-intestine-permeable cyclic peptide known as the DNP peptide, enabling efficient oral delivery of insulin.

The researchers established two effective approaches to facilitate the intestinal absorption of insulin:

Unlike previous oral insulin approaches requiring very high doses (often over ten times that of an injection), this platform achieved a pharmacological bioavailability of approximately 33–41% relative to subcutaneous injection. This result demonstrates a substantial reduction in the amount of insulin needed for oral administration and marks a key step toward practical clinical use.

""Insulin injections remain a daily burden for many patients,"" said Associate Professor Shingo Ito.

Our peptide-based platform offers a new route to deliver insulin orally and may be applicable to long-acting insulin formulations and other injectable biologics.""

Shingo Ito, Associate Professor, Kumamoto University

The study was published in the international journal Molecular Pharmaceutics on November 24, 2025. The team is now progressing toward translational studies, including evaluations in large animal models and human intestinal systems.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Lab efficiency: Avoiding the hidden costs of inefficiency","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20260123/Lab-efficiency-Avoiding-the-hidden-costs-of-inefficiency.aspx","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:50:00 GMT","

Managing any laboratory is a demanding task. With so many priorities to consider, including meeting deadlines, maintaining equipment, and controlling costs, it can be easy for inefficiencies to go unnoticed.

For cryogenic storage facilities in particular, this is why it is so important to ensure the laboratory is operating efficiently. It is not only about cost control or streamlining processes, but also about maintaining high standards, ensuring employee safety, and protecting valuable samples.

Below are key recommendations to help laboratory managers avoid the hidden costs of inefficiency.

It may seem unexpected coming from one of the United Kingdom's leading suppliers of liquid nitrogen, but Air Products actively helps customers identify ways to reduce consumption. Lower usage reduces one of the largest ongoing operating costs, while fewer deliveries also support sustainability objectives and reduce environmental impact.

Reducing liquid nitrogen usage ultimately comes down to making the right choices.

Laboratory equipment plays a critical role in overall efficiency. While lower-cost equipment may offer initial savings, equipment that is not well-suited to operational requirements or not fit for purpose can result in significantly higher long-term costs. This is particularly true for cryogenic freezers.

For example, a cryogenic freezer adapted from a design intended for liquid storage, or one that stores liquid nitrogen in a jacket with a dry vapor storage area, may be less expensive to purchase. However, with a smaller reservoir, it consumes more liquid nitrogen through evaporation and requires more frequent refilling, often every one to two days rather than every four to seven days for an efficient vapor storage freezer.

In addition, the freezer design is fundamentally compromised, resulting in a hold time of only two to four days compared with the 13 to 21 days offered by efficient vapor storage freezers. This also means additional cover is required during holiday periods to maintain sample safety.

It quickly becomes clear how inefficiencies and associated costs can accumulate.

For many laboratories and clinics, space is limited, making efficient use of available space essential. A well-organized laboratory is inherently more efficient, but effective space utilization often depends on equipment selection.

Air Products frequently encounters laboratory storage rooms filled with dewars spread across the floor, consuming valuable space and making sample access and management difficult.

These dewars typically require manual filling with liquid nitrogen, increasing the risk of spills, operator safety hazards, and potential floor damage. In addition, individual alarms often need to be retrofitted separately.

By contrast, investing in freezers designed for high-volume, long-term vapor storage at temperatures down to –190 °C, such as those from the MVE range recommended by Air Products, can deliver significant benefits.

Advanced features, including automated monitoring, auto-fill systems, and internal carousels that bring samples to the operator, improve accessibility, reduce physical strain, and streamline operations. These systems also allow greater sample volumes to be stored within a similar or smaller footprint, maximizing available space.

Selecting the right equipment also significantly improves sample security. High-quality liquid nitrogen freezers offer extended hold times, increasing safety margins, and allowing more time to respond to events such as power failures.

For example, the MVE HEco™ Series provides hold times ranging from 13 to 27 days. These freezers also use advanced insulation technology to maintain a highly uniform temperature profile throughout the storage chamber.

Improving freezer quality and efficiency can therefore have a positive impact on operating costs, productivity, and institutional reputation.

Laboratory efficiency can often be improved by reviewing layout, ensuring frequently used equipment is easily accessible, and that there is sufficient space for safe movement. In cryogenic laboratories, layout and location are especially important for controlling operating costs.

Where reconfiguration is possible, or when designing a new facility, positioning freezers as close as possible to the liquid nitrogen source is essential. Ideally, the laboratory should be located on the ground floor against an external wall, with space outside for a liquid nitrogen storage tank that can be easily accessed for deliveries.

This arrangement allows for a short pipeline, typically using a Super Insulated Vacuum Line, with stable pressures and minimal liquid nitrogen losses during filling.

It also reduces the need for complex and costly HVAC systems, requiring only basic ventilation or extraction. In addition, it eliminates inefficient and potentially hazardous practices such as moving heavy liquid nitrogen vessels through the building.

Every laboratory is different, and ideal conditions are not always achievable. However, there are often opportunities to improve efficiency by taking a different approach. This is an area where the Air Products Biomedical team has extensive experience.

In many cases, Air Products specialists have helped customers improve laboratory efficiency in ways they did not initially consider possible, streamlining operations and significantly reducing ongoing costs.

This past September, United States Women's National Team's (USWNT) 21-year-old star Alyssa Thompson signed a contract to transfer from the National Women's Soccer League's (NWSL) Angel City FC to Chelsea FC in England's Women's Super League (WSL).
Thompson's move comes amid a growing wave of USWNT players heading overseas. In recent years, starting center back Naomi Girma and defender Emily Fox have also made the jump to European clubs.
So what is driving this trend?
One major factor is money. The NWSL operates under a $3.5 million team salary cap, while the WSL does not currently enforce such a cap. When Girma transferred to Chelsea, she became the most expensive women's soccer player in history, with the club paying $1.1 million to acquire her from the NWSL's San Diego Wave. Previously, when soccer icons Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan played for Lyon in 2013 and 2017, respectively, they reportedly earned more in a single month than many NWSL players made in an entire season.
European leagues also offer prestige and increased competitive opportunities. The WSL provides multiple high-profile competitions including the Football Association Challenge Cup, the League Cup and the UEFA Women's Champions League. For many American players, the Champions League remains the most coveted club trophy in the world. By comparison, the NWSL has only recently introduced additional competitions—and those tournaments have yet to gain widespread traction.
International experience is another draw. The NWSL is largely composed of American players whereas European leagues feature rosters filled with international talent. Competing with and against players from different countries can help athletes develop their game and better prepare for major international tournaments such as the FIFA Women's World Cup and the Olympics.
Why now?
While American players moving abroad is not new, the pace of these transfers has accelerated in recent years largely due to changes in the U.S. Soccer Federation's relationship with the NWSL.
Before 2022, many USWNT players were signed as “federation players” under U.S. Soccer contracts, making them the highest-paid athletes in the league. This system encouraged national team players to remain in the NWSL, as all USWNT players during the 2015 and 2019 World Cup cycles were based domestically. In effect, playing in the NWSL was closely tied to national team opportunities.
Now, players are free to sign wherever they choose. Five starters from the most recent Olympic roster are currently playing abroad. USWNT head coach and former Chelsea Women's head coach Emma Hayes has even faced criticism for the growing migration of players to Europe—though she has emphasized that the decisions ultimately rest with the athletes.
What does this mean for the NWSL?
The NWSL is still widely considered the top professional women's league in the world, and viewership and popularity have continued to rise over the past year. However, the departure of elite players like Girma and Thompson raises concerns about whether the league's overall quality and star power could decline over time.
There is a harsh reality to acknowledge: Women's soccer is still not among the most widely followed sports in the United States. If you ask a random person to name a women's soccer player, they will likely mention household names like Alex Morgan or Hope Solo who are now retired or no longer active at the top professional level. Among current players, the most recognizable names tend to come from recent U.S. national team and Olympic rosters such as Mallory Swanson, Trinity Rodman and Sophia Wilson. While all three currently play in the NWSL, they have also attracted strong interest from top European clubs, reflecting the growing global demand for elite American talent.
In response, the NWSL has begun taking steps to retain top talent after European clubs pursued Rodman. To keep Rodman in the NWSL, the league introduced the High Impact Player Rule (HIP), now commonly referred to as the “Rodman Rule.” This policy allows teams to spend an additional $1 million beyond the salary cap to sign or retain elite players who meet specific criteria, such as national team minutes or high rankings on year-end lists like ESPN's Top 50.
However, the NWSL Players Association has already challenged the rule, arguing that it violates the league's collective bargaining agreement and federal labor law. The union has instead advocated for raising the overall salary cap.
What's the bottom line?
The bottom line is that many of these top-performing athletes are not paid at a level that reflects their talent, workload or impact. Outside of a small group of high-profile stars, many NWSL players earn salaries that are barely a livable wage. To put the gap into perspective, the minimum salary for an NFL rookie is approximately $840,000, while Rodman earns roughly $275,000 annually from her NWSL contract. Even Morgan, widely considered one of the most recognizable women's soccer players in the world, earned around $250,000 per year in league salary at her peak. For many of these top athletes, a significant portion of their income comes from off-field endorsement deals—an opportunity that is far less accessible for lesser-known players, further widening the financial gap within the sport.
Despite these challenges, the NWSL continues to look ahead. The league plans to expand by three teams by 2028, signaling confidence in long-term growth. With the rising popularity of women's sports, the league may continue to thrive, but the loss of star players could have a greater impact than many expect.

Trinity Rodman didn't just sign a contract this week—she rewrote the economic ceiling of women's soccer, especially in the United States. The 23-year-old forward agreed to a new three-year deal with the Washington Spirit through 2028 reportedly worth more than $1 million per year, instantly making her the highest-paid player in NWSL history and among highest-paid women's soccer players in the world.

RELATED: 5 Cameron Brink Card Sales from 2025: Is it too late to get in on This Star?

For collectors, moments like this matter. Salary breakthroughs tend to coincide with broader visibility, league-wide change, and a player crossing from star into market reference point. In Rodman's case, the deal didn't just reward performance, it helped force structural change, prompting the NWSL to introduce a new “High Impact Player” mechanism (quickly nicknamed the “Rodman Rule”) that allows teams to spend up to $1 million over the cap to retain truly elite talent. That's the kind of milestone that anchors an era.

RELATED:  Top 5 Liv Morgan Card Sales of 2025

Rodman's rise has been fast, loud, and largely uninterrupted. Drafted No. 2 overall by the Spirit in 2021 at just 18 years old, she became the youngest player ever selected in the NWSL draft and immediately justified the gamble. That same season she won NWSL Rookie of the Year and U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year, while delivering an extra-time assist in the NWSL Championship to help Washington lift the title.

By 19, she already held playoff records, and in 2022 she signed a reported $1.1 million extension that briefly made her the league's highest-paid player at the time. Even before this latest contract, the Spirit had effectively built around her as a franchise face: high-energy winger, defensive pest, transition threat, and marketing centerpiece rolled into one.

Internationally, Rodman has quickly become one of the defining figures of the U.S. women's national team's transition period. Since her senior debut in 2022, she has earned 47 caps with double‑digit goals and assists while helping the USWNT win the Concacaf W Championship, three straight SheBelieves Cups, the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup, and Olympic gold at Paris 2024.

Armed with speed, physicality, pressing, and highlight-reel finishes, her game translates cleanly to big moments and global broadcasts. Even after a recent back-injury layoff, her return to national-team camps under Emma Hayes has reinforced that she's viewed as a long-term pillar, not just a supporting piece.

Rodman's story also resonates beyond soccer. As the daughter of NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman, she entered the spotlight early, but made a point of carving her own path. She chose soccer over basketball, turned pro instead of playing college soccer at Washington State, and reached franchise-player status before turning 24. That blend of legacy, independence, and early success has helped push her into mainstream awareness.

Now, the numbers match the narrative. With club salaries historically topping out in the mid-six figures—nd even global stars in Europe often sitting below the $1 million mark—Rodman's deal stands as a genuine market reset. An NWSL winger in her early prime now sits at or above the club salary level of Ballon d'Or winners and Champions League icons.

For collectors, that's the signal. Contracts don't make careers, but they crystallize them. And Trinity Rodman's new deal feels like the moment her story, status, and market finally aligned.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Trinity Rodman becomes highest-paid player in women's soccer in landmark deal","https://fortune.com/2026/01/23/trinity-rodman-highest-paid-player-womens-soccer-business/","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:42:00 GMT","

There's a new highest-paid player in women's soccer. It's Trinity Rodman, the Washington Spirit star—and she's staying in the National Women's Soccer League. 

This is a “monumental and game-changing moment” for the sport, Rodman said of her deal—worth around $2 million a year through 2028. It's also a game-changing moment for the business of women's soccer in the U.S. 

The National Women's Soccer League is only 13 years old. Women's professional leagues have come and gone in the U.S., compared to Europe and globally where soccer is a much more established sport. Top-tier players have often left the U.S. to play abroad, where they can earn significantly bigger salaries (the previous top-paid player was in Barcelona). Depending on the player, however, it can be a trade-off with the brand opportunities in the U.S. market. Meanwhile, American soccer has struggled with pay equity and the U.S. Women's National Team's famous lawsuit. 

The NWSL spent the past few months figuring out how to keep Rodman in the league. The Washington Spirit, which is owned by billionaire Michele Kang, wanted to keep her. But they weren't allowed to throw money at Rodman, due to the league's salary cap rules. After months of back-and-forth, the league debuted a new “high-impact player” rule that allowed teams to pay extra for star players, determined by both on-field ability and commercial potential. There's still some uncertainty regarding this rule; the players' union has objected to it, saying it was not negotiated and violated their collective-bargaining agreement. ESPN reports that while the rule's ultimate form is still up in the air, Rodman's contract is still a contract and will be honored. 

In many ways, it's been a challenging year for women's sports. Hyper-growth comes with growing pains; cracks in the foundation appear. The WNBA is currently operating without a contract with its players, who demand a greater share of the league's revenue. Its 30th season is set to kick off in May—if both sides can come to an agreement in time. 

While we wait for a resolution that will support the continued growth of women's basketball, in women's soccer Rodman's contract can set a new standard. If the investors who see so much financial potential for women's sports want to realize those outcomes, they'll need the best players in the world. For now, the NWSL has figured out how to hold onto its best. That's not just good for Rodman—it's good for the players who come after her and for every stakeholder who wants to see this sport thrive.

Trinity Rodman is staying in the National Women's Soccer League.

The US Women's National Team star became the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world Thursday as she signed a new contract with the Washington Spirit.

According to ESPN's Jeff Kassouf, the three-year deal is worth $2 million annually, “a world record.”

“First off, it's amazing, but it's also relieving to finally have pen to paper, signed, confirmed,” Rodman said on SportsCenter Thursday evening. “I'm staying with the Spirit, so it is a relief, but I'm just thrilled. Very blessed. Very excited.”

Rodman entered free agency at the end of last season, but the process of re-signing her created league-wide issues. European teams — which do not have salary caps — attempted to lure the 23-year-old abroad, competing with an NWSL salary cap that would have limited Rodman's earning potential.

The NWSL rejected an earlier deal between the Spirit and Rodman, saying that it went against the spirit of the league's rules. The National Women's Soccer League Players Association filed a grievance before the NWSL created a “High Impact Player” rule, allowing teams to go above the salary cap for a certain caliber of player.

“It's been a roller coaster of emotions through it because there's one side of wanting to be paid well, wanting to stay in the US and represent my country, but also there's the other aspect — the other piece — of we want to get a lot more players paid this and continue to raise the bar for that,"" Rodman said. “Again, celebrating me, but at the same time, it's a big moment for soccer as a whole and another stepping (stone) for another opportunity for somebody else and hopefully numerous people around the league.”

WASHINGTON — Trinity Rodman has signed a big new contract that makes her the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world. The forward agreed on a three-year deal with the Washington Spirit that will keep her with the team through 2028.

Rodman's contract is worth more than $2 million annually when bonuses are included, according to her agent. 

This makes her salary the highest ever for a female soccer player, topping previous records around the sport.

The 23-year-old was set to be a free agent after her old deal ended in 2025. Many teams in other countries, including clubs in Europe, were interested in signing her before she chose to stay with the Spirit.

Her new contract reflects recent changes to the National Women's Soccer League's salary rules. The league introduced a “High Impact Player” rule that allows teams to pay extra money to top players like Rodman. This rule made her record contract possible.

Rodman has been a standout player since she was drafted by the Spirit in 2021. She was the youngest player ever selected in the NWSL draft and has scored many goals for both her club and the U.S. Women's National Team.

Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang said the team sees Rodman as a key part of its future. Kang said the club wants to build a strong team that will compete for championships every year.

Some people see Rodman's new deal as a sign that women's soccer is growing and earning more respect around the world. Many hope that more star players will be able to earn bigger salaries as the sport becomes more popular.

In a move that's turning heads throughout the soccer world, Richy Ledezma has officially switched his national team allegiance from the United States to Mexico, with FIFA confirming the change on January 20, 2026. The 25-year-old right wingback, born in Phoenix to Mexican parents, is now set to don the green of El Tri after previously representing the U.S. at youth and senior levels. His switch, announced by the Mexican soccer federation and FIFA, comes at a time when Mexico is actively reshaping its roster ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Ledezma's journey to this pivotal moment has been anything but ordinary. He first made waves as a standout for the U.S. squad at the 2019 Under-20 World Cup in Poland, later earning a senior cap in a friendly against Panama on November 16, 2020. But despite his promising performances in Europe with Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, Ledezma found himself overlooked by the U.S. national team in recent years, even as he played regularly overseas.



""I would like to represent Mexico,"" Ledezma declared last year, making no secret of his aspirations. ""My dream is to go to the World Cup."" After six seasons in the Netherlands, he signed with Mexican powerhouse Chivas de Guadalajara in June 2025. His impact was immediate, starting in the first three matches of the Clausura tournament and impressing coach Javier Aguirre, who has been searching for a reliable right wingback since taking the helm in August 2024.

The right wingback position has been a revolving door for Mexico, with Aguirre trying about six different players in that spot. Ledezma's arrival couldn't be timelier, as Mexico gears up for two high-profile friendlies—against Panama on January 22 and Bolivia on January 25. Both matches serve as critical auditions for players hoping to make the final World Cup roster.

But Ledezma isn't the only Mexican-American making headlines. Brian Gutiérrez, a 22-year-old attacking midfielder from Chicago, is also in the mix for Mexico's January camp. Unlike Ledezma, Gutiérrez never played in an official competition for the U.S. at any level, so he didn't need to file a one-time switch. He remains eligible to represent either country until he appears in a competitive senior match. Gutiérrez, who came through the Chicago Fire academy and made his mark in Major League Soccer, obtained a Mexican passport in the fall of 2025, moved to Chivas in December, and now finds himself called up to El Tri alongside Ledezma.

According to a U.S. Soccer spokesperson, ""Gutiérrez never played in an official competition for the U.S. at any level. He therefore did not need to file a one-time switch."" This subtle difference in their paths underscores the complexity of FIFA's eligibility rules, which allow dual-national players to make a one-time change of association under certain circumstances.



FIFA's Players' Status Chamber approved Ledezma's switch this month, making him officially committed to Mexico for the rest of his international career. The Mexican federation, FMF, wasted little time, announcing both Ledezma and Gutiérrez as part of their 27-man roster for the January friendlies. The camp, held during a Liga MX pause, is designed to give the coaching staff a closer look at less-heralded players, with most mainstays like Edson Álvarez and Raúl Jiménez remaining with their European clubs.

This January's roster is almost entirely composed of players from Mexican clubs, with one notable exception: Seattle Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas, another Mexican-American dual national who also opted to represent Mexico over the U.S. The inclusion of so many dual nationals reflects a broader strategy by Mexico to tap into the rich talent pool of Mexican-Americans, many of whom have developed in the U.S. system but retain strong ties to their heritage.

Ledezma's move to Chivas was a significant step in his career. Chivas, known for its policy of fielding only Mexican players, immediately benefited from his European experience. After a strong Apertura campaign, Ledezma's ambitions became clear. ""My dream is to go to the World Cup,"" he said, and now that dream appears within reach. Coach Javier Aguirre, facing mounting pressure to solidify his defense, seems ready to give Ledezma every chance to claim the right wingback spot.

Meanwhile, Gutiérrez's rise has been just as remarkable. After being omitted from the U.S. Men's National Team's 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup roster despite making the broader provisional list, he seized the opportunity to pursue his international future with Mexico. His versatility as an attacking midfielder, coupled with his youth and MLS experience, make him an intriguing option for Aguirre's evolving squad.



Both players' stories highlight the increasingly fluid nature of international soccer allegiances, particularly for dual nationals. The U.S. and Mexico have long competed for the loyalty of players like Ledezma and Gutiérrez, who straddle two cultures and two soccer traditions. The stakes are especially high with the 2026 World Cup looming, and both federations are keenly aware of the need to secure top talent.

For Ledezma, the decision was both personal and professional. Born and raised in Phoenix, he's always felt a strong connection to his Mexican roots. His parents' heritage and his own experiences in Liga MX have shaped his identity as a player. Now, as he prepares to make his first appearance for Mexico's senior national team, he carries the hopes of fans on both sides of the border.

The friendlies against Panama and Bolivia aren't just tune-ups—they're auditions. With Aguirre's right wingback dilemma still unresolved, Ledezma has a realistic shot at locking down the position for the World Cup. Gutiérrez, too, will be eager to impress, knowing that a strong showing could cement his place in future call-ups.

As the January camp unfolds, all eyes will be on these Mexican-American standouts. Their journeys reflect the changing landscape of North American soccer, where identity, opportunity, and ambition intersect in fascinating ways. With the World Cup on the horizon and competition for roster spots fiercer than ever, every appearance counts.

For now, the spotlight shines brightest on Richy Ledezma, whose bold switch could pay dividends for both player and country. The coming friendlies promise to be more than just games—they're the opening chapters of a new era for Mexico's national team, one defined by fresh faces, renewed ambition, and the unbreakable bonds of heritage.

Arsenal will be one of the four competing teams in a few weeks time after winning the Champions League in 2025 David Ramos/Getty Images

The winners of the inaugural Women's Champions Cup will earn $2.3million (£1.69m; €1.95m), FIFA announced on Friday.

The global football organisation said on top of the “highest single payout ever awarded in women's football”, the second-placed team will earn $1million and the third and fourth-placed sides will earn $200,000 for participating in a prize pot totalling $6m.

The maiden intercontinental tournament — between January 28 and February 1 — will see the best club from each confederation (UEFA, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL) in a calendar year compete over two semi-finals and a final.

This year, Gotham FC (United States) will face SC Corinthians (Brazil) while Arsenal will take on ASFAR (Morocco) before the winners of each tie compete for the title at the Emirates Stadium in London. The champions of the federations representing Oceania (Auckland United FC) and Asia (Wuhan Chegu Jiangda WFC) were eliminated in the earlier rounds and will receive $100,000 each.

“Our focus is clear,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom said in a release on Friday. “To continue investing in, growing and elevating women's club football at every level – ensuring that opportunity, visibility and value keep pace with the exceptional performances seen on the pitch.”

The promised prize money is only $200,000 shy of the $2.5m awarded to the winners of 2025's global seven-a-side tournament that featured clubs such as Manchester United, Manchester City, winners Bayern Munich and San Diego Wave. By contrast, the women's Champions League winners last year won €350,000 ($412,417), though money was also given out in the group stages.

The Champions Cup is set to take place annually in the other three years of the Club World Cup cycle, of which the first edition will be held in 2028.","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

ZURICH — FIFA will pay $2.3 million in prize money to the club that wins the first Women's Champions Cup at Arsenal's stadium next week.

The total fund detailed on Friday by FIFA will share $3.9 million among the six continental champions. The final stages in London are a warmup for a planned full Women's Club World Cup in 2028.

 European champion Arsenal will play ASFAR of Morocco after Gotham from the United States plays Corinthians of Brazil in back-to-back semifinals on Wednesday at the home of Premier League club Brentford.

The final at Arsenal's stadium on Feb. 1 will follow a third-place game at the same venue.

The champion gets $2.3 million and the beaten finalist $1 million, with $200,000 paid to each of the losing semifinalists.

Two continental champions already eliminated in earlier rounds — Auckland United from Oceania and Wuhan Chegu Jiangda representing Asia — each get $100,000.

The prize money is “a clear statement of the belief in women's club football and the players, teams and competitions driving its continued rise,” FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafström said in a statement.

Arsenal got more than 1.5 million euros ($1.8 million) in prize money for winning the UEFA Women's Champions League last season.

 FIFA paid $1 billion among 32 teams in the men's 2025 Club World Cup. That tournament in the United States was backed by Saudi Arabian money to ensure influential European clubs got the prize money they sought to agree to take part.

The LEGO Group are building towards 2026 in serious style. Teaming up with FIFA ahead of the next World Cup, the iconic toy brand have pulled together a proper meeting of footballing immortals to celebrate the reveal of the LEGO Editions FIFA World Cup Official Trophy — and the vibes are exactly what you'd hope for.

Ahead of next summer's tournament, LEGO will roll out a dedicated product portfolio celebrating the biggest stage in the game, starting with the most iconic symbol of them all. Launching in March 2026, the LEGO FIFA World Cup Official Trophy is the first-ever, officially licensed 1:1 LEGO replica of world football's ultimate prize. Built from an impressive 2,842 pieces, it's designed as a centrepiece — something to build, display and obsess over as the tournament approaches.

A post shared by SoccerBible (@soccerbible)

A hidden scene sits inside the upper globe, revealed via a pullable slip, featuring the 2026 World Cup logo and an exclusive branded minifigure holding a miniature version of the trophy itself — a subtle nod to every fan's dream of lifting it one day. Beneath the base, a printed plaque lists every World Cup winner since 1974, grounding the set firmly in football history.

Even the gold matters. Two different finishes — drum-lacquered bricks and moulded gold pieces — combine to give the trophy its unmistakable sheen. It's also the first LEGO set ever to use this volume of gold-coloured elements, underlining just how special this one is meant to be.

And what better way to show it off than with the help of Roberto Carlos, Cafu, Iker Casillas, Sami Khedira and Marco Materazzi. Five winners. Five different journeys to the summit of world football. 

A post shared by SoccerBible (@soccerbible)

In a behind-the-scenes video, the legends are given their first look at the LEGO trophy set, and the reactions do not disappoint. There's laughter, disbelief, and that familiar glint in the eye that only comes from remembering what it feels like to lift the real thing. Stories spill out naturally — moments from finals, the weight of the trophy, the noise of the crowd — all refracted through a playful, nostalgic lens.

Naturally, things get competitive. Roberto Carlos and Cafu waste no time arguing over who gets to take the trophy home, before all five icons are handed personalised sets of their own. Beyond the jokes, though, there's a genuine sense of reflection. On childhood dreams. On football as a form of immortality. And on why a LEGO World Cup trophy might just be the perfect bridge between generations of fans.

As Roberto Carlos puts it: “Winning the FIFA World Cup was one of the most incredible moments of my life, and I'll never forget what it felt like to hold that trophy. I know we couldn't have achieved it without our amazing fans and what this trophy means to them. Now, with the LEGO World Cup Trophy set, fans can create their own version and bring that magic home. This isn't just about building a trophy; it's about sharing the love of football with family and friends.”

The LEGO Editions FIFA World Cup Official Trophy building set is available for pre-order now at LEGO.com. It will be on sale on LEGO.com, LEGO Stores and in selected retailers around the world, starting 1st March 2026.

The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 is set to revamp the competition into a truly global event that will bring together the best club sides from across the globe. Here we take a closer look at the intricate detail behind the design of the tournament's new trophy.

It may be next year but the hype for World Cup 2026 starts now as FIFA unveil the official host city posters for the tournament.  Each piece is a work of art, designed to mirror each city's identity and football culture before bringing the biggest competition in football to their doorstep. 

Football's next big thing just dropped. Adidas show off the ‘Trionda' for the first time, which will hit the pitch as the official match ball next summer in the 2026 World Cup. The design pays homage to all three host nations with some bold graphics, blending performance, aesthetics, and culture for the game's biggest stage.

adidas have officially unveiled the match ball for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, and it's a beauty. With the tournament fast approaching, this release bolsters the excitement for another summer of football. We can't wait. 

The 2022 World Cup just got a little bit more real, as FIFA unveiled the emblem for the tournament that's set to be hosted in Qatar. And yep, it's still going to be the first World Cup to be played in November and December. Still struggling with that one…

Having collaborated since 2010 FIFA and Lous Vuitton have taken their relationship to new heights as the brand have revealed an entire collection of leather goods along with the official World Cup Trophy travel case. 

In what is surely set to be one of the last big additions to the FIFA franchise as we know it, EA Sports has revealed an overview of features for its FIFA Women's World Cup Australia and New Zealand 2023 update.

adidas and FIFA have revealed their 2018 World Cup tournament trophies for the Golden Boot, Golden Ball and Golden Glove, revealed this week at a special adidas pop-up store in Moscow.

Fifa

Fifa has teamed up with Michele Kang for the inaugural Women's Champions Cup in an agreement that will see her multi-club soccer ownership group Kynisca sponsor the tournament.

The pact makes Kynisca the presenter partner of this year's tournament, which is taking place in London from 28th January to 1st February,  and the organisation will be integrated across key tournament and final phase moments through branding and storytelling.

Fifa added that the union would create new global opportunities for women's club soccer and increase the visibility of the next generation of female athletes worldwide.

“The launch of the Fifa Women's Champions Cup is a powerful step forward for women's club football globally,” said Jill Ellis, Fifa's chief football officer.

“Partnering with Kynisca underlines our shared, unwavering commitment to building platforms that showcase the pinnacle of women's football. Fifa would like to express our gratitude to Michele Kang, a true pioneer of the women's game, for her support of this game-changing competition.”

Kang added: “The inaugural Fifa Women's Champions Cup represents a defining moment for women's football. Partnering with Fifa on this historic competition reflects Kynisca's belief in the power, potential and global appeal of the women's game. We are proud to support a tournament that will set new benchmarks for excellence and ambition.”

The first edition of the Women's Champions Cup was confirmed last March after the launch of a 16-team Women's Club World Cup was postponed until 2028. Fifa plans to hold the Women's Club World Cup every four years, with the Women's Champions Cup being held in the other three years of each cycle.

The competition features the champion clubs from each of the six continental confederations. The semi-finals will be played at Gtech Community Stadium, home of Premier League club Brentford, before Arsenal's Emirates Stadium hosts the third-place playoff and final.

DAZN will broadcast the Women's Champions Cup in most countries around the world, with Fifa finally securing a deal just weeks before the opening matchup. Sky Sports will air the competition in the UK and Ireland and streamer CazeTV will do the same for Brazil. Fifa has also struck a deal with Morocco's national broadcaster and DAZN has secured the rights to the semi-finals in the US.

Fifa has also struck a deal with Morocco's national broadcaster SNRT and DAZN has secured the rights to air the semi-finals in the US.”

Kang, who made her fortune in health technology, launched Kynisca in 2024 and its clubs include the National Women's Soccer League's (NWSL) Washington Spirit, the Women's Super League's (WSL) London City Lionesses, and French Première Ligue outfit OL Lyonnes. Last year also saw Kang commit US$25 million to support US Soccer, following a US$30 million donation in 2024.

Speaking to SportsPro last year, Kang said she wanted to own “at least one club in each continent”.

Fifa usually reserves sponsorship of its tournaments for major consumer brands, but this deal further solidifies Kynisca as a central player in the commercialisation of women's soccer.

For Kang, who is is deputy chair of Fifa's committee for women's club competitions, the agreement offers global visibility for Kynisca as it seeks to establish itself as the world's pre-eminent women's sports organisation. Fifa, meanwhile, enhances the credibility and legitimacy of its new tournament by aligning with arguably the most influential investor in women's soccer.

More broadly, this partnership suggests that the future of the women's soccer commercial ecosystem may be shaped not only by traditional sponsors but also by investors in the sport.

Even for the ambitious MLS club, it's a dream too big","https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6992679/2026/01/23/inter-miami-copa-libertadores-jorge-mas-messi-mls-conmebol-concacaf/","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:43:01 GMT","

MLS

 Nathan Ray Seebeck / Imagn Images

Inter Miami's club motto is an aspirational call to action that the club's co-founder, Jorge Mas, often points to as the foundation of the MLS side's ambition. “Freedom to dream” is plastered throughout Inter Miami's training facility in Fort Lauderdale. It's on the club's jerseys and Mas himself repeats it publicly.

Advertisement

After Inter Miami won the MLS Cup final in December, Mas told Apple TV that the team's success was “based on dreaming.” The club's first MLS title was a dream come true for the Cuban-American billionaire. But Mas has another dream that will be significantly more difficult to accomplish.

Last week when Inter Miami kicked off 2026 MLS preseason, Mas told reporters that seeing the club and Lionel Messi compete in South America's Copa Libertadores is still on the table. How viable that is, however, is certainly up for debate. There are many hurdles that a North American club must bypass in order to gain access to CONMEBOL's premier club competition.

Mas knows this, but that hasn't stopped him from, well, dreaming about that possibility. “It's a dream,” Mas said when asked about how serious he is about pushing MLS into the Copa Libertadores.

“Dreams come true, right?” he continued. “I have had conversations with CONMEBOL and with (president) Alejandro (Domínguez) about looking into participation in the Copa Libertadores. There are precedents because Mexican clubs have played in the Libertadores before.”

Liga MX teams not only participated in the Copa Libertadores, they competed at a high level for nearly a decade. From 1998 to 2016, Mexican clubs were part of the Copa Libertadores field, which pitted Liga MX sides against some of South America's biggest and most successful clubs. Cruz Azul, Chivas de Guadalajara and Tigres all reached the Libertadores final.

Cruz Azul lost to the dynasty that was the 2001 version of Boca Juniors. Chivas succumbed to Brazil's Internacional in 2010 and Tigres finished runner up to Marcelo Gallardo's 2015 River Plate. Yet in hindsight, the ways in which Mexican clubs earned the right to play the Libertadores makes their return to the modern-day tournament nearly impossible to envision.

Advertisement

To summarize, in 1998 the Mexican Football Federation (FMF) successfully lobbied CONMEBOL to allow two Liga MX teams to participate. First, Liga MX teams were matched against two Venezuelan sides, traditionally the weakest Libertadores participants, in a pre-Libertadores playoff. That process later became the InterLiga tournament, which was an eight-team Liga MX qualifying competition that was staged in the U.S. The top two teams qualified for the Copa Libertadores. Both methods were time consuming and would eventually clash with domestic league calendars.

Mas said last week that the MLS Cup winner and Liga MX champion were “perhaps deserving of a slot” in the Copa Libertadores. That's quite the fast track considering the aforementioned qualifying process. Furthermore, and according to Concacaf president Victor Montagliani, FIFA shut the door on the prospect of the Copa Libertadores including North American teams.

In December of 2023, Montagliani told Spanish-language outlet TUDN that FIFA had rejected a petition from FMF that sought to reintroduce Liga MX's Copa Libertadores participation.

“The confederations are working together to create another competition, but regarding the Libertadores, we have a request from Mexico to play in it,” Montagliani said. “We spoke with FIFA, and we sent a document back to the FMF that was denied; it was not authorized. Concacaf didn't authorize either because we have our own official competition. It wasn't authorized because we have ours, which is the path to the Club World Cup.”

That official competition is now the Concacaf Champions Cup. And as Montagliani noted, the tournament provides the winners with a direct berth to the now expanded 32-team Club World Cup. On Thursday, a Concacaf source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Athletic that the confederation's position remains unchanged. CONMEBOL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mas, though, does have a joker in his deck. Messi is Inter Miami's captain and remains a massive draw for both live audiences and corporate sponsors. Messi has never played in the Copa Libertadores. At 38, his opportunities to do so are limited. And while Messi signed a contract extension in October that should see him in pink through the 2028 MLS season, that's still a short window in which to introduce such a seismic change. In the meantime, Inter Miami has reloaded its squad with an aim to win the Champions Cup, something that must surely excite Concacaf.

That is a more realistic objective than advocating for an invitation to the Copa Libertadores. Mexican clubs have long dominated Concacaf tournaments, so it was understandable that they would want to test themselves against stronger competition. Inter Miami, however, has been soundly defeated in its two appearances in the Champions Cup.

In 2024, Inter Miami reached the quarterfinal round but was eliminated by Monterrey 5-2 on aggregate after two legs. A berth in the 2025 semifinals ended with an embarrassing 5-1 aggregate loss to the Vancouver Whitecaps. Mas' desire to play an official competition in South America is a cart-before-the-horse situation. Inter Miami is a global success as a brand, and it exceeded expectations at last summer's FIFA Club World Cup. A well-earned win over Porto in Atlanta and a draw against Brazilian giant Palmeiras in Miami were noteworthy. Tournament football can create moments of magic. Inter Miami, though, has yet to prove itself beyond the continental U.S.

The Copa Libertadores would be a bridge too far.

“Personally, I would love to play in the Libertadores,” Mas said. “I've said it before. I say it publicly, I say it within (MLS). I know these are matters between Concacaf and CONMEBOL, but I believe that if we can somehow continue to grow football hemispherically through the participation of North American and Mexican clubs, the competition would be better for it.”

A Brazilian club has won eight of the last 10 Copa Libertadores finals and seven consecutive titles. An all-Brazilian final has become the norm. Financially-restricted MLS teams would enter the tournament at a massive disadvantage. Even the most ambitious MLS club does not have the spending power of Brazil's richest teams, or the overall talent level of South America's most competitive clubs.

Instead, Inter Miami has scheduled preseason January friendlies against Peru's Alianza Lima, Colombia's Atlético Nacional and Ecuador's Barcelona SC. All three clubs are prominent South American brands and traditional Copa Libertadores participants. Nacional won the tournament in 2016. These exhibition matches will be an opportunity to leverage Messi's popularity in South America and get a taste of CONMEBOL competition.

One can appreciate Mas' freedom to dream and his insistence that MLS clubs can play a bigger part in international club football. But not all dreams come true. Sometimes one's reality is rooted in the fine print.

From Joao Pedro to Enzo Fernandez, Chelsea have numerous players offering plausible routes to fantasy points Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images

Chelsea assets are quickly gathering momentum among Fantasy Premier League managers, with the west London club having had an upturn in form and a run of promising fixtures to come from Gameweek 23.

There are plenty of options among the Club World Cup champions' ranks to consider investing in across the pitch. So, which of their players should fantasy managers be looking to, and who are the key assets at Stamford Bridge to avoid?

Advertisement

It's a new era at Chelsea, with the arrival of Liam Rosenior as their new head coach in early January, and he's off to a winning start in the Premier League.

A 2-0 victory against in-form neighbours Brentford last weekend saw them climb above their local rivals in the Premier League table, up to sixth place, just two points behind Liverpool in fourth.

Chelsea are now heading into an attractive run of upcoming fixtures, beginning with Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace, who haven't won at Selhurst Park in the Premier League since November 1. After that, they have four in a row against sides currently in the bottom quarter of the league: West Ham, Wolves, Leeds and Burnley.

It's expected that their new-manager bounce can extend through this period.

Forward Joao Pedro (£7.1m) remains their most-owned player in the game, in 26.7 per cent of sides, having produced five goal involvements in the opening four gameweeks of the season.

Evaluating his output now in mid-January, he has just 10 goal involvements for the campaign from 19 starts: seven goals and three assists, showing a clear decline in his output. He played 73 minutes against Brentford, returning to the No 9 role for the first time under Rosenior, and got himself on the scoresheet.

There's a glimmer of potential there to monitor Joao Pedro against Palace. Still, with just four goal attempts to his name in as many gameweeks, he's unlikely to displace the game's current forward template of Manchester City's Erling Haaland (£15.1m) and Igor Thiago (£7.2m) of Brentford.

It's Enzo Fernandez (£6.5m) who has been their most prolific attacker this Premier League season, with six goals and three assists from midfield. He has been in fine form too, with two goals and an assist in the past four gameweeks.

He has deputised for the injured Cole Palmer (£10.4m) on penalty duty, while taking some corners. Fernandez is arguably a better fantasy asset when he plays in the No 10 role and when Palmer is absent, which has been a common trend this campaign. He is at a fantastic price point. We saw the Argentina international was playing more advanced in the later stages of that Brentford game, after Andrey Santos (£4.5m) came on for Alejandro Garnacho (£6.4m).

Premium pick Palmer started in a central role in that match, where he scored from the penalty spot and completed a rare 90 minutes this season. His nine points were his best return so far of an injury-hit campaign in which he has managed just 10 starts and five goal involvements in the Premier League.

At the end of the Brentford victory, however, Palmer was seen lying on the pitch, and Rosenior has since reported he hadn't trained all week before the game, due to a thigh strain. His match fitness is my biggest barrier to buying right now, and I expect Fernandez to match him in the short term at a much cheaper price point, and with a midweek round of fixtures coming up in early February.

Looking at defensive options for Chelsea, the standout has to be Trevoh Chalobah (£5.5m), who has quietly been going about his business to become the second-highest scoring defender in the game, 10 points behind only Arsenal's Gabriel (£6.9m).

Chelsea rank second to Arsenal (11) for clean sheets in this campaign, with nine in their 22 league games, and Chalobah has been an ever-present for those nine fixtures. He also has four goal involvements for the campaign: three goals and one assist, with no Chelsea defender finding the back of the net on more occasions. Chalobah has had 13 efforts on goal, and three big chances.

It's the number of routes he has to points that makes him such a reliable asset. As well as clean-sheet potential and goal threat, Chalobah has earned 20 defensive-contribution points, ranking among the top 10 defenders for this new addition to the FPL scoring matrix.

Reece James (£5.7m) is a viable alternative, producing the game's leading tally of goal involvements by a defender with seven: scoring two and assisting five. It's his availability which has been his biggest barrier to fantasy points in recent seasons due to frequent injuries, with his ceiling always high due to his attacking potential and now the fact the long-time full-back is being played further forward in central midfield.

If you're buying a Chelsea defender this week, I'd lean towards the consistency of Chalobah over the explosiveness of James. The game's managers worldwide seem to agree, as it's Chalobah who is the most-bought Chelsea asset going into Gameweek 23.

For managers on a Wildcard, I'd look to their goalkeeper Robert Sanchez (£4.9m) as a key acquisition, who crucially comes in cheaper than Arsenal counterpart David Raya (£5.9m). Sanchez has nine clean sheets to Raya's 11, but has made more saves (54 to 32) and collected three more bonus points (seven to four), with just seven points separating them overall (Raya: 92, Sanchez: 85).

La Liga

Real Madrid should arguably be looking at centre-back Nico Schlotterbeck; could Rodrygo be a solution on the left? Getty Images

Last summer, Xabi Alonso's ascension to the role of Real Madrid head coach felt natural. 

A popular former player and a promising young coach, the ex-Madrid, Liverpool and Spain midfielder spoke with a confidence and clarity that seemed, along with his impressive spell at Bayer Leverkusen, as if it would demand respect.

But managing Madrid is a different beast, and less than eight months after his appointment, Alonso was gone before his project had a chance to get off the ground.

There were myriad problems behind the scenes, including issues when it came to convincing some of the bigger names in the squad to adapt to his system. But Alonso also struggled with his fair share of injuries, inheriting a squad with notable issues when it came to recurring fitness problems.

Speaking in the wake of Alonso's sacking last week, sources close to Carlo Ancelotti's former coaching staff at Madrid, who asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships, said they saw “no solution right now” to the side's situation.

They said what the team really needs is a radical overhaul in the summer, financed by the sale of a big player such as Vinicius Junior or Jude Bellingham. They identified right-back, centre-back, right-winger and, above all, central midfield as the most urgent positions that need addressing, and suggested several other players to move on.

Laying out Madrid's squad on paper, those problem areas become clear to see. Despite a 6-1 rout of Monaco in the Champions League on Tuesday, they started with two midfielders (Federico Valverde at right-back and Eduardo Camavinga at left-back) in defence.



While the team looks well-covered at centre-back at first glance, persistent injuries to David Alaba and Antonio Rudiger have left them light. Eder Militao has also suffered another big setback, tearing his left hamstring after last season's anterior cruciate ligament injury (his second in two seasons). That leaves 20-year-old Dean Huijsen — himself battling calf issues — and 22-year-old academy graduate Raul Asencio bearing most of the responsibility at the heart of defence.

At right-back, it is another case of poor availability, with neither Trent Alexander-Arnold nor Dani Carvajal able to string together more than five consecutive starts this season before injury has struck. 



Further forward, the concerns are tactical. There is a feeling that Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga cannot dictate the rhythm of games in which Madrid control possession. Sorely missing the pinpoint distribution of Toni Kroos at the base of midfield, Madrid are struggling to open up tighter contests.

In attack, with both Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo preferring to play on the left, Madrid could do with a right-sided forward to ease expectations on 18-year-old Franco Mastantuono as he finds his feet in Europe, even after an impressive performance in that Monaco win, in which he scored his first goal in the competition.

All the while, the club's stance remains firm. The Athletic reported in the Transfer DealSheet on Tuesday that Madrid do not intend to make any signings this month, as they do not see any viable options available at a fair price. They are also strong in their belief that this squad is good enough to fight for La Liga and the Champions League.

But if they were to decide to shake things up, where would they need to start?

Though Madrid's midfield is packed with technically gifted and athletic midfielders with their best years ahead of them, it sometimes lacks an orchestrator to set the tempo and stamp authority on meandering games.

In end-to-end contests, dominant physical players often thrive. Away to Athletic Club, for example, who were happy to press high up the pitch, spaces opened up in midfield for Madrid's powerful box-to-box midfielders to exploit. Flanked by Bellingham and Valverde, Tchouameni and Camavinga anchored the midfield and covered ground effectively to win second balls and keep their team on the front foot.

But many of Madrid's opponents in La Liga are happy to sit deep and deny those runners space to arrive into, demanding a different type of midfielder — one who is good on the ball in tight spaces and incisive in their forward passing — to help break down stubborn defensive shapes.

Alonso trusted Arda Guler with that role, and while the 20-year-old Turkey international rewarded the coach's faith with a series of bright, creative performances on the ball, racking up seven assists in La Liga, problems emerged out of possession. As an attacking midfielder, Guler often lacked the defensive awareness to play a deeper central role and left gaps when deployed in a 4-4-2 formation.

Here they are against Celta Vigo. With Tchoaumeni pulled over to the left after a quick switch of play, Guler drifts over to help, but leaves the run of Ilaix Moriba untracked in behind.



The solution, then, is to find that player who can do it all — sit deep, control the flow of possession, cover position and snap into tackles. But how many of those midfielders are out there, ready to come in and make a difference right away?

On paper, the player within the squad best suited to such a role would be Tchouameni. According to data from SkillCorner, the France international is one of the best at retaining the ball under pressure. As we can see from the scatter plot below, Dani Ceballos also ranks strongly, but the eye test tells us the Spaniard does not quite move the ball on quickly enough, or have the physical capabilities to lock down such a demanding defensive role.

There is a yearning for a Kroos-like player, but such a combination of press resistance, along with an ability to distribute the ball at speed and with accuracy over large distances, will prove difficult to find.



Some other profiles have been discussed internally. AZ's Kees Smit is an elusive midfielder with a knack for wriggling his way out of tight situations with the ball at his feet, but at 19 years old, he would need time to settle. At Crystal Palace, Adam Wharton is excellent at moving the ball forward quickly and incisively, but is a risk-taker who may not fit the mould. Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez has shown he can command the tempo of games from a deeper role, but the Argentina midfielder would likely come with a sizeable price tag.

With Manchester City's Rodri and Martin Zubimendi of Arsenal firmly off the market, it will not be an easy search.

Madrid have struggled to name a consistent back four this season, largely due to injuries in the centre of defence and at right-back.

Advertisement

As we can see from the graphic below, only left-back Alvaro Carreras has played more than 75 per cent of the available game time, while neither Alexander-Arnold nor Carvajal have managed more than 500 minutes across all competitions.



With both Rudiger and Alaba struggling for fitness, it makes sense to start succession planning for left-sided centre-backs to provide competition for Huijsen.

In that regard, Borussia Dortmund's Nico Schlotterbeck seems a sensible option. The 26-year-old Germany centre-back is vastly experienced, with close to 150 Bundesliga starts, and is renowned for his progressive ability on the ball. His long-range passing is excellent — no centre-back in Europe's top five leagues has completed more per game since the start of last season — while he loves to fizz the ball through the lines with sharp, disguised passes into midfield.

As reported in The Athletic's latest Transfer Radar, Dortmund are still pushing for a contract extension for Schlotterbeck, but are yet to reach an agreement. Madrid would have to tread lightly around a previous meniscus tear, but he represents the kind of proven quality who could elevate the centre of defence.

Once again, Madrid's conundrum on the wings is all about each of their starting wide players — Vinicius Jr,  Rodrygo and Mbappe — preferring to play on the left.

Mbappe has settled into more of a striker's role, rotating in and out of the No 9 position to devastating effect. But questions remain over the future of Vinicius Jr — who was one of the players booed at the Bernabeu during their 2-0 win against Levante at the weekend — and Rodrygo, usually the player shifted over to the right to give the front three more balance.

As we can see from the graphic below, Rodrygo has been more lively from the left throughout his Madrid career, generating more combined expected goals (xG) and expected assists (xA) per 90 minutes from that flank, while attempting far more take-ons (7.4 vs 4.2 per 90) on his favoured side.

It suggests that, should Vinicius Jr leave, Madrid's replacement could lie within their ranks.



But that would leave the right side looking light, with only two natural wide players in Mastantuono and Brahim Diaz available to step up.

It could be an opportunity to look for a prime-age winger to rotate with Brahim while Mastantuono develops. Roma's Matias Soule is two-footed, creative, hard-working and likes to drop into those pockets of space where Nico Paz may roam next season if he returns from Italian side Como. Wolfsburg's Mohamed Amoura is lightning-quick and a fine finisher, a player who works hard to harass from the front and ensure that high-pressing systems do not fall apart.

It is in Madrid's nature to target the biggest names in international football, but spreading their funds across the team and recruiting those all-important players — the unflappable holding midfielder, the commanding left-footed centre-back, the energetic right-sided winger — could help fix some of the gaps that have emerged in their superstar squad.

Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports on new details about why President Donald Trump wants control of Greenland on ‘Special Report.'

France's sports minister addressed questions about whether the country would consider boycotting the 2026 FIFA World Cup in response to the U.S.'s recent ""framework"" deal for control of part of Greenland. 

French Minister of Sports, Youth and Community Life Marina Ferrari told reporters this week the country has ""no desire"" to skip the cup, which takes place in North America this year.

""As it stands now, there is no desire from the ministry for a boycott of this great competition,"" Ferrari said. ""Now, I will not anticipate what could happen, but I have also heard voices raised from certain political blocs. I am one who believes in keeping sport separate [from politics]. The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport.""

Far-left French politician Éric Coquerel has called for the U.S. to be stripped of World Cup hosting rights and has suggested a boycott by France.

""Seriously, one imagines going to play the World Cup in a country who attacks its ‘neighbours,' threatens to invade Greenland and rides rough shod over international law?"" Coquerel told reporters.

Trump announced on Truth Social Wednesday that the framework for a deal has been made for the U.S. to gain control of parts of Greenland.

""Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,"" he wrote.

""This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations,"" Trump wrote in the post. ""Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland.""

During a speech at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Switzerland Thursday, Trump seemed to indicate that he would not use force to seize Greenland.

Despite similar calls for sanctions in response to Trump's foreign policy, the U.S. has not been penalized by any major sports bodies for its recent intervention in Venezuela either. 

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has responded to calls to exclude the U.S. and its athletes from the upcoming Winter Olympics over the intervention in Venezuela. The committee ruled out any penalty on the U.S.

""As a global organization, the IOC has to manage a complex reality. The IOC has to deal with the current political context and the latest developments in the world,"" the IOC said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. 

""The ability to bring athletes together, no matter where they come from, is fundamental to the future of values-based, truly global sport, which can give hope to the world. For this reason, the IOC cannot involve itself directly in political matters or conflicts between countries, as these fall outside our remit. This is the realm of politics.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Fact check: Fans canceling World Cup tickets over ICE fears?","https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-fans-canceling-world-cup-tickets-over-ice-fears/a-75562821","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 07:02:19 GMT","

Amid a violent crackdown on migrants in the US, claims have been emerging online that thousands are canceling their tickets to the 2026 World Cup. Are fans backing out? And would immigration officers target visitors?

""This will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to showcase the beauty and the greatness of America. And we can't wait to welcome soccer fans from all over the globe."" This statement by US President Donald Trump stands prominently on the US governement's official visa information page for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

But the message of welcome contrasts sharply with the broader policy landscape in Trump's second term. Immigration restrictions, intensified enforcement, and deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have become defining elements of his administration.

""This is a difficult time in this country because a lot of things that are happening are extremely unusual,"" says Daniel Kanstroom, a professor of law at Boston College. ""We are seeing examples of ICE agents who appear to be overstepping their authority in some cases."" 

The Trump administration has also tightened visa regulations, including broad suspensions affecting dozens of countries, in what Trump has described as an effort to ""permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.""

The United States will host three quarters of the tournament's 104 matches. The remaining will be held in Canada and Mexico, respectively.

Recently, social media has erupted with claims that thousands of fans are canceling their tickets out of fear of immigration enforcement.

DW Fact check had a look at the viral claims.

Claim: ""Overnight 16,800 people canceled their World Cup Tickets. This is commendable,"" one userwrote on X in a post viewed more than six million times. Another user claimedthat more than 25,000 people had canceled their tickets. 

DW Fact check: False

FIFA has denied these claims. ""It's fake news,"" a FIFA spokesperson told DW over the telephone. The football body initially did not respond to our request for an interview but contacted us after the story was published. ""No physical tickets have been handed over to customers by FIFA so far, and there is no bulk cancellation,"" the spokesperson added.

FIFA's customer support website clarifies that ticket sales are final and cannot be cancelled once ""payment for the ticket has been successfully processed."" The organization reiterates that tickets should only be purchased through its official platform, which includes a dedicated resale and exchange marketplace.

More than a million World Cup ticketshave already been sold during the Visa presale phase, while FIFA has received more than 500 million ticket applications during the latest random selection draw.

Public anxiety has grown as ICE — the federal agency that enforces immigration laws inside the United States — has continued conducting large‑scale operations targeting undocumented migrants in recent months. 

Several posts suggestthat ICE could also target soccer fans visiting the US. They claim that ICE could identify, detain, or deport fans attending the tournament.

Kanstroom believes this is highly unlikely. ""I do not expect ICE would be involved in this,"" he told DW, adding that the administration would not want to signal that ICE agents are targeting fans who have legally been admitted into the country. The scenario of fans being jailed, he says, ""seems to be extremely, extremely unlikely.""

During President Trump's second term, ICE's budget and mission have expanded significantly, making the agency a focal point of the administration's migration crackdown.

ICE has also faced controversy. In Minneapolis, an ICE agent shot and killed a 37‑year‑old US citizen, prompting widespread protests and debate over federal enforcement practices.

According to information provided the US Department of Justice, security at major stadium events is led by local and state law enforcement, with federal agencies providing intelligence and coordination, not frontline enforcement.

Claim: ""In the midst of the World Cup year, US President Trump suspends visa issuance for 75 countries, including Brazil,"" reportedthe Spanish‑language account Alerta News 24. The account has 2.6 million followers on X. Several otherposts also claimthat Brazilian fans will be unable to attend the World Cup.

DW Fact check: False

These claims are inaccurate. The Trump administration has paused immigration visa processing — which affects those seeking permanent residence — from 75 countries, including Brazil, Colombia, and Egypt. Short-term visas for travel and business, known as B1/B2 visas, are not affected. Brazilian citizens can still apply for a tourist visa to attend the World Cup.

""Therefore, a Brazilian national, for example, can still interview for a tourist visa to the United States that would allow them to attend the World Cup,"" said Eryn Hanlon, a US immigration lawyer based in London and New York.

The US State Department has created a dedicated World Cup 2026 visa information page , where Brazilian applicants can findvisa instructions. 

Brazil is the most successful team in World Cup history, having won the tournament a record five times and participated in every edition so far. Brazil remains one of the top nations for ticket registrations, accordingto FIFA.

Fans from several countries, including Brazil, are required to have a valid US visitor visa (B1/B2) to travel to the US for the FIFA World Cup 26, accordingto the State Department's website. Most Europeans can travel visa‑free under the ESTA visa waiver program.

Trump earlier imposed a travel ban on 19 countries, which would bar fans from those nations from entering the US. These include four World Cup-participating countries: Iran, Haiti, Senegal and Ivory Coast. 

""Iranian fans who are solely Iranian nationals will not be able to attend,"" Hanlon noted. ""If they are dual nationals and their other nationality is not on the list, they can attend.""

Athletes, coaches, and essential tournament personnel are exempt from the ban.

Donald Trump's new role announced for FIFA World Cup 2026 appeared first on ClutchPoints. Add ClutchPoints as a Preferred Source by clicking here.

While busy conducting his Presidential duties, US President Donald Trump has now been announced for a brand new role for the upcoming FIFA World Cup 2026 in USA, Mexico, and Canada.

Set to be conducted in North America and expected to be one of the most-watched FIFA World Cups of all time, FIFA President Gianni Infantino has now handed Trump a special role for the tournament's final on Jul. 19, 2026. With the final set to take place at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Trump will present the trophy to the 2026 World Cup winner. However, Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada's Mark Carney's roles remain unclear.

Infantino was recently present at the Davos Kick-Off for the 2026 World Cup, where he confirmed Trump's role for the event final (quotes via GiveMeSport). “This trophy will be handed out on [Jul. 19, 2026] to the captain of the team who will win the World Cup. I will give it together with the President of the United States, the host country. Nobody can touch this trophy.”

While the presidents of the other two co-host countries have been enjoying the build-up to the World Cup while staying away from the spotlight, Trump has been very involved in the development since the beginning. In his second term as the US President, Trump also received the FIFA Peace Prize last year in Dec. 2025.

Trump became the inaugural winner of the award and received it from FIFA President Gianni Infantino during the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington, D.C. While the purpose of the award was to honor those who promote peace and unity in accordance with FIFA's Football Unites the World message, it received major backlash from all across the globe.

MANCHESTER – World Cup ticket prices are at exorbitant levels yet fans are still queueing up in their millions to attend soccer's biggest tournament.

There is a such an over-demand for the event being staged in the United States, Canada and Mexico this year that FIFA president Gianni Infantino said the governing body would need to hold a draw to allocate tickets to fans and acknowledged that prices would likely be even higher on resale platforms.

“In 100, almost 100, years of World Cup history, FIFA sold around 50 million tickets in total,"" Infantino said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. ""Now for this World Cup in four weeks (on sale), we have the request for 1,000 years of World Cups at once. This is unique. It's incredible.”

It could also lead to a lot of disappointed fans being driven to resale sites where tickets are being listed for multiples of their face value. 

On FIFA's own resale marketplace, a ticket for the final was being listed for as much as $230,000 this week. FIFA does not resell tickets or set prices on the platform, but can cash in for a second time by taking a 30% cut from any sale.

Addressing the issue in Davos, Infantino said that in the U.S. it was “perfectly legal to resell tickets on resale platforms. ... So we have to of course allow that.""

He said all 104 matches at the World Cup would be sold out, meaning “tickets will probably be resold at even higher prices.”

Soccer fans have reacted with outrage to the pricing strategy for this year's tournament. FIFA is asking for up to $8,680 per ticket, but after criticism said it would offer a selection of $60 tickets for every game to the 48 national federations participating. 

Costs can be even more exorbitant through sellers trying to make a massive profit on the secondary market. 

Resale sites are commonplace in the U.S. and tickets can go for well in excess of their original price. NBATickets.com hosts the official resale marketplace for the NBA where sellers determine whatever prices they want, with fees applicable.

Sellers also set their own prices on FIFA's marketplace and enormously inflated listings further highlight the spiralling costs of the tournament for fans, while the governing body stands to make even more money, having already sold tickets at face value. 

The list price for a category one ticket for the final at MetLife Stadium on July 19 is $8,680, but that is subject to change as dynamic pricing will be utilized at a World Cup for the first time. 

The lowest list price for an equivalent ticket on FIFA's marketplace this week was $16,000 - almost twice as much. 

If sold at that price it would be worth $4,800 to the non-profit organization, based on it taking a 30% cut. 

A fan group, Football Supporters Europe, already has accused FIFA of a “monumental betrayal” over its pricing and is also critical of its resale platform. 

Ronan Evain, executive director of FSE, told The Associated Press he believed “a significant proportion of tickets that are sold and put on the resale platform are there just for profit.”

Other resale sites are also listing World Cup tickets. 

FIFA says its platform provides a safe and secure way for fans to resell tickets. 

At the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, the governing body took a lower cut from resales, charging both the buyer and seller the greater of a 5% fee or 2 Qatari Riyals ($0.50). It was also in control of setting resale prices, which could be higher or lower than face value. 

That policy has changed this time around. 

In a statement to the AP, FIFA said it was a “reflection of the treatment of the secondary market for tickets (in the U.S. and Canada), which has a distinct legal treatment than in many other parts of the world.

“We are focused on ensuring fair access to our game for existing but also prospective fans. FIFA resale fees are aligned with North American industry trends across various sports and entertainment sectors.”

There was outcry last month when FIFA announced its latest general release of tickets priced from $140 to $8,680. 

FIFA defends its pricing model, saying it “reflects the existing market practice for major entertainment and sporting events within our hosts on a daily basis, soccer included.” 

Speaking at Davos, Infantino went further. 

“We were hammered. I was hammered, I should say, because of the ticket prices because they are so expensive,” he said. ""The main critics were from Germany and and England of course.

“Now number one in ticket requests is U.S., number two Germany and number three England because everyone wants to come and to participate.""

Public transportation systems across the U.S. are “poised to get” a $100.3M assist from the federal government as Congress considers “directing more money to transit agencies” in cities that are hosting this year's FIFA World Cup games, according to Michelle Kaske of BLOOMBERG NEWS. The allocation is included in a bipartisan appropriations bill that “would fund spending on defense, transportation, housing, education and health” through FY2026. The legislation also includes $94.3M for public transit needs in and around L.A for when it hosts the 2028 L.A. Olympic. The U.S. House is set to approve the appropriations bill on Thursday before it heads to the US Senate next week. Congress has until Jan. 30 to pass spending measures and avoid a government shutdown. According to legislation, the exact amount of funding each transit agency receives will be “calculated by stadium seating capacity and the number of matches in each host city” (BLOOMBERG NEWS, 1/22).

CITY IMPACT: KC2026 President Pam Kramer said, “We know that any base camp here will be an impact.” She added, “There are lots of factors, but we think that the base camps can be not only an economic impact, but there's a cultural opportunity here.” In K.C., Pete Grathoff noted Kramer “likened the World Cup base camps to spring training where teams stay for two months at a city in Florida or Arizona, and fans come to see the players.” But at the World Cup base camps in K.C., “more than fans are expected.” Kramer said, “For the base camps, there will be families of players, coaches, staff. In some cases, there will be sponsors, certainly the embassies, I think with base camps aside, with Argentina playing here, and their massive fan following, I think they will have several representatives from their embassies, several consul generals, counselors on the ground here in Kansas City” (K.C. STAR, 1/22).

HELPING HAND: USA TODAY's Marcus Smith noted FIFA President Gianni Infantino confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump will co-present the World Cup winner's trophy on July 19. Infantino said, “I will give it together with the President of the United States, the host country. Nobody can touch this trophy.” Smith noted it is a “sacred tradition” (USA TODAY, 1/22).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

Amid a violent crackdown on migrants in the US, claims have been emerging online that thousands are canceling their tickets to the 2026 World Cup. Are fans backing out? And would immigration officers target visitors?

""This will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to showcase the beauty and the greatness of America. And we can't wait to welcome soccer fans from all over the globe."" This statement by US President Donald Trump stands prominently on the US governement's official visa information page for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

But the message of welcome contrasts sharply with the broader policy landscape in Trump's second term. Immigration restrictions, intensified enforcement, and deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have become defining elements of his administration.

""This is a difficult time in this country because a lot of things that are happening are extremely unusual,"" says Daniel Kanstroom, a professor of law at Boston College. ""We are seeing examples of ICE agents who appear to be overstepping their authority in some cases."" 

The Trump administration has also tightened visa regulations, including broad suspensions affecting dozens of countries, in what Trump has described as an effort to ""permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.""

The United States will host three quarters of the tournament's 104 matches. The remaining will be held in Canada and Mexico, respectively.

Recently, social media has erupted with claims that thousands of fans are canceling their tickets out of fear of immigration enforcement.

DW Fact check had a look at the viral claims.

Claim: ""Overnight 16,800 people canceled their World Cup Tickets. This is commendable,"" one userwrote on X in a post viewed more than six million times. Another user claimedthat more than 25,000 people had canceled their tickets. 

DW Fact check: False

FIFA has denied these claims. ""It's fake news,"" a FIFA spokesperson told DW over the telephone. The football body initially did not respond to our request for an interview but contacted us after the story was published. ""No physical tickets have been handed over to customers by FIFA so far, and there is no bulk cancellation,"" the spokesperson added.

FIFA's customer support website clarifies that ticket sales are final and cannot be cancelled once ""payment for the ticket has been successfully processed."" The organization reiterates that tickets should only be purchased through its official platform, which includes a dedicated resale and exchange marketplace.

More than a million World Cup ticketshave already been sold during the Visa presale phase, while FIFA has received more than 500 million ticket applications during the latest random selection draw.

Public anxiety has grown as ICE — the federal agency that enforces immigration laws inside the United States — has continued conducting large‑scale operations targeting undocumented migrants in recent months. 

Several posts suggestthat ICE could also target soccer fans visiting the US. They claim that ICE could identify, detain, or deport fans attending the tournament.

Kanstroom believes this is highly unlikely. ""I do not expect ICE would be involved in this,"" he told DW, adding that the administration would not want to signal that ICE agents are targeting fans who have legally been admitted into the country. The scenario of fans being jailed, he says, ""seems to be extremely, extremely unlikely.""

During President Trump's second term, ICE's budget and mission have expanded significantly, making the agency a focal point of the administration's migration crackdown.

ICE has also faced controversy. In Minneapolis, an ICE agent shot and killed a 37‑year‑old US citizen, prompting widespread protests and debate over federal enforcement practices.

According to information provided the US Department of Justice, security at major stadium events is led by local and state law enforcement, with federal agencies providing intelligence and coordination, not frontline enforcement.

It was not long ago that it looked like Casemiro would be leaving Manchester United in disgrace, ushered out the back door and out of European football for good, consigned to history as one of the club's worst transfer errors. Instead, he is set to leave with his head held high, showing that, contrary to Jamie Carragher's brutal assessment, the football never left him after all.

United's announcement on Thursday that Casemiro is set to leave the club in the summer when his contract runs out was perfectly timed, a rare case of the Red Devils getting something right. It came after one of the Brazilian's best displays of the season against Manchester City, when he received a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd and heard his name reverberate around the stadium. 

And it came as speculation was growing about whether or not the club would trigger his one-year contract extension, which was threatening to become a distraction from the pursuit of that all-important top-four finish. Now Casemiro has plenty of time to look for a new club and United have more time to begin their midfield rebuild and target players who are approaching their prime years.

It means that the Brazilian can focus on finishing his up-and-down United career on a real high and get the farewell he deserves for fighting his way back into the team and proving everyone wrong...

Casemiro had an enormous impact on United when he arrived from Real Madrid in August 2022. The team had lost their first two games of the season to Brighton and Brentford - getting hammered 4-0 by the Bees - and he instantly beefed up their midfield and sprinkled the squad with his win-at-all-costs mentality, honed from his eight years at the heart of Madrid's multiple Champions League-winning machine.

He was fundamental to United finishing third in the Premier League, reaching the FA Cup final and winning the Carabao Cup, which he celebrated on the Wembley pitch with just as much gusto as any trophy he had won with Madrid. Indeed, in an interview with AS last year Casemiro described the 2022-23 campaign as his best performance on an individual level of his entire career.

But playing over 50 games in a season took its toll on his body and the following campaign he looked like he was struggling to keep up with the pace of the Premier League while he also suffered two injuries. The rest of the squad was also obliterated by injuries and by the end of the campaign Casemiro was either asked to anchor an inexperienced midfield or play at centre-back, a position he had never previously played.

It was when playing at centre-back that Crystal Palace ran riot over United at Selhurst Park, hammering them 4-0. Casemiro was badly exposed by Michael Olise and that was when Carragher tore into the Brazilian on Sky Sports by saying: ""I always remember something when I retired: 'Leave the football before the football leaves you'. 

""The football's left him at this top level. He needs to call it a day at this level of football and move. A man of that level should not be going through what he's going through now, he needs to call it a day.""

Casemiro was then dropped from the squad for the FA Cup final. He was expected to leave that summer, especially if a club from Saudi Arabia came calling. No acceptable offers came in, however, and the Brazilian made a decent start to the following campaign. But it all unravelled again when he made a mistake leading to a goal against Liverpool and was hauled off at half-time by Erik ten Hag for 20-year-old debutant Toby Collyer.

The Brazilian didn't start another league game under Ten Hag for six weeks. Interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy did lean on the veteran heavily in his four games in charge after Ten Hag was sacked, but Ruben Amorim seemed to also write off the player, making him an unused substitute for 12 games in a sequence of 15.

Casemiro returned to the team against Tottenham, but only after an injury crisis afflicted Kobbie Mainoo and Collyer. And the coach gave a typically honest but brutal assessment of the player when speaking to TNT Sports Mexico around that time. He said: ""We understand that Casemiro has other things nowadays. The intelligence he has, understanding the game, understanding where the ball is going to fall but we're in a league that I can see, even in European competitions, the difference in intensity is big. And so, I feel that this team also needs players with a very high intensity.""

But once Casemiro got a run of games he began to prove his coach wrong and locked down his place in Amorim's line-up for the crucial stage of the season, playing a pivotal role in the run to the Europa League final. He contributed to three of the goals in the incredible extra-time comeback win over Lyon and scored in the semi-final first leg against Athletic Club. He also earned a recall to the Brazil squad under Carlo Ancelotti, his old boss in Madrid.

He has remained unmovable this season, starting 19 of United's 22 league games. And whenever he has not started, the team has badly suffered, losing against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup, Brighton in the FA Cup and Manchester City, Brentford and Aston Villa in the Premier League. He has contributed four goals and an assist from holding midfield and was outstanding in United's first win at Anfield in a decade and most recently against City.

In October Amorim hailed Casemiro for digging in to reclaim his place in the team. He said: ""He fought and he worked and now he's back in the national team. He gives a lot of experience, he is an example for everyone. We understand that football can change really fast. You just need to work. You're going to play if you do the right things.""

But that does not mean that United are wrong to be letting Casemiro go in the summer. He turns 34 next month and is among the club's highest-paid players. Reports of his actual salary vary from £325,000 per week to £375,000 per week, although he has been subject to a 25 percent reduction in his wage like every other player in the squad in the three seasons United have failed to qualify for the Champions League. The Athletic estimates that between his £70m transfer fee from Real Madrid and his salary over four years, he has cost the club a total of £119m.

Extending his contract by a year would have meant on the same terms as his initial agreement, costing the club between £16.5m and 19.5m annually. That figure would rise even more in the event United qualified for the Champions League. It has been reported that when Sir Jim Ratcliffe found out about Casemiro's salary, he raised the alarm and effectively used it as an example of the club's avarice before he arrived. 

In an era where Ratcliffe has taken away free lunches from employees and made up to 450 people redundant in order to save costs, Casemiro's salary was increasingly hard to justify. United sources have stressed that Casemiro's departure will enable additional capacity to invest in strengthening the squad as the club continues to build towards regular and sustained success.

Even with Casemiro's impressive resurgence, it is hard to not argue that United signing him in the first place smacked of desperation. The right thing to do now is to build for the future and target players who can lead United's midfield for the next decade, players such as England international Elliot Anderson and Palace midfielder Adam Wharton or Brighton's Carlos Baleba, who was a target last summer.

Casemiro said: ""I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life"" and he has also left his mark on the club. He might have been a stop-gap solution and an expensive one at that, but the Brazilian has brought a lot of joy to United fans and given them many moments they will never forget.

He took the club back into the Champions League, helped deliver a first trophy in six years and then reversed his own decline to give them some semblance of stability. Now he has four months left and United fans should savour them as it will not be easy to replace a player of his experience or with his utter refusal to throw in the towel.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Michael Carrick shows up Ruben Amorim! New Man Utd boss makes six behind-the-scenes changes to impress players and club staff","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/michael-carrick-shows-up-ruben-amorim-new-man-utd-boss-makes-six-behind-the-scenes-changes-to-impress-players-and-club-staff/blta2892f2dc02d9c38","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:38:55 GMT","

Michael Carrick has wasted no time stamping his authority on Manchester United, implementing six key behind-the-scenes changes that have already highlighted the shortcomings of his predecessor, Ruben Amorim. From matchday routines to academy integration, the interim boss has impressed both players and staff in his first week, culminating in a morale-boosting derby victory over Manchester City and a clear shift in culture at Carrington.

One of the most immediate and symbolic changes Carrick has made involves his visibility and support for the club's famed youth system, according to Manchester Evening News. In a move that starkly contrasts with the previous regime, Carrick and his backroom staff braved rush hour traffic to attend the Under-21s fixture at Leigh Sports Village on Tuesday. His attendance has been regarded as a gesture to show the youth stars that a path to the first team exists while he is in charge.

Amorim's approach to the academy was notably distant during his 14-month tenure. Despite opportunities to watch games at Old Trafford or the nearby Moss Lane in Altrincham, the Portuguese coach rarely attended. While Erik ten Hag had previously made the effort to visit local youth fixtures, Amorim's interaction was limited to a casual stroll across the pitches at Carrington. Carrick's presence at Leigh after just seven days in charge has already won him credit where Amorim failed to engage, fixing what insiders viewed as an ""easy win"" that was previously ignored.

At Carrington, the atmosphere has shifted significantly. Carrick has introduced a new training schedule characterised by shorter but more intense sessions, with a renewed focus on individual improvement plans for specific players. The feedback from the squad has been overwhelmingly positive, with defender Harry Maguire admitting he has been ""really impressed"" by the detail and energy brought by the new coaching team.

Carrick has also adopted a more hands-on approach than Amorim. While the former boss often preferred to observe from a distance, Carrick is actively involved in drills alongside his assistants, Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate. The appointment of Holland, a boyhood United fan with vast experience at Chelsea and England, has been hailed as a masterstroke. The dynamic between the staff is reportedly strong, blending different skillsets to create a cohesive coaching unit that is already earning the respect of the players.

The changes have extended to matchday logistics and dressing room culture. Carrick has tweaked the pre-match routine, deciding that the squad should arrive at Old Trafford slightly later than they did under Amorim. While the core principle of travelling together from Carrington remains, the subtle adjustment is designed to usher in a ""fresh feeling"" and break the monotony of the previous regime.

Crucially, Carrick has reinstated the traditional manager's post-match address. Amorim was known for backing off immediately after the final whistle, preferring to gather his thoughts and speak to players the following day, leaving the squad to hold their own debriefs. Carrick, however, spoke directly to the team in the dressing room following the victory over Manchester City, urging them not to get carried away. He has also shifted the tone of his general addresses, constantly reiterating the ""privilege"" of working for the club and the importance of enjoyment - a message that seems to be resonating.

Perhaps the most impactful on-pitch change has been the reintegration of Kobbie Mainoo. The young midfielder had been frozen out under Amorim, who doubted his suitability for a 3-4-3 system, leading Mainoo to request a loan move in the summer. Frustrations had boiled over, with family members protesting and the player engaging with critical social media posts.

Carrick has immediately restored faith in the 20-year-old, handing him his first Premier League start of the season in the derby. Mainoo repaid that trust with a tireless performance, covering 7.9km and impressing with his defensive work rate. A post-match photo of Carrick offering words of encouragement to Mainoo in the tunnel signalled a new chapter for the midfielder, who looks set to play a key role in United's push for Champions League qualification.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester United's shortlist of four transfer targets to replace departing Brazilian star Casemiro has been revealed. The Red Devils will be bidding farewell to a Champions League-winning former Real Madrid midfielder when his contract expires in the summer. A number of England internationals are said to be on the recruitment radar at Old Trafford.

Casemiro became a marquee signing for United in the summer of 2022 when joining for £60 million ($81m) from La Liga giants Real. He should pass 150 appearances for the club before becoming a free agent.

The option of agreeing a one-year extension with the 33-year-old South American has been passed up, with United ready to move in a different direction that sees fresh legs drafted into their engine room. Casemiro is said to be earning £350,000-a-week in Manchester.

Costs can be cut there, but another big-money transfer fee will be required in order to bring in a suitable replacement. The Sun claims that the Red Devils already have their eye on four proven Premier League performers, with the acquisition of a new No.6 considered to be a top priority.

Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson is being closely monitored by United, alongside Crystal Palace ace Adam Wharton and his fellow England World Cup hopeful Alex Scott of Bournemouth. They are all considered to be long-term additions for the Red Devils.

Carlos Baleba is another option that United continue to weigh up. The Brighton midfielder was targeted in the summer of 2025, but no deal could be done. A winter approach for the 22-year-old has been considered, but is unlikely at this stage “due to the managerial vacancy at the Old Trafford helm”.

Whoever is approached, they will have big boots to fill at Old Trafford. Casemiro has been unable to make United contenders for the Premier League title again, but has helped them to FA Cup and Carabao Cup triumphs.

His pedigree cannot be questioned and it has come as some surprise that no extension has been agreed, on reduced terms, with the 82-cap Brazil international. Instead, he is preparing to take in a long goodbye.

Casemiro said after seeing his impending departure confirmed: “I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life. From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.

“It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months. We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.”

He went on to post on Instagram: “Knowing when stages come to an end. Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever. Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal. Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.”

Casemiro will be hoping to bid farewell after helping United back into Champions League competition. They remain in the hunt for a top-four finish in the Premier League, with a 2-0 derby victory over Manchester City last time out offering that quest a welcome boost.

The Red Devils are only a point back on defending champions Liverpool, but are aware that the chasing pack is bunching up behind them. If they were to secure return tickets to European football's most prestigious club tournament, then efforts to prise top talents away from domestic rivals would become easier.

They are ready to spend again, despite seeing little return on their investment across recent windows, and may need to bring in a couple of midfielders in the summer of 2026. That is because, while preparing to sever ties with Casemiro, club captain Bruno Fernandes continues to generate talk of a move to the Saudi Pro League being made.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Cristiano Ronaldo retirement date teased as Saudi Pro League line up FIFTY stars to support Portuguese GOAT before exiting Al-Nassr and hanging up boots","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-retirement-date-teased-saudi-pro-league-fifty-stars-support-portuguese-goat-al-nassr/bltcb315e2e1e009e6c","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 07:35:44 GMT","

A retirement plan for Cristiano Ronaldo has been teased as Saudi Pro League officials reportedly line up 50 big-name players to join CR7 in the Middle East before the day comes for him to hang up his boots. More high-profile additions, such as Mohamed Salah and Bruno Fernandes, will help the division to retain interest heading towards the 2034 World Cup.

According to talkSPORT, “dealmakers are targeting 50 peak-age foreign signings this summer”. It is expected that efforts to complete a flurry of notable deals will be stepped up once the 2026 World Cup has been completed.

While focusing on the acquisition of players that can spend several years in the Saudi Pro League, “a handful of older stars are also on the shortlist”. Liverpool superstar Salah, Manchester United captain Fernandes, Real Madrid winger Vinicius Junior and Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski are all being targeted.

It is claimed that Saudi officials have already made an “exploratory enquiry for Salah” following his outburst against Liverpool in December. Michael Emenalo, who is now sporting director of the top tier in Saudi Arabia, boasts a “long-standing relationship with Salah and will be one of the driving forces on the timing behind any formal move”. Al-Ittihad saw a £150 million ($202m) bid for Salah rejected in 2023, but his situation has now changed and the reigning Premier League champions may soon be open to offers.

Al-Ittihad, who could lose Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante at the end of the season, are “one of three clubs considering a move for Manchester United captain Fernandes”. The Portugal international has a “€60m release clause valid for non-Premier League clubs” in his deal at Old Trafford and has hinted at being ready for a new challenge.

Fernandes has revealed that United tried to sell him to Saudi suitors in 2025, with a contract worth £700,000-a-week reported to have been agreed, and he will reassess his options after this summer's World Cup finals.

The Portuguese midfielder's current team-mate, Casemiro, is also a “long-standing target” for Saudi outfits. It has been revealed that the veteran Brazilian will be severing ties with United as a free agent this summer.

“Several other Premier League names are also under consideration”, according to talkSPORT. They include Aston Villa duo Youri Tielemans and Amadou Onana and Arsenal forward Gabriel Martinelli. Al-Nassr are considered to be a “genuine contender” for Brazil international Martinelli - with the Gunners ready to draft in reinforcements on their left flank.

Outside of England and Real Madrid superstar Vinicius will be targeted this summer, with Al-Ahli set to be “given significant central funding to try and pull off a deal”. The South American has put contract extension talks in the Spanish capital on hold. It is claimed that “conversations between Vini Jr's agency, Roc Nation Sports, and senior Saudi officials are ongoing and date back over a year”.

Sources have told talkSPORT that “Saudi has been given some private encouragement that a transfer is possible” for Vinicius, while experienced Barcelona striker Lewandowski, who is now 37 years of age, also has offers to consider from the Middle East.

All of this is being made possible as “a strategic shift has taken place within Saudi with clubs encouraged to use central funds of up to €2 billion per season on younger players”. It is reported that said funds are “allocated to clubs based on an assessment of their needs and is not split equally”, while it “must be used on transfer fees, agent commissions and wages”.

The Saudi Pro League is taking action at this stage as Portuguese GOAT Ronaldo is “likely to leave Al Nassr in the summer of 2027”. It is suggested that the five-time Ballon d'Or winner “could potentially retire from football” at that point.

Even if a one-year extension is put in place, taking CR7 beyond the age of 43, “plans are being put in place to try and prevent a sharp decline in global interest when the ex-United attacker eventually departs”. The option of keeping Ronaldo around as an owner, “increasing the 15 per cent equity stake he currently has in Al-Nassr”, is also being considered.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cristiano Ronaldo is again being backed to break into Hollywood once the day comes to hang up record-shattering boots as a footballing GOAT. At 40 years of age, the Portuguese superstar has already dipped his toe into the movie industry. He could fully take the plunge at some stage, with fellow ex-Manchester United star Giuseppe Rossi billing CR7 as a perfect Joker for the Batman franchise.

Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo has offered no indication that he will be heading into retirement any time soon, with many backing the evergreen frontman to play beyond the end of his contract at Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr in 2027.

A day will come when the all-time great has to walk away, with various new career paths set to open up in front of him. Club ownership has been mooted, while plenty are tipping one of the most recognisable celebrities on the planet to try his luck on the big screen.

With a cameo appearance set to be made in the next Fast & Furious blockbuster, Rossi has told OLBG why Ronaldo could go on to much bigger things in Hollywood - with a spot in the DC Universe up for grabs.

Rossi said: “He's made for LA, man. He'd be perfect for LA. That's an interesting thought. I think he has the aura. He's got the fans. I think it would be an easy transition for him. He likes the spotlight so why not take advantage of it and go into a world that's kind of similar to professional sports and see how it goes. I'm very curious to see him as an actor. He would definitely be the villain in something. Let's make him the Joker in the next Batman maybe?”

Another former Premier League star, ex-Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Emmanuel Petit, has already speculated on how Ronaldo could one day challenge for an Oscar. The World Cup-winning Frenchman told Hochgepokert: “Could Cristiano Ronaldo end up being a huge movie star? Definitely. The surprise is why we don't see many more sports people in movies. We see rappers, we see influencers, we see so many well known people going into film but not sports people. Why?

“We are entertaining people as well. In sport, we have the character for that. I know that Eric Cantona has been doing that, Vinnie Jones, David Ginola, as well as Frank Leboeuf, have done that. Why can't more do that?

“I'm happy for Ronaldo. I think he has the charisma and the aura. Ronaldo is the most famous person on social networks. Can you imagine if he was in the middle of big Hollywood stars? 

“He would have nothing to prove to those guys. He can say, ‘I know you're a big star, but I am Cristiano Ronaldo. I am probably one of the best players in football history. I am a billionaire. I won everything I could win in football. So who are you?'

“The Oscars? One day. Honestly, you can make a movie on his life. I have never seen someone stronger than him mentally. This guy is the most powerful human being I've ever seen mentally.”

A move to the United States as a player has been speculated on for Ronaldo, with the world desperate to see him pair up with eternal rival Lionel Messi at MLS Cup winners Inter Miami. Not everybody, though, is convinced that would be a wise move.

Speaking to betting site BOYLE Sports, ex-Colorado Rapids striker Kevin Doyle has said: “I think it's a couple of years too late for Cristiano Ronaldo in MLS, I think the moment has passed. He picked Saudi Arabia, which would have been the perfect time to go.

“I know he's going to the World Cup at 40, if you play in the World Cup you can play in MLS, but maybe only for six months or so. I think making it just Messi vs Ronaldo would be a circus act. They're trying to make it a serious league and not just based on two players. I don't think it would be a good thing for the league, but let's see what happens.”

Ronaldo would be welcomed to Los Angeles if he opened himself up to a move, with South Korean superstar Son Heung-min already plying his trade in California, but it remains to be seen whether Tinseltown becomes a permanent base for CR7.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Alvaro Arbeloa has navigated a turbulent start to life in the Real Madrid dugout, with details emerging of a significant tactical and cultural shift from the Xabi Alonso era. Reports from the Spanish capital reveal that the dressing room has responded positively to Arbeloa's ""direct"" methods, while a hostile reception from the Bernabeu has had the unexpected consequence of uniting a fractured squad following their Copa del Rey humiliation.

It has been a whirlwind period for Arbeloa since taking the reins at the Santiago Bernabeu. His tenure began in disastrous fashion with a shock Copa del Rey exit at the hands of Albacete, a result that immediately placed the new manager under the microscope. However, following a vital league win over Levante and a morale-boosting Champions League thrashing of Monaco, the mood inside the camp has shifted dramatically.

According to reports from Cadena SER, the turning point for the squad was not a tactical tweak, but the visceral reaction of the supporters. The heavy whistles and jeers that rained down from the stands on Saturday during the clash against Levante had an ""unexpected effect"" on the players.

In the immediate aftermath of the Albacete defeat, the atmosphere at Valdebebas was described as ""cold"" and defined by a ""relative silence,"" with players retreating into individualism. However, the public judgment from the fans acted as a catalyst for cohesion. Sources from inside the dressing room suggest that by the time the Monaco fixture arrived on Wednesday, the dynamic had changed; the players were no longer fighting individual battles but had circled the wagons to protect the group, effectively uniting against the external noise.

Arbeloa has arrived with a clear identity that appears to be resonating with the heavyweights of the dressing room. The report describes the Salamanca-born coach as ""direct, approachable and with clear concepts."" His management style is heavily centralised, placing the burden of communication squarely on his own shoulders.

Unlike many modern coaching setups where assistant managers play a vocal role in daily drills, Arbeloa's backroom staff have taken a step back. While they are responsible for the meticulous preparation of training sessions, they rarely speak directly to the players during practice.

Instead, it is Arbeloa who takes charge of all explanations, motivation and tactical instructions. This single voice approach has provided clarity for a squad that appeared to be drifting, ensuring there is no confusion regarding what is expected on the pitch. The players now look to one figure for direction, a move that seems to have simplified the daily routine at the training ground.

The shift in style is particularly stark when compared to the methods of his predecessor, Alonso. While the former Bayer Leverkusen boss and his staff were highly regarded as professionals, their approach was described as ""incisive"" and ""interventionist.""

Under Alonso, the coaching staff were incredibly hands-on, often at the request of the manager himself. Players were subjected to lengthy video analysis sessions, followed immediately by training drills designed to recreate the specific scenarios shown on screen. While the intent was to achieve tactical perfection, the relentless nature of the instruction reportedly wore down the squad.

Cadena SER notes that while the players spoke highly of Alonso's staff's quality, they found them ""a tad insistent for what this group was used to."" The constant micromanagement and intervention from multiple voices has now been replaced by Arbeloa's more streamlined method. The removal of that ""insistence"" appears to have liberated the players, allowing for a fresher mental approach to matches.

The impact of these changes is already visible in the results. The squad has managed to right the ship after a ""very difficult week,"" with the victory over Monaco placing them within touching distance of the Champions League top eight.

However, Arbeloa is well aware that the scars from the Albacete debacle are still fresh. The sentiment from the dressing room is that ""the pitch must speak"" in the coming days. Real Madrid face two stern tests in quick succession: a trip to Villarreal on Saturday followed by a clash in Lisbon on Wednesday.

Despite the short timeframe, the emotional intensity of the last fortnight has warped the perception of time at the club. As one source from the dressing room concluded: ""From what they lived through last Wednesday to Saturday, compared to what was lived from Sunday to today, it seems like more time has passed than just a few days."" For Arbeloa, the hope is that this intense period has forged a unity that will sustain his tenure for the long haul.

Daniil Medvedev rallied from the brink of defeat Friday when he escaped Fabian Marozsan 6-7(5), 4-6, 7-5, 6-0, 6-3 to reach the Australian Open fourth round.


En route to his fifth career comeback from two sets to love down, and fourth in Melbourne, Medvedev earned a crucial break at 5-5 in the third set that turned the tide of the match. The three-time Melbourne finalist won nine consecutive games to deflate the hopes of the Hungarian, eventually escaping after three hours and 43 minutes.

“He played great and I was like, ‘If I lose, I lose', but I'm just going to try, I'm just going to fight,” Medvedev said in his on-court interview. “I tried to go for it a bit more because he was moving me all around. It managed to work, I started playing better, so I'm happy about it.”

Never count out @DaniilMedwed 😤The No. 11 seed survives Marozsan in a five-set epic lasting three hours and 43 minutes.@AustralianOpen | #AO26 pic.twitter.com/a4YFjnQhwV


Medvedev, former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, has opened his 2026 season on an eight-match winning streak, including a title run at the ATP 250 in Brisbane this month.


The 11th seed will next face a familiar foe in Learner Tien, the American who stunned Medvedev last year in a five-set, second-round battle at Melbourne Park. A budding rivalry on the ATP Tour, Tien leads Medvedev 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.


Tien took a contrasting path to victory Friday, ousting Portugal's Nuno Borges 7-6(9), 6-4, 6-2.

Carlos Alcaraz treated the Melbourne crowd to a highlight-reel performance Friday, earning a 6-2, 6-4, 6-1 victory against Corentin Moutet to reach the Australian Open fourth round.


If the top seed is feeling any pressure of chasing his maiden Australian Open title and a Career Grand Slam, the Spaniard is not showing it. Alcaraz played with confidence and freedom from the baseline, highlighted by a superb tweener on the second point of the second set, a 16-ball exchange that brought alive the fans inside Rod Laver Arena.


After leading 3-0 in the second set, Alcaraz dropped four consecutive games, yet quickly regrouped and earned a crucial break at 4-4 to serve for a two-sets-to-love lead. The World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings raced to a double-break lead in the third set and applied the finishing touches to advance after two hours and five minutes.

“It wasn't easy,” Alcaraz said. “When you play someone like Corentin, you don't know what's going to be next. That's really difficult to approach the match, but I had so much fun with it on the court. I think we both pulled off great shots, great points. I think there were a few highlights in the match. I'm grateful to play this kind of match against him.”


With his win, Alcaraz improved to 87-13 at Slam level, tying Bjorn Borg for the best major record after 100 matches. A six-time major champion, the 22-year-old has twice reached the quarter-finals in Melbourne. 

Another day, another milestone 🌟In his 100th Grand Slam match, @carlosalcaraz defeats Moutet 6-2, 6-4, 6-1 to return to the fourth round.@AustralianOpen | #AO26 pic.twitter.com/akcFw0Jjm8


Up next for Alcaraz is 19th seed Tommy Paul, who advanced after Alejandro Davidovich Fokina retired with the American leading 6-1, 6-1. The Spaniard called the physio for a left leg issue in the second set. Alcaraz leads Paul 5-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“We have great battles against each other,"" Alcaraz said of his clashes with Paul, a 2023 semi-finalist in Melbourne. ""It's always really difficult to play against him. He plays great tennis on hard courts with that flat backhand that he slices a lot, aggressive, great touch. It's going to be a really interesting one.”


Through three matches this fortnight, Alcaraz is yet to drop a set. Against the lefty Moutet, the Spaniard pummeled the ball off both wings, hammering 30 winners, several of which were passing shots by the net-rushing Frenchman. Moutet showed flashes of his best tennis and produced his own magic with exquisite tweeners and feel around the net, adding a flair of entertainment despite the defeat.

“I thought we were in a drop shot competition,” Alcaraz joked. “Definitely, he won.”

On Thursday, 40-year-old Stan Wawrinka became the oldest man to reach the third round of the Australian Open since Ken Rosewall in 1978, while 37-year-old Marin Cilic showcased his own longevity by notching his 599th tour-level win, drawing level with Goran Ivanisevic for the most victories by a Croatian man in the Open Era.

And then there was 38-year-old, record 10-time champion Novak Djokovic, cruising into the third round in straight sets on Rod Laver Arena. All three featured in the Australian Open draw as far back as 2007, and their remarkable staying power has emerged as one of the defining talking points of the tournament's opening week in Melbourne.

On Friday, World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka was the latest star to weigh in on her admiration for the trio.

“These guys are legends, G.O.A.T.s, especially Novak,” Sabalenka said. “He's been developing his game his whole career. Right now, he's really relevant with young boys. He's playing incredible tennis. I feel like it depends on your physicality, of course, mentality, your approach to tennis. He's very healthy, fit. He's really focused. Yeah, at this age he's playing incredible tennis.

“I feel like there is no age anymore in sport. It depends how you approach everything and if you have a smart team around you. I feel your career can be extended for I don't know how many years.”



At 27, Sabalenka is herself at the peak of her powers. The top seed lifted the trophy in Melbourne in 2023 and 2024 and reached the final again in 2025. But could she still be competing a decade from now?

“I'm not sure,” Sabalenka said. “I cannot say anything because you never know. You don't know what's waiting for you tomorrow. Ideally for me, I would love to, I don't know, maybe have kids at 32 or something. But knowing me, I know that I love to accept tough challenges, so I feel like even after having kid, I would love to challenge myself, like coming back and see if I still have it, just to challenge myself.

“So probably we're going to see me being that grandma on tour trying. Hopefully I'll be pushing these young girls. Let's talk about that in 10 years. That's a long time.”

Ousting the sport's elite is never meant to be easy, but Botic van de Zandschulp has repeatedly shown he possesses the belief, and the game, to trouble the very best on the biggest stages.

The 30-year-old Dutchman will look to tap into that giant-slaying pedigree again on Saturday, when he faces record 10-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic in the third round at Melbourne Park. It is a daunting assignment, but not an unfamiliar one for Van de Zandschulp, who has beaten ATP No. 1 Club members Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal within the past two years — and holds a recent victory over Djokovic himself.

“It's always nice to play one of the best of the game. It's a nice matchup as well, I know I can play well during them and I've proved it in the past,” Van de Zandschulp told ATPTour.com in Melbourne. “I know what I'm capable of… It gives you a confidence boost when you see those names in the draw. Of course you are scared, but further into the tournament when I have some matches in, I feel I can beat a lot of players.

“Matches like these against Novak, if you can enjoy it during it, it's a really nice occasion.”

Van de Zandschulp prevailed in his most recent Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Djokovic last year at Indian Wells, a match he remembers vividly. Entering the main draw as a lucky loser, the Dutchman produced a clinical deciding-set performance to spring the upset.

“I didn't feel great at that time, but now I am feeling a little bit better tennis-wise,” Van de Zandschulp said, reflecting on their Indian Wells clash. “Hopefully that helps me… Here in Australia, it's one of his favourite tournaments, one of his favourite courts, so it will be a different test. He was struggling there [in Indian Wells]. The conditions were tough: pretty hot, pretty bouncy.”

Djokovic is far from the only superstar Van de Zandschulp has tested — and toppled — in recent seasons. He stunned Alcaraz in the second round of the 2024 US Open and, two months later, famously brought Nadal's storied career to a close at the Davis Cup Finals.

Each victory offered a different form of validation, reinforcing his ability not only to match the sport's elite shot for shot, but also to manage the moment and the magnitude of the occasion.

“Beating Alcaraz over five sets is not an easy task, but beating him 3-0 was something I couldn't imagine before stepping on court,” Van de Zandschulp said. “[Beating] Rafa was also pretty special because it's not often in tennis you know who you are going to play a month in advance.

“I found out that it was going to be his last tournament and that we were going to play Spain in the quarters. If he was going to play, I would be the one to play him, so I thought a lot about the match when usually you don't have time to. That was, mentally, the toughest match for me.”



When Van de Zandschulp walks onto Rod Laver Arena this weekend, it will mark his third consecutive year competing on the iconic stage. He fell to Jannik Sinner and Alex de Minaur in first-round encounters in the past two editions of the hard-court major. Those were experiences that, while bruising, have helped remove the novelty of the occasion.

Now, the Dutchman is back in the Australian Open third round for the first time since 2022, having dropped just one set en route after victories over 27th seed Brandon Nakashima and Shang Juncheng.

“I'm really happy about it. It's been a while since I won a match here,” said Van de Zandschulp. “The last two years, I had some tough draws with Sinner and De Minaur in the first round. But I'm playing some good tennis again - I started the season pretty well.

“It's good I already played there [Rod Laver Arena] as it's nothing new, but it's still going to be a huge challenge.”





Part of that renewed confidence can be traced back to a more settled offseason — a rarity in recent years. With Davis Cup commitments stretching deep into November, Van de Zandschulp has often had limited time to reset physically and mentally.

“The last couple of years, we have played Davis Cup in November, so the offseason has been pretty tough, pretty busy,” he added. “Now I already had three weeks off, five weeks practice, so I think that did me pretty well, especially for the mind, being at home a little bit longer. I really enjoyed my offseason and have started fresh.”

Against Djokovic on his most decorated stage, Van de Zandschulp will once again arrive as the underdog. Yet history suggests that is a role he knows how to embrace.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Frances Tiafoe: A new environment, same person & why 'Big Foe' can never be late","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/tiafoe-australian-open-2026-feature","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 02:26:25 GMT","

Dr. Mark Kovacs has known Frances Tiafoe since he was 12 years old. Kovacs, with the USTA at the time, worked with a group that included Tiafoe, Reilly Opelka, Taylor Fritz, Stefan Kozlov and Michael Mmoh.

Fifteen years ago, Tiafoe and the rest of the group were not competing on the world's biggest stages like they are today. They were putting in the hard yards on and off the court, dreaming of eventually being where they are today.

“Great person, super friendly with everyone, has an unbelievable heart, loves the game of tennis, loves to practise, loves to train, loves to be out on court, and loves to watch tennis as well,” Kovacs told ATPTour.com of Tiafoe. “He's the same person and I've worked with him in the purest form. It wasn't at the Grand Slams. It was on back courts, no one around, grinding for hours, working on your game, working on your fitness, doing all those types of things.

“That's sort of the same environment we're trying to create again. It's like, ‘Hey, this is the pure love for the sport'. Commit to what you're great at, work on the details, be as consistent and deliberate as we possibly can.”





Already a two-time US Open semi-finalist and a 2019 Australian Open quarter-finalist, Tiafoe on Friday evening will play sixth seed Alex de Minaur inside Rod Laver Arena, the No. 1 court at Melbourne Park. On this big occasion, Kovacs is by Tiafoe's side again.

They have kept in touch over the years, while Kovacs, known for his high-performance and performance physiology work as well as sports technology consultancy, has helped many clients across different sports and industries.

At the end of last season, Tiafoe was making changes and reached out asking if Kovacs could help, even just for a reset during the preseason. Kovacs “wants the best” for Tiafoe, so he happily obliged.

“As things went along, he asked me if I'd be willing to take more of a serious role and sort of help him on the journey,” Kovacs said. “And obviously, I had to think about it. I've got a lot of things that I do. 

“But I gave him a handful of non-negotiables and said, ‘Hey, if you're willing to do these things, then let's do it'. He was willing to do these things. And I said, ‘Hey, if you're fully committed and ready to go all in, and try to get this done, then so am I'.”

According to Kovacs, their collaboration has been “great so far”. Tiafoe has been doing everything he has asked.  

“He's got great ability. We all know he could play tennis at a high level,” Kovacs said. “Now it's about, ‘Can he take care of the little details on a daily basis?'”

An example for Team Tiafoe is time. Being on schedule is of the utmost importance, and Kovacs has integrated something he saw done in another sport into Tiafoe's daily routine.

“I worked in the NBA for a few years. There's a fine system in the NBA if you're late. I have the same policy,” Kovacs said. “We abide by a fine system, all of us on the team. So it's consistent. It's not just for the player, it's for the coaches, it's for everyone else. So things like that, if you're late, there's a dollar amount that's attached to it.”

Kovacs and company have worked on changing certain habits and several things they are working towards to allow Tiafoe to perform the best he can on court.

“There's a combination of things, and most of the time, it's on things that he wants to do to get the end goal, and I'm just giving him some steps along the way,” Kovacs said. “If you really want to get these outcomes, these are the deliberate processes that we have to go through. And we're really not focused on outcome at all. It's all about daily process, daily improvement. and setting a consistent standard that we all can live to. The entire team is accountable. It's not just him.”

Something that has been working well has been Kovacs and Tiafoe's communication. Because they have known one another for more than half of Tiafoe's life, they are able to cut to the chase.

“I can speak to him very differently than even I can speak to maybe other players I've worked with in the past, if we don't have the same relationship,” Kovacs said. “And he can speak to me in a different way as well. He doesn't have to bide his time, be cautious about what he says, how he says it. He knows we're all here for a very simple purpose and we're working together to try to see if he can achieve it.” 

Tiafoe will put his efforts to the test against De Minaur, one of the toughest competitors in the sport in what promises to be a raucous atmosphere, an environment in which the 29th seed has long thrived.

“I want him to enjoy it. This is why you do this,” Kovacs said. “I tell him every day, ‘You chose this life. You made the decision to be a professional tennis player… Go out there, have as much fun as possible while following the plan, while staying on the course, while doing the things that you've been trained to do'. So that's what we want.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz ties this Borg record, outpacing Djokovic, Nadal & Federer...","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-australian-open-2026-100-major-matches","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:20:33 GMT","

After 100 matches at Grand Slam level, Carlos Alcaraz has compiled a record that places him in rarefied air.


The Spaniard, who advanced to the Australian Open fourth round Friday with a win against Corentin Moutet, owns an 87-13 record at the majors, equalling Bjorn Borg for the best start through 100 matches in the Open Era. 


Alcaraz has surpassed legends, including Rafael Nadal and fellow ATP No. 1 Club member John McEnroe, who both went 86-14 across their first 100 major matches. The World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings is setting a standard that some of the sport's greatest names did not reach as quickly. 

Most wins after 100 major matches in the Open Era

Novak Djokovic, a record 24-time major titlist and 10-time champion in Melbourne, went 79-21 across his first 100 Slam matches, while Swiss Roger Federer went 80-20. Alcaraz's great rival Jannik Sinner played his 100th major match (81-19) last year at Wimbledon, coincidentally against the Spaniard in the championship match. The Italian won that clash.


At just 22 years old, Alcaraz is a six-time major champion who this fortnight is chasing more history. Should he claim his maiden Australian Open title, Alcaraz would complete his Career Grand Slam and become the youngest player to achieve that feat.


Alcaraz's journey at the Slams began four years ago at Melbourne Park, where the then-No. 141-ranked qualifier earned a milestone first major victory against Botic van de Zandschulp. In 2022, Alcaraz captured his maiden major crown at the US Open and with that victory, he became the youngest World No. 1 in PIF ATP Rankings history.


One of 29 members in the prestigious ATP No. 1 Club, Alcaraz has already secured a memorable milestone with his latest victory Down Under. Yet the Spaniard is chasing a bigger prize, aiming to leave Melbourne with the trophy in his luggage for the first time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Benjamin Balleret: Working in the dark, winning in the light with half-brother Vacherot","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/balleret-atp-coach-spotlight-january-2026","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:34:36 GMT","

Years ago, Valentin Vacherot would sometimes turn up at ATP Challenger events to simply watch his half-brother Benjamin Balleret compete.

The two Monegasques would hit a few balls together in the evening before Vacherot, still a schoolboy at the time with no real thoughts of turning professional, headed back to his studies. Tennis was something he enjoyed rather than something he chased, but today, the roles have reversed. It is now Balleret watching from the side of the court, guiding the 27-year-old Vacherot as he competes among the ATP Tour's elite.

“He was just playing tennis for fun,” Balleret told ATPTour.com, reflecting on Vacherot's teenage years. “He was going to school and playing from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. with his coach. He did this until he was almost 18 years old. I would bring him to some Challengers in Italy to just watch my matches. It wasn't serious, not really professional.”

What once felt like a casual introduction to life on Tour has evolved into one of the most compelling coach-player partnerships, built not solely on contracts but on family and belief. It is a relationship that made global headlines in Shanghai in October last year, when Vacherot stormed through qualifying to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in series history (since 1990).







Ironically, Vacherot began that Shanghai run as the No. 204 player in the PIF ATP Rankings — the exact career-high ranking Balleret reached during his own playing days. Now 43, Balleret admits he never achieved the success he hoped for as a player, but the lessons learned have become central to his effectiveness as a coach.
Before committing full time to Vacherot in 2022, Balleret built a strong coaching resume, guiding Gilles Muller to a career-high World No. 21 and working with Pierre-Hugues Herbert across a four-year spell that included three Grand Slam doubles titles. Those experiences helped shape a philosophy rooted in consistency rather than quick fixes.
“Every player, every human is different,” Balleret said. “Some things for me as a coach are important: work, respect… It doesn't matter who you coach, this has to be there. [You have to] work hard, respect and trust each other. Then everything outside of that, you have to adapt to every player.”

After Vacherot completed four years of college tennis at Texas A&M — where he played alongside his cousin Arthur Rinderknech, whom he later defeated in the Shanghai final — the brothers formally joined forces. What followed were seasons of steady progress, difficult losses and continued emotional investment.
“Sometimes it was difficult because it took time before what happened in Shanghai,” Balleret explained, referring to the sacrifices. “Because he's my brother, it was even more difficult when you don't have the results you want, when you feel like you're losing so much and you think that you shouldn't lose, some bad losses.
“But we never stopped believing, working and trusting each other — that's more important. Then Shanghai happened… I think everybody talks enough about this, but it was really unreal to go until the end.”

Coaching a family member presents its own challenges, particularly when the emotional lines between success and disappointment are thinner. For Balleret, learning when to step back as a brother and when to step in as a coach has been key to sustaining both the relationship and the results.
“I think it's even easier sometimes to tell things to your brother,” Balleret said. “The most challenging part is the emotional part. When we win, I try to not be overwhelmed with the win because it's also my brother and I'm so happy for him. It's the same for a loss. Sometimes it's difficult when you have a bad loss and not to be at the bottom, so I try to be really honest with him.
“I have this thing where I know him very well, better than almost everyone. So this has helped me, of course. But we're also not spending 24 hours together… We try to spend quality time together. It's pretty easy going. For most of the day, I'm his brother and not his coach.”
Shanghai also represented validation for a wider support team that had been carefully assembled over several seasons.
“Val and I, we tried for three years to put together a team that would help him reach his goals,” Balleret said. “That's why he's working with a fitness coach, Julien, his physio, Antoine, the mental coach, Isabelle. Also his girlfriend, Emily… We try to work all together and for all those people also, not only for Val and me.
“I'm so happy that Shanghai happened and that everybody's rewarded with all the work in the dark. We were working in the shadows for so many years. Now Val is more in the spotlight, everybody's more in the spotlight. We're not looking for the spotlight, but you just feel good reaching the goal and being there with the top players and playing every week against those players.”

Vacherot showed the Shanghai title was no one-off. He quickly rose inside the world's Top 40, reached the quarter-finals in Paris two weeks later and arrived at the 2026 Australian Open — his main-draw debut in Melbourne — as the 30th seed.
So where do they go from here? For Balleret, the focus remains unchanged.
“For this year, the goal for Val is to play the best players and to try to improve every week,” Balleret said. “Maybe he will play this guy and lose to this guy, but what can you improve to beat this guy next? That will be the main challenge this year for Val and I.”
More than 10 years after a young Valentin once watched from the stands without expectation, the tables have fully turned. Balleret is no longer the one being observed. Instead, he is the steady presence behind the scenes, guiding his half-brother through the brightest moments of a career that, not long ago, felt like nothing more than a game.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Jovic takes advice from Djokovic, upsets Paolini at Australian Open","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4438568/jovic-18-upsets-paolini-at-australian-open-for-first-top-10-win","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:34:16 GMT","

The youngest player in the Top 100, 18-year-old Iva Jovic, dealt out the biggest upset of the tournament so far with a 6-2, 7-6(3) third-round defeat of No. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini.

The result put No. 29 seed Jovic into the second week of a major for the first time at just her sixth attempt. It's also her first win over a Top 10 player in four meetings. Two of the American teenager's three previous losses had come against Paolini, at Indian Wells and the US Open last year.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

""I've been wanting this one for a while now,"" Jovic said in her on-court interview. ""Had a couple of tough losses. I'm so happy to get through that barrier and get that win today.""

In her press conference, Jovic revealed that she had been given some ""very attentive tips"" from former ATP World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in a conversation the previous day to incorporate into her game.

""Just to open up the court a little bit better, to not rush into the shots all the time, find some more width,"" she explained. ""So I tried to do that, and it ended well. So I'm just going to try to keep listening to Novak.""

Jovic, the daughter of a Serbian father and Croatian mother, is still closely connected to her roots. She visits Serbia annually, both the capital of Belgrade and the southern town of Leskovac, where she has extended family. The link to one of Serbia's greatest athletes of all time is a natural one -- though she still finds it surreal.

""It's pretty insane,"" she said. ""You always think about those moments where you're going to meet your idols a little bit, and I think sometimes for certain people it can be a little bit deflating if they are maybe not as nice or as open as you anticipated. I think that happens a lot of times where you kind of see, oh, wow, that's definitely not how it looks like on TV.

""I think he's almost even kinder and even more attentive outside the cameras than what he's portrayed. It was amazing. I mean, he's so intelligent and smart and really wants to help the younger generation. So I'm really grateful to have that advice.""

Djokovic's pointers were evident in Jovic's relentless, side-to-side offense in a dominant 37-minute first set. It forced Paolini to over-press in response -- she tallied 13 unforced errors and just four winners in the opener -- but the two-time major finalist made Jovic battle hard in the second. Paolini adjusted her tactics, pumping high balls to Jovic's backhand and extending the rallies. Jovic served for the match twice at 5-4 and 6-5, but was unable to close the deal.

But despite those setbacks, it was younger player who got on the front foot in an impeccable tiebreak, taking the lead with sweetly-timed backhands down the line and reaching match point with a bold return winner -- her 20th of the match.

""I tried to focus on what I was doing earlier in the match,"" Jovic said. ""Being really aggressive and controlling the play. I think when I served for the match, I got a little too passive -- so I told myself to go out swinging and it helped in the tiebreak.""

The result continues a rapid rise for Jovic, who was ranked No. 191 this time last year. She captured her first title on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz in Guadalajara last September, and started 2026 in fine form by reaching the Auckland semifinals and Hobart final. Her record this year is already 10-2, and she'll have the opportunity to extend that further against Yulia Putintseva in the fourth round.

2025 WTA Newcomer of the Year Victoria Mboko will face World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the fourth round of the Australian Open after both won tense third-round matches.

Victoria Mboko's Australian Open breakthrough now carries her into a fourth-round meeting on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz with World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The 19-year-old No. 17 seed sealed a second-week berth regrouped after failing to convert three match points in the second set of an eventual 7-6(5), 5-7, 6-3 win over No. 14 seed Clara Tauson in the third round on Friday, a win that puts her through to the fourth round of a Grand Slam event for the first time in her career in her fourth main draw played.

Simultaneously, two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka was navigating her own tough test inside Rod Laver Arena to reach the second week in Melbourne for a sixth year in a row. Up against Anastasia Potapova, Sabalenka found herself reeled in from a 7-6(4), 4-0 lead -- and eventually, saved four set points in the second-set tiebreak to win 7-6(4), 7-6(7).

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Mboko did not come close to losing a set in each of her first two matches of her Australian Open debut and looked on course to do the same against Tauson. After edging out an opening set tiebreak after being ahead by a break of serve twice, Mboko came from an early break down to build a 7-6(5), 5-3 lead. 

But Tauson found her best tennis in the next games -- most crucially, when she was one point from defeat three times serving down 5-4. Five games in a row went to the Dane to not just earn her the second set, but an early break in the third. 

Mboko later said ""self-belief"" was what helped her get over the finish line in 2 hours and 19 minutes. She broke back immediately, the start of a four-game run of her own, and hammered back-to-back backhand winners to clinch the match from 30-30 in the final game.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

""I had so many chances in the second set but I have to give credit where its due, she was playing incredible tennis, so I just had to lock in in the important moments,"" Mboko said afterward. ""When you have those chances like that, and you're up in the match, and you have opportunities to finish but don't take it, it can be very discouraging. But that's why there's a third set, and I was able to regroup, find my groove again, and get it done. ... I really fought hard today.""

With the loss, Tauson drops to 0-3 in her career in Australian Open third rounds.

In two previous matches against Potapova, Sabalenka surrendered just seven games in four sets played. And after the tightest set between the two so far in a 1 hour and 4-minute opener, she won 16 of the first 19 points in set two. 

""She played incredible tennis. I was always on the back foot, and to be honest, there are days where you just have to be there, to fight and try your best to put the ball back,"" she said. ""Even though emotionally I was all over the place, I was able to still fight for every point ... and I'm just super happy that I was able to get this win. It was such a fight and I really enjoyed it.

""I was just trying to calm myself down, which wasn't working well today, but at the same time, I was trying to figure out how to connect my body. It seemed like everything was working separate. My brain was somewhere else, my arms were going one direction ... and I was looking to put pressure on her, to try to let her play basically, and somehow, magically, I was able to get this win.""

Sabalenka has now made the fourth-round or better at the last 13 Grand Slam events she has contested dating back to a third-round loss at Roland Garros in 2022.

Teaming up with Nick Kyrgios, the two starred inside ANZ Arena by winning from three match points down against a team that has shared two mixed doubles titles together. Facing Desirae Krawczyk and Neal Skupski, the wild card pairing prevailed with a 6-7 (6), 6-4 [12-10] victory.“It was a lot of fun. My goodness,” reacted Fernandez. “I keep hearing how the crowd here in the AO is very rowdy, it's a party, and finally I have the chance to experience it, and I also get the chance to kind of compare it to the US Open. It's just very electric.“I was just excited to play the next point. I totally forgot the score sometimes and just enjoyed my time with them.”

Hamilton reflects on Ferrari's 'remarkable' journey at Maranello launch

Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history'

F1 technical expert Mark Hughes gives his initial take on the Mercedes W17 design.

The renders Mercedes have released of their new W17 challenger show a distinctive design – especially around the rear three-quarters – with a lower bodywork that kinks upwards at the rear.

This is in stark contrast to the extreme downwash bodyworks on the other 2026 cars that we have seen thus far. However, this is a computerised render and not the real thing, so it's difficult to try to read too much into it.

Other notable points are the retention of pushrod front suspension (Mercedes were in the minority in using front pushrod last year), which seems to be the common choice of teams for the 2026 regulations.

It's notable that the pushrod is intrinsically lighter for the same strength and this is probably a significant driver of that move as everyone struggles to get down to the lowered 770kg minimum weight.

With the platform of these flat-bottom cars no longer needing to be as stiff as those of the ground-effect era machines, the ride heights are expected to be greater and we will probably see the return of using some dive under braking to bring forward the centre of aero pressure into slow corners to counter the natural low-speed understeer. As such, the pullrod installation's inherently greater stiffness control is no longer as valuable.

The nose mounts to the middle element of the three-element front wing via pillars, leaving a big slot beneath with which to feed airflow to the underfloor. With the reduction in underfloor downforce arising from deleting the venturi floor tunnels, rear downforce generation is going to be at more of a premium than before. Mercedes appear to be committing heavily to this.

On the renders, the floor board ahead of the sidepod – a new part of the regulation intending to force teams to in-wash the front wheel wake into the floor rather than out-washing it for greater aero effectiveness, but a more disruptive wake for the car behind – looks to be fully committing to in-washing with the alignment of the vanes.

Looking at the VCARB which tested at Imola, it appears as if that team is trying to minimise the in-wash in the way it has aligned the permitted three vanes within the boards. This would seem more logical, but again this may not be representative of the actual W17 when it breaks cover on its shakedown at Silverstone.

Other things to check when the real car breaks cover include whether the sidepod/engine cover really is as flat in profile as the render makes it appear – or whether the heavy downwash which is the more obvious reaction to the new regulations will be incorporated also on the W17.

If the real car indeed has this sidepod/engine cover arrangement and the committed in-washing floor boards, then there will be many seeking to understand how Mercedes have chosen to resolve the conflicting demands of the new regulations.

Have they pioneered a left-field solution, or is this just a case of deliberately misleading renders?

Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history'

Mercedes have unveiled the first images of their 2026 challenger, featuring a new livery in their iconic colours.

Mercedes have revealed the first images of their 2026 challenger, which features a revised livery in their iconic silver and black colours.

The Silver Arrows, who fought back to finish second in the Teams' Championship last year, will run an unchanged line-up of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli this season.

The W17, like all its rivals, will be smaller, narrower and lighter than its predecessor as it has been designed and built to sweeping new aerodynamic regulations.

“Formula 1will undergo significant change in 2026, and we are prepared for that transition,"" said Team Principal and CEO Toto Wolff.

""The new regulations demand innovation and absolute focus across every area of performance.

""Our work on the new car, and the long-term development of the Power Unit and advanced sustainable fuels with Petronas, reflects that approach.

""Releasing the first images of the W17 is simply the next step in that process.

""It represents the collective, sustained effort of our teams in [their Power Unit base in] Brixworth and [chassis base in] Brackley. We will continue to push hard in the months ahead.""

Mercedes will join the rest of the teams in Spain next week for the five-day Barcelona Shakedown.

The eight-time world champions will then host a season launch event with their drivers, senior personnel and the W17 on February 2.

Afterwards, the squad will then head to Bahrain for official pre-season testing, with two three-day tests planned for teams to refine their cars and start to chase performance.

Racing Bulls have signed the former Aston Martin technical chief to bolster their ranks.

Racing Bulls have announced the appointment of experienced aerodynamicist Dan Fallows as their new Technical Director, adding to the squad's technical leadership group.

When he arrives in April, Fallows will report into Chief Technical Officer, Tim Goss, and “take responsibility for the overall technical direction of the team, working across design, aerodynamics and performance”.

Fallows joins Racing Bulls after previous Technical Director Jody Egginton vacated his position to become Engineering Director at Red Bull Advanced Technologies in early 2025.

It marks the latest move in an F1 career that began with Jaguar Racing in the early 2000s, before stints at Red Bull and most recently Aston Martin – the Briton stepping down as their Technical Director at the end of the 2024 season.

“I'm very pleased to be joining VCARB at an exciting time for the team,” said Fallows in a press release issued by Racing Bulls on Friday.

“There is a clear vision and strong technical ambition, and I'm looking forward to working closely with Tim and the wider engineering group to help drive performance and continue building the team for the future.”

Alan Permane, Racing Bulls' Team Principal, said: “Dan has a wealth of experience, and his technical understanding and leadership will be a real asset to the team as we continue to develop and push forward competitively. We're delighted to welcome him to VCARB.”

Racing Bulls head into the 2026 season with a revised driver line-up, as F2 race winner Arvid Lindblad joins incumbent Liam Lawson – the pair already experiencing the new VCARB 03 in a shakedown at Imola earlier this week.

Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history'

Ahead of the manufacturer's first season in F1 as a works team, Audi are set to launch their own Driver Development Programme.

Audi have announced the launch of their Driver Development Programme ahead of the manufacturer's first season as a works outfit in Formula 1, with the initiative set to be directed by former F1 driver Allan McNish.

Identified as a key part of the team's strategy to build a competitive Formula 1 team by investing in young talent on and off the track, the programme will scout and support promising young drivers from karting and junior formula series, providing a clear path to the top echelon of motorsport.

Members of the Driver Development Programme will receive world-class training and mentorship as part of a bespoke programme, covering various aspects from on-track performance and driving and engineering development, through to human performance and media and marketing.

McNish brings a wealth of experience to his role with the programme. Along with his racing background – which includes an F1 stint with Toyota in 2002 and three 24 Hours of Le Mans victories – the Scot has worked in team management roles and has held a long-standing relationship with the Audi brand.

“To be entrusted with finding the cornerstones of the future Audi Revolut F1 Team is a great honour and a responsibility I am very passionate about,” said McNish. “This brand is built on a history of 'Vorsprung durch Technik', and that philosophy must apply to our young drivers as much as to our cars.

“We are not just looking for raw speed; we are looking for the resilience, intelligence, and team-driven mindset that defines a future Audi champion. Our goal is to build a pathway that turns potential into precision and performance on the world stage.

“I am thrilled to begin this work and identify the first generation of talent to join this ambitious project.""

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal of Audi, added: “Investing in the champions of tomorrow is a key pillar of our Formula 1 strategy. The Audi Driver Development Programme is a clear statement of our long-term commitment to youth and our ambition to be competitive.

“With Allan McNish, we have a director who not only has an incredible track record in motorsport but also embodies the spirit and dedication of our operations. Under his leadership, this programme will be integral to our vision for 2030, our goal of building a winning team and shaping the future of Audi in Formula 1.""

The news comes after Audi unveiled their 2026 F1 car, the R26, at an immersive launch event in Berlin.

Hamilton reflects on Ferrari's 'remarkable' journey at Maranello launch

Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history'

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella has explained why the squad will continue to use their ‘papaya rules' approach for Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in 2026.

Andrea Stella has reaffirmed that McLaren will continue to provide “equal opportunities” to both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in 2026, with the Team Principal stating that the squad will “keep racing the McLaren way”.

The Woking-based outfit became known for their ‘papaya rules' last season, an approach that focuses on treating both drivers fairly. While the strategy occasionally faced external criticism on the occasions where it backfired, it is one that the team are sticking with going forward.

Reflecting on this ahead of the MCL40 first hitting the track at the upcoming Barcelona Shakedown, Stella praised the squad's drivers for their support on the matter as he explained: “We talked last year quite a bit about internal racing at McLaren, so let me say that from that point of view, we will enter 2026 with continuity.

“We will keep racing the McLaren way. If we have been able to achieve success in 2024 and then in 2025, what has added extra value to what we have achieved is the way in which we have achieved in such a collaborative, supportive way – [a] cohesive way – together with our drivers.

“I actually [came here] straight from a meeting with Oscar, and before I was having lunch with Lando. The 2026 season is already fully on, even in terms of how much the drivers are engaged, and I was particularly pleased to see how energetic, proactive, full of ideas, but also full of support to the way we have gone racing the McLaren way in the past. So that's the perspective of going into 2026 racing from a team point of view.”

Despite this, Stella acknowledged that there may be ways in which the team “streamline” their approach, having tried to learn from the areas that they could improve on from last season.

“I can certainly say that like anything that we approach at McLaren, we go through a thorough process of review such that we can see where are the opportunities to improve, and this was the same for what we call the racing principles and the way we go racing and internal competition,” the Italian said.

“We got quite a lot of feedback already during the season last year. We had conversations after the season and we are having conversations pretty much as we speak now.

“All this has led us to reaffirm fundamentally, like I said before, that the concepts of fairness, integrity, equal opportunities, sportsmanship, they are all fundamental for the team, for Lando and for Oscar. So they are reaffirmed, they are confirmed and consolidated, if anything.

“At the same time, we all acknowledge that the volume of work required, for instance, for the team and to some extent even for the drivers related to internal competition was important.

“Therefore, any attempt we can make to make this going racing together just simpler to some extent will be welcome. It will be in reality a matter of finetuning because, once we reviewed what we have done, in most of the cases we said that's exactly what we would still do again.

“But we found a few opportunities in which we can streamline the way in which we operate collectively – like I said, reaffirming the fundamental principles that we have adopted in the past.”

Hamilton reflects on Ferrari's 'remarkable' journey at Maranello launch

Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history'

Flavio Briatore has stated that Alpine have no reason to not perform well in 2026.

Flavio Briatore has outlined his high expectations for Alpine in 2026, explaining that ""this year is not for excuses"" after they discounted last season in order to capitalise on the new regulations.

After a strong multi-year run of consistent midfield results, 2025 was a gruelling year for the team as they dropped to last place in the Teams' Championship, earning just 22 points at the hands of Pierre Gasly while Franco Colapinto failed to score.

Briatore, who previously guided the squad to numerous titles under the Renault name, returned in 2024 as Executive Advisor and now covers the duties of a Team Principal alongside Managing Director Steve Nielsen, with the pair targeting a much improved season.

Asked at the A526 launch what he expects from the unchanged driver line-up, the Italian answered: “This is a difficult question, but I expect the best. You know, this year is not for excuses anymore. We have a brand new car and we have the same drivers.

“I promise Franco had a very good winter and I hope he gets much better results and he's ready to compete with Pierre. We need two drivers competing. We need the performance of the driver.”

Alpine's 2026 car was revealed in style onboard a cruise ship, marking what Briatore labelled “a new chapter” for the team after they dedicated the bulk of their resources to making their challenger the best it can possibly be.

Like the other 10 teams, they will have to adjust to the new regulations, but the Enstone outfit will face the added challenge of a different power unit as they become a Mercedes customer team.

Briatore appeared confident that, despite the widespread changes, Alpine are ready to compete at a high level once again, saying: “I promise everybody that this season will be fantastic. Before the first race, everybody's world champion. After we go to Australia, we see where we are.

“It's very difficult to see where we are. We need to see what happens in the first race, but we believe we are competitive. We have been working very well and our technical people have done a super job. Alpine has really come back in performance this year.”

Hamilton reflects on Ferrari's 'remarkable' journey at Maranello launch

Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history'

Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc got an initial taste of Ferrari's 2026 car on Friday.

1 / 7

Ferrari have completed the very first laps with their new F1 challenger, the SF-26.

Shortly after the design was presented to the world on Friday, Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc got behind the wheel at the team's very own Fiorano test track – next to their Maranello headquarters in Italy.

Classed as a demonstration day, Ferrari's running was limited to just 15 kilometres, meaning only brief stints on track for the continuing team mates.

Nonetheless, that sent the passionate group of Tifosi gathered around the circuit wild, with plenty of support being shown before Ferrari head to next week's Barcelona Shakedown.

Check out a gallery of the SF-26 in action at the top of the page.

Charles Leclerc: 'One of the biggest changes that has happened in F1 history'

Williams have announced that they will not appear at the upcoming Barcelona Shakedown as they pursue ""maximum car performance"".

Williams have announced that they will not take part in the upcoming Barcelona Shakedown, explaining that they are pursuing ""maximum car performance"" for 2026.

The shakedown, which will see teams get the opportunity to run their new challengers for three days over January 26-30 at the Circuit Barcelona-Catalunya, offers more track time in addition to the usual pre-season testing in Bahrain to help with the transition to the adjusted regulations.

While Williams will not make an appearance, they will carry out their own private testing ahead of the first official test in Bahrain, taking place on February 11-13.

In an official statement, the team said: ""Atlassian Williams F1 Team has taken the decision not to participate in next week's shakedown test in Barcelona following delays in the FW48 programme as we continue to push for maximum car performance.

""The team will instead conduct a series of tests including a VTT [Virtual Track Testing] programme next week with the 2026 car to prepare for the first official test in Bahrain and the first race of the season in Melbourne.

""We are looking forward to getting on track in the coming weeks and want to thank all our fans for your continued support – there is a lot to look forward to together in 2026.""

Abby Ryder Fortson and Sam Waterston also star in Rachel Lambert's story of a divorced doctor struggling to reconnect with or pull away from a former girlfriend.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	Whether playing sexy comedy or hostility, raw emotional agita or hollowness, Chris Pine and Jenny Slate are so damn fine in Carousel that you keep wondering why we seldom get to see these gifted actors bite into characters of such substance and complexity. Rachel Lambert's latest is a strange and beguilingly lovely relationship drama. Eventually. But first, the writer-director needs to get out of her own way, peeling away the fussiness and frustration of her oblique approach and finally cutting back on her overbearing use of a cascading score to give us unfettered access to characters about whom it's clear she cares deeply.

	Not to pile onto composer Dabney Morris, who presumably is doing what was asked of him, but the wall-to-wall music of the opening scenes is almost a deal-breaker. Even before the title card appears, we get that the plinky-plonky melodies are meant to suggest the merry-go-round of life, with the rise and fall of the horses mirroring the ups and downs of our relationships. It's a trite metaphor, and a movie as smart and subtle as this one deserves better.

The Bottom Line

	
	Takes its time but sneaks up on you.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (U.S. Dramatic Competition)Cast: Chris Pine, Jenny Slate, Abby Ryder Fortson, Sam Waterston, Katey Sagal, Heléne York, Dagmara Domincyzk, Jessica Harper, Jeffrey DeMunn, Tien TranDirector-screenwriter: Rachel Lambert

								1 hour 45 minutes			






	There are moments early on that draw us in, notably between Noah (Pine), a Cleveland doctor with a small family medical practice, and his teenage daughter Maya (Abby Ryder Fortson), when he drops her at school and she has a full-blown panic attack after realizing she left some important papers at home.

	











	Lambert clues us in quickly that Maya is suffering from anxiety and depression, and the way Noah tiptoes around her — showing support and concern but holding back as if by not making a big deal of it, the problem will go away — is quietly affecting.


	But it's not until midway, in a devastating extended duologue between Noah and Maya's high school teacher and debate coach Rebecca (Slate), that the movie's defining elegance and restraint fully take hold and the actors are given space to deepen their characters. Like something out of Scenes From a Marriage (the HBO remake, not the original Bergman miniseries), the sequence unfolds in a kitchen but is shot mostly from the next room. It's carefully blocked but lived in and spontaneous as Noah and Rebecca cycle through anger, regret, self-justification and defeat, setting the drama on a decisive new trajectory from which it never looks back.


	The pair were a couple back in school, their relationship ending in bitterness and resentment when Rebecca left Cleveland to pursue a career in the political sphere and Noah chose to stay put and start a family. When they initially reconnect through Maya at a farmers market, it seems as if they barely knew each other — beyond being cast in the same production of Fiddler on the Roof. But the first time they are alone together it's evident that the sexual sparks are still very much there, along with the underlying emotions.


	Noah is bruised by his recent divorce from Maya's mother (Dagmara Domincyzk), saddened by the decision to retire of his mentor at the financially precarious clinic (Sam Waterston), and we later learn, grieving from the unexplained but seemingly tragic loss of his father. But he's so inured to shoving aside his troubles so he can keep a vigilant eye on Maya that a complicated romantic relationship with Rebecca feels like more than he can handle.

	











	The minute Maya is out of the picture for a summer studies program at Stanford, Noah falls apart, literally unable to pick himself up and even get out of the airport for what seems like days.


	Rebecca has her own problems and uncertainties — her parents (Jessica Harper and Jeffrey DeMunn) are aging; her friend Sophie (Tien Tran) tells her she has worked too hard to make inroads into D.C. politics to be teaching high school; her history with Noah is far from perfect.


	The love between the central couple is never in doubt, but hesitancy is a big part of this romantic drama. Lambert is clear-eyed and perceptive about the emotional safeguards people put up to protect themselves from the messiness of relationships. But the film also advocates for taking risks, for leaving doors open and giving love a shot. The long final scene, melancholy but beautiful, again framed from a detached distance, this time in half-light, encapsulates that sense of hope with pleasing delicacy.


	DP Dustin Lane shot Carousel on 35mm in what looks like the boxy Academy ratio, suffused in soft light. The visuals heighten the drama's intimacy. Lambert shows an attention to the details of daily life that shape the ways people connect and communicate. Returning to solitude as a central theme after Sometimes I Think About Death, the director has made a flawed movie that requires patience, but it delivers in the end, thanks in large part to the sensitive work of three excellent leads.


	Not since Hell or High Water has Pine conveyed such depth of feeling, such corrosive sorrow. Slate's Rebecca at first glance has a brittle aspect but slowly reveals a yearning that makes her question her choices. And Fortson, who was such a radiant discovery in Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret, is maturing into a first-rate actor, alternatively heartbreaking and resilient.

Co-helmed by Neil Berkeley, the Sundance-premiering film delves into Bamford's mental health and professional journeys.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	It's rare to see a lofty executive as front-and-center in a documentary as Netflix's Ted Sarandos is in Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley‘s Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story. 


	Sarandos takes justifiable pride in Bamford's career, since Netflix helped launch her mainstream visibility with the documentary The Comedians of Comedy and then fronted two seasons of Bamford's surreal and semi-autobiographical Lady Dynamite, which Sarandos boasts he bought from co-creator Mitch Hurwitz based on only a brief hallway pitch. Sarandos even calls Lady Dynamite his favorite Netflix original, a likably quirky choice, though he goes one step too far.

					Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	Funny, emotional and a bit too conventional.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (Premieres)Directors: Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley

								1 hour 55 minutes			






	“Critics really did love the show, but then they didn't talk about it much in the second season,” Sarandos declares, to which I can only say: I know at least one critic who had the second Lady Dynamite season in his Top 10 list for 2017.


	That's the thing about Maria Bamford. She has built a career on people taking personal ownership over “discovering” her. She's been one of those “your favorite comic's favorite comic” esoteric choices going back nearly 30 years. With every success, pundits have tipped her as being on the verge of breaking out, as if she craved something “bigger,” when the truth is that with her avant-garde eccentricities and increasingly confessional approach to her battles with mental illness, Bamford has never seemed destined for stadium tours. 


	So anyway, Maria Bamford seems to be on the verge of breaking out with Paralyzed by Hope, a 115-minute exploration of Bamford's personal and professional journey from Duluth to Altadena, with myriad roadblocks — depression, OCD, suicidal ideation, family tensions — along the way. 

	











	The documentary has one serious problem that won't bother many viewers and doesn't fully detract from a portrait that blends the candid, silly, uncomfortable, sad and triumphant, just like Bamford herself.


	The most Bamford-ian part of the documentary is actually the beginning, with Apatow and crew arriving at Bamford's house, offering her a banana and a small cash payout — “Maybe we have no ethics here,” Apatow confesses — and sitting down for a casual conversation that Bamford compares to dating. This is before she agrees to do the documentary.


	Bamford, of course, ultimately agrees to participate, and she participates with consummate candor, luring talking heads from her personal life — including her father and sister, who both admit to discomfort when they first saw Bamford's on-stage impressions of them, and her husband, who is central to the documentary's best and most heartwarming chapters. 


	The documentary is well-represented with Bamford's various colleagues, comics like Jackie Kashian, who met her at open mics in Minneapolis in the '90s, and Patton Oswalt, Bamford's Comedians of Comedy touring partner, who says without hesitation that when he first saw Bamford onstage he didn't get her. 


	Oswalt is far from the only person who required some exposure to understand Bamford, whose material has evolved to include Andy Kaufman-esque anti-comedy absurdity and those impressions, which have always been astonishing. Sarah Silverman, who seems to appear in every Apatow documentary, Stephen Colbert, who calls Bamford his favorite comedian, and Ron Funches, another of those comics who is always presented as being on the verge of breaking out, are among the many peers who show up to confirm Bamford's greatness. 

	











	The documentary's biggest challenge or obstacle in telling Bamford's story is something of a luxury problem: Maria Bamford has long been spectacular at telling Maria Bamford's story, and she hasn't been stingy in her openness. Bamford's stand-up has been primarily autobiographical for years and she's covered her stints in mental wellness facilities, her struggles to find a proper diagnosis and medication, her bumpy relationship with her family and several prominent tragedies in cable specials, talk show appearances, podcasts and, yes, in Lady Dynamite, which critics apparently didn't support enough. 


	If you're going to tell Maria Bamford's story, you probably won't be able to tell it as well as Maria Bamford, so you're going to lean into those various clips of her telling her story, at which point the question becomes: What, exactly, are you adding to this experience? The answer, in the case of Paralyzed by Hope, is that what's being added is the platform, but not a lot else. Apatow frames several of those oft-discussed biographical details as surprises in a way that felt a little cheap to me — not grossly manipulative, but not exactly additive. 


	Maybe the documentary's biggest advantage and biggest revelations relate to recency. The chapter of Bamford's life over the past year-and-a-half, which includes the impact of last January's Eaton fire, hasn't been processed onto the stage as fully. This is the chapter that even casual fans may not know, with details that admirably baffle even her various contemporaries. In a good way.  

	











	In contrast to how Lady Dynamite depicted Bamford life, with its boundary-pushing whimsy and expressive weirdness, Paralyzed by Hope is shaped by a very straightforward, somewhat dry and largely familiar approach. Or it's familiar if you know her story. Which some people don't. Because Maria Bamford is on the verge of breaking out, but apparently not there yet. So it's a good opportunity to fall in love with Maria Bamford if you're unfamiliar. And even if you know the story, the way Bamford tells it remains refreshing and fully involving.

Adriana Paz toplines Suzanne Andrews Correa's based-on-real-events drama as a survivor of sexual assault who embarks on a path of retribution.


							By 

	Sheri Linden


Senior Copy Editor/Film Critic


The Huntress (La Cazadora), the first feature by writer-director Suzanne Andrews Correa, opens with a portentous tableau: women waiting in darkness by the side of an unlighted road. Passing headlights illuminate their anxious faces. They know that the buses they depend on to get to their assembly plant jobs can also be traps, making them prey to rapists and killers. And, in the border town where they live, their calls for justice have long been met with official indifference and obstruction. They wait.


	Exploring trauma, rage and revenge from an intimate perspective, Andrews Correa's gritty, well-observed drama is based on events that unfolded in Ciudad Juárez, a place that has become infamous for violence against women, many of whose remains have turned up in shallow graves in the Chihuahuan Desert on the outskirts of the city. It was in Juárez, in the summer of 2013 (20 years after victims' bodies were first discovered), that a woman who called herself Diana, Hunter of Bus Drivers shot and killed two drivers at point-blank range. Her true identity remains unknown. The Huntress conjectures, affectingly, on who she might be.

The Bottom Line

	
	Keenly observed and deeply unsettling.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (World Cinema Dramatic Competition)Cast: Adriana Paz, Teresa Sánchez, Jennifer Trejo, Eme Malafe, Guillermo Alonso, Leidi Gutiérrez, Estrella Gómez, Suri GutiérrezDirector-screenwriter: Suzanne Andrews Correa

								1 hour 31 minutes			






	Set and filmed in and around Juárez, part of a U.S.-Mexico manufacturing hub, the movie imagines barely more than 24 hours, spread over two transformative days, in the life of Luz, a 40-something employee of one of the border town's maquiladoras. The character is brought to vibrant, ferocious, conflicted life by a superb Adriana Paz (Emila Pérez).

	










			Related Video		







	After the opening nighttime scene, the film jumps straight into the shocking daylight shooting. Instead of boarding the bus she usually takes to the appliance assembly plant, Luz, with a gun in her shaking hands and her only disguise a long platinum wig, plants herself in the entrance to the bus and takes aim. She flees to a public bathroom to throw up and scrub the spattered blood from her face. The man she killed recently raped one of her co-workers, 17-year-old Clara (Leidi Gutiérrez), whose face still bears the bruises from her attack. During a moment alone, Luz seems to breathe for the first time in hours, her satisfied smile signaling her sense of accomplishment and, perhaps, a course of no return.


	The plant's American managers arrange for a local police detective, Rosales (Guillermo Alonso), to question employees about the shooting. With his faux geniality, he's almost a walking cliché of male entitlement. Alonso taps into this but also into how Rosales is posing, testing his power at every turn — from the menacing fashion in which he pours a glass of water to his maliciousness after nearly forcing his way into Luz's house. With cops like these, it's no wonder the investigation of crimes against poor women hasn't been a priority. Newscasters, meanwhile, quickly begin spouting an official story about the bus driver's killing that has nothing to do with the women.


	Luz's protective instincts have a particular focus: her 14-year-old daughter, Alejandra (Jennifer Trejo), first seen playing hooky with her bestie (Suri Gutiérrez) to shop for quinceañera dresses. It's a quintessential teen-girl moment, complete with glittering layers of crinoline, a joyful vision of innocence on the cusp of experience. Alejandra's innocence extends toward her mother's trauma: As the screenplay gradually reveals, Luz's assault happened a year earlier, and the truth of the matter has been kept from her daughter, who knows only that her mother was in an “accident.”

	











	Luz's boyfriend of three years, cabdriver Jaime (Eme Malafe), is a neighbor in their remote patch of Juárez. He's a good-natured and dependable guy — and a long-suffering one, at the end of his patience with Luz, who apparently hasn't slept with him since she was raped. Meaning well but hitting a flat note that signals he just doesn't get the depth of her pain, he tells her of her ordeal, “It's over. You're okay.” Later, though, after Luz harshly reveals that she views even him as a potential abuser, his viewpoint abruptly shifts. “You're really sick,” he tells her, understandably offended.


	That Luz is damaged is one of the strengths of Andrews Correa's screenplay, which doesn't downplay the trap that grieving and outrage can turn into. When Luz crosses paths with Ximena (Teresa Sánchez), a tough local who has devoted herself to the memory of her long-missing daughter with an obsessive focus, it's soon clear that they understand each other on a profound level — they are, as Ximena later puts, “two zombies.” Ximena, whose daughter worked at the same plant as Luz, leads groups of bereft parents of missing girls into the desert to search for evidence, people for whom any scrap of bone inspires hope. There's barely room for her to sleep amid the boxes of evidence in her house, but her daughter's room is pristine and carefully maintained. Hanging from the rearview mirror of her pickup is a figurine that intrigues Luz: the goddess Artemis, the hunter.

	











	Andrews Correa, a writer-director on the Paramount+ series Minimum Wage (15 a la Hora), roots the story in an unforced working-class sensibility and a powerful sense of place. María Sarasvati Herrera's widescreen camerawork captures an edge-of-the-world emptiness in the flat stretches of desert that surround the city, and a heartless chill in the horizontal grid of workstations stretching across the factory floor. The darkness of the night scenes is thick with danger, and the tension throughout the film, along with its sense of emotional unraveling, is ratcheted up by the sound design.


	The high August temperatures referred to several times in the dialogue never quite come across, though it's notable that Luz, averse to being touched by Jaime or anyone, wears long sleeves in the summer heat. Whether Luz's pain will dissipate remains in doubt, but in Paz's exceptionally compelling performance, it's clear that she's done waiting for justice. And she's accepted the price.

Kingsley reprises his role as Trevor Slattery, now just an actor looking for his next big role, in the eight-part dramedy co-created by 'Shang-Chi' director Destin Daniel Cretton.


							By 

	Angie Han


Television Critic


	Simon Williams, the lead of Disney+'s Wonder Man, is no superhero. I don't mean he's a future Avenger yet to come into his potential — he's just not a superhero in any sense, and has no desire to become one. Nor is he any kind of villain, though like any of us he has his bad days.


	No, Simon, an aspiring actor played by former DC supervillain Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, is that rarest of Marvel protagonists: a totally regular person, albeit one blessed (or saddled) with unexplained hidden powers.







	
	
		
					Wonder Man		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	More human than superhuman.
	



Airdate: Tuesday, Jan. 27 (Disney+)Cast: Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Ben Kingsley, Arian Moayed, X Mayo, Zlatko BuricCreators: Destin Daniel Cretton, Andrew Guest			
			







	Perhaps this should make him less interesting than the likes of Spider-Man or Captain America, who can't seem to step outside for coffee without being whisked into one galaxy-hopping adventure or another. Simon's most dramatic chase, by contrast, is tracking a scooter-riding brat through Los Angeles gridlock. But Wonder Man turns Simon's ordinariness into its secret weapon, delivering a dramedy that's all the more charming for being so low-key.

	As the second title released under the “Marvel Spotlight” banner, following 2024's Echo, Wonder Man is a standalone affair. Well, mostly. The Disney+ series finds Simon looking for his big break, and then stumbling into an irresistible opportunity when he meets Ben Kingsley‘s Trevor Slattery — whom fans will recall as the oddball thespian revealed in 2013's Iron Man 3 to be posing as the terrorist Mandarin, though the show provides enough context for even non-fans to get up to speed. (Trevor also appeared in 2021's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, who co-created Wonder Man with Andrew Guest, but that's less relevant to the plot.)

	











	Now just a working actor like any other, Trevor tips Simon off to the auditions for Wonder Man, a remake of Simon's favorite 1980s action movie. The two couldn't be more different in temperament: Simon overthinks his roles to the point of self-sabotage; Trevor is all impulse and intuition. Simon is so reserved that even his live-in girlfriend (an egregiously underused Olivia Thirlby) has given up on him; Trevor is a kooky gadabout who'd be right at home trading druggy celebrity anecdotes with Oliver Putnam.


	They nevertheless become fast friends, drawn together by two major commonalities. The biggest is a sincere passion for their craft. These are men who bond by reciting their favorite monologues at each other, who absolutely mean it when they tell Joe “Everybody Calls Me Joey Pants” Pantoliano (in a highly amusing cameo) that acting is the “single most consequential” calling a person could possibly hope for in life. 


	Abdul-Mateen and Kingsley are adorable in their bromance, the former's combination of confidence and neediness playing against the latter's oddball sense of humor. Their chemistry, fun and fizzy with a hint of melancholy, is the main reason to watch Wonder Man — more so than any big shocking twists (there aren't any) or action thrills (there is one important fight scene in eight half-hour episodes) or weighty themes (this isn't really that kind of show).


	Trevor and Simon also share, unbeknownst to Simon, the interest of the Department of Damage Control. Desperate to fill up their new state-of-the-art prison with “enhanced individuals” in order to justify the enormous budget granted to them by the government — a situation with definitely no real-life resonance at all — they're looking to lock up any superpowered being who might possibly be conceived of as dangerous. So Simon is seen as a viable target, thanks to some vague ion-based (don't ask me) ability to blow things up, and Trevor is blackmailed by ambitious agent Cleary (Arian Moayed) into helping entrap him.

	











	To the extent that Wonder Man has a villain, it's a system that targets minority populations under the callous pretense of “security.” Simon's reality is one where studios have banned all superpowered performers following a tragic incident (dramatized in an episode-length black-and-white flashback starring Byron Bowers as DeMarr “Doorman” Davis and Josh Gad as an entertainingly douchey version of himself), and where the DODC has no qualms about detaining people who've committed no crimes. The stakes might be low in the sense that no one's trying to stop the manifestation of depression or an otherwordly entity from smiting the planet, but they're astronomical from Simon's perspective: If his secret were to come out, he could lose not just his career but his freedom.


	For most of the series, though, Simon's most pressing concerns are ones that'll be familiar to any struggling artist. He argues with an agent, Janelle (X Mayo, very funny), who's as encouraging of his talents as she is exasperated by his self-important habits. He sweats in audition rooms full of actors who are more successful or more connected. He argues with relatives who dismiss his aspirations as irresponsibility or laziness.


Wonder Man shares with other recent showbiz sendups like The Other Two or The Studio the wry amusement of creators who've clearly spent enough time in the trenches of Hollywood to know just how unglamorous it is up close — to know their way around cramped trailers and cheap apartments and self-tape studios. It does not, however, share with those shows the sharp satirical bite toward the industry in general, or the skepticism toward and critique of big-budget IP filmmaking more specifically. This is hardly surprising, given that Wonder Man hails from the money-minting Marvel machine, but it feels like a missed opportunity nonetheless.

	











	Instead, the series subverts the genre in its own characteristically unflashy way. By stripping away the epic scope and fantastical battles these superhero blockbusters have been known for, it brings to the forefront the very human drives — for approval, for connection, for meaning — that have always given Marvel movies their real magic. It's a pretty neat trick, even if it is a modest one.

Gayle Rankin and Grant O'Rourke also star as uncivilized off-the-grid siblings who resist being evicted by the Scottish Council from their island home.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	The British Isles can be treacherously vulnerable to twee overload in movies, though last year's The Ballad of Wallis Island showed that it can be avoided, remaining a minor-key charmer even while it embraced every oddball eccentricity that writer-stars Tom Basden and Tim Key could concoct. Louis Paxton's The Incomer is not so resilient. Set on an even more remote island, this one off the northeast coast of Scotland, it centers on orphaned siblings who have grown up in isolation, without the comforts of modern mainland life — in thrall to mythical seagull legends that make this abrasively unfunny comedy strictly for the birds.

	The movie's saving grace is Domhnall Gleeson as Daniel, a gentle-natured mainlander working as a land recovery coordinator for the Northeastern Scottish Council. He's an awkward outsider in the office, his moral misgivings about foreclosures and evictions, turfing people out of their lifelong homes, leading his careerist boss Roz (Michelle Gomez) to treat him like a bleeding-heart fool. He's also “a ginger” with eczema, which doesn't exactly raise his stock.

The Bottom Line

	
	A shipwreck.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (NEXT)Cast: Domhnall Gleeson, Gayle Rankin, Grant O'Rourke, Emun Elliott, Michelle Gomez, John HannahDirector-screenwriter: Louis Paxton

								1 hour 42 minutes			






	With Daniel's empathy perceived as a weakness, Gleeson makes him the ideal mediator to communicate with two people positioned even further out on the margins. Calum (Emun Elliott), the thuggish staffer usually in charge of doorstep evictions, is out of commission due to some legal strife, so Roz sends Daniel in his place to a tiny island where brother and sister Sandy (Grant O'Rourke) and Isla (Gayle Rankin) — on-the-nose names that make them seem like they belong in Bikini Bottom with Spongebob — have lived alone since their parents passed 30 years ago.

	











	Paxton makes clever use of Selina Wagner's doodling animation to pencil in the island's ancestral folklore, frequently recounted by bossy Isla to dim bulb Sandy, when she's not caw-cawing at birds like a witch. The isle belongs to the gulls, and the siblings were taught as children to defend the birds' sanctuary from “incomers,” bringing with them the decadence and deceit of the mainland. Even so, Isla jealously guards the flotsam that drifts ashore, including a bendy sex toy that they think must be a weapon of some kind. Oh, the hilarity!


	The brother and sister sustain themselves by digging up peat bog to burn in an ancient, dilapidated house with no utilities, and hunting seabirds. But it's a meager existence. “I could go for some whale blubber right now,” says hungry Sandy.


	Probably three readers at most will get this reference, but the establishing scenes on the island poked my repressed memory PTSD, hate-watching 1970s British children's fantasy TV series like Catweazle, a show about a creepy time-traveling wizard that dialed up the whimsy to 11. The movie also brought back those cringe-inducing scenes at the end of another drama set on a windblown Scottish island, The Outrun, in which Saoirse Ronan “conducts” turbulent nature with an invisible baton.


The Incomer follows similar cues. Rankin plays Isla as a shrill, feral version of Gaby Hoffman (no offense to the wonderful Gabs) given to physical violence, while O'Rourke gets to play the sweet, constipated dolt, talking wistfully of the days when his “bottom mess” flowed more freely. I'm serious. Isla also has frequent exchanges with a “fin man” (poor John Hannah), part of a mythical species of whiskered seal-like creatures that haunt the waters, bobbing up to lure land-dwellers into the murky depths.

	











	One of Isla and Sandy's preferred deterrents to keep incomers away is to dress up in home-made Wicker Man-type bird costumes and masks — which at least gets them out of their hideous knitwear. If their hostile squawking doesn't work, they take up primitive weapons. Daniel is greeted with a rock to the head and then dangled over a cliff. But he saves himself by telling Isla and Sandy he's a wizard (like Catweazle!), snapping a photo of them on his cellphone and threatening to use it to delete their souls.


	What follows is a predictable détente during which Daniel paints a rosy picture of relocation to a comfortable home and easier lives on the mainland. Given that stories are Isla and Sandy's chief currency, he also entertains them by taking ownership of Tolkien and recasting himself as Gandalf.


	Romantic complications ensue when time spent with Daniel sparks impulses that the siblings don't know what to do with, beyond roping him into a gull initiation ceremony. And violence intrudes when Roz grows impatient for results and deploys hotheaded Calum to clean up the mess.


	But this is designed to be a heartwarming comedy and debuting feature director Paxton is more assured with the outcome than he is about getting there. Some actual funny gags in the late action — a queer awakening avec bear; a hard headbutt when Daniel moves in for a kiss, confusing Isla — hint at what the story could have been with a less cutesy touch.


	Almost in spite of its full-scale charm offensive — the score's plucky strings and horns really are a bit much — The Incomer acquires poignancy through Gleeson's playful, unassuming performance. Watching Daniel stand up to Roz is a victory for social justice in a rapacious modern world, while the fear of change embodied by Isla and Sandy ultimately is quite touching. While I found the movie a mostly annoying guano pileup, some no doubt will respond more receptively to its quirky exploration of human connection.

The executive has overseen such soundtracks as Barbie The Album, Twisters The Album and The Greatest Showman.

Kevin Weaver has been promoted to president of Atlantic Music Group (AMG), rising from president of Atlantic Records, West Coast.


	Weaver, who has been part of the executive leadership team formed in 2024, will continue to report to AMG CEO Elliot Grainge and will oversee opportunities spanning across soundtracks, strategic partnerships and gaming initiatives, as well as helm sync licensing and brand alignments for Atlantic Records, 300 Entertainment and 10K projects.


	Under Weaver's tenure, Atlantic has curated and released some of the most culturally relevant and successful soundtracks of the last several years, including Barbie The Album, Twisters The Album, The Greatest Showman, Suicide Squad The Album, F7 and, most recently, F1: The Album.


	“Kevin has spearheaded a remarkable series of era-defining projects, creating powerful opportunities for Atlantic's artists while helping make the label the go-to partner for creators and brands looking to make an impact,” Grainge said in a statement. “With him now stepping into this central role, all of Atlantic Music Group will benefit from his unrivaled expertise, relationships, and passion.  [COO] Zach [Friedman], [GM] Tony [Talamo], and I are proud to appoint him to this well-deserved new post.”


	Weaver joined Atlantic Records in 1994 and has held a number of positions including executive vp, president of film & television, and, most recently, president, west coast since 2017, as he helped expand the label's bicoastal footprint.


	He has received two Grammy Awards as album producer in the best compilation soundtrack for visual media for Boardwalk Empire and Barbie The Album. He's worked on a number of other Grammy-nominated albums, including for Daisy Jones & The Six, True Blood, Vinyl and Girls.


	“Atlantic has been my home for three decades, and the opportunity to continue helping define the legacy of this extraordinary company and its artists is incredibly meaningful to me,” Weaver said in a statement. “I'm deeply grateful to Elliot, Zach and Tony for their trust and support, and I'm excited to continue helping shape the future of AMG alongside such a committed and talented group of leaders. We have a truly unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to keep pushing boundaries and creating new opportunities for our artists, and I couldn't be more excited about the future of AMG.”

He also said that instead of feather boas, he wants his fans to show up to his tour in their dancing shoes.

Harry Styles' new album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, is coming this spring — but will there be any featured artists joining him on the dance floor?


	According to the British pop star, no. In an interview with Capital Breakfast on Friday (Jan. 23), Styles managed fan expectations by revealing that — like all three of his prior solo albums — HS4 won't include any special guests. “There are no collabs on this album,” he said, choosing not to beat around the bush when asked about it point-blank. 

	











	He added with a shy grin, “Just me.”


	The musician's answer may not come as a surprise, as Styles has never been one for including duets on his albums. His 2017 self-titled debut, 2019's Fine Line and 2022's Harry's House were all strictly solo works, and all of them reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200. 


	The interview comes hours after the release of Styles' first single in years, “Aperture.” The house-inspired track marks the first taste fans are getting of Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, which is due out March 6.


	Elsewhere in the interview, the One Direction alum spoke about having to “fall in love with music all over again” during his three-year break from the spotlight after feeling burned out from his Love On Tour, as well as gushed about his lifelong love of Shania Twain, who will be joining him on a few dates of his recently announced Together, Together tour.












	And while Styles' fans have shown up to his shows in sparkles and feather boas in the past, the Grammy winner told Capital Breakfast that this time around, “I just want them to come ready to dance.” 


	“I want them to come ready to be with their friends, close their eyes, open their eyes, dance, let it go and be whatever and whoever they are in that moment,” he said. “And I think it's going to be fun and I'll be right there with them.”

The track is the lead single from the star's upcoming album Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally.

Harry Styles‘ music and his fans belong together, and for the first time in years — with the release of new song “Aperture” on Thursday (Jan. 22) — they finally reunite.


	Arriving a few weeks ahead of the singer's fourth solo album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, “Aperture” finds Styles crooning over an electric beat produced by Kid Harpoon. It marks the first step in a new era that's already defined by romance, dancing and whimsy, which the One Direction alum kicked off earlier in January with the launch of his WeBelongTogether.co.

	











	The website preceded the announcement of Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally on Jan. 15, at which time he unveiled the release date (March 6) and cover art (a slightly out-of-focus photo of Styles at a dance party near dark woods) on Instagram. At this time, fans don't know much about the full-length, other than it including 12 tracks worked on by Kid Harpoon — but “Aperture” marks their first taste of Styles' next phase.


	Two months after Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally arrives, the Brit will embark on a series of residencies in seven different cities, starting May 16 with five performances in Amsterdam. After stops in London, São Paulo and Mexico City, Styles will set up shop for an eye-popping 30 shows in New York City's Madison Square Garden, where a banner celebrating his numerous 2022 Love On Tour shows in the famed venue already hangs. After NYC, Styles will close out the trek in Australia in late November, early December.

	











	The hitmaker last dropped an album in 2022, when Harry's House spent two weeks atop the Billboard 200. His first two albums also debuted at No. 1 on the chart. Harry's House won the album of the year Grammy in 2023 and housed the 15-week Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 “As It Was.”

The nominees -- also including Nicholas Pike and Max Richter -- share their reactions to being nominated with Billboard.

	Melinda Newman



	For Diane Warren, the 17th time may be the charm for taking home her first Oscar, while The National's Bryce Dessner and composers Nicholas Pike and Max Richter are all celebrating their first nominations. For two time-Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat, it's a chance to add another trophy.


	They all may have approached writing for their nominated projects differently, but on Thursday (Jan. 22), the original score and original song honorees are all united on feeling the joy of hearing their name called when the 2026 Oscar nominations were announced at 8:30 a.m. ET this morning.

	











Billboard talked to a number of the nominees shortly after they learned of their nominations. Below are condensed highlights from the interviews.


	Clint Bentley's Train Dreams is such a minimalist film with the emphasis on the cinematography and small acting ensemble that the director and the film's composer, The National's Bryce Dessner, questioned if it even needed a song, but the pair ultimately decided it did. “It felt like [the song] had to kind of walk a careful line of feeling part of the film, which feels so closely related to the book, and this universe in which it lives,” says Dessner.




	Nick Cave was Bentley's first choice to write the lyrics and perform the song. “He's obviously a huge hero of mine, of my band, and someone we've listened to forever,” Dessner says. “It was not something I had imagined doing because how would we get to him?” But it turns out Cave was a huge fan of the book the movie is based on. “[Nick] called me and just said, ‘Look, I really want this to feel part of the world you created. Can you send me some music to work with? I sent him a piece that then he was able to write over and that's how it happened. Sometimes beautiful profound things are fairly effortless. I think that, basically, Nick had a dream, woke up and wrote the lyrics. It just came together quite quickly. A couple days [later] in the studio he asked me if I had any notes. I said, ‘Don't change a thing.'”


	Dessner says he and Cave have no future plans to work together, though he would be open to it. “This is just such a joy,” he says. “Having my name on an Oscar nomination with Nick is such a big honor.”


	Desplat considers Frankenstein the “third movement of the triptych” with director Guillermo Del Toro, following Pinocchio and The Shape of Water. “They are all about the creatures and being able to receive love to give love and create empathy, so there's some kind of line going through these three scores and these three movies. Each time it's how do you bring the audience to understand and love the creature?”


	To represent humanity, Desplat chose “the smallest, tiniest, most beautiful and most difficult instrument, which is the violin,” which plays as the movie opens and creates the sound of the creature for the film. “Of course, it will get bigger and operatic and huge with a symphonic choir but keeps going back and forth between this very intimate, gentle sound and the huge symphonic sound.”  Desplat and Del Toro had decided on the solo violin motif long before shooting for the movie even began. “We wanted the avoid the obvious, avoid the horror film, avoid the scary and we knew that we needed to be touched, moved by the creature. Very early on, we spoke about using a string instrument because the creature is a huge thing and we need to have a counterpoint with this instrument.”

	











	Over the course of their work together, the two have developed complete trust. “Guillermo likes music in cinema and that makes a huge difference because when the composer comes near him, he allows him to do whatever he wants as long as it brings the dramaturgy and the characters int a wider level of emotion. And so, it's really a flawless [process.]”


	With 12 nominations and two wins, Desplat says it is still a thrill to be nominated. “It's fabulous!,” he says. “It's amazing each time. I'm so grateful.”


	Writing an aria for the closing of Viva Verdi!, an independent documentary that shines a light on the elderly opera singers and musicians who live in Milan's Casa Verdi retirement home (built by the composer in 1896) and mentor young music students, opened up a whole new path for Pike. “I can't say I was a huge opera fan or going to the opera all the time,” he says before writing the song, but he found the process so enjoyable, he has written more arias for upcoming films and is now entertaining the idea of writing an opera that could hopefully appeal to a  younger audience to “This is a passion of mine at the moment,” he says, adding the film “really brought all that to life. Ideally, I would get a commission of some sort.”


	Pike, who also scored the documentary, wrote “Sweet Dreams of Joy” based on a 12-minute snippet of the film sent to him by producer Christine La Monte. “It was so inspiring, it was so full of humanity and music and energy, that I literally walked over to the piano and wrote the piece without any thought of would it end up in the film,” he says. “It was just so moving I had to write the piece. The lyrics took me a little longer to finesse them, but, really, it was just pure inspiration.”

	











	Soprano Ava Maria Martinez sang the aria after the original singer came down with bronchitis. After the singer fell ill, Pike says he was “complaining bitterly” to his engineer who suggested Martinez who had worked with her for series Mozart in the Jungle. It went so well that Pike pledged to her that “I wasn't going to rest until you're singing on the Oscars stage.”


	For Richter, his score to the Golden Globe winner for best motion picture-drama had to coordinate with the natural elements of the film. “The voice of the forest and of the earth, they're really a big part of the overall texture of the film,” he says. “It was almost like a conversation between those natural sounds and the score and dialogue. It was like trying to find very, very minimal kinds of ways for the music, just to kind of make things glow just a little bit.”


	The Chloe Zhao-directed movie looks at William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes' courtship, marriage and subsequent loss of a child that leads Shakespeare to write Hamlet.


	Richter was deliberately “very sparing” in his musical choices to let the “powerful, very emotional material speak on its own terms without trying to direct us as the audience in any particular way.” He also brought in renowned Renaissance choir, Tenebrae, “but I transformed those vocal recordings in the computer into a sort of haunted, ghostly version of those vocals.” He also used Elizabethan string instruments in keeping with the period, but “we hear them as altered, refracted ghostly versions of themselves.”


	For all the dark topics Hamnet addresses, Richter says working on the movie was nothing but a joyous experience. “It really is a special project to me because very often you may work on a film and the film will turn out great, but the project was a nightmare, right? That was not the case with Hamnet. The vibes on that set were just amazing.”

	











	Out of all the songs that Warren has written for films, “Dear Me” included a first: “I've never written a song about myself,” she says.


	“Dear Me,” the hopeful, inspiring end-title song performed by Kesha that accompanies the documentary about the 17-time Oscar-nominated songwriter, draws from what Warren would tell her younger self.


	“I was a lonely, misunderstood, bullied kid that spent a lot of time in my room by myself when I wasn't being kicked out of school or things like that,” she says. “What I wanted to do was tell that young girl sitting in a room and picking up a guitar and maybe writing her first song that, ‘Hey, you know what? You're going to be OK. You don't know it now, but you're going to be all right.'”


	Warren's most personal song turned out to be her most universal. “It's resonated with so many people because we all have that kid inside us,” she says. Even the third graders who came into her studio to sing on it related to the message, she says. “They said, ‘This song is giving me hope. This is making me tell myself it's going to be OK.'”


	Kesha was her first choice to sing the song as she “cast” the role. “They have to be authentic to the movie and to the song. You have to have both,” she said. “I've known Kesha for a while and I'm so aware she's an amazing singer. I also knew she's gone through a lot of stuff so I knew it would resonate with her. She came to my studio and was crying when she heard it and that's how I knew. There was no other choice.”


	Warren is behind only Sammy Cahn and Johnny Mercer in receiving the most nominations in the best song category. “That makes me feel pretty cool,” she says. “They've won a couple of those, right?” The answer is yes, with Warren hoping 17 is her lucky number to finally take home a trophy. “I'm not gonna lie and say I wouldn't like to win, especially with this song from this movie. Who knows, right?”

Styles appeared on BBC Radio 1's Breakfast show to discuss his comeback song ""Aperture"" and hitting the road.

	Thomas Smith



Harry Styles is officially back. On Thursday (Jan. 23) the British pop star announced his Together, Together global residency tour, and shared new single “Aperture,” the first to be taken from his upcoming album Kiss All The Time. Disco, Occasionally.

	On Friday morning, Jan. 23, he followed the reveal with his first interview of the new era on BBC Radio 1's breakfast show with Greg James. During the 10-minute conversation, Styles discussed the inspiration behind the new song, the album's playful title and how ended up amongst the crowds in Rome to see the reveal of Pope Leo XIV back in May.

	Speaking to James, Styles said that “Aperture,” a five-minute electronic-inspired banger, was influenced by his time away from performing. He said the song, produced with longtime collaborator Kid Harpoon, was the last track completed for the LP, due for release on March 6. 


	“It was amazing for me. We had most of the album done and a lot of it was exploring the themes that the song is exploring. Getting this song at the end of the process when we were feeling the freest and having a lot of fun… and it felt like the mission statement of what the album was about.”

	











	“I'd had a couple years away from work stuff and a lot of big realizations about generally opening up more to the world and allowing some more positive things to come into my life. It was the culmination of all that was happening around me making this record. [“Aperture”] was like a perfect little bow, and once this song happened it was like ‘oh, the record's finished.'”


	He added that the song was influenced by “classic pop songwriting” but picked out LCD Soundsystem and English post-punk band The Durutti Column as additional inspirations for the sonic departure.


	“I saw [LCD Soundsystem] at a festival in Madrid, then saw them again at Brixton [Academy, London]. It was so joyous watching them be immersed in it. The inspiration from watching [LCD Soundsystem] and realizing ‘that's how I want to feel when I'm on stage,' and it matched the music I was making.”


	Styles last performed live in 2023 in Bologna, Italy after 169 dates on the Love On Tour run. Returning to being an audience member and “getting out into the world” is what inspired him during the recording process.


	“The most important thing was about getting on the other side of the audience experience. Having so many years being on stage, the last couple years allowed me to be a real audience member and be in the crowd and have a reminder of ‘oh this is why this is special to people and this is why this feels so good.'”


	When asked by James if going incognito at concerts was easy, Styles replied: “Yeah, when it's dark enough and music is loud enough it's quite easy actually.”

	











	James then questioned Styles on the LP's title – Kiss All The Time. Disco, Occasionally – and the semantic implications. “You could say it's like ‘drink water all the time. But you're gonna have to pee occasionally,” Styles said. “You can have a break from kissing, but you could also drink water while you're peeing. It's kind of optional. The idea is that you can take a break from kissing to disco.”


	Since the conclusion of his tour in 2023, Styles has been spotted by fans on a number of “side quests,” such as attending Glastonbury Festival, attempting to help a fan parallel park their Fiat 500, (“The space was too small. It wasn't going in there”) and popping up in St. Peter's Square in the Vatican City when Pope Leo XIV – the first pope to be born in North America – was revealed to the world in May 2025.


	“I was getting a haircut in Rome and then I heard all these people start shouting ‘Habemus Papam!' [‘We have a pope'] and people running down the street. The guy who was cutting my hair was like ‘Habemus Papam!,' but then he finished up and then I was like ‘oh I'm like 5 minutes walk from there' so I just walked over there. It was wild.'


	Styles' Together, Together tour kicks off on May 17 at Amsterdam's Johan Cruyff Arena, before heading to London's Wembley Stadium for six nights. Further stops will take him to São Paulo and Mexico City before a 30-night stint at NYC's Madison Square Garden. The tour concludes with shows in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia on Dec. 13.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: The Walking Dead star Ross Marquand (who plays Aaron in the hit AMC series) is leading horror-thriller Unknown Company, which has wrapped production and is now moving into post-production. 


	Set in the final days of World War II, the film follows a small unit of American soldiers sent behind enemy lines to locate the wreckage of an unidentified object. The mission quickly becomes a psychological and moral reckoning, forcing the men to confront fear, loyalty, and the consequences of the unknown. Above and below are first-look stills.


	Directed and produced by Vincent Talenti (Transformers: War for Cybertron) and written by Gavin Hignight (Gundam: Requiem for Vengeance), the film also stars Hugh Scott (Deadpool), Zak Steiner (Euphoria), Mace Coronel (That '90s Show), and Kevin Brooks (Glowzies), with Sarah Hay (Flesh and Bone) and Nolan North (Uncharted).

EXCLUSIVE: Netflix‘s Korean content craze has helped the streamer to more than four billion views, with demand going far deeper than Squid Game.


	A Deadline analysis can reveal that Korean-language titles across film and TV have amassed at least 4.5BN streams since Netflix first started publishing views in What We Watched reports from July 2023.


	Unsurprisingly, Squid Game has led the charge, with two new seasons dropping over the past two-and-a-half years, cementing its status as a true phenomenon on Netflix. Other notable titles include disaster movie The Great Flood, which has become a breakout hit since debuting last month.

	Season 2 of the Squid Game franchise has recorded 220.9M streams since its premiere in December 2024, making it the most-watched TV show on Netflix during that time.




			Watch on Deadline		







Squid Game Season 3 has delivered 150M views since June last year, making it the third highest-rated show on Netflix. Even Season 1, which premiered in 2021, has 97M views in the past couple of years.


	Put together, all three seasons account for nearly half-a-billion views, but other titles have also struck a chord with Netflix's 300M-plus subscribers, even if they had not had the same attention.


King the Land, a romantic drama series about the heir of a luxury hotel group thrown into an inheritance war, was the next biggest Korean series on Netflix after Squid Game.


	Featuring K-pop stars Lee Jun-ho and Lim Yoon, the 2023 series originally screened on Korean network JTBC, but has since checked in 64.7M views for Netflix.

	











	This put it in the top 100 series on Netflix over the past two-and-a-half years, placing it ahead of splashy English-language originals like the final season of The Crown and Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.


	Other hit Korean series include True Beauty (47M streams), My Demon (45.8M), and Queen of Tears (44.6M), all of which featured in Netflix's top 150 shows. Below is the top 10 Korean series.


Netflix committed to investing $2.5BN in Korean originals in 2023 — and the strategy is delivering results. When Life Gives You Tangerines and The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call, which both premiered in the first quarter of 2025, were among the top 10. The Trauma Code has reportedly been renewed for two more seasons. 


	One original series that is confirmed to return is All of Us Are Dead, which has registered 31.5M views since July 2023, an impressive return given it originally premiered in January 2022.


	Over in movies, the top Korean title was 2024's Badland Hunters, an original Netflix production about a group of Seoul earthquake survivors in an orderless wasteland. Badland Hunters has recorded 73.9M views since its debut, putting it 108th Netflix's top films since mid-2023, when it began publishing What We Watched reports in their current form.


	The next biggest Korean film was The Great Flood, another Netflix original, which has made waves with 66.1M views after only being released on December 19. Set on the last day of Earth, it tells the story of a desperate fight to save a child from an apartment after a great flood has swept the planet. Below is the top 10 Korean films.


	Netflix is planning to launch well over 30 Korean originals in 2026, with K-content chief Don Kang saying that more than 210 Korean titles have been ranked in the global top ten over the past five years.

	With Oscar nominations and a couple of Golden Globe awards, the KPop Demon Hunters phenomenon is now well and truly established. But even so, the ratings Demon Hunters has put up for Netflix continue to stun.


As Deadline's Katie Campione noted, the animated movie became Netflix's most-watched title ever over a six-month period, according to the streamer's latest What We Watched report.


KPop Demon Hunters amassed 482M views between July and the end of December, but this does not include the 36.7M streams it recorded in the 10 days after its release on June 20, 2025.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In total, the Sony Pictures Animation title has 518.2M views on Netflix. That's right, more than half-a-billion views in around six months.

	











	To put this into some context, it's worth looking at how KPop Demon Hunters has performed since Netflix first started publishing views in What We Watched reports from July 2023.


	Over that two-and-a-half year period, Demon Hunters has more than double the number of streams of any other title on Netflix. 


The Super Mario Bros. Movie was the second biggest film during that time with 241M views. The biggest TV show was Squid Game Season 2 with 220.9M streams.


	Below is the chart showing how KPop Demon Hunters is on a summit all of its own.

					By Tom Tapp 

Deputy Managing Editor


	Deadline called Oscar winning director James L. Brooks‘ return to character-driven movie comedy, Ella McKay, a “smart, funny and surprisingly timely film set in the world of American politics centered on an idealistic, issue-driven woman.”


	Disney released the 20th Century Studios production wide in theaters last month and it failed to find an audience. Hopefully, that will not be the case when it hits Disney+ on February 5.


	As the writer-director of Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News and As Good as It Gets and the creator of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Brooks knows how to tell women's stories onscreen. 

	











	Billed as a “fresh and heartwarming comedy is about the people you love and how to survive them,” Ella McCay stars standout French-British actress Emma Mackey (Sex Education) as an idealistic young woman juggling her less-than-perfect family with her passion for her work. The stakes increase as her star rises, working as chief of staff to the Mayor and then as the super-smart lieutenant governor Governor Bill (Albert Brooks).




			Watch on Deadline		







	Curtis steals scenes as Ella's faithful Aunt Helen, who helps anchor the film. The other scene stealer is Broadcast News alum Brooks. He hits just the right notes as the practical, retail-politics-loving governor who wants Ella to succeed, but in far more realistic ways than she can deal with.


	The film also stars Jack Lowden, Kumail Nanjiani, Ayo Edebiri, Spike Fearn, Rebecca Hall, Julie Kavner, Becky Ann Baker, Joey Brooks and Woody Harrelson. 


	It is produced by James L. Brooks, p.g.a.; Richard Sakai, p.g.a.; Julie Ansell, p.g.a. and Jennifer Brooks.


	After a long stint producing movies such as The Edge of Seventeen and Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret as well as long-standing series work on The Simpsons, Brooks felt the need to channel his energy into writing an original story again. It's his first feature directing outing in 15 years.


	“My goal for this movie was to pay tribute, as best I could, to the golden age of movie comedy, the 1940s and 50s…the challenge all along was to maintain the same zany spirit of that era, while still taking seriously the inevitable jolts, pains and pitfalls of being human,” Brooks explains. 

	











	You can watch a new trailer below.

Jameela Jamil defended her feminist views after calling Blake Lively a “suicide bomber” and “villain” in a series of texts.

The “Good Place” alum, 39, took to Instagram Stories on Thursday to address her texts with Justin Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, which were uncovered in recently unsealed court documents.

“Guys, feminism means fighting for the political, social and economic equity for women. Just gender equity,” Jamil said in a video, per The Hollywood Reporter. 

“It does not mean you have to like every single woman. It doesn't mean you have to be friends with every single woman. It means you can actually beef with other women. You can criticize them. You can do whatever you want, as long as you are also fighting for their human right to the same things that men have in this world.”

The self-proclaimed feminist and activist continued, “That's all feminism is. It's a moral and political stance. It is not a sleepover where we braid each other's pubes, OK? So if you are fighting for women's rights, but you don't get along with every single woman, it doesn't make you a bad feminist.”

Although she did not name-drop Lively in her Story, her comments came shortly after the DailyMail exposed her texts with Abel.

In the August 2024 exchange, Jameel and the PR strategist were reacting to a TikTok video about Lively's allegedly “tone-deaf” promotion of the film. 

At the time, the “Gossip Girl” alum had been accused of promoting her haircare line and talking about her fashion instead of the film's serious theme of domestic violence.

“I want to officially incorporate nightmare c–t and demon c–t into my vocabulary; UNBELIEVABLE; She's doing this to herself,” Abel texted Jamil, who is also her client, about Lively.

Jamil curtly replied, “She's a suicide bomber at this point.”

Later in their conversation, Abel expressed that she hated Lively “so much,” to which Jamil agreed.

“I've never seen such a bizarre villain act before,” the “She-Hulk” actress texted. “She's Over over.”

A source close to the matter exclusively told Page Six Thursday that Jamil's comments were “disappointing.”

“It's disappointing that instead of listening to women when they speak out, other women call them names,” the insider said.

Rumors of Lively and Baldoni's feud sparked in August 2024 after their movie, “It Ends With Us,” premiered in New York City.

By December, Lively filed an official complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of sexually harassing her on set, before officially suing him. The 41-year-old has repeatedly denied the claims.

The “Jane the Virgin” star reacted with a $400 million countersuit, accusing Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, of defamation. 

He also sued the New York Times for libel after the outlet reported on Lively's lawsuit.

This past summer, a judge dismissed both of Baldoni's countersuits; however, Lively's legal battle against the actor is still ongoing.

Jennifer Lopez looked glamorous in a plunging black dress during a shopping trip in Beverly Hills, Calif.

The actress, 56, was photographed browsing inside luxury vintage boutique What Goes Around Comes Around while rocking a maxi dress that showed some cleavage.

Lopez looked sensational showing off her physique in the chic style choice, putting her hair in a simple ponytail to highlight the low-cut neckline.

The daring dress also showed off her toned back.

She completed her look with a pair of dangling earrings.

Lopez was later photographed getting into her car, wearing a herringbone blazer over her dress and enjoying a beverage.

While What Goes Around Comes Around is technically a thrift store, it's extremely high-end — the shop specializes in designer vintage fashion, including handbags, accessories and apparel that's authenticated and curated.

On Tuesday, Lopez was photographed generously giving cash to a homeless man in Los Angeles.

The “Kiss of the Spider Woman” star, who was carrying a nearly $80,000 Hermès Kelly crocodile handbag at the time, handed over the money after the man pleaded his “love” for her.

In turn, the man was grateful for the gift, telling her afterwards, “Jennifer, I love you. Thank you, Jennifer.”

Lopez's presence at the 2026 Golden Globes last week didn't garner nearly as positive a reaction due to her awkward interaction with Glambot director Cole Walliser.

In a video Walliser posted on Instagram that went viral, Lopez posed for the Glambot but didn't acknowledge him as he spoke to her.

Walliser later defended Lopez in a follow-up video.

“I didn't take it personally. It didn't feel rude in that moment,” the Canadian filmmaker said.

“One, she's just down to business. The carpet was closed,” he explained. “She's ready to go inside. She knew what she was gonna do. She got into the position.”

Walliser said it was “just unfortunate” that Lopez happened to be “facing away” from him in the moment.

“I knew she was getting ready. I knew it was late,” he said. “We were just getting through it. That moment didn't feel rude.”

Jana marked the mid-point the following month, writing, “Halfway through pregnancy and I'm still in awe! It sure has flown by! I love feeling those tiny kicks these days!”

Romeo Beckham appeared to be in a good mood while in Paris with his girlfriend, despite his family rift with older brother, Brooklyn, dominating headlines.

The model, 23, was photographed holding hands in the city with Kim Turnball Thursday. The couple attended the Costes party as part of Paris Fashion Week.

Romeo — who sported bleached hair, a white long-sleeved T-shirt and baggy brown pants — flashed a smile in the pics. He also rocked a red plaid scarf, which he wore on top of his head.

Turnball looked chic in jeans, a black top and a sherpa coat. The DJ and model styled her hair in a slicked-back ponytail.

Romeo and Turnball rekindled their romance late last year after they previously broke up in June 2025 after seven months of dating.

The news came amid reports that Romeo and Brooklyn had fallen out over Turnbull, claiming Brooklyn previously had a romantic connection with her — but sources told Page Six that wasn't true.

“It's just an excuse to find an argument,” the source said, calling the rumors about the brothers “nonsense.”

Turnbull later shut down the rumors herself in an Instagram Story, stating that she and Brooklyn, 26, “have never been romantically involved in ANY capacity at ANY point.”

“Nothing between us has occurred further than a school friendship at age 16,” she claimed. “I would like to remove myself from the ongoing conversation & set the record straight for the sake of everyone involved.”

Meanwhile, Romeo has yet to comment on Brooklyn's scathing Instagram post against their parents, David and Victoria Beckham.

In the stunning attack — which Brooklyn shared via Instagram Stories on Jan. 19 — he accused his parents of “endlessly” attempting to “ruin” his and his wife, Nicola Peltz's, relationship and accused his mom of dancing “inappropriately” with him at his 2022 wedding.

“I do not want to reconcile with my family,” Brooklyn wrote in part. “I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life. For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family.”

“For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family [with] performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships,” he continued. “Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade.”

Much like Romeo, Victoria and David's youngest son, 20-year-old Cruz Beckham, appears to be taking the drama in stride.

He recently “liked” a video poking fun of Victoria's alleged “inappropriate” dancing at Brooklyn's wedding on Instagram.

As for Brooklyn, he and Nicola put on a united front in their first public sighting since going nuclear on his parents, showing PDA while walking their dog in Malibu, Calif.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","CBS renews a big ol' boatload of shows","https://www.avclub.com/cbs-renews-10-shows-matlock-elsbeth-tracker-ncis","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 02:05:48 GMT","

The world may feel chaotic, dynamic, and full of the terrifying specter of change, but don't worry, folks: CBS refuses to be. (Unless you look at its news coverage. Don't look directly at CBS News.) Variety reports that the network has gone “Ain't broke, don't fix” on a whole bushel of its scripted (and an unsurprising smidgen of unscripted) programming today, handing down fully 10 renewal orders to its slate of existing shows.

It feels worth noting that the shows in question have all been around for at least two seasons at this point; there's something mildly amusing in the fact that one of the youngest series to get the green light in this frenzy of approval is Kathy Bates' Matlock, which is getting a third season. Ditto Young Sheldon spin-off Georgie And Mandy's First Marriage and NCIS: Origins, the show that dares to ask: What naval crimes were happening in the not-actually-all-that-distant past? (Modern maritime shenanigans, meanwhile, will continue to be covered by the flagship show, now set for its 24th season, or, if they're in the Southern Hemisphere, NCIS: Sydney, clocking in at 4.) To round out the avalanche of procedurals, Tracker and Elsbeth have both been renewed for fourth seasons, too, with Fire Country (which joins its already-renewed, irritatingly named spin-off, Sheriff Country) has been picked up for number 5. And The Amazing Race and Survivor remain fundamentally unkillable, having been renewed for seasons 39 and 51, respectively.

In case you're both extremely well-versed in CBS's current slate of shows, and also running the process of elimination right now, you'll know that leaves exactly two current CBS primetime shows on the bubble: “What if House also had a lot of Sherlock Holmes shit in it?” series Watson, and first-season sitcom DMV. (The Neighborhood has already been canceled, while FBI, Ghosts, and Boston Blue picked up renewals previously.) There's also a small crop of actual new shows coming in, wonder of wonders, including legal drama Cupertino from Evil‘s Robert and Michell King and Mike Colter, and Einstein, the TV show about Albert Einstein's genius descendant working with the police to solve crimes—because the more things change, the more CBS remains determined to stay exactly what it is.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","TikTok has finally managed to sell itself [UPDATED]","https://www.avclub.com/tiktok-deal-finally-going-through","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:45:51 GMT","

Update, 1/22/2026 at 9:15 p.m.: Variety reports that the TikTok sale has finally officially gone through, with the new company formally named the highly elegant “TikTok USDS Joint Venture.” The new version of the company will continue to operate with global TikTok—meaning you'll still able to see, and be seen by, users in other countries—but with an intent to “retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data.” Also, “the content recommendation algorithm will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment.” (Because nothing makes us feel safe like Larry Ellison and Abu Dhabi AI investors getting more access to our data—but so it goes.) Adam Presser, a former Warner Bros. executive who's spent the last several years as head of operations and trust and safety for TikTok, has been named CEO of the newly formed joint venture.

Original story: After years of wrangling, international diplomacy, and a seemingly endless parade of billionaire buddies of the current White House lining up to get a piece of young peoples' eyes, thumbs, and brains, it's sounding like the deal for American investors to (mostly) buy social media site TikTok may finally be going through. This is per a new piece in Semafor, which reports that the deal for TikTok's U.S. operations to be sold by Chinese owner ByteDance—an issue originally raised during the first Trump administration over concerns about data security, and then signed into law in the sundown days of the Biden administration—is apparently set to close some time this week. If it does, it'll end a saga that's extended to brief shutdowns of the service, executive orders delaying enforcement of the ban, and the potential imperiling of like 8 million videos where a Level 101 improv student reacts to another “character” that's just them in a hat, shot from a slightly different angle.

The Semafor report includes a rundown of who will allegedly be owning U.S. TikTok once the sale goes through, a number that sees ByteDance itself maintain a legally safe 19.9 percent interest, while 15 percent stakes go to Larry Ellison's Oracle, massive private equity firm Silver Lake, and MGX, an AI-focused firm owned by the UAE government. (Other investors pulled from the various shining minds of the billionaire class have lined up to carve up and gobble down the other 35 percent.)

What's not entirely clear yet is how much money is changing hands over the deal, although it's likely in the ballpark of the formal economic measurement unit known as the “fuck-ton.” (J.D. Vance said late last year that the deal values TikTok at $14 billion, so some simple division and subtraction suggests the company will be well-compensated for its loss.) Previous statements from ByteDance have asserted that the new American TikTok will be responsible for its own data protection and other security, and “governed by a new seven-member majority-American board of directors.” The deal had been waiting on regulators in both the United States and China to sign off on terms; neither government has officially commented yet, but news that the deal is moving forward suggests regulatory concerns have been overcome.

While the general way Nihon Falcom's Trails games work has been pretty set in stone for a while—take jobs to help people out, learn about the world and those people and the problems of both while you do it, see the overall narrative progress as villains swoop in to do their thing—the longtime RPG developer still likes to play with structure. 

Last year's The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II instituted a rewind feature for Van Arkride and his Arkride Solutions crew that had you replaying sections of the game in order to avoid failure, injury, or even character death that had been baked into the narrative. Trails Into Reverie split the game up not just into acts with an intermission, as is the usual setup, but also broke you into separate paths with different parties, all converging on the same spot eventually and occasionally interacting with each other, sometimes without even knowing this was happening. And then there was Trails In The Sky The 3rd, a game that did away with the openness and the jobs of the first two games in the series in favor of a highly experimental setup based on memories and the experiences of the characters in your party, as everyone trapped in an alternate dimension was forced to look inward to fight the figurative and literal demons that manifested from it.

The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon is effectively Daybreak III despite the naming convention, as it's the third game in the Calvardian portion of the saga—the latest country in the continent of Zemuria for Falcom to zoom in on. It plays nearly exactly like its predecessors, only now Falcom has added even more bells and whistles to the action-oriented “Field” combat that lets you, without pause, fight enemies in an action RPG style instead of in a turn-based format, if you so choose: you can now briefly slow down time to deliver a series of big hits in a row to stronger foes and larger groups of enemies so that these action-oriented battles go by more quickly, and there's also a charge meter that lets you deliver devastating, powerful blows to rip through even the game's “A-level” monster threats. In the “Command” battles—the turn-based ones—you can now use some of your built-up ability meter to set yourself up for back-to-back turns by a single character, and there are additional support opportunities from allies who aren't in your party to extend combos and dish out more damage per turn. Otherwise? It's more Daybreak, which is also the setup that the recent remake of Trails In The Sky FC is based on. If those games felt good in your hands, then this one will, too.

Trails Beyond The Horizon, of course, would share DNA with the preceding Daybreak games, in cast and in location and in general gameplay, but Trails Into Reverie and Trails In The Sky The 3rd get more than just a little shine and callbacks here, as well, in terms of structure and themes. Trails Beyond The Horizon borrows the multi-party, multi-path structure of Reverie, and brings back Sky The 3rd's protagonist, the “Heretic Hunter” Kevin Graham, as well as his struggles with being a cleaner for the exceptionally powerful and seemingly all-knowing Septian Church. Trails Beyond The Horizon also gleefully borrows the penchant of both games to turn previous villains into uneasy, unlikely allies in the present in a way that lets you get a better sense of who they are and how they can be different—a perfect fit for the Trails subseries that focuses on those characters who straddle the line between lawful and chaotic, who live in the gray by choice or because society has forced that upon them.



What results is a game that is not just about building relationships in the way previous Trails games—especially the Daybreaks—have been, even and especially when the pairings seemed unlikely, but is also about testing those relationships when it turns out that the goals of the characters might not align. There's a tension in the game nearly from the start when it becomes clear that everyone has their own agendas that they are unwilling to share for one reason or another—because a character or group likes to hold their cards close to the chest in general, because they are from another country and are wary of spilling secrets to a now-ally but former foe, or because a certain protagonist is hiding things from everyone, even their closest confidants and established allies. There's an unease to it for you, the player, since you're aware of the personalities and motivations of all these characters, who you've grown accustomed to liking and appreciating, and who now might very well be in conflict with each other. 

It's all told in an exceptional fashion that will have you guessing even when you think you know what's going on or why any decision is made by the characters in question. Trails Beyond The Horizon is a 70-hour game that feels much, much denser than that, one that keeps piling new twists and realizations on top without those moments ever feeling forced, because they have been earned over the course of not just this subseries' three games, but over the 13 that make up Trails as a whole.

Trails Through Daybreak II concerned itself with the personal more than with an arc that pushed the overall narrative of the series; it excelled at both the big and small pictures, but showed  a clear preference for the latter in terms of what it mostly zeroed in on. That decision made plenty of sense in the moment, given how many loose ends there are to tie up for a series that is heading toward its overall conclusion—yes, a video game series telling a complete, start-to-finish story is allowed if publishers will only let it happen—but it is even more justified after seeing how Trails Beyond The Horizon plays out. Trails Through Daybreak II is its own worthwhile story and entry in the series, but it's also 60 hours of staging for what's to come, a slowed-down look at the game world and its characters to prepare you for the breakneck pace of Trails Beyond The Horizon, which is Vladimir Lenin's quote about weeks where decades happen given video game form: the entire game takes place over a matter of days, with a clear deadline for its story to wrap up, and it is incredible how much happens in that span and how different the world is when it wraps.

Every little thing that has popped up in the Daybreak games to this point, whether new or building on previous Trails' subseries, matters in Trails Beyond The Horizon. Every relationship, everything you know about Calvard and its status with its neighbors, what you know of the Septian Church and its seeming polar-opposite enemies of Ouroboros' “Society,” the things that have been hinted at about the oddness of the continent of Zemuria and how it's seemingly detached from the rest of the world in some way, of the speed at which technology is discovered and harnessed and discarded for something new, the cost of progress and the dangers inherent within it, what the characters who clearly know something beyond what has been revealed to the rest of the cast or even you yourself know about the world… it all comes to a head here. Falcom is so on top of it that they even manage to make the protagonist of the Cold Steel games, Rean Schwarzer, not an annoying distraction here, and instead a fit for what he's used for that doesn't detract from the experience. A miracle, really.

﻿

And it all results in the most dramatic cliffhanger the series has ever produced. If the cliffhanger in between the first two games in the series was an intensely personal one that mixed in larger-scale intrigue, this is the opposite: the scale of what's happening is enormous and concerning in a way that's never happened in the series before, which is saying something given how seemingly apocalyptic it's been in the past. But it also doesn't just tug at your heartstrings; it rips them right out of your chest not just with what actually happens in front of your eyes, but the implications of it, as well. It's masterfully done, and of course happened when Trails finally caught up to the Japanese release schedule in the west: for the first time, we don't know when the next brand-new Trails is coming.

As you can imagine given all of this detail above, Trails Beyond The Horizon is arguably the least-newbie-friendly game that Falcom has ever produced, but that's not a negative nor a reason to ding it. Start at the beginning. Earn your way to this game's payoffs, which tie together even moments you might have once thought wouldn't matter beyond the one in which they were experienced, or ones you had even forgotten about entirely. Falcom didn't just bring Kevin Graham back because it had been awhile—it is bad news when he shows up, because his job is to dirty his hands in the tasks no one else is equipped to handle, either mentally or physically. His being partnered with the Picnicking Front here—a group that, despite its intentionally goofy, lunch-loving namesake, is full of former child assassins, a major (former) series antagonist, and a constructed consciousness so powerful it's been used for evil in the past—is no mistake. Graham is a conflicted misfit with dangerous abilities unsure of his own place in the world as well as his worth, with a weariness and desire for things to be different and an inability to know how to make them so. You can get a sense of that from how everyone discusses him within the context contained solely in Trails Beyond The Horizon, sure, but it all works so much better if you have lived through the very struggles that still haunt him, as you do in Trails In The Sky The 3rd. The same goes for understanding what the Picnicking Front's whole deal is, which you need the Trails Of Cold Steel games, Trails Into Reverie, and Trails Through Daybreak II for in order to paint a complete picture of what is a whole bunch of tragic backstories and presents aiming to make the characters more than “just” that. This is less than one-third of the game's playable cast, by the way, never mind the many, many key non-playable characters whose scent Van and the rest of the Daybreak crew spend the game chasing as “Spriggans,” the subseries' regional answer to the Bracers Guild of the Sky games.

Trails is the most ambitious epic in games, and that's only becoming truer with each new entry that builds on the previous ones. Every new Trails game starts a round of “is this a good one to start with?”, and the answer is “no” every time, unless you're referring to the recent remake of the original, Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter. Which, if you want to experience Trails Beyond The Horizon in full, go start with that. Then play Trails In The Sky 2nd Chapter when that remake lands, then Trails In The Sky The 3rd on a Windows-compatible machine, then… you get the idea. It's been said before, but you don't start a lengthy book series in the middle; why would you do that with Trails, unless FOMO is your primary driving force? Respect yourself and Trails more than that, and do what's right for the both of you. Only then will you get the full experience that you deserve.



The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Beyond The Horizon was developed by Nihon Falcom and published by NIS America. Our review is based on the Switch 2 version. It's also available for PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch.

“A new dawn breaks over my castle,” says Alan Cumming to introduce “Planning A Coup,” the halfway point of this polarizing fourth season. And a new dawn it happily is—the Rapaport Era is behind us, blessedly, though Lisa Rinna and her fellow Traitors are cursing the exit of that loudmouth distraction. And after some dark, discouraging weeks of Faithful-on-Faithful hostility, the Peacock competition is also finally tapping back into what so often makes The Traitors peak reality entertainment: when those titular turncoats start twisting the knife on each other. It was only a matter of time before the kumbaya camaraderie between Rinna, Candiace Dillard Bassett, and Rob Rausch turned cutthroat, and I've got to hand it to the castle's resident overalls-lover for bringing some much-needed drama to the turret. 

But I'm getting ahead of myself: First, we need to see if any of the Faithfuls claim that dangling shield to save themselves at the risk of sabotaging the group. Alas, the majority rules, with the entire remaining cast showing up to breakfast the next morning. Left with displaced murder energy, the Traitors quickly strategize that they'll follow the herd and get Ron Funches out at the next roundtable before murdering Colton Underwood, who's had his sights set on Rinna and is trying to rope in anyone who will listen against the Real Housewife. 

Rob isn't a fan of the group's plans to target Ron. He's sparked up an oddball friendship with the comedian over the past few episodes and doesn't want to see him banished from the castle grounds. Helpfully, he's pulled into a large alliance by Johnny Weir, who does the numbers and realizes the Faithfuls just need a majority of eight players to swing any vote, with “ringleader” Colton on the top of their banishment wishlist.  

That strategizing is put on pause for the recurring haunted-cabin mission, in which the players have to decipher clues—spelled out Ouija board-style across the table or splashed onto the walls in fake blood—before rushing over to a corresponding grave for $3,000 a pop. Though there's a tempting two shields at one burial site, the group collectively decides to forgo individual protection in favor of prize money—well, almost collectively, with Yam Yam Arocho putting up a bit of a fight and earning some suspicious side-eye from Maura Higgins in the process. Not only does the cast now have an extra $15,000 in the prize pool but “we can murder whoever we want!” Rob cheers. “They're giving us a Faithful buffet.”

The banishment plan is split between Ron and Colton, a development that the latter is acutely aware of, so he makes a big swing: “Instead of trying to banish a Traitor, I'm gonna try to hold one hostage.” And that double-crosser is none other than Lisa Rinna, who Underwood pointedly assures he'll protect at the roundtable moving forward if she protects him in the turret. He's right on the money, but Lisa does some A-plus Lifetime acting and asserts that he's barking up the wrong Traitor.

At the roundtable that evening, things are eerily quiet until Ron prompts them to get the inevitable over with. He knows that he's a major target, though he rightfully points out that Colton has gotten things wrong in that very room more often than he has: “Because we don't like Michael, we don't count it; but because we love Porsha [Williams], we're still on me. I don't feel that's fair.” (For his part, Colton acknowledges that he's been playing the game “recklessly and boldly,” sure, but he's not “playing it as a Traitor.”)

Ron starts individually saying his goodbyes, a sweet but savvy move as it gets Natalie Anderson, Tara Lipinski, and Mark Ballas all believing that he's maybe a Faithful after all. With the spotlight now shifting back toward Colton, Underwood desperately throws another name to the wolves: Rinna. “You don't go against a Housewife,” he theorizes about her first-night vote for Porsha, but it's also a potent warning for his own gameplay. 

It'll no doubt be a harsh lesson for Rob to learn, too. During the roundtable, as votes start stacking up between Colton, Ron, and Lisa, Rob makes the shocking move of voting against Rinna. But with only one vote left, and Mark ultimately sending the ever-faithful Ron packing, Rob's big backstab doesn't end in a Traitor-on-Traitor death and he'll be left to feel the fires of Rinna's rage. “That was a huge risk. One vote?!” Candiace says of Rob's betrayal. “Watching him stab Lisa in the front like he did, I don't trust him.” And Rob knows it: “This is about to be baaaad for Robby Bobby.”

At least Rinna's wrath seems equally split between him and Colton. And the Traitors have to put that internal disloyalty temporarily to the wayside as Alan tasks them with yet another in-plain-sight murder, this time held at a grand banquet in the castle hall that evening in front of the rest of the Faithfuls. Festooned with a cursed amulette, Lisa will have to single out one Faithful to touch the shiny bauble and thus mark them for murder.But who will she choose?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:indiewire.com","Corey Feldman's Documentarian Marcie Hume on Why the '80s Teen Icon Is More Than Just a ‘Victim' or ‘Villain'","https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/marcie-hume-on-corey-feldman-vs-the-world-1235174128/","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT","

For moviegoers of a certain age, child star Corey Feldman has remained an object of endless fascination. From early roles in “Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter,” “Gremlins,” and “The Goonies” to his collaborations with Corey Haim in “The Lost Boys,” “License to Drive,” and “Dream a Little Dream,” he was ubiquitous in theaters and on cable TV in the 1980s — Jordan Peele called him one of the greatest teen icons of all time. As an adult, however, Feldman entered a decades-long stint in the tabloid wilderness, working as an actor only intermittently after struggles with addiction and the trauma of alleged abuse as a child in the film industry.

 








Related Stories ‘The History of Concrete' Review: John Wilson Illustrates How to Get Over a Beloved TV Show with a Moving and Hilarious Meditation on Death ‘Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!' Review: An Exuberant and Whimsical New Spin on the Grief Drama 

Feldman was a legitimately great actor with both dramatic (“Stand by Me”) and comic (“The ‘Burbs”) chops, but in the 1990s and beyond he became known less for his talent as a thespian than for his bizarre forays into pop music and for “Corey's Angels,” a group of attractive young women who lived in his house and served as his backup band. Feldman claimed they were aspiring actors and singers he was supporting; to the outside world it sometimes looked as though Feldman was exploiting them or even serving as a kind of amateur cult leader. Feldman's frequent assertions of his own abuse and exploitation when he was younger only served to complicate the issue.

 










Documentarian Marcie Hume is one of those people who always found Feldman to be an intriguing figure, and in 2016 she began filming him for what would ultimately become “Corey Feldman vs. the World,” a riveting feature documentary that follows Feldman and his “angels” on tour. Hume was given incredible access to Feldman for around a year, and the film that resulted from it is astonishing — riotously funny, deeply troubling, and provocative in the complex questions it raises about celebrity, power, money, sex, abuse, and how they're all intertwined.

Hume adopts a vérité approach that largely lets Feldman speak for himself — there's no editorializing, and there doesn't really need to be given that Feldman's life and personality are so dramatic that a straightforward presentation of the facts is plenty wild. Whatever your preconceived notions about Feldman are, Hume's film will expand and challenge them; the movie's greatness lies in its ability to capture all of Feldman's contradictions and self-destructiveness, empathizing with him without soft-pedaling his sins.

It's a major piece of work and one of the great celebrity documentaries of recent years. Following the film's independent release online last month (it's currently available for purchase and rental on iTunes), IndieWire spoke with Hume via Zoom about the challenges not only of making the movie but of getting it out into the world — especially given Feldman's animosity toward it in spite of the fact that the film lets him tell the story almost entirely in his own words. 

 










This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

IndieWire: What were the origins of this documentary, and what was your prior relationship to Corey Feldman and his work?

Marcie Hume: I had a deep, visceral fascination and reaction to Corey, seeing him pursuing his music and making these self-produced videos. It was just jaw-dropping and unreal watching him try to establish a different type of career as somebody that many of us had grown up seeing in the limelight in a time when fame was very different. He was a pop icon at 13 when there were just a handful of famous teenagers. 

I made contact with his management and met with him and filmed a sizzle reel for a TV show that didn't sell. It took me quite a while to get from there to the documentary, because that was not as exciting or enticing to Corey and his management as a TV show. But then my film [“Magicians: Life in the Impossible”] came out, and I think they saw that I could make and finish a movie. I was invited to come film Corey's wedding in Las Vegas, so I packed up my gear and drove there, and that was the first thing I filmed for the documentary. I just kept filming from there and kept getting invited to his house and gigs and everything else you could imagine.

What were the initial conversations like with Corey about the parameters of the documentary as it started to become a real thing?
 










It was a very long process. He's learned not to trust people, so I just tried to be very friendly and open with him. He did try to establish control over everything, but that was really difficult when you're on the road in an RV or a bus with all of these people wanting to live their own lives. It was an incredibly frenetic environment. As we developed more of a rapport, he didn't really tell me what to do. But what's so fascinating, and what I've had to think so much more about, is what it is to have no control over telling your own story. Because seeing his reaction to the movie, over which he has zero control, it's quite extreme. And it has forced me to think about the idea of having no control over your own story and how scary that must be.

Yet in a sense you are letting him tell his own story, as much as possible. There's not a lot of manipulation.

We did let him tell his own story, and so much of the movie is from his own point of view. It was crucial to show his perspective and how it's the foundation of the world that he created and why these women are with him on tour and why things fall apart. I think to make a simple takedown or a simple vindication of him would have been the wrong thing to do, because the movie is about the ecosystem that produces someone like Corey, about the industry that made him and used him, and the fans that mock him. But also, you see firsthand the ideas that he expresses himself, and you as an audience have to grapple with what is going on inside this man's mind. It's down to the audience to decide. I cannot make a judgment about what is happening psychologically with him.

 










Corey isn't only a victim and he isn't only a villain, and you have to sit with the fact that he can be harmed and also harm others. And he can be sincerely trying to tell the truth and also distorting the truth. And we all have those contradictions — maybe not to the same degree, but we all want to behave a certain way and we all fail to behave the way that we want to all the time. That might be one of the biggest themes of the movie: how much nuance and depth and contradiction can you accommodate in your view of the world? There's no easy answer to any of it.

Tell me a little about the actual logistics of shooting Corey and the angels on tour. Are you riding the bus with them? Do you have any kind of crew, or is it just you and your camera?

I would come in for about a week at a time and stay on the RV, or the bus — there were a couple of different tours. I had my own bunk where I slept with my Canon 5D and my mic attached because I wanted to be ready at any moment to just take off the lens cap and start rolling. I have a filmmaking partner named Star Rosencrans who filmed when I was in New York or otherwise unavailable, and Bryan Donnell filmed one or two days with me. But other than that, it was just me and my 5D shooting Corey for about a year, which was the only way it could have happened. There wasn't room for anyone else either physically or personality-wise.

 










It's been several years since you shot with Corey, so how long did it take you to go through the footage you had and find a shape for it?

The footage sat there for a few years while I was looking for help and support. Eventually I found [editor and producer] Adam Franklin, who was already a Corey enthusiast. During the pandemic he had the time to sit and watch down all of the footage — and there was a lot of footage because I rolled as much as I could. We started talking about a structure and really staying squarely in Corey's point of view, until the aperture started to open to the perspectives of other people on tour. And honestly, that aperture continues to open for me now as I meet and talk with the women. 

Adam was almost supernatural in his ability to craft the story and let the humor come out without ever being mean or unfair. We had a lot of screenings where we tried to find the balance between the fun and joy and humor of the movie and the dark subject matter that made its way in.

When did your relationship with Corey start to fall apart?

In 2017 he decided he was going to make his own documentary, and that's when he started to decide that he had no use for me. He asked me if he could have my footage, and I said, “I'm sorry, Corey, but I've spent so much time and almost all my money on this movie. I didn't take other work to do this. I can't just give you my footage.” I felt genuinely bad about it, because I have extraordinary empathy for him. When you're a documentarian, your empathy finds corners that it wouldn't in an average everyday relationship with someone. But I knew I could not give him my footage, and that was the last time I heard from him or spoke with him. He told Phil, his music manager, that he did not want to be involved in the movie. But I had invested so much time and money and effort and I knew it could be a great movie, so I had to finish it. It was extraordinarily hard to find the resources to actually finish it, but obviously we eventually did.

 










When it was finally done I called Corey, and I could tell he was really freaked out that the movie was done. I thought there was a very good chance that he would like most of it because it is very much his point of view and who he is. I said to him, “Look, I have to cover the point of view of other people. The women are in this. I know this is going be difficult, but I'm really excited to show you this. There's so much in it of your struggles and your perspective.”

He came over to watch the movie, and we did not get a chance to talk about it. He left before we had a chance to talk, and then the day before the premiere, we received a cease and desist.

But the movie is out there, so has he actually been able to do anything to hurt it?

It was up on Amazon and now it's not. Apparently Amazon errs on the side of extreme caution, so they have not put it back up even though there's no danger, which is a real shame. We're working on that and I would like it to be back up there. But otherwise I guess all has been fine. His claims are completely outrageous and baseless, but it's very much his way of dealing with the world. You see it in the movie, how he copes with things he doesn't like.

My mind was so blown by the documentary that I'm honestly a little surprised people aren't talking about it more, and it's why I wanted to talk with you — I really think it deserves to find a huge audience, and that people will love it if they find it.
 










I think we need to treat this moment we're in in the industry as an opportunity to do things differently. I could never get attention on this film in the right way, and it blew my mind because to me I had a subject that was just so inherently intriguing and entertaining. I think some people really just don't like Corey and find him hard to watch, and some I just couldn't get to engage with the movie. All I knew was that I was going to get the movie out, no matter what. But it would be impossible to count the hurdles along the way. I truly wouldn't know where to begin. This film almost killed me, and it's still killing me because I'm trying to get people to pay attention, and it's very difficult. 

I think in this moment we're only going to be getting more “no's” from the industry at large, so we need to find ways as filmmakers to make sure that we're going to get our movies out anyway. I don't mean to be Pollyanna about it. It's going to get harder, but there are only so many people who know how to really make a movie and get it done. So if you're one of those people, it's your time to shine. Really figure it out and keep that light alive.

When most people think about concrete, they think about the obvious stuff: The color gray. New York City. Why it's generally a bad idea to jump off tall buildings. When John Wilson thinks about concrete, the erstwhile star of HBO's “How to With John Wilson” thinks about DMX, Hallmark movies, Kim Kardashian, public diarrhea, a trailblazing Asian American judge, the world's first 3D-printed Starbucks, and a 3,100-mile footrace that honors a dead Brooklyn cult leader. 

What do those things have in common? Possibly everything! Maybe a little bit less than that. But definitely, definitely at least this: They're all things that John Wilson thinks about when he thinks about concrete. And that turns out to be all the connective tissue we need to appreciate the relationship between them.

Related Stories Corey Feldman's Documentarian Marcie Hume on Why the '80s Teen Icon Is More Than Just a ‘Victim' or ‘Villain' ‘Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!' Review: An Exuberant and Whimsical New Spin on the Grief Drama 

A sweetly Dantean scavenger who collages this broken existence back together from an endlessly amusing library of first-person video snippets and unpredictable detours (his clips layered with a quizzical voiceover that warps their images into cheeky visual puns, and evokes the affect of an alien kindergartner sending travelogues about life on Earth to its friends back home), Wilson makes sense of the world by sanding the edges off its infinite strangeness. His work suggests a sleeping brain that's straining to organize chaos into order, and his ability to manufacture semi-logical associations between literally anything — often by forging a path that leads from A to B to Q to ancient hieroglyphics to an Avatar fan support group before eventually finding its way back to where it began — has allowed him to impose some credible degree of meaning onto a human condition that offers all too little of its own. 

 










Much like the episodes of his show (very much like, to the point of being indistinguishable, aside from its length), Wilson's consistently hilarious and sneakily profound “The History of Concrete” is sustained by an internal tension between order and entropy. Between meaning and mayhem. This meandering but laser-focused essay film is, like the best episodes of Wilson's show, sustained by parallel dramatic questions that inevitably answer each other by the end. (The series finale of “How To” is especially relevant, as its search for lasting purpose amid the transience of all things perfectly tees up this debut feature). 

The first is as simple as it gets: What is Wilson going to do with himself now that his short-lived but deeply beloved premium cable TV series is over? (“The space between projects is hard” he muses at the start of the movie before cutting to an inordinately phallic sign of a hot dog bisecting the two sides of a giant bun). The second is more complicated, even though it's basically the first question in disguise: How is Wilson going to cut all the footage he's been shooting ever since into a coherent rationale that allows him to rescue a convincing sense of peace from his jobless uncertainty? 

Of course, “The History of Concrete” is Wilson's next project, and the process of turning it into an actual job — which is to say, the process of getting it funded — is subsumed into the smorgasbord of material that he presents to us over the course of the movie's 100 minutes. 

 










It would be a waste of time to walk you through how Wilson gets from 49-cent royalty checks and rueing his life as a Ridgewood landlord to the oldest buildings in Rome and a brick-laying contest in Las Vegas, but suffice it to say that concrete — everyone's favorite composite material composed of aggregate bound together with fluid cement — serves as the great connector. Wilson is compelled to the substance because he recognizes how well it straddles the divide between false permanence and ephemerality. People make skyscrapers and highways out of it. They scratch their names into the mixture before it dries as a bid for immortality. They use it to build the burial vaults that sustain them into the sweet hereafter. It is nothing less than the backbone of modern infrastructure.

And yet, concrete only lasts for about 40 years before it starts to crumble. I've already held out for longer than that, and my body is made out of mushy stucco and wiry gray hair. Even the most solid things on Earth aren't meant to last forever. Towers crumble. Highways collapse. TV shows come to an end. And that's OK! Well, that last thing is. 

And Wilson must understand that at heart, as he ended “How To” on his own accord. But as anyone knows who's ever lost — or even voluntarily relinquished — a foundational piece of themselves, to understand loss is not the same as to accept it. And “The History of Concrete” is nothing if not a sprawlingly beautiful self-portrait of a man trying to strike a balance between letting go and holding on. A man trying to make space for grief at the same time as he scrambles for self-preservation. 

 










The existential anxiety of that mission provides “The History of Concrete” an even deeper bedrock of wistfulness than could be found in the flooded basement of Wilson's previous work (among this movie's other miracles: It made me sympathetic towards a New York City landlord). Death, evanescence, and the inevitability of change cast a long and constant shadow over the film, as Wilson's attention flits from the Sri Chinmoy ultramarathon and its promise of self-transcendence to Tibetan sand mandalas and a tattoo artist who preserves the inked flesh of the dead so that the living can frame it on their walls. 

That context is probably enough to appreciate some of the film's most delightful asides, such as a profile of the man behind GumBusters — a business that power blasts old gum off the streets of NYC — and a brief aside into the temporary venues that host Wilson's favorite DIY noise shows. Other detours would be harder to explain and much easier to ruin, but anyone familiar with “How To” will be unsurprised by how Wilson's cock-eyed perspective allows him to be movingly sentimental without ever veering into self-seriousness. 

By the same token, fans of his work will be familiar with how “The History of Concrete” looks askew at its hero characters without ever looking down on them. And no hero character in any of Wilson's previous stuff plays a larger role than part-time rock-and-roller Jack Macco, who Wilson meets when the guy is handing out free tequila samples at a liquor store. While Macco is an undeniable eccentric, and there's something a little sad about the empty bar gigs he plays along the Jersey shore (a sadness made that much stronger by his bandmates' refusal to rehearse), he gradually comes to embody the core truth at the heart of Wilson's work: There's more to everybody than meets the eye. 

 










It isn't long before Macco's set list — a careful negotiation between originals and covers — erupts into an existential dilemma over the push-and-pull between creation and inertia, which in turn leads to a wildly unexpected personal revelation that confronts us with a universe of new possibilities at the same time as it bring the film back to its nucleus of grief. That circularity is a defining staple of how Wilson has always shaped his vision of the world, and, perhaps even more than the filmmaker's signature aesthetic, is the thing about this movie that might engender the feeling that he's simply repeating himself with a longer running time. 

I don't think Wilson would deny that. On the contrary, “The History of Concrete” offers a characteristically roundabout argument for the rewards of sticking to a formula (it involves a trip to the Canadian warehouse where they shoot all of Hallmark's Christmas movies). A formula imposes comfort upon chaos. That comfort can be manufactured, even inauthentic, but everyone needs to make their own sense of this merciless world if they want to enjoy living in it. 

For a certain demographic of wine-drunk women, a degree of peace with their smallness in the universe can be found in the divine predictability of watching someone move back to their adorable hometown for the holidays, save a house from a grinchy banker, and share a kiss with a ChatGPT-created hunk under the mistletoe. John Wilson finds the same from stringing “random” things together until life itself begins to resemble a wildly bizarre — and oddly soothing — evidence board in the case he's building against meaninglessness. 

 










Humanity has long regarded the lack of a grand design as an invitation to create their own, and you don't have to believe in the connections that Wilson makes in “The History of Concrete” to appreciate how the act of making them keeps the world from crumbling around him, and allows him to make his own kind of peace with the fact that it will some day. If maybe not for another 40 years. 

“The History of Concrete” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Sadly, it's a rarity these days: a filmmaker who trusts their audience to have the attention span to follow the story unfolding on the screen. Filmmaker Rachel Lambert has long excelled at just this, from her fractured family drama “In the Radiant City” to her delightfully off-kilter character study “Sometimes I Think About Dying.” Mostly, Lambert trusts her actors to breathe life into stories that may scan small on the page, but reach profound heights on the big screen.

Her latest film, the lovely romance “Carousel,” is perhaps the best example yet of these tendencies and talents, a film for and about grownups bolstered by strong performances from stars Chris Pine (in a role that, we hope, will define the next chapter of his career) and a wonderfully delicate Jenny Slate. Filmed in Lambert's own Ohio hometown, the film revels in the seeming minutiae of everyday life, but finds pleasure and profundity in such spaces.

When we first meet Noah — a local doctor who loves his handed-down practice — his gentle nature is barely masking some big pain. Lambert's script doles out details in small measures, requiring patience from her audience. It is, however, immediately clear that Noah's seemingly recent divorce has taken a major toll on both him and his teen daughter Maya (“Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret” breakout Abby Ryder Fortson), who displays major anxiety about the smallest of matters.

 










There are big matters afoot, too, like the news that Noah's mentor (Sam Waterston) is retiring from their practice. And there's the reappearance of Rebecca (Slate), who we later come to understand was Noah's high school sweetheart, and one he has been unable to shake in the intervening years. Rebecca is back in town to deal with her own problems, including a stuck career in politics and her aging parents' inability to move forward with selling their house. We see what's brought Rebecca here through a natty bit of perspective shift, a trick that Lambert employs sparsely throughout the film, and one that can occasionally catch audiences off-guard, eager to fill in the pieces.

But Lambert will fill in the pieces, often through the force of Pine's performance in particular. When he and Rebecca reunite — the pair exhibit an immediate chemistry that feels both physical and emotional, conveying a believably complicated history — no one is under any illusions that everything is suddenly perfect. This is, after all, a story about adults, people who look and talk like real people, imperfect actions, stilted sentences, so much unsaid. Communication, it seems, has always been a problem between the two, and when we get a taste of what tore them apart in the first place, we can already see what might happen this time.

 










Or will it? That's the central question of “Carousel,” which finds Lambert gently eschewing standard romance beats — they fall in love, express it, and live happily ever after! — in favor of a story that is compelled by viewing the cost of real love through a decidedly mature lens. Both Noah and Rebecca are dealing with real problems, true-life stuff, the kind of things coming at all of us. Noah's divorce has wounded him, a lingering tragedy involving his father still cannot be spoken of, Rebecca is realizing her career is not everything. Local stores are closing up on Main Street. Maya can't put into words what she's feeling. There are so many jokes about the cost of healthcare.

What happens to love in the face of all of that? Anchored by a heart-stopping argument that sees Noah and Rebecca laying bare every fault, flaw, and falsity that has kept them from fully embracing each other (and maybe even life itself), “Carousel” feels ripped from the fabric of a million lives. Don't let the seemingly small nature of the film fool you; there is career-best work here, especially from Pine, who was always made for a romantic drama. This one was worth the wait.

“Carousel” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking distribution.

On the morning of August 22, 2023, something went horribly wrong in the remote mountains of Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province: A makeshift gondola that was carrying eight people — most of them teenagers on their way to school — from one peak to another was left dangling on its side 1,000 feet in the air when two of the system's mile-long cable car wires snapped without warning. 

Like the Tham Luang cave rescue, the Copiapó mining accident, and the litany of other disasters that have been disseminated over the internet in media res, the situation in Battagram immediately became equal parts crisis and spectacle, as the industrialized world pivoted its narrow spotlight towards a poor stretch of the Himalayas that it had previously been happy to ignore.

How long would it be until the boys plummeted to their deaths? What could the Pakistani government do to help a people who'd always been left to fend for themselves? Why does it feel like no one would have cared as much about the outcome if not for the fact that a local drone operator was there to capture it all in jarring close-up, his camera hovering just a few inches away from the passengers' faces as they stood motionless inside the refurbished sheet metal, afraid that even the slightest movement might send the cable car screaming to the bottom of the valley below? TV news stations were eager to confront their viewers with the first two questions. At its best, Mohammed Ali Naqvi's taut but frustratingly anemic “Hanging by a Wire” takes a few measured steps toward addressing the third. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Molded on E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin's “The Rescue,” but sorely missing that film's artful suspense and rich characterizations, the 77-minute “Hanging by a Wire” gets right down to business with the sort of “don't click away to some true-crime bullshit!” urgency that all docs seem to require now that the entire medium has been relegated to streaming. Here is the valley. It's gorgeous but secluded. Here are the cable cars. They are clearly made and maintained by the locals. It was just another school day until BOOM — cue the very canned sound of an explosion over the soundtrack — the wires snapped at the worst possible time. 

From the moment the movie starts, there is little doubt in our minds that most or all of the passengers will ultimately survive; I'd like to think that we'd remember if things went south, but the more relevant tell is that people don't really make upbeat, action-forward, heart in your chest rescue docs about terrified kids who died horribly while their parents watched. Still, Naqvi does what he can to engender some doubt, as he introduces the boys through memorial-like still photographs (often being held by their fathers, who speak of their sons in the present tense, and whose only function here is to say things like “I can still feel the utter despair from that day” in a variety of different ways), and diverts our attention from them until the rescue is well underway. 

 










In the meantime, Naqvi introduces us to a terrifically memorable cast of characters, all of whom help to explain why he was so compelled to make this movie, but few of whom receive the degree of detail they deserve. 

First up is Sumaira Khan, a pro-active news anchor who grew up in Battagram, but has since worked her way into an on-air gig at SAMAA TV, and feels an obligation to help the people of her hometown (knowing full well that the authorities need an extra kick in the ass to bother with the country's poorer communities). She effectively passes the baton to police chief Sonia Shamraz, another woman who knows a thing or two about defying the odds. Seen here cosplaying as herself in some of the film's least essential recreations, Shamraz determines that the locals can't be trusted to save themselves, and sends in a rescue helicopter without communicating her plan to the anguished parents and friends who are watching the situation unfold. 

“Hanging by a Wire” doesn't call much attention to the class divide that runs through the middle of this film like a faultline, but the broader points speak for themselves. You can hear it plainly in the use of language (the big city types are fluent in English, while the Battagram residents talk in Pashto or Urdu), and in the disregard that authorities like Shamraz have for “Sky Pirate” Sahib Khan, a winsome Battagram native who fearlessly attempts to save the kids with a pulley he cobbled together from $15 worth of spare parts. Confident in his know-how, Khan is forced to access the cable car from the other side of the valley — where the cops won't stop him. 

 










They have a Sky Pirate of their own, an entrepreneur and wildly entertaining social media influencer who runs the world's highest zipline and is more than happy to flaunt his success. Despite being the “best-looking member of his family” with “a handsome body,” Ali Swati feels like a disappointment to his father because he wasn't able to serve in the Pakistani Army, and sees the cable car situation as the perfect chance to prove his worth. 

Swati's mid-air clashes with Khan are destined to become the film's most valuable source of interpersonal conflict, and “Hanging by a Wire” clearly recognizes the nature of the tension between them, but Naqvi passes up the opportunity to shine a more revealing light at the subtext of their relationship. That's par for the course in a documentary that loses a lot of its you are there intensity when the dark of night descends on the dangling cable car, forcing Naqvi to transition from first-hand footage to studio-bound recreations starring the real people who survived the crisis. 

These sequences are elegantly shot and psychologically mega-charged (though “Hanging by a Wire” does precious little to engage with the anxiety of dramatizing the worst day of your life), but the pitch-black void isn't a particularly exciting backdrop, and the operation itself is absent the insane twists that all but ensured “The Rescue” would be adapted into a Ron Howard movie. 

 










Hollywood is far too white to make a similar go at “Hanging by a Wire” (there's no role for Christian Bale to play here), but it wouldn't be the worst idea for another film industry to give it a whirl, as this is the rare documentary thriller that feels like it might actually be improved by scripted dialogue and some more extensive stunt work. Naqvi has thoughtfully collected all of the right ingredients for a more penetrating story, and it's easy enough to appreciate how his emphasis on basic entertainment value is a roundabout effort to return the world's attention to Battaram (whose infrastructure has yet to be improved, something I had to discover on my own time after the movie had ended), but the movie's narrow focus on the pre-existing conditions that fed into the cable car crisis does more to flatten the people involved than it does to bring new dimension to their ordeal. 

Rather than offering a nuanced response to any of the issues it raises from the start, “Hanging by a Wire” ultimately asks a different set of questions — one that Naqvi's film is less equipped to answer. Chief among them: At a time when every disaster is captured on video, what's the value of fleshing them out into feature-length documentaries? It would seem there's a need for filmmakers to perform rescue missions of their own — to rescue the stuff of recent history from the slipstream of social media content and restore a measure of dignity to the people who suffered for the world's morbid amusement. Naqvi is able to accomplish that at least, but the movie he's made is unwilling to go even the slightest bit further, as if the filmmaker were afraid that audiences' last remaining connection to non-fiction cinema would snap if he applied any more weight to it. 

 










“Hanging by a Wire” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

We are first introduced to Lagos through the eyes of Lady (Jessica Gabriel's Ujah) and everything is upside down. It's not a projection error! The image flips and gravity returns. Two young girls are letting their heads loll backwards over the edge of a jetty, rendering the pastoral vision behind them the wrong way up. This idyll does not last long. One slammed door later and Lady — as a young adult — fills the frame. She is living in the same place, it's the dream that has shifted.

Nigerian-British writer/director Olive Nwosu, aided by cinematographer Alana Mejia Gonzalez, starts her career with a fully-formed sense of image-craft. The most enduring moments in her first feature “Lady” stem from a visual power. A widescreen 2:1 aspect ratio is maximized to shoot the over-populated highways of a city home to over 17 million souls, yet there is grace in the gridlock. With a shrewd eye for color and detail, Nwosu does for Lagos what Payal Kapadia did for Mumbai in “All We Imagine As Light,” finding the secret rhythms within a chaotic city.

But this is a boldly aestheticized genre film – and while there are serene moments where the camera takes the position of god overlooking an anthill, much of the film takes place after-hours with the camera drawn to individuals and small groups. Under the glow of car headlamps or club strobe lights, sex workers look like flocks of high-femme birds of paradise. By contrast, Lady holds fast to masculine clothing in the hope of going under the radar and staying in control of her destiny. Gender presentation as a theme is suggested, rather than explicated, by the yin-yang survival modes pursued by Lady and her oldest friend Pinky (Amanda Oruh), the other girl in the opening sequence.

 










Pinky's return after an abrupt departure many years prior presents Lady with an opportunity to earn more than the living she is scraping as a taxi driver. Fuel prices are skyrocketing and increasing numbers of Lady's driver colleagues are heeding the voice of DJ Revolution — a charismatic radio personality — and taking to the streets in protest. Used to being a lone wolf, a woman in a man's world, a solo grafter while collective dissent brews, Lady turns the other cheek and accepts Pinky's proposition to moonlight as a driver for sex workers.

For Lady has one simple dream and it is fully dependent on accruing funds. One wall of her shack is plastered with images of Freetown, Sierra Leone. Behind one tenuously attached photo ripped from a magazine, there is a hole in the wall where she keeps her life savings in cash. Just as Rita Hayworth in “The Shawshank Redemption” was a vulnerable guard against Andy's one shot at freedom, so too the words ‘WISH YOU WERE HERE' over an azure sea induce anxiety — it's a flimsy front for such a precious stash.

If the stakes laid out for Lady are simple enough, Nwosu saves complexity in her sketch of a city vast enough that a person could lose track of their dreams by sheer dint of distraction; the day-to-day business of survival slowly eroding anything more high-minded on the horizon. One of the ways that Lady keeps focused is by fiercely rapping to herself in the mirror; she is, she tells herself, “the boss”. Whether the film agrees is something that Nwosu keeps close to her chest.

 










Working with many first time actors, Nwosu draws out commanding performances, even if these are limited by the loose personas within her writing. The actors give committed emotional performances that suit the stylistic visuals, without emerging as fully-formed characters. Jessica Gabriel's Ujah holds the film together with a seething charisma, while butting up against an underwritten origin-story of her sexual phobia. Her traumatic memories, triggered by spying on the sex workers, sit on the surface; without nuanced rooting in the story, they function only as jagged atmospheric flourishes, detached from deeper significance. 

Yet, these limits have little chance to grate, so compelling is the vision that Nwosu has conjured. Individual scenes are directed with a flair for beat-by-beat menace and reprieve, and she avoids many of the traps that a less confident filmmaker would have dutifully entered. Nwosu has a refined ability to present alternating perspectives without tipping the scales on one or the other. There is a strong sense of duality throughout: characters code-switch between Nigerian and Pidgin, the soundtrack juggles tense strings with rap music, Lady balances the masculine and feminine, while the theme of individualism vs collectivism bubbles on the backburner.

 










If “Lady” is more successful as a series of interconnected vignettes, than as one fluid narrative, it has a moving ending up its sleeve. After presenting a morass of rich themes, Nwosu teases out a small, surprising finale that transcends the blinkered concerns driving her protagonist. ‘WISH YOU WERE HERE' is an entreaty to audiences on behalf of the cinematic and social movements of Lagos today.

“Lady” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

On a crowded dancefloor, where illicit substances, pheromones, and hypnotic beats blur, it's hard to tell if it's the drugs or the person standing in front of you that's making you euphoric. “I'm going on clean,” Harry Styles repeats in the first verse of “Aperture,” the first single from Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally., after admitting that he falls quickly when under the influence. You'd expect him to return with a dopamine rush, but his first single since Harry's House is a five-minute slow burn, a new pace he's exploring romantically.

The new album, Styles says, was inspired in part by seeing LCD Soundsystem perform, and the “Aperture” instrumental is purely MPC—a synth that drones, a synth that glitches, and a bassline pulse. It's a stark departure from the acoustic guitar plucks and somber piano strokes heard across Styles' three prior albums. Throughout his nearly two-year Love On Tour, Styles' live band became part of his showman persona; their absence heightens the song's melancholy and intimacy. It's in the moment of quiet reflection that Styles decides that enduring love is worth the discomfort of having your truths laid bare.

The payoff in the back half of this track isn't quite as rewarding as, say, the gospel-esque final act of “Lights Up.” The chorus of “We belong together” in “Aperture” even sounds a bit defeated, like fifth-graders in choir class. Kid Harpoon's accelerating synths, streaking like laser lights, carry a lot of the emotional lift, counterbalancing Styles' subdued delivery. He's 32 now and haunted by how fast time is passing: “Time won't wait on me,” he muses, “I wanna know what safe is.” It's as if he'd stumbled on the memoir of the adrenaline-junkie rock star he once imagined he'd become and started to realize that might be a miserable way to live.

Of all the DJs and producers who have contributed to the decade's Brazilian funk resurgence, few have reached a wider audience than DJ Ramon Sucesso. Since he began his Sexta dos Crias series (which translates as something like “Homie Fridays”) in 2021, Sucesso has become a rare export from the underground Rio scene—a touring heavyweight and a critical favorite. If he became known internationally for his iconic videos of DJ controller abuse, where his fingers pound away at distorted vocal chops and explosive drums, his 2023 mix album Sexta dos Crias proved his buzzy mixing style had deeper substance than his short videos might have suggested. On its sequel, Sexta dos Crias 2.0, Sucesso upgrades nearly every part of his frenzied funk, setting himself apart as the style's most kinetic practitioner.

Sucesso's style is laid bare on snaking side A-side “Rompanedo o Espaço-Tempo” (“Breaking Through Space-Time”), which centers both his precise production chops and songs from likeminded peers. Distortion is key to Sucesso's heavyweight funk beats, though they're nowhere as brutal as the mandelão and bruxaria—two haute underground funk subgenres—of contemporaries like d.silvestre and DJ K. Instead, along with his grimy experimentation, Sucesso has always grounded himself in foundational aspects of funk carioca, the hip-hop–inspired sound innovated by DJ Marlboro, though his beats are nowhere as melodic or bubbly as popular funk contemporaries like Anitta or even underground peers like DJ Ramemes, who contributes production on the record. Poking through the constant chaos, Sucesso's selections share crucial similarities with mainstream funk: repetitive, bass-heavy, and sexy. At its core, funk is a party music and Sexta dos Crias 2.0 feels like a celebration from start to finish.

With much credit to Sucesso's exacting curation of dozens of voices and his constant chopping and filtering to keep repetitive lines fresh, the vocalists are the clear stars of “Distorcendo o Universo” (“Distorting the Universe”), the mix's B-side segment. The lineup of vocalists—some brash, some beautiful, all aggressive and confident—center some of the most memorable funk rapping and melodies in recent memory, recalling the gorgeous vocal work of funk royalty like Tati Quebra Barraco and MC Bin Laden. Around the 13-minute mark, a female vocalist delivers a melody so indelible that when it's repeated by Sucesso, it feels like hypnotherapy. Popular funk vocalists like MC Nito and MC Marlon PH make boisterous cameos, but the barrage of voices on Sexta dos Crias 2.0 creates a whole that doesn't ever hinge on any one performance. It's unclear who most of these vocalists and producers are, anyways; the record solely credits Sucesso for “music and mixing.” So just like that fire track that Shazam couldn't ID last weekend at the club, there's no knowing what Sucesso pulled from to put Sexta dos Crias 2.0 together, but it all makes good on the B-side's implicit promise of making Sucesso's take on funk bigger than himself.

Sexta dos Crias 2.0, as the title may suggest, improves and upgrades on nearly every aspect of its preceding iteration. Whereas the original Sexta dos Crias boasted incredibly minimal rhythm lines and many interruptions from the DJ, the sequel incorporates a wider palette of samples, melodies, and rhythms, while reducing his time on the mic to allow the music to speak louder for itself (changes he credits to the critical feedback he received after the first edition). Sucesso delivers tighter mixes of fiercer tracks with mixing that ignores the easiest blend or chop in favor of more difficult but rewarding options. Certain limitations occasionally reveal themselves; when a classic dub echo effect kicks in, anyone who's been near a Pioneer DJM mixer can picture Ramon turning its knob. But for how extensively Sucesso's style has been technologically determined by his controllers, he's made remarkably vibrant use of the palette available to him.

Sucesso's approach to funk has been largely atypical of its local manifestations: Whereas uploading full sets of funk mixes is fairly common among Brazilian DJs, he's the first to press one to vinyl and present mixes in the LP format. Even his fame, sprung from videos filmed in an empty room, happened a world away from the packed dancefloors where funk thrives. It's this unconventionality that's set Sucesso apart from his peers, especially as funk continues to grow in popularity abroad. But at its core, DJ Ramon Sucesso is still focused on what's made funk great across generations and now borders: infectious beats, melodies, and basslines that are dissected with surgical precision.

OutKast was always an exercise in friction. Long before the barely disguised breakup album that became their biggest commercial success, Dre and Big Boi chafed at one another, at different versions of themselves, at the past, the present, their genre, their neighbors. Their debut album, 1994's remarkably accomplished Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, was buoyed by a pair of hits so thematically discordant that they could only be held together by an impenetrable alloy of charisma and technique.

Two years later, when the Atlantans were just 21 years old, they returned with ATLiens, an album that finds a new vantage point on the outside world to burrow deeper into its authors' own paranoias and insecurities. Suffused with dread and bathed in reverb, the record captures two virtuosos at their most vulnerable. Even when the revelations seem to be inadvertent, they add depth and dimension to the high school rivals-turned-partners who had quickly emerged as monumental talents in rap.

Southernplayalistic allowed Dre and Big Boi to tour across the continent and in Europe. In interviews around the time of ATLiens' release, both MCs, but especially Big Boi, cite this as a broadening experience for two teenagers whose lives had mostly been confined to the American South. But tour is also exhausting, and isolating; it's a lot of airport terminals and interchangeable hotels and greenrooms that blur into a sort of purgatory with fresh towels and stale deli trays. For a nominally social endeavor, it leaves you alone with yourself an awful lot.

When Big Boi and Dre started working with Organized Noize—the production trio Sleepy Brown, Ray Murray, and Rico Wade, who had nurtured them as part of the Dungeon Family collective and produced Southerplayalistic—the accommodations were no itineraries, no concierges. “The basement wasn't finished,” Big Boi said to Rolling Stone in 2004, recalling the place from which the Dungeon took its name. “We have red clay in Georgia, so the beat machines had dust on 'em. There were old broke-up patio chairs. You had seven people sitting on steps with their notebooks out. Guys sleeping upstairs on a hardwood floor. It was some gritty shit. We'd walk up to this deli inside a gas station and order the spaghetti special, because it came with five meatballs, so we could split it.” That was then. Now there was money; now there were deadlines. While OutKast toured, Organized Noize rented out the top floor of the Biltmore Hotel and started working on beats for the second album.

Meanwhile, the rappers had invested some of the money from their publishing deal in production equipment and begun tinkering with beats themselves. They worked diligently and smoked copious amounts of weed. Their emerging codependence refracted through both things: Any beat made by either one was credited, simply, to OutKast; because Big Boi didn't yet know how to roll blunts for himself, Dre would prepare as many as 30 for him to go through during a single day.

But during this period, three crucial things happened which clarified (if not calcified) a difference in artistic approach between the two men. André, along with several other Dungeon Family members, took an extended trip to Jamaica. It was apparently transformative: Dre came back clean, sober, and celibate, a pivot that would be reflected in his suddenly more eclectic wardrobe. Big Boi couldn't make the trip because of his aunt Renee's passing. And in March 1995, he became a father. (Several years ago, during an interview for a magazine profile, Big Boi told me that it was the birth of his daughter that shaped a newly disciplined writing practice he continues to this day: jotting rhymes on a yellow legal pad with start and stop times noted in the margins, clocking in and out as if at a factory.) One half of the duo was more tethered than ever to the practical realities of adulthood; the other was free to imagine moving beyond them.

The opening five-song movement of ATLiens is not so much otherworldly as it is vaguely apocalyptic. “Two Dope Boys (In a Cadillac),” the title track, and “Wheelz of Steel”—the latter two produced by OutKast, the first by Organized Noize—are uniformly metallic and slightly distorted, a marked departure from the debut that was on the whole lusher and funkier. Yet that consonance of sound is complicated by the writing. No one who has ever heard “Elevators (Me & You)” has forgotten its languid hook. But the slick, slow boasts about slamming Cadillac doors don't quite square with the disdain Dre expresses for the old classmate he runs into, who wants to know what kind of car he drives. Similarly, at the end of his first verse on “ATLiens,” Big Boi invokes his incarcerated uncle; this gives way immediately to the chorus that instructs you, “Now throw your hands in the air/And wave 'em like you just don't care.” That line traces back to rap's beginnings, a reliable party-starting instruction. Here, the men saying it sound more than a little defeated.

The same virtuosity that helped explain “Player's Ball” and “Git Up, Git Out” as two sides of the same slick-but-industrious ethic is at play here. Actually, both rappers are notably sharper than they'd been before, rattling through intricate patterns that would seem like athletic feats for most other MCs. The pair is also so confident that they have no problem throttling down when it serves the song. On “Two Dope Boyz,” Dre describes a rapper challenging him to a battle—then simply steps out of the rhythm of the verse. “Look, boy,” he deadpans, “I ain't for that fuck shit.” At times, Dre and Big Boi pack a half-dozen different flows into their verses on a single song. “Elevators” alone sees Big Boi's stop-start “Back in the day when I was younger/HUNGER/Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's/BULLSHIT” and Dre's now-legendary lapse into double time:

True, I've got more fans than the average manBut not enough loot to last me to the end of the weekI live by the beat like you live check-to-checkIf it don't move your feet, then I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck

On one level, the acceleration that starts on “to the end of the week” is simply a great trick. But it also seems to convey a desperation that Dre betrays, at several points on ATLiens, to be seen by his peers as a fellow struggling Black Atlantan rather than as an aloof celebrity—or an alien. He doesn't even make it through a full song before imagining himself on a freeway off-ramp, holding a sign that says WILL RAP FOR FOOD. Dre's determined to draw this parallel, but the lines keep swooping toward the margins.

Ironically, this works to the album's benefit. Maybe it's the hostility of the scene depicted in “Elevators”; maybe it's the hollowness of his accusation, on “Ova da Wudz,” that “record companies act like pimps” after the world's second-oldest profession was invoked so often as a fun aesthetic cloak on Southernplayalistic. Rather than acting as the final word about how down-to-earth Dre had remained, it all plays like the protestation of someone whose feet are just starting to levitate off the ground.

The irony of the “pimps” line is fascinating; not all the album's sexual politics are. The A-side's gloom is centered on “Jazzy Belle,” a mournful and clumsily retrograde scolding of promiscuous women. The sentiments are ugly but pedestrian; elsewhere, Dre pushes further, rapping on a song called “Babylon” about schoolboys and girls covertly exploring one another's bodies. The vignette ends with the clunker, “They call it ‘horny' because it's devilish.” Dre's new asceticism scans as a youthful overcorrection rather than the sage wisdom he imagines it to be; though presumably unintended, this adds yet another layer to the text. Near the album's end, the fissures in his spiritual armor start to show. “My stomach can't digest it, even when I bless it,” he raps, none of the spiritual frequencies quite right to drown out the corruption of the world. Of course, Big Boi had already put this in plainer terms: “Rally's? Bullshit.”

The songs on ATLiens are split more or less evenly between the two headliners, with two notable exceptions. The first is “Babylon,” where Dre raps twice before Big Boi takes his turn. It's appropriate that the latter's verse feels like an addendum—it's about how grief-stricken he was to lose Aunt Renee, the incident that kept him from the Jamaica trip that informs Dre's verses. The second departure from format is “Decatur Psalm,” which doesn't feature Dre at all. Instead, verses from Dungeon Family allies Cool Breeze (a legendary guest turn) and Big Gipp bookend Big Boi's story about men on the corner staring “like accidents on highways” at him while he drives with his daughter. “High days are better than sober ones,” he muses, before putting two gunshots in the sky “to let 'em know I'm babysitting.” It's the most brutal the album gets, and also the most beautiful. Maybe it's fitting that for all Dre's struggles to relate to his audience over money, he finally cuts straight to their souls over guns. “While we rantin' and ravin' 'bout gats,” he chastises on “Babylon,” “Nigga, they made them gats/They got some shit that'll blow out our backs.”

As heavy as all this is, ATLiens maintains a delicate tonal balance through smart sequencing. (“Babylon” is followed by a reprieve in the form of the bright, brisk “Wailin.'”) But there is no escaping the tension between the abstract and corporeal concerns, seemingly irreconcilable and similarly totalizing. ShaJuanna Edghill's echoes, on the chorus of “Millennium”—“Planets and stars… Earth, Jupiter, Mars… clothes, hoes, cars… It's who you are”—seem to presage Dre's “She said she thought hip-hop was only guns and alcohol/I said ‘Oh hell nah!' But yet, it's that, too,” from Stankonia's “Humble Mumble,” as close to a mission statement as OutKast would ever get.

Two years later, the duo released Aquemini, a masterpiece that is expressly about the passage of time. But already on ATLiens, the supposed linearity of things is beginning to blur. On “E.T. (Extraterrestrial),” Dre admits he's “holding onto memories like roller coaster handlebars.” One song later, he quips—over and over, like a mantra—that “fat titties turn to teardrops” as Big Boi laments the calendar that “keeps flipping.” As Big Boi says, the calendar doesn't actually end; the dead linger, the babies grow up. Just because we feel alienated from the world doesn't mean we're not of it.

A crucial question comprises the syncopated chorus of “Bad News,” the penultimate track on Doppelgänger. “Who do you wish you were when you're alone?” Peaer's lead singer Peter Katz asks in falsetto. Self-directed inquiries make up the bulk of Döppelganger's lyrical content, and the album's quiet unrest makes it clear that he has been stewing on this particular question for longer than he ever wanted to. When lockdown prevented the Brooklyn trio's tour in support of 2019's A Healthy Earth, Katz stopped making music altogether for a full year. He'd formed his band and signed to Tiny Engines while studying at SUNY Purchase (a retrospective incubator for Bandcamp-era indie rock success stories of the 2010s), and music had defined almost the entirety of his adult life. But what was once a life force had become a breeding ground for resentment toward the industry and its gatekeepers, as well as toward the person he was onstage and on his records—a person he no longer recognized.

Some of Doppelgänger's best songs synthesize years of working and reworking, stagnancy and revival, in just a few minutes. “No More Today” was written in 2018, and it hints at the burnout that eventually led to Katz's hiatus. Its ghostly guitar melodies float as its basslines thud along, growing both more menacing and dejected as Katz's depression becomes impossible to outrun. Katz wrote “Part of the Problem” during the 2016 election. Its lyrics are vague enough (and our circumstances unfortunately similar enough) that it doesn't feel stuck in the past. The message—frustration with a crisis that can't be solved with one single action, a general wariness of anyone who claims to have all the answers—is timeless. So is the simple and slow chord progression underlying it all, making for a folk song that avoids the predictable tropes of protest music and doesn't rely on cynicism as a dead end.

The creeping riff that serves as a skeleton for “I.D.W.B.W.Y.” dates all the way back to 2015, but the lyrics weren't written until five years later. They're few and purposely ambiguous. A solemn stack of harmonies repeats “I don't wanna go back there” and “I don't wanna be without you” for the first and second choruses respectively, like mantras. “I.D.W.B.W.Y.” could be interpreted as a pure love song just as easily as it could be a lament about a codependent relationship or a breakup song stuck in the denial stage of grief. Most of Doppelgänger expands Peaer's signature slowcore into something more melodic, but “I.D.W.B.W.Y.” hearkens back to a more bare-bones era of the band's sound. It's lived-in without being worn out.

Throughout the album, Katz questions how much identity stock to put into being an artist, whether continuing to pursue a music career is worth the financial precarity and psychological strain, and if what he's building is “just a shrine to [his] ego.” He's steeped in the less glamorous half of a double life on “Button,” marching up and down the scale and interrogating his decision to take on a 9-5 office job: “Plan every step, once it's done, nothing's left/Did you make it?” The barely audible scratching of strings twitches in the periphery, adding a subtle daydreaming quality to Peaer's otherwise grounded song construction. Katz's cryptic mumblings referencing Biblical imagery and Greek myths make “Rose in My Teeth” feel out of place. Still, it's an instrumentally striking track, built around a twisting, American Football-reminiscent riff.

Closer “Future Me” is a straightforward address to a version of Katz that he hasn't yet become. Recorded on an iPhone, its production strays slightly from the relative cleanness of the rest of the album, letting you hear each time Katz's breath catches or wavers. It sounds like a voice memo pulled from the drafts and forced into the public without necessarily being ready—perhaps like Katz himself. The album closes mid-word, while Katz is repeating the refrain of “Have you given up on everything?” It's a fitting end to a record largely made up of unanswered questions: leaving us not only without an answer but also with the question itself cut short. As much as Doppelgänger is a testament to slowing down and letting good things take time, there's a stark humanity in its awkward in-between stages. It's a strange and disquieting document of an artist falling out of love with music and a band finding its footing again.

Paris Hilton discussed the 2004 release of a sex tape that featured her during an appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Hilton, accompanied by Democratic New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Florida representative Laurel Lee, the reality star gave an impassioned speech about the importance of protecting women from similar incidents. 


	“When I was 19 years old, a private, intimate video of me was shared with the world without my consent,” Hilton said. “People called it a scandal. It wasn't. It was abuse.”


	Hilton made the appearance in support of the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act, or DEFIANCE Act. The bipartisan legislation would allow victims of AI-generated, sexually explicit content to take legal action against people who create it, distribute it, and solicit it with the intent to distribute. The bill has already pass in the Senate. 


	“There were no laws at the time to protect me,” Hilton explained. “There weren't even words for what had been done to me. The Internet was still new, and so was the cruelty that came with it.”

	She continued, “They called me names. They laughed and made me the punchline. They sold my pain for clicks, and then they told me to be quiet, to move on, to even be grateful for the attention. These people didn't see me as a young woman who had been exploited. They didn't see the panic that I felt, the humiliation, or the shame. No one asked me what I lost.”


	Hilton explained that she had the platform to reclaim her story, but “so many others don't.” “And what I've learned is that when your image is violated, it doesn't disappear; it lives inside you, but so does your power,” she said. “Telling the truth has helped me heal, and I am so proud that today I stand here without shame.” 

	











	She concluded, “I will keep telling the truth to protect every woman, every girl, every survivor, now and for the future.”

When I was 19, a private video of me was shared without my consent — and there were no laws to protect me. What people called a “scandal” was actually abuse, and it's something survivors are still facing today. That's why today, I spoke on Capitol Hill with @Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and #LaurelLee about the DEFIANCE Act 🏛️🩷 This bipartisan bill strengthens legal protections for survivors of AI-generated explicit deepfakes giving people real options to fight back and seek justice when intimate images are shared without consent. Proud to use my voice on this issue and stand up for women and girls everywhere 💗 #DEFIANCEAct


	The sex tape was filmed by Hilton's then-boyfriend Rick Salomon. She recounted the experience in her 2024 book, Paris: The Memoir, writing that she felt pressured to allow her much older boyfriend to record her. The footage was released in 2004. After Hilton said publicly that she did not approve of its release, Salomon sued Hilton for defamation. She counter-sued and was awarded damages, which she donated to charity.

	In 2021, Hilton described the sex tape to Vanity Fair as “something that will hurt me for the rest of my life.” “It was a private experience between two people,” Hilton said. “You love someone, you trust someone and to have your trust betrayed like that and for the whole world to be watching and laughing… It was even more hurtful to me to have these people think that I did this on purpose — that killed me. It still gives me post-traumatic stress disorder to talk about it.”


	Hilton will release a new documentary, Infinite Icon: A Visual Memoir, on Jan. 30. The film will center around the creation of Hilton's 2024 album of the same name, and explore how music often served as a balm during the most difficult moments of her life and career. In the film, Hilton will confront the often deeply misogynistic ways she was portrayed in the media, and discuss her experiences at troubled teen schools, where she claimed she was abused.

Louis Tomlinson appeared on The Tonight Show to perform his recent single, “Imposter,” and to chat with host Jimmy Fallon about his new album, How Did I Get Here?, which is out today. 


	The former One Direction member took the stage alongside his band to showcase the pop song, released earlier this week. Tomlinson built the mood with flashing colorful lights and artfully-arranged piles of cords. 


	The track was written by Tomlinson with Nico Rebscher and Dave Gibson. “Imposter was written in the jungle in Costa Rica,” the singer explained of the song in a statement. “Conceptually it leans into the idea of identity. It's probably the most melodic moment on the record, I'm really excited for the world to finally hear it!”


	Tomlison and Fallon discussed the creation of How Did I Get Here? and the sense of “relief” the singer feels having now released it. “I've been sitting on it for a while now,” he said. “There's a lot of anticipation, a lot of tension, but a lot of excitement too.”

	











	The singer reflected on whether being part of One Direction prepared him to be a solo artist. “Every moment, every memory I have of One Direction is incredibly special, obviously,” he said. “But that experience, it was relevant, but somewhat. Being in a band and doing things collectively and sharing the pressure it's a very different version of the same thing.”


	He added, “This is the record where I feel really comfortable with it. And I felt really comfortable making it. I really enjoyed the process. I'm even enjoying the promo, which is a new thing for me.”

	











	Tomlinson has been dropping Easter eggs for the album for a while. He told Fallon he tries to “imagine what it's like to be a fan” so he likes to create “as much excitement around it” as possible. He noted that the Easter eggs did confuse Taylor Swift‘s fans. 


	“I think they were thinking it was somehow related to her album,” he said. “So I got free promo for a couple days.”

How Did I Get Here? is Tomlinson's third solo album. The singer will embark on an extensive world tour in support of the LP, which will visit Europe and North America. The North American tour dates kick off on June 3 in Vancouver and continue through July 24, when the trek wraps in Miami.


	“I sum up it as ‘The record I always deserved to make,” Tomlinson said in a statement. “My bread and butter is my honesty. I genuinely wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope it comes through in the music.”

	The Civil Right Division of the Department of Justice was created in 1957 to act as the federal government's independent investigative and enforcement mechanism for civil rights law in the United States. The office oversaw landmark cases such as Brown v. Board of Education, the enforcement of voting rights for Black Americans in the desegregated South, and the investigation into the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. 


	The division may have investigated Floyd's murder in Minneapolis in 2020, but in the wake of Renee Good's killing there earlier this month, it is now more concerned with those protesting ICE's brutal, ostensibly unconstitutional conduct in the city. The Civil Rights Division's new mission is the direct result of Donald Trump retaking office, after which it cut staff and reoriented itself to focus less on the rights of the underrepresented, and more on the president's retribution agenda, the exclusion of transgender athletes from sports, and supposed slights against white, Christian Americans.

	











	Upon his reelection, Trump nominated attorney and former Fox News talking head Harmeet Dhillon to serve as assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. Dhillon, who worked as a legal adviser for Trump's 2020 campaign, moved quickly to purge the division of senior officials and dismiss a slew of ongoing cases — many focused on police brutality and law enforcement misconduct. In a series of memos, Dhillon outlined that the division would be shifting its priorities to “Keeping Men out of Women's Sports” and “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling.” 

	











	It was “really hard to write transition memos feeling like they were just going to go in the trash,” a former employee of the Civil Rights Division tells Rolling Stone. The former employee, who was granted anonymity to speak more freely about their experience, described the frenetic shuffling of staffers between departments and agencies amid the administration's early DOGE cuts and mass firings.

	“I think of the people that I worked with who filed complaints [to the DOJ] and were looking for help from the U.S. government, and just kind of completely disappeared on them,” they say. “It's particularly impactful when [it's] the U.S. government. When you're a person facing discrimination, and you'll go anywhere for help, and somebody actually answers, and then all of a sudden you never hear from them again.” 


	Many of the cases handled by the Civil Rights Division had been ongoing for years. Others were confidential, as the department tends to keep active investigations under wraps until they determine a finding is in the public interest. The staffer recalls that in one instance, they had been instructed to investigate a viral post on X “as if it was a complaint we'd receive from a citizen.” 


	Dhillon's management of the division was thrust back into the national spotlight this month after the DOJ refused to open an investigation into the killing of Renee Good, a Minneapolis mother of three who was shot and killed in her car by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Shortly after her murder, the Justice Department indicated that it would not launch a probe into the incident, with sources telling CBS News that the division's criminal section was explicitly ordered not to pursue an investigation into Good's killing — sidelining them from a case they would have typically pursued under past administrations. Instead, sources within the department told multiple outlets that the DOJ had begun investigating Good's widow, Becca Good, on allegations of impeding a federal officer and ties to activist groups. Dhillon, a prolific social media poster, boosted unfounded claims on social media that Good was associated with “Antifa”, and statements from Trump describing Good as a “professional agitator.”

	Stacey Young, founder and executive director of Justice Connection, a network of DOJ alumni, and a former senior attorney in the Civil Rights Division, tells Rolling Stone that Dhillon's management of the division — which mirrors the administration's affinity for bold declarations on television social media — is undermining the work of the department. 

	











	“They're all about clicks and PR,” Young says. “You're seeing Harmeet Dhillon not just prematurely announce investigations on social media, but threaten individuals and entities on social media.” 


	“To use the DOJs incredible power and influence to threaten people online,” she adds. “I mean, it's hard for the division to maintain any kind of integrity when its leader is willing to engage in that conduct.”


	Earlier this month, half a dozen Minnesota federal prosecutors resigned over the DOJ's  handling of Good's case. The departures included Joseph H. Thompson, who had spearheaded the state's case against a widespread network of social services fraud that has become a flashpoint in the administration's anti-immigrant messaging. 


	“When you lose top leaders in offices like that, not only do you lose their own institutional knowledge and expertise, but it's extremely destabilizing to the rest of the office,” Young explains of the mass exodus taking place throughout the Justice Department. “Some of the top folks in that U.S. Attorney's Office, and in the Civil Rights Division — you lost almost the entire leadership structure [and] that's going to crush morale among those who stay, and degrade the work that office will do going forward.” 


	As reports of ICE misconduct continue to emerge from Minnesota, — including the beating and mistreatment of detained individuals, racial profiling, and the snatching of citizens and other individuals with legal status — the focus of the DOJ is set on the actions of anti-ICE protesters.


	On Sunday, Dhillon announced a DOJ investigation into a protest held at a church in the Twin Cities area. A group of activists — along with former CNN host Don Lemon, who was covering the protest — interrupted a service at the Cities Church in St. Paul. Around 40 individuals chanted and paraded around the interior of the church, where Pastor David Easterwood — acting field director of the St. Paul ICE office — preaches. 


	The protesters chanted “ICE out!” and “David Easterwood, out now!” They then left the church and marched to a nearby alley. Right-wing commentators were quick to label the protest an instance of domestic “terrorism,” and Dhillon appeared on conservative streamer Benny Johnson's show and announced that the Civil Rights Division was investigating the incident as a potential hate crime, and was looking into charging protesters under the FACE Act and the KKK Act of 1871. 

	











	The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) is a 1994 law that prohibits the use of force or intimidation against individuals seeking abortion care, exercising their religious rights in a place of worship, as well as vandalism and destruction of reproductive clinics or places of worship. The Enforcement Act of 1871 — known as the KKK Act — prohibits certain forms of conspiracy to violate the civil rights of individuals. 


	“Whenever anyone conspires to violate the protected civil rights of American citizens, the Klan Act can be used to bring a conspiracy charge,” Dhillon told Johnson. 


	In a post on X, Dhillon directly warned Lemon that he was “on notice.” 


	“A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws! Nor does the First Amendment protect your pseudo journalism of disrupting a prayer service,” she wrote. 


	Looking to “social media to find violations” is an “absurd way to try to enforce civil rights laws,” Young, the former Civil Rights Division attorney, tells Rolling Stone. “Going about doing the division's work by social media is clownish.” Young adds that Dhillon's plans to use the FACE and KKK acts against the protesters would be a “novel use” of the laws, and that given the nonviolent nature of the protest, it was not an incident that “you'd usually see in a case the Civil Rights Division would pursue.”

	Regardless, the administration is plowing ahead. Attorney General Pam Bondi added in a separate post that “attacks against law enforcement and the intimidation of Christians are being met with the full force of federal law.If state leaders refuse to act responsibly to prevent lawlessness, this Department of Justice will remain mobilized to prosecute federal crimes and ensure that the rule of law prevails.” 


	Trump — long a critic of Lemon's — amplified calls for his arrest on Truth Social, writing that participants in the protest were “troublemakers who should be thrown in jail, or thrown out of the Country.” As of Thursday, the administration has announced the arrests of three people who participated in the protest. Despite the incident being a peaceful demonstration, members of the administration — including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel — have described it in various instances as a “riot” or an “attack” on the church. The DOJ tried to bring charges against Lemon, as well, but a federal magistrate judge rejected the move, citing First Amendment protections for Lemon in his role as a journalist.

Raye has announced that her sophomore album, This Music May Contain Hope, will land on March 27. 


	News of the aspirational offering arrived alongside a heartfelt message from the Grammy-nominated artist. “Music is medicine, I've always said that. I guess I'm in the process of making medicine for myself that I can share with the world,” said Raye. “I want us all to say to ourselves that it's going to be all right, and I'm going to have faith in the seeds that I've planted beneath the snow. I wanted to create something that is a hug, bed or soft place for that person who needs it.”


	The album will be set across four “seasons,” according to a press release, with each side of the vinyl representing a different chapter while taking listeners on a journey that begins with “darkness and ends with light.”

	Last year, Raye delayed her second album after her car, containing her prized songwriting books, was stolen. Back in October, she revealed that the car had been found — and the songbooks along with it. “It was a roller-coaster journey, but what I didn't tell everyone is the police called me maybe two or three months ago, and they were like, ‘We found your car,'” Raye told EE Official Big Top 40 From Global at the time. “Not only did I get it back, not one thing had been taken out of the car. All my songwriting books were there, untouched.”

	











	Tonight, the star is launching her 51-date arena tour, the aptly titled, This Tour May Contain New Music, and will travel to Europe, the U.K., and the United States for the international run. Rolling Stone named her trek one of the most anticipated tours of 2026, with music writer Larisha Paul noting, “The British songstress has an affinity for big band music and grand dramatic displays both onstage and in the studio, as evidenced by ‘Where Is My Husband?' and ‘Genesis.' A master entertainer and a true musician, Raye knows how to put on a show.”

	As Rolling Stone previously and dutifully reported, it had been more than 1,300 days since Harry Styles released new music before he returned on Thursday evening with new single, “Aperture.”


	The single delivers a shimmering first look at his long-awaited album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, out March 6. “It's best you know what you don't/Aperture lets the light in,” sings Styles before diving into the soaring chorus and declaring: “We belong together/It finally appears it's only love.”


	The singer previewed the song for fans who waited hours at New York's Rough Trade record store on Wednesday, Jan. 21, to be among the first to hear the lead single from the musician's upcoming LP. “As soon as I heard his voice, I was crying so much,” Lindsay, 24, told Rolling Stone at the listening party. “We've been waiting for years for his comeback.”


	The following day, Styles announced a global residency tour of 50 shows across seven cities in support of his upcoming fourth studio album. The international run will launch May 16 in Amsterdam, where he is booked to perform six shows, followed by shows in London, São Paulo, Brazil, Mexico City, and a whopping 30 shows at New York's Madison Square Garden. Styles will wrap the tour in Australia in Melbourne and Sydney.

	Last week, the star revealed that Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, was pending. Produced by Kid Harpoon, the LP will span 12 new tracks and mark Styles' fourth studio album and his first since 2022. Styles teased the announcement in his customary, enigmatic fashion, putting up billboards and posters from New York to São Paulo that quizzed onlookers, “Do you know who you are?” The signs were branded with “TPWK” at the bottom, an acronym corresponding to his single, “Treat People With Kindness” and merch from his last tour. Posters declaring “We Belong Together” also appeared in major cities worldwide.

	











	The signs also correlated with a new website from the musician, which currently invites visitors to spin a wheel to fatefully land on either “Disco” or “Kiss” — upon clicking, fans are prompted to text a number, which leads to a sign-up page to add contact information.

A mysterious triangular UFO was spotted over Area 51 in Nevada, fueling speculation about secret aircraft, drones, and classified US military projects.

An unidentified flying object has reportedly been spotted in the skies above a classified US Air Force facility in Nevada known as Area 51. A video circulating on social media shows a triangular-shaped object airborne and leaving what appears to be a contrail behind it.

According to the reports, the footage was captured using a thermal imaging device. So far, there have been no official explanations or confirmed information clarifying the nature of the object.

One theory suggests the object could be a sixth-generation aircraft being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. Unofficial reports have claimed that test flights of this platform may have begun as early as 2020. Another possibility raised is that the sighting involves a classified unmanned aerial vehicle.

The Nevada base has long been associated with testing secret US aerospace projects. Among the most notable examples is the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, which underwent trials there while remaining strictly classified for years.

Earlier, the Daily Mail reported that the US Navy's Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) may be storing an aircraft of unknown origin at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland. Sources cited by the outlet claimed that since the 1950s, the US military has been studying technologies allegedly obtained through the examination of objects of extraterrestrial origin.

The same sources also said surveillance around the base has recently been intensified after Chinese drones and other unidentified objects were allegedly spotted nearby. They further claimed that the US government has an emergency plan in place to evacuate the mysterious object should information about its location become public.

   00:54 EST 23 Jan 2026, updated  03:41 EST 23 Jan 2026    By CHRIS MELORE, US ASSISTANT SCIENCE EDITOR  

An off-the-grid explorer has spotted a mysterious UFO-shaped aircraft flying over the top secret US military base Area 51.

Anders Otteson, a self-described backpacker and videographer, was documenting his trip to the desert surrounding the infamous Nevada facility on January 14 when the unidentified craft was seen flying overhead at around 3am local time (6am ET).

Otteson had already seen what appeared to be a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber flying over Area 51 two hours earlier and noted that this craft was shaped more like an 'equilateral triangle,' which UFO researchers have called the 'Dorito.'

Moreover, a scanner monitoring Area 51's unencrypted radio frequencies picked up a bizarre transmission full of code words themed around beer, food, and snacks instead of standard military jargon.

Otteson noted that this isn't the first time the mystery aircraft has been seen flying over the US.

Twice in 2014, photographers caught the same Dorito-shaped object on camera, revealing that the craft looked nothing like the US military's current stealth bomber planes or known drones.

Area 51 has been involved in the development and testing of revolutionary and experimental aircraft for decades, including the F-117 Nighthawk, America's first stealth bomber.

The explorer claimed that the latest sighting of the Dorito adds to recent reports of triangle-shaped objects seen over Southern California and Death Valley, near the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) where Area 51 sits.

On his Uncanny Expeditions YouTube channel, Otteson said he was camping in the Tikaboo Valley of the Nevada desert, on public land near Groom Lake Road, which overlooks Area 51's restricted airspace and front gate area when the Dorito appeared.

Around 1am local time, he spotted and filmed what appeared to be the B-2 flying overhead from the northwest, which had allegedly originated from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.

Hours later, Otteson observed the second aircraft performing a low flyover from the northwest, passing directly over his position before continuing onward.

The Dorito triangle's flight path was consistent with a low-altitude pass over the area like other military aircraft, though the explorer wasn't able to determine its exact heading. 

Although the B-2 has a similar V-wing design, the Dorito had a drastically different body, with a noticeably flatter trailing edge, no wings, or jagged rear section like the stealth bomber.

'Are we looking at a classified test flight or run-of-the-mill training sortie?' Otteson said. 'I certainly think we have something interesting here.'

The mystery sighting over Area 51 played out very much like the Dorito sightings in 2014; one captured by photographer Jeff Templin in Wichita, Kansas and another by photographer Steve Douglas in Amarillo, Texas.

Both showed similar unidentified triangle-shaped aircraft that looked unlike known Air Force planes or drones. The main difference was this new incident took place over a base infamously tied to UFO sightings since the 1950s.

As for the strange radio code picked up on fellow UFO researcher Joerg Arnu's scanner, military personnel at Area 51 were heard using words such as 'pretzel snack,' 'corona pretzel snacks zero with cheese,' 'profile Michelob,' 'Imperial with garlic,' and 'fridge hydrate' to mask what they were saying.

While the familiar flight path of the Dorito and the military code words point to the craft being a manmade aircraft, triangle-shaped UFOs have been a frequent sighting over the US for decades.

According to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), there have been 10 UFO sightings throughout the US in January that mention a triangle-shaped object flying overhead.

Unlike the Dorito over Area 51 hover, the UFOs has bright or flashing lights that could be seen clearly by witnesses on the ground.

Overall, there have been 85 triangle-shaped UFO reports since November 2025 throughout the world, including in the UK, Canada, Germany, and Brazil. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

A school student's personal testimony anchors “Postmortem”, a stage production that turns a child's experience into a wider examination of social pressure, parental expectation, and the quiet violence of a success-driven urban life.

The play will be staged on Saturday at 7:00pm at the main stage of the National Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.

“Postmortem” is the fifth production of the University of Asia Pacific Drama Club and is written and directed by Fahim Maleque Evan. The narrative unfolds through the voice of a school-going child, using individual memory as a way to map broader social contradictions. Rather than offering spectacle, the production relies on close observation and restraint to show how institutional and familial pressures shape children long before they are old enough to resist them.

At its centre, the play interrogates a competitive social order that treats examinations as battlegrounds and achievement as survival. It raises direct questions about the responsibilities of parents, the emotional costs of ambition, and the fragile relationship between care and control. By framing these tensions through a child's account, “Postmortem” exposes conflicts that are often dismissed as routine until their consequences become irreversible.

Speaking about the production, Evan said, “At a time when the cultural sphere feels stalled due to various constraints, I believe a production like this by a private university drama club can still play a meaningful role in society.” The remark reflects both the play's social intent and a broader belief in theatre's ability to intervene where public conversation has grown muted.

All roles in “Postmortem” are performed by members of the University of Asia Pacific Drama Club. The ensemble-driven approach reinforces the production's emphasis on collective experience rather than individual heroics. Performances are grounded in lived familiarity, keeping attention on narrative clarity and emotional precision.

Lighting design is by Faruk Khan Titu, while costume design has been handled by Sajia Afrin Lubna. The background music has been composed and planned by Evan himself, ensuring a cohesive tonal framework that supports the play's themes without overwhelming them. Overall management of the production is overseen by DSWO.

The choice of the title “Postmortem” is deliberate. The play does not offer comfort or an easy resolution. Instead, it asks what remains after damage has already been done—when values are examined too late, and silence has already taken its toll. It invites audiences to consider how pressure is absorbed, normalised, and passed down, often without acknowledgement.

Spooky Time members, left to right, Matthew Tinsley, Jared Diehl, Easton May, Zack Peck, and Austin Yewell.

You do not need to believe in ghosts to get hooked on Spooky Time Paranormal at RealSpookyTime on YouTube, but you might start wondering if something unexplained is lurking just around the corner.

The creators behind the channel are Logan Countians Matthew Tinsley, Austin Yewell, Zack Peck, Easton May, and Jared Diehl. They say the name of their channel started as nothing more than a running joke among friends.

“Halloween has always been my favorite time,” Tinsley said. “I would constantly say, ‘It's finally spooky time,' and eventually everyone else picked it up. The joke just stuck and it became the perfect name.”

The idea to take paranormal investigating seriously goes back even further to a night they still talk about.

“We were just hanging out at this house nearby,” Tinsley said, speaking for the others in Spooky Time as well as himself. “Totally normal night until suddenly it was not. Something happened that none of us could explain and it is one of those moments that sticks with you forever. That is really when we realized the paranormal might be more real than we thought.”

From that night on, the group decided to explore those questions together. They describe their style on camera as a mix of honest reactions, real friendship, and the kind of nervous humor that spills out when things get too spooky.

“We are not overly serious on camera,” Tinsley admitted, “but we take the places, the history, and the people connected to these locations very seriously. Our goal has always been to show what we experience honestly while still letting our personalities shine through.”

Their travels take them all over Kentucky and Tennessee, where they say there is an endless list of historic and supposedly haunted places. They have explored everything from old hospitals and jails to sanatoriums and forgotten homes tucked deep into rural towns.

What this group loves most are the locations no one else pays attention to.

“We try to find places that have not been investigated a thousand times,” said Tinsley. “Those hidden spots usually have the best stories.”

Two of their most memorable recent projects include their investigation of the Capitol Theatre in Bowling Green, where they later hosted a public premiere and a trip into an abandoned coal mine in eastern Kentucky.

“The mine really stuck with us,” said Tinsley. “You walk in and immediately feel the history. It meant everything to that small community. Even though it has been shut down for years, people still talk about it with pride. That kind of emotional weight is powerful.”

For Spooky Time Paranormal, history is what guides every investigation.

“Before we ever step inside a building, we research everything we can,” Tinsley explained. “If you do not understand the history, you miss the context behind the activity people report.” That is especially true, they said, in places like Logan County. “Areas with deep roots and long histories have stories layered into them. You feel that before you ever pick up a camera."" 

During investigations, the members tend to use tools that allow for interactive moments, especially the spirit box. “Some of our funniest moments come from that thing,” said Tinsley. “Sometimes the responses match exactly what we are asking and sometimes we just look at each other like, ‘What did it just say?' It is chaos, but fun chaos.”

Behind the scenes, this fun group of gentlemen take preparation seriously.

“People think we just show up somewhere creepy and start filming,” Tinsley joked. “No. There is planning, research, talking to property managers, safety guidelines, walkthroughs, everything.”

They say safety always comes first, especially when working in old structures with unknown hazards. Respect is another major priority.

According to Tinsley and the others, these sites matter to people and they treat every location like it belongs to someone who cares deeply about it. They are not there to make a mess or stir things up. They are there to tell its story even if that means freaking out on camera a little.

Support from viewers across Kentucky and Tennessee has been better than the men ever expected.

Friends, family, strangers online—everyone has been incredible, according to the group. They also welcome skeptics.

“We get it. Honestly, we were skeptics ourselves before we started doing this. We do not expect everyone to believe what we believe. We just like when people watch and ask questions,"" Tinsley said.

Preserving and sharing local history has become one of the strongest parts of their mission.

The spooky fellas add that a lot of locations already come with legends or rumors. Some of it is true, some is not, but every story says something about the people who lived there.

The Capitol Theatre in Bowling Green is a perfect example, according to the spooky team. “People whispered about it being haunted for years. Getting invited in to explore it and then getting to show our findings to the public meant a lot to us,” they said.

Looking ahead, the team hopes to focus more on their own community.

“Logan County is filled with stories we grew up hearing,” said Tinsley. “Some of these legends have been around forever but have not been looked into the way we do it on our channel. We would love to change that.”

The spooky sleuths believe paranormal stories stick around in small towns because they become part of shared identity. “In places like this, stories get passed down. It keeps everyone curious. And honestly, that curiosity is what keeps us doing what we do. We want to understand the stories people have been whispering about for generations,” Tinsley said.

For Matthew, Austin, Zack, Easton, and Jared, the heart of Spooky Time will always be the same: real friendship, real reactions, local history, and a deep respect for the communities who trust them with their stories.

Whenever the team investigates somewhere, especially in Logan County, they want people to know they are treating it with care. They are there to document, explore, and tell these stories the right way.

Whether you believe in ghosts or not, watching them explore these old theaters, coal mines, and hidden corners makes you feel like you are right there with them, holding your breath, laughing, and wondering if maybe, just maybe, there is something out there waiting to be discovered.

By Jake Howarth


Yukon-born television producer Shirley McLean is gathering ghost stories from across the territory as she prepares a pitch for a new paranormal documentary series, aiming to deliver her proposal to network executives by March 1, 2026.

McLean, a member of the Carcross/Tagish First Nation now based in Vancouver, told the News she is developing the project to pitch to Blue Ant Media, which operates the streaming platform Haunt TV. She has also produced programs for the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network and previously worked there as a reporter.

The working title, Yukon Paranormal, reflects her goal of building a series centred entirely on Yukoners recounting their own encounters with spirits, haunting and unexplained activity, she said.

McLean said the show would differ from other paranormal programs because it is rooted in northern stories, Yukon locations and the territory's long-standing sense of lore. She is currently in the development phase, gathering stories, subjects and locations rather than filming a pilot.

The pitch is expected to outline the show's tone, structure and potential episodes. If approved, she said production could begin in the fall or next spring.

One of the locations she hopes to feature is the Caribou Hotel in Carcross, which she described as “active”. She told the News her family has long-standing ties to the building, including relatives who worked there.

McLean said she has heard stories connected to the hotel dating back generations, including accounts passed down from her grandmother and aunt. She also noted that some residents living near the former residential school site in Carcross have reported paranormal activity.

Other areas she is exploring include Carcross, Whitehorse, Takhini North, Pelly Crossing, and Dawson City, where she hopes to speak with people familiar with the Macaulay House.

McLean said she is looking for stories that go beyond casual sightings, including experiences that frightened people or involved entities people could not explain. She added that she has heard accounts connected to the old Yukon News building at 211 Wood Street in Whitehorse.

McLean is seeking scary ghost stories from Yukoners and wants to help put the territory “on the map” in unscripted television beyond the Gold Rush genre. She said the project is Yukon-wide and open to anyone with a compelling story.

McLean is the sole producer attached so far, drawing on seven years in unscripted television, including previous paranormal programs. She said many of the people she is speaking with are Yukoners she already knows, including some from her home community of Carcross.

New research suggests liquid water may exist on tidally locked exoplanets beyond classic habitable zones. (CREDIT: NASA Astrobiology Institute)

For many years, astronomers have been looking for extraterrestrial life. In doing so, astronomers have narrowed their search to a small “habitable zone” around stars. This habitable zone defines the region in which the temperature of a planet is likely to be warm enough, but not too warm, for liquid water to exist at the surface of the planet.

By analyzing the data in a recent paper published in Astrophysical Journal, Professor Amri Wandel from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem argues that this long-held assumption may actually be too conservative. It may easily dismiss planets that once seemed inhospitable to liquid water as potentially habitable planets because they might still have liquid water on their surfaces.

Wandel's studies were focused mainly on planets orbiting two types of stellar names, M Dwarf Stars and K Dwarf Stars. These stars are both smaller and cooler than our Sun and make up the majority of stellar types in our galaxies.

The majority of M and K Dwarf Stars are excellent targets for exoplanet detecting. The planets orbiting these stars transit more frequently. They can be easily detected and studied with instruments like the James Webb Telescope, etc. Therefore, they appear to have tremendous potential for finding and studying exoplanets.

However, most of the exoplanets orbiting M and K Dwarf Stars look very different than Earth. Almost all of these planets are “tidally locked.” A planet that is tidally locked is a planet that has one side always facing its host star. The other side of the planet remains in perpetual dark.

Experts once argued that a planet that is tidally locked would not likely be a good candidate for life because of the extreme temperature difference between the two sides of the planet. For instance, one side may have “scorching heat.” The opposite side would have “freezing temperatures.” This would make it impossible for the atmosphere to exist on the planet due to atmospheric collapse.

However, Wandel argues that this assumption is incorrect by performing a comparison of the heat flow on such planets using his analytical climate model. ""We found that the amount of heat circulating from the dayside of a planet to the nightside is more efficient than previously thought. If there is sufficient transfer of heat, more than a hemisphere's worth of the dark hemispheres on most worlds can be affected when they are closer to their stars using traditional models of astronomy,"" he explained to The Brighter Side of News.

Instead of just focusing on how warm or cold a world can get on average, Wandel's study also looks at the ability of any part of the surface within that planet's orbit to support permanent liquid water under the same conditions.

In a tidally locked world, the nightside of the world might be the only place to support liquid water.

In addition, Wandel's research has provided further understanding of previously observed phenomena based on the work of the James Comet Mike Space Telescope. This telescope has been able to detect the presence of gaseous forms of water (H₂O), as well as many gases associated with liquid water, in the atmospheres of warm, nearby, super-Earth-type planets orbiting around M-dwarf stars. 

These are mostly found within what would generally be considered an inner boundary of the habitable zone. Due to these observations, it is now difficult to state that there should be no evidence to support the idea that H₂O would survive around such star systems.

In addition to the inner edge of the habitable zone being able to accommodate places for the presence of H₂O in its gaseous form, Wandel's research also extends the outer edge of the habitable zone outwards. On other worlds within our solar system, for example Earth, there could be evidence for permanent liquid water being located under the covering of thick, ice-crusted layers. It could also exist below the covering of a permanent ice-frosted layer. 

If conditions were to allow for sufficient subsurface pressure to build up during ice onset or onset of maximum freezing temperatures, such as when subglacial or intraglacial lakes were present, these places where permanent liquid water might have existed would also mean that there are places on these worlds where there is a chance of continued existence of permanent liquid water. This could occur despite atmospheric or environmental conditions remaining frozen.

While water is viewed as the most important of all life-supporting compounds, it is only one of several critical needs that living systems have for proper functioning. These needs ultimately include both chemical energy and long-term stability.

Traditional limits of habitability are typically based on two different sets of legibility limits. The inner limit represents the point of maximum water vapor loss through atmospheric escape. The outer limit represents the point at which any planet has frozen over completely.

This study proposed a simpler approach for estimating the habitability of exoplanets around different types of stars. The luminosity of main-sequence stars is directly related to the size and temperature of those stars. Main-sequence stars are in the process of fusing hydrogen to helium in their cores. This relationship means that their luminosities can be positively correlated to their mass and size.

Using the relationships established in this study, scaling laws can be devised for estimating the location on exoplanets that would support habitable conditions. This can be done without the necessity of performing complex climate models.

The intention of such an approach is to aid researchers in directing future observations. It is not intended to provide a substitute for the more detailed models.

A major conclusion of this work is that, generally, tidal locks on exoplanets are more likely to have habitable conditions at their star than those that have a faster rotation. These are exoplanets that are constantly in orbit around the same planet at the same distance from their star. In contrast, planets with a day-length cycle comparable to the rotation of a solar system every one to two years are less likely to be habitable when compared to Earth.

Whereas previously researchers tended to consider whether or not the entire zone would be too hot, Wandel proposed that researchers ask themselves if some part will remain cool enough.

In summary, the research has provided two potential scenarios. The first scenario is the presence of liquid water on the surface of the planet. The second scenario involves the possibility of the presence of frozen water beneath a solidified nightside of an exoplanet. This could occur even though the conditions at the surface may be entirely extreme.

Two parameters are established as frames for this study. One of these is the Heating Factor, which incorporates stellar energy, surface reflectivity (albedo), and greenhouse warming. The other is the Heat Transport Fraction, which describes how much incoming energy is distributed uniformly across the planet.

In the case of various heavenly bodies, drastically different ratios exist with respect to heat transport. For instance, with regard to Mars, close to 85 percent of the energy that is absorbed by Mars is distributed globally. On the other hand, Mercury absorbs nearly 100 percent of its received energy. There is little to no global redistribution of that energy.

Utilizing moderate heat transport values, the author deduces that liquid water on the night side of a planet could remain viable for many planets. This would apply to planets that receive multiple times the solar energy received by Earth.

Additionally, according to the research, a tidally locked planet could occupy an orbit nearly three times closer to the parent star than the inner boundary defined by conservative estimates. It could still maintain liquid water on its night side.

Before establishing a definition for habitability linked to location or distance, the author Wandel established definitions for habitability that were based instead on heating. This heating refers to energy input produced from incoming stellar energy. It represents the amount of energy reaching the planet from its parent star. It also includes the surface reflectivity (albedo) and the greenhouse warming effect.

With the heating-based model of habitability, habitability is defined by the extent to which a planet falls within the range of temperature between freezing and boiling. This range is related to its surroundings. All of this holds true in locations that are permanently covered by ice. It also applies in regions where there is water below the planet's surface.

This study proposed various atmospheric patterns. Examples include hot day-side and cool night-side waters.

There are also other important findings from this research that have implications for searching for extrasolar planets. Based on previous studies, M-dwarf systems are easier to study than other types of stars. Thus, the findings of this research indicate that many more planets orbiting M-dwarfs will likely contain water.

If scientists do not have access to the atmospheric data of the exoplanets, the study suggests using infrared measurements of the exoplanets. This can serve as a method of testing for the presence of exoplanets with substantial atmospheres.

In this situation, scientists can use the heat transport to determine whether the basic atmospheric condition has a significant effect on the temperatures on the day and night sides. If the pattern, or heat transport subsystem, can be identified, then it supports the idea that a significant amount of atmosphere exists.

Finally, the recent discoveries of water vapour on close-in planets may suggest that there may be night-side or subsurface oceans of water on the planets. These are exoplanets orbiting stars. If this holds true, this would support an even broader definition of habitability than the currently accepted definition.

According to Wandel, based on the research findings, there may be far more potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs and K-dwarfs than was previously theorized by conservative model estimates. In fact, the difference in potentially habitable exoplanets between M-dwarfs and Sun-like stars could be as great as a factor of 50.



Research findings are available online in the Astrophysical Journal.

A retro supernatural slasher that evokes the raw, low-budget chaos of 1980s horror staples, director Gabriel Bernini's Blood Barn is coming to Screambox in less than one month.

Blood Barn will be streaming exclusively on Screambox beginning February 17.

The film embraces the grit and immediacy of low budget filmmaking, prioritizing practical creature effects and the handmade fun of classic cabin-in-the-woods splatter fests. The result is nostalgic and feral, a love letter to do-it-yourself horror and tape-trading cult cinema.

Slash into the trailer for Blood Barn below and stream in February 17!

Set during the summer of 1985, Blood Barn follows Josie, a camp counselor who reunites her closest friends for one last weekend together at her family's secluded barn before they head off to college. What begins as a nostalgic getaway quickly feels off when the group realizes the property has been neglected for years – carrying with it a history Josie would rather forget.

As the weekend unfolds, restless energy, bad decisions, and curiosity about the barn's past stir something unnatural. Strange and violent events erupt without warning, turning the peaceful escape into chaos when a malevolent force awakens and begins to tear the group apart.

As the night spirals out of control, Josie is forced to confront the legacy surrounding the barn before it consumes everyone.

Campy horror-comedy throwback Blood Barn is written and directed by Gabriel Bernini, co-written by Alexandra Jade. The cast includes Chloe Cherry (“Euphoria”), Lena Redford, Bambina, Sam Lanier, Felipe Di Poi, Pierce Campion, and Simon Paris.

‘The Twisted Child' marks Goan author Mario Coelho's return to short fiction two years after ‘Moonlight And Shadow', his first collection of unsettling tales for adults. His new book comprises 12 short stories that move into the terrain of mystery and the supernatural, dark, but not quite horror. Set in Goa, the stories are populated by recognisable characters and everyday situations, drawing readers in through familiarity before leading them towards the unexpected. The stories are dark but not frightening, each with a twist as Mario strikes that balance as a writer. “Some of the stories are a little frightening, but not so much that they'll keep you awake at night. I myself don't mind reading stories that are a little scary, but I shy away from downright horror. I don't want to have nightmares when I sleep,” says Mario. Each story can be read on its own, but all are closely tied to Goa and its surroundings with characters that most readers would relate to, whether a village drunkard, a hardworking toddy tapper or the elderly woman living alone in her heritage home. Published by Goa 1556, several stories in ‘The Twisted Child' are inspired by experiences shared with Mario by friends, acquaintances and even strangers. Once a sceptic, he admits these encounters forced him to reconsider his disbelief in the supernatural. “I never used to believe in ghosts, but after listening to people, both friends and strangers, who've spoken of their supernatural experiences, I've had to do a rethink. And many of the stories were so fascinating that I had to weave them into a story of my own. It would have been such a waste if I hadn't. Usually, I take the basic experience that the person has had, and weave a completely different story from that experience, as I did with the title story ‘The Twisted Child'. Imagination has a lot to do with this process, and that is simply a gift; I don't take any credit for it.” Known for his children's books ‘Daksh, the Dancing Dragon' and ‘The Cats Who Loved to Dance', this is Mario's second collection of stories after ‘Moonlight and Shadow.' Speaking about why mystery and the supernatural as genres remain underexplored locally, Mario explains, “I've been reading the works of Goan writers like Tino D'Sa, José Lourenço, Sheela Jaywant and Kaustubh Naik, to name a few. These are all immensely talented and entertaining writers. From Mangalore, Dr Geralyn Pinto's writing, is extraordinary. Much of Goan writing, including the works of Damodar Mauzo (Bhai) is what I would call ‘slice of life' or vignettes of Goan culture and society. You can smell the earth in their stories, taste the tang of curry and spice, and inhale the fragrance of the soil after the first rains. But as to why mystery and the supernatural are largely unexplored genres in Goan writing, the honest answer to that is: I don't know. Maybe I alone have a dark soul, who knows?” Mario began writing seriously at the age of 46. Despite the challenges of publishing, he says “It is easier to know the mind of the Almighty than that of a top publishing house.” Looking ahead, Mario has no shortage of plans. “Tentatively titled ‘Avigail – Tales of a Darker Night' is another book of tales with a twist. In April or May this year, HarperCollins will be bringing out a book, written by me, on the Vikram & Betaal mythological series. We are thinking of calling it ‘Betaal Pachchisi'. These will comprise 25 stories, written almost entirely in verse, and profusely illustrated,” he informs. What keeps him going is simple and honest. “First, the fact that I'm putting my talent to good use. Secondly, that I'm entertaining people. Thirdly, the fact that someday I'll be widely read and well known; fame and recognition are important to me. And lastly, that I am weaving or crafting narratives, whether children's stories or dark tales, which are of a certain quality. That is the most important thing to me, above everything else,” concludes Mario. (Mario Coelho will launch his latest book, ‘The Twisted Child: Tales of the Unexpected', at Broadway Book Centre, Panjim, on Thursday, January 29 at 5 pm. The event will also feature a session titled The Art and Craft of the Short Story, with speakers Tino de Sa, Sheela Jaywant, Bina Nayak, José Lourenço and Mario Coelho.)

RFK Jr. speaking at George Washington University, Nov. 17, 2025Turning Point USA



As US health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn a lot of attention for promoting pseudoscience and disproven theories, especially on vaccines. He is using that playbook on another major public health issue: gun violence, which remains the leading cause of death for kids in America. When it comes to school shootings and other mass shootings, here's what RFK Jr. wants you to believe: It's not the guns, he argues, it's the pills.

The fringe theory that antidepressants can cause people to turn violent has been around for decades, focused primarily on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which are the most common class of these drugs. But extensive research by mental health and violence prevention experts has found no credible evidence that antidepressants cause or contribute to mass shootings.

As I wrote recently, the history of how this failed theory gained attention online is also telling:

The generalized claim that SSRIs can make people violent—and that they supposedly gave rise to the shootings epidemic—traces in part to an unscientific anti-Prozac campaign in the 1990s from the Church of Scientology and gained some traction in online forums after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. Disgraced conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who helped create a miasma of lies claiming that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was faked, has also peddled the theory.



Proponents of the SSRI theory use anecdotal, often unconfirmed details about shooters' health histories to argue causation. But multiple studies from experts in psychiatry, law enforcement, and public health show that the theory has no merit. Data on shooters spanning more than a decade from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit has been used specifically to examine the claim that psychiatric drugs are at the root of school shootings; independent researchers concluded from the FBI data that “most school shooters were not previously treated with psychotropic medications—and even when they were, no direct or causal association was found.”

In the above video, I show how RFK, Jr. has been using his top government post to continue spreading the failed theory—a misinformation campaign in which he makes at least a half dozen false or misleading claims about guns, psychiatric drugs, and mass shootings.

Alexis Wilkins rubbishes conspiracy theories concerning her relationship and insists: ‘I've never been to Israel. There's not a stamp in my passport'

Removed from bookmarks

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Alexis Wilkins, the girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel, has denied being an Israeli spy tasked with ensnaring her partner in a “honey trap,” as baseless conspiracy theories about their relationship continue to swirl online.

Wilkins, 27, a conservative pundit and country singer, has already sued three right-wing influencers for promoting the lie about her relationship with Patel, 45, which also attracted controversy last year after it was reported he had used a government jet to travel to watch her sing at a wrestling event.

Asked about her alleged Mossad connection in a new interview with Vanity Fair, Wilkins reportedly rolled her eyes and answered: “It was widespread character assassination. People assume that because you're already public, absolutely everything about you is fair game. The input is unimaginable. I've never been to Israel. There's not a stamp in my passport.”

She speculated that the falsehood might have arisen from her past work with PragerU, whose CEO, Marissa Streit, has claimed to have served in the Israeli military's spying arm.

“They're like, ‘Well, Marissa must have just gotten surgery to look like someone else, and this is now Alexis, and they placed her with Kash,'” Wilkins said. 

“It's just very confusing to me. That was a theory that was more widespread than I was comfortable with it being because that's insane. How are this many people thinking this is true?”

When Vanity Fair suggested to Wilkins that she may be at least partly responsible for the climate of misinformation she now finds herself a victim of – she having previously promoted President Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 presidential election and other untruths about Covid-19, January 6, and the war in Ukraine – she answered dismissively.

“I don't think it's a straight line back to Trump or his ascent or his presidency,” Wilkins said. “I think that we have arrived at a unique time in politics where people have so much information, they can look up anything.”

She previously denied the Israel allegation in good humor during an appearance on SiriusXM's The Megyn Kelly Show last July, saying that she was “shocked” when she first heard it, but was more concerned by the fact that: “It's accusing me of manipulating the person that I'm with, that I love. You know, that's a horrible accusation.”

Pressed by Kelly “for the record” on whether or not she was an operative for a foreign government, she laughed and said: “Definitely not. That is a firm ‘no' on that front.”

She and Patel also previously discussed their “love story” on a MAGA podcast hosted by Katie Miller, wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller, which had the misfortune to drop in mid-December when the bureau was engaged in a manhunt for the person behind the shooting at Brown University.

The episode's timing attracted criticism, notably from Laura Loomer, and only reinforced the perception that the FBI is “rudderless” under Patel's command and that he is “in over his head.”

Elsewhere in the Vanity Fair interview, Wilkins discussed her experience growing up in the U.K., Switzerland, and Arkansas, and reflected on the often surreal and occasionally disturbing nature of being in a relationship with the director of the FBI.

“We had a beautiful Christmas with family, which was wonderful and normal and good to make some normal, great family memories,” she said. “Then someone got arrested for threatening to execute me. It's scary. There's no point at which you get used to that or that it feels good.”

She added that she felt people have gone after her as a means of attacking Patel, commenting, “I think it's sad that people have figured out that they can try to use me to get to him in the press.

“I don't have a lot of skeletons in my closet. I'm not someone who hopes that something doesn't come out.”

Asked about having to have a security detail, Wilkins said: “It's definitely strange. Everyone's doing their best to make it as normal as possible because, contrary to what seems to get reported, it's not the most comfortable thing, especially when you're not someone who… I'm not doing a job that warrants it. 

“It was determined – outside of Kash and I, agents who are experts at this stuff – that that was necessary. And so here we are.”

A concise essay explores the core reasons there is so much corruption and manipulation in our world and gives inspiring ideas on what we can do to create a brighter future.  

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. 

Don't lose hope. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Here's one paragraph of this poetic writing. 

""Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.""

John Seigel-Boettner ... has been coordinating the local chapter of Cycling Without Age (CWA) since 2019. Effortlessly charming and still ferociously fit at 70-years-old, he gives rides at least twice a week. Though the people who ride upfront don't pedal, he doesn't call them “passengers” but “riding partners” to emphasize the program's spirit of companionship. “Cycling Without Age is about connection,” Seigel-Boettner says. “It's about the conversations between pilot and partner, and the connection with everyone we meet along the way.” While anybody can ride for free, CWA prioritizes riders with limited mobility. Seigel-Boettner's youngest rider was a five-year-old boy on a feeding tube who wanted to ride to school with his friends. “We provided that,” he says, “and it made him very happy.” Sometimes, his riders have lost their ability to speak at all. When Seigel-Boettner rides with someone experiencing memory loss, the words might fade away, but not the emotional resonance. The vibrations, the breeze, watching the passing world together become their shared language. “They see a flower, or the ocean, or a bird, and suddenly a memory surfaces,” Seigel-Boettner says. CWA is much more than a lovely idea. A 2020 study found that participants experienced measurable improvements in mood and well-being after rides. The trishaw excursion is a chance to be seen again, not as a diagnosis but a person, not a burden but a being alive in the world.

The mainstream press often downplays how ineffective, harmful, and wasteful our current national security strategy is. While entrenched bureaucracy are partly responsible for this, deeper covert actions and major cover-ups within the military-intelligence complex continue to remain largely hidden from public awareness.

We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it. When we can recognize what's pushing us — in our personal lives and as a society — we already have a degree of freedom from it. Challenging information can paradoxically remind us of the greater good. It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that brings these injustices to light—fueling open dialogue and constructive action.

In Montana, a focus on restorative justice is reducing juvenile recidivism through a nonprofit program that engages them, rather than punishes them. The nonprofit believes that it's actually far more challenging for juvenile offenders to look their victims in the eye and explain why they behaved antisocially than it is to simply serve a suspension from school, where they're distanced from friends and mentors, and often fall behind in their education. The Center for Restorative Youth Justice (CRYJ), is not a new organization, but their influence in Montana is growing. CRYJ receives referrals from Youth Court probation officers, school administrators, or school resource officers made on behalf of a juvenile offender who's broken the law. CRYJ then has a conference with the youth and their parent or guardian, and creates a tailormade program of restorative justice. This can involve peer group discussion, victim-offender meetings, and other situations where the youth is given the forum to reestablish a relationship with the community, rather than something like a school suspension. CRYJ believes that by limiting the overuse of exclusionary discipline and emphasizing a community-driven approach, it can help at-risk youth avoid falling behind in school. We spend a lot of time separating people after there's been harm, but often the deepest healing and learning and moving forward can happen ... when we can actually come together and talk about what happened and how to make things right.

The World Economic Forum in Davos has an unofficial dress code: neutral colors, sensible shoes, and quiet-luxury pieces built for subzero temperatures.

Jolie Hunt, however, doesn't follow it.

The 47-year-old founder and CEO of the communications firm Hunt & Gather, who has made more than 20 trips to the global leadership event, has turned Switzerland into her personal runway.

At this year's WEF, Hunt wore a mix of form-fitting dresses, statement heels, and designer bags — a far cry from the simple winter coat-and-boot combos seen throughout the town.

""I can't tell you how many people stop me in my tracks and say, 'I love what you're wearing,'"" Hunt told Business Insider.

Her outfits have made her one of the most fashionable people you'll find in Davos as the world's elite, from business to government leaders, convene.

Hunt's standout fashion is on display from the moment she leaves New York City.

""I always travel in black,"" she said. ""I like a theme, and I don't like any loose ends. I'm sure I was French in a former life.""

This year, she departed for Davos on January 18, wearing a $1,650 Balenciaga hoodie with fur trim, leather pants, and silver Givenchy sneakers. She also had two Louis Vuitton luggage pieces in hand.

""I never check a bag,"" she said. ""It's one of my super skills. I pick a theme for what I'm going to wear, down to my pajamas. Everything has a job and a purpose, so there's never any fluff.""

This trip, she chose red as her statement color and packed shoes and accessories that complemented her chosen outfits.

One of the first she wore at Davos comprised a $3,390 printed minidress from Balmain, sheer tights, $575 Larroudé x Libertine pumps, and an Hermès bag.

""It's a black crocodile Birkin; it's very special,"" she said. ""I wouldn't usually bring it on a trip, but it matches everything, and I'm with all the masters of the universe, so I might as well bring out the big guns.""

She wore the dress on Monday to host an event she calls the Stragglers Dinner, which brings together members of various companies and media outlets.

On Wednesday, she wore a $1,195 red Sportmax dress beneath a $3,990 Balenciaga coat, which she bought specifically for her trip to Davos.

She accessorized with her Hermès bag, knee-high boots, and sheer Saint Sass tights with the word ""killer"" printed on the thigh.

""I'm in my 'optimized for joy' part of life,"" she said. ""Maybe this comes with age and status, but I think getting a little bit older and having done this a bunch, I feel much freer in my [fashion] choices.""

She wore the look to attend Cisco's Women in Tech breakfast, to get drinks with company executives, and to attend the Semafor Media Party, among other events.

Hunt was also wearing the outfit during our phone interview, during which someone stopped her to compliment the look.

In Hunt's experience, flashy outfits are uncommon at the World Economic Forum.

""Nobody wears color. It's honestly depressing,"" she said. ""You look in a room, and you don't see a single person who's not wearing navy, gray, or black — men and women.""

She attributes that to a few things. First, the city's icy weather makes wearing heels, dresses, and other fashion pieces impractical. Second, the event is rather reserved in nature.

""For years, this was kind of a boys' club,"" Hunt said. ""Men dressed very conservatively, and I think as women became matriculated into the program, they also kept it conservative. We didn't want to ruffle too many feathers.""

With every outfit, though, Hunt is changing that. She said her outfits bring her confidence and energy.

""In places like this, it's a little bit survival of the fittest, if I'm honest,"" she said. ""Everybody's either eyeing up your affiliation, your look, or what you can do for them. Fashion is the quickest signal that you're either intimidating, interesting, or a whole host of other things.""

Fully remote jobs aren't as easy to come by as they might've been during the pandemic remote work boom. But they're still out there.

 Recent data from FlexJobs, a jobs site for remote roles, shows the fields where these fully remote jobs are growing fastest.

""Workers want to work remotely,"" Toni Frana, career expert manager, tells CNBC Make It. Companies ""know that it makes sense to offer work flexibility like remote work to help them attract and retain talent.""

In FlexJobs' Remote Work Index, 85% of professionals called remote work the biggest factor that would make them apply to a job, ahead of competitive pay and benefits.

Analyzing more than 60 career categories, FlexJobs compared the total number of 100% remote job postings between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2025 to identify the 15 fastest-growing fields for fully remote jobs. FlexJobs defines a ""fully remote job"" as a professional-level role allowing someone to perform their job responsibilities entirely from home. Each field showed at least 19% growth in fully remote job postings in 2025.

FlexJobs' report notes the list ""excludes long-time leaders in the remote space,"" like IT, customer service and project management roles in order to highlight emerging fields where remote work is quickly growing.

""There are remote opportunities but the competition for each of those remote roles is pretty high,"" says Frana. To boost their chances, workers applying for these positions should focus on learning in-demand skills for these roles and demonstrating their impact in prior roles on their resumes and in interviews. Particularly for remote roles, candidates also want to show they can ""work really effectively as independently as possible with less manager oversight,"" Frana says.

Here are the 15 fields seeing the quickest growth in fully remote work, according to FlexJobs' report:

In this article

The future of the booming obesity drug market won't hinge on drugs that deliver greater weight loss alone. 

Top executives from drugmakers big and small told CNBC that the next phase of the space will be defined by a broader range of treatment options and improved access for patients. Those were among the themes that emerged at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco during interviews with top brass from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and other drugmakers. 

""We really see the obesity market going from, in this year, a one-size-fits-all kind of idea to different medicines for different patients. We don't have a crystal ball to know how that all sorts out,"" Dan Skovronsky, Eli Lilly's chief scientific officer, told CNBC in an interview at the conference.

""But I think by presenting people with options, they'll pick for themselves with their doctors, and I think we want to have something for everyone,"" he continued. ""And we're not done yet."" 

Over the coming years, executives expect an expanding menu of obesity treatments that can be tailored to an individual patient's needs — from pills and less-frequent injections to combination regimens and drugs designed to preserve muscle mass while promoting weight loss. Some also expect the direct-to-consumer market to become an even larger slice of the market, while hoping that hurdles preventing patients from getting treatment continue to fall.

Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are widely credited with establishing the market through their weekly GLP-1 injections for obesity and diabetes, which have surged in popularity in recent years. The next chapter is already taking shape, with Novo launching the first GLP-1 pill for obesity earlier this month and Lilly preparing to bring an oral option of its own to market later this year. 

While those companies will play a critical role in how the space evolves, other players from pharma titan Pfizer to little-known upstarts could also enter the market — both threatening the two rivals' sales dominance and offering more treatment alternatives for consumers.

While access remains a challenge for many patients, the ability to get GLP-1s has improved notably over the past year. Both Novo and Lilly have slashed cash prices for their injections and struck deals with President Donald Trump in November that will, for the first time, introduce Medicare coverage for obesity drugs later this year.

More treatment options and wider access could boost the case for analyst projections that say the weight loss and diabetes drug market could be worth almost $100 billion annually by the end of the decade. 

In an interview at the conference, Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said the company and Lilly currently have around 15 million people combined who have obesity taking GLP-1s. There is still a ""long tail"" to reaching the 110 million that are reportedly suffering from the condition, along with those who are overweight, he added. 

In a May report, McKinsey said it expects a range of 25 to 50 million U.S. patients to use GLP-1s by 2030. 

Here's what executives say the future of the space could look like. 

Pills have not yet proven more effective than injections. 

Still, the consensus among executives is that oral options could expand the market, reaching entirely new patients. That may include people who are afraid of needles, as well as people who could benefit from existing injections but don't view their condition as severe enough to warrant a weekly shot.

In an interview at the conference, Doustdar said it could also include people who travel frequently and can't easily refrigerate injections. 

""There is so much aligned exactly with this market expansion story … because there is a huge number of patients that are simply not interested in losing weight at the cost of injecting themselves,"" Doustdar said. 

The ""real growth"" and uptake of the pills is going to come from primary care physicians, who write the majority of prescriptions for Americans and typically prefer pills to injections, said Ray Stevens, the CEO of obesity market hopeful Structure Therapeutics. 

He said he believes his company's GLP-1 pill, aleniglipron, will be the third to enter the market after Eli Lilly's and Novo Nordisk's. Structure's oral drug will enter Phase 3 trials this year. 

Daily pills can offer more flexibility to patients. For example, Stevens said a patient could cut a pill in half to mitigate side effects on a day when they have an important meeting to attend. 

Lilly's Skovronsky said pills will also serve as a way for patients to ""deescalate their therapy"" after taking injections. The company in December released data showing that patients who initially took Wegovy or Zepbound shots maintained the majority of their weight loss after switching to Lilly's pill. 

""They say, 'I've lost the weight, I've got this, so I can maintain this on my own with something less strong,'"" Skovronsky said. 

Structure is also developing an oral drugs that targets amylin, an emerging form of weight loss treatment that mimics a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to suppress appetite and reduce food intake. Novo is developing a medicine called amycretin, which targets both GLP-1 and amylin to offer potentially enhanced weight loss. 

Stevens said combination regimens are ""going to be the next phase of the field."" 

For example, Structure hopes to combine its oral GLP-1 and amylin drugs to achieve even greater weight loss than one alone would, which he said will likely be ""one of the best combos of the future."" It's too early to say which patients would be the best fit for that regimen, but Stevens said it could achieve ""good tolerability, really good patient experience and good efficacy."" 

He said the company is already working on manufacturing the two ingredients together in a single pill, which is similar to what Novo's amycretin achieves. 

But he said combination regimens can also help treat certain obesity-related conditions better than one product alone. That could look like combining a GLP-1 with one of the existing treatments for fatty liver disease. 

""I feel like the winners are now starting to emerge for the monotherapy"" treatments, he said. But Stevens said the treatment patients take will segment according to the other health conditions a person has on top of obesity, such as fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. 

Lilly's upcoming pill is an oral GLP-1, but Skovronsky said the company can see the potential for a pill that targets that hormone along with another called GIP, since that's a ""preferred formulation."" 

That's how tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Lilly's blockbuster obesity and diabetes injections, works. That drug has proven to be more effective than semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's rival injections, which only targets GLP-1. 

Skovronsky said, ""we're working hard to create those medicines"" in an oral form, but aren't ready to disclose any details. 

Pfizer inherited several experimental injections and pills with combination potential from its roughly $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera last year. 

But Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company is also developing an in-house oral drug that blocks the GIP receptor, which can significantly reduce side effects when combined with GLP-1. 

""I have very high hopes that it will also differentiate,"" Bourla said.

One biotech, Wave Life Sciences, also sees combinations as part of its broader strategy, its CEO Paul Bolno said in an interview at the conference. 

Wave is taking a different approach to weight loss, targeting how the body burns fat rather than suppressing appetite. The goal is to achieve comparable weight loss to GLP-1s, without the associated muscle loss, and with less frequent dosing of once or twice a year rather than weekly. 

That push comes amid growing focus on the quality of weight loss with next-generation obesity drugs, as GLP-1 treatments have raised concerns around muscle loss, side effects and patient drop-offs.

Wave has an experimental injection that uses RNA technology to lower levels of a protein called activin E – a liver-produced protein that slows fat burning. By reducing that protein, Wave believes the drug can increase fat loss, particularly harmful visceral fat, while preserving lean muscle mass. 

Bolno said the company is developing the injection, called WVE-007, as a monotherapy or a potential maintenance treatment that patients can switch to and take far less frequently after being on GLP-1s.

But he also sees the opportunity to combine the company's injection with GLP-1s to ""continue to drive benefits."" 

""We can double the weight loss on GLP-1s in combination,"" Bolno said, referring to what the company is seeing in preclinical research. 

He said adding Wave's injection on top of a GLP-1 won't make it more difficult for patients to tolerate the treatment regimen, so it makes the company's drug ""very amenable to combination"" options.

As for who can use Wave's injection, Bolno said it will work for any patient since ""this happens to be a target that's actually in human genetics.""

The future of the industry will likely also include drugs that can achieve even greater weight loss than the current treatments on the market. 

Lilly in December released the first late-stage data on an injectable drug called retatrutide, the highest dose of which achieved more than 28% weight loss at 68 weeks among patients who stayed on the treatment. Lilly will read out data on seven other Phase 3 trials on the drug this year. 

Dubbed the ""triple G"" drug, retatrutide works by mimicking three hunger-regulating hormones — GLP-1, GIP and glucagon — rather than just one or two. That appears to have more potent effects on a person's appetite and satisfaction with food than other treatments. 

Skovronsky said the drug could serve patients who need additional weight loss or have other severe health conditions on top of obesity, such as arthritis knee pain. 

Novo Nordisk is racing to catch up: In March, it agreed to pay up to $2 billion for the rights to an early experimental drug from Chinese drugmaker United Laboratories International. The newly acquired treatment is a clear potential competitor to retatrutide because it similarly uses a three-pronged approach to promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar.

The industry has made strides toward improving drug access for patients, and executives expect that will continue. The cash price of Novo's pill is already the lowest seen on the market, at $149 for the starting dose and up to $299 for the higher doses. 

GLP-1 injections are roughly $1,000 per month before insurance and without recent cash discounts.

Both Pfizer's Bourla and Lilly's Skovronsky said upcoming Medicare coverage of obesity drugs should also move the needle with coverage. 

""Once the government starts covering it in Medicare, it probably will become more and more uncomfortable for employers to not — it's that societal pressure,"" Skovronsky said. 

He also pointed to an ""activation of consumers,"" where patients are starting to call their employers and ask why their benefits don't cover obesity drugs. 

Drugmakers, researchers and scientists are also generating more data about the benefits of obesity drugs for health-care spending, which could help spur more employer coverage, Skovronsky said. 

""So for employers, is there less absenteeism? Is there better productivity? Is there better medical costs?"" he said. ""The data's coming in, and we're seeing more and more of that."" 

In terms of the direct-to-consumer channel, Skovronsky said it may become the ""fastest-growing segment"" of the space given the recent push for drugmakers to launch cash offerings. 

Lilly was among the first companies to launch a direct-to-consumer platform in 2024 offering its obesity drug Zepbound at a discount, and Novo followed more than a year later. 

Bourla estimated that the direct-to-consumer channel already makes up 30% of the obesity and diabetes drug market in the U.S. It could become closer to 90% or more of that market abroad, he added. 

When asked about what the broader market will look like by 2030, Structure's Stevens said he hopes access and affordability are no longer issues.

""I'm okay with the cost dropping because, to me, this has always been about volume and really trying to address a very large unmet need globally itself,"" he said.

TikTok has finalised a deal with the White House that will allow the video-sharing app to continue operating in the US, ending a years-long dispute over its Chinese ownership.

The agreement creates a new joint venture to run TikTok's US operations separately from its global business.

It will be majority American-owned, with equal 15pc stakes for Oracle, the US tech giant, MGX, the UAE investment firm, and Silver Lake, the private equity group. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, will retain a 19.9pc minority share.

Oracle, which is led by Larry Ellison, the billionaire Republican donor, will serve as a key partner. Mr Ellison has close ties to Donald Trump and a reported net worth of $227bn (£168bn). His family has also backed a bid by Paramount Skydance to acquire Warner Bros Discovery in a hostile takeover battle with Netflix.

In a press release, TikTok said the new venture, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, “will operate under safeguards that protect national security through data protections, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurances for US users”.

Donald Trump praised the deal on Truth Social, writing: “I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok! It will now be owned by a group of great American patriots and investors, the biggest in the world, and will be an important voice.”

He added that TikTok had been “responsible for my doing so well with the youth vote in the 2024 presidential election” and expressed hope that he would “long into the future … be remembered by those who use and love TikTok”.

Trump also acknowledged president Xi Jinping of China, saying: “He could have gone the other way, but didn't, and is appreciated for his decision.”

Data on American users will be stored in Oracle's secure cloud and overseen by an audited cybersecurity programme. The app's recommendation algorithm will be retrained and updated using only US data.

The joint venture will also manage trust and safety policies and moderation, covering other TikTok-owned apps in the US, including CapCut and Lemon8.

Adam Presser, a former WarnerMedia and TikTok executive, will lead the venture as chief executive, with Will Farrell as chief security officer. A seven-member board, including Shou Chew, TikTok's chief executive, and executives from Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, will oversee the company.

The deal resolves a saga that began under Trump's first presidency, when the administration attempted to ban TikTok over concerns it could allow Chinese authorities access to US user data or manipulate the app's algorithm.

A law, passed by Congress in April 2024 and upheld by the US Supreme Court in early 2025, required ByteDance to divest TikTok's American operations or face removal from app stores.

The Court cited well-supported national security concerns despite TikTok's argument that the ban violated First Amendment free speech protections.

Critics argue the new arrangement does not fully meet the requirements of the Biden-era national security law passed in April 2024.

“There remains a disconnect between the agreement and the spirit of what the statute required,” said Brett Freedman, former chief of staff of the national security division at the Department of Justice.

            US President Donald Trump has once again questioned whether NATO allies would “be there” if the United States “ever needed them,” baselessly claiming that the alliance's troops “stayed a little back” from the frontlines in Afghanistan.
    


            “I've always said, ‘Will they be there, if we ever needed them?' And that's really the ultimate test. And I'm not sure of that. I know that we would have been there, or we would be there, but will they be there?” Trump said Thursday in an interview with Fox News in Davos, Switzerland.
    


            In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the US became the first and so far only NATO member to invoke Article 5, which states that an attack against one member is an attack against all. For 20 years, NATO allies and other partner countries fought alongside US troops in Afghanistan – a sacrifice Trump has routinely downplayed.
    


            “We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did – they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines,” he said.
    


            The president's comments have rankled US allies in NATO, coming at the end of a week in which he has severely strained the alliance through his repeated threats to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous part of Denmark, another NATO member.
    


            While in absolute terms the US lost by far the most troops of any NATO country in Afghanistan, some European countries – with much smaller populations than the US – lost almost as many troops in relative terms.
    


            Around 3,500 allied troops died in the conflict, of which 2,456 were Americans and 457 were British. Denmark, with a population of around 5 million when the invasion began, lost more than 40 troops.
    


            The force dispatched to the southern Helmand province – a Taliban stronghold and a center of opium production – initially comprised mostly British and Danish troops, before the US sent reinforcements in 2008. Britain and Denmark suffered most of their casualties in Helmand.
    


            On Friday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer sharply criticized Trump's “insulting and frankly appalling” comments, and suggested the US president apologize for his remarks.
    


            “I'm not surprised they've caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured,” Starmer said. “If I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologize.”
    


            Prince Harry, who was twice deployed to Afghanistan, said in a statement provided by his spokesperson that the sacrifices of NATO troops deserve respect.
    


            “Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defence of diplomacy and peace,” he said in a statement provided by his spokesperson on Friday.
    


            Since the turn of the year, Trump has repeatedly questioned NATO's willingness to support the US. “I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM,” he blasted on Truth Social on January 7. “We will always be there for NATO, even if they won't be there for us.”
    


            Before Trump's comments to Fox News, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte had pushed back at the president's previous attempts to diminish the alliance's willingness to support the US.
    


            “There was one thing I heard you say yesterday and today – you were not absolutely sure that Europeans would come to the rescue of the US if you will be attacked,” Rutte said Wednesday in Davos, sitting next to Trump. “Let me tell you – they will. And they did in Afghanistan, as you know.”
    


            “For every two Americans who paid the ultimate price, there was one soldier from another NATO country that did not come back to his family,” Rutte said. “This is important. It pains me if you think it is not.”
    


            British lawmakers across the political spectrum were also outraged by Trump's comments.
    


            “NATO's Article 5 has only been triggered once. The UK and NATO allies answered the US call. And more than 450 British personnel lost their lives in Afghanistan,” said Defense Secretary John Healey. “Those British troops should be remembered for who they were: heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation.”
    


            Emily Thornberry, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Trump's comments were an “absolute insult,” while Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, called them “flat-out nonsense,” saying that the allies' sacrifice “deserves respect not denigration.”
    


            Other members of the Trump administration have also made light of the sacrifices made by NATO allies in Afghanistan. In June, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said his fellow US troops in Afghanistan would joke that the ISAF acronym on their shoulder patches – which stood for International Security Assistance Force – actually stood for “I Saw Americans Fighting.”
    


            “What ultimately was a lot of flags … was not a lot of on the ground capability,” Hegseth said, disparaging the efforts of NATO allies.

Snow, sleet and freezing temperatures are forecast for the south, midwest and east coast over the weekend

Trump says the big US winter storm is proof of climate hoax – here's why he's wrong

The dangerous monster storm threatening half of the US was bearing down on Friday with 13 states already declaring emergencies and areas typically unused to prolonged Arctic temperatures bracing for power failures and supply shortages.

At least 230 million people are likely to be affected by the huge winter weather system as it forms in parts of the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains and surges across southern and midwestern areas from Friday, blowing up the east coast on Saturday and as far north as Maine by Sunday.

State governors have declared emergencies ahead of time that warn of mortal danger but also free up financial reserves to deal with the conditions. By early Friday, states of emergency had been announced in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina in the southern US. Emergency declarations were also made in Missouri, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. New York added itself to the list later on Friday morning.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump on Friday morning posted on his social media platform: “Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States. Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain – WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”

In fact, the climate crisis is causing more instability in weather systems and patterns, disrupting the polar vortex and bringing more extremes amid rapidly rising global temperatures. Arctic temperatures are more frequently and persistently sweeping across parts of the US not accustomed to prolonged deep chills. The US president has long been a climate crisis skeptic and is determinedly pulling the US back from domestic climate action and international treaties to curb global heating driven by human-caused emissions, while spinning inaccurate information.

Even the American Red Cross said on its website: “Winters are getting warmer and shorter because of the climate crisis. But, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, heavier snowfalls are more likely to occur.”

Lines have been forming at stores in several states, with residents hurriedly stocking up on supplies ranging from bottled water and electricity generators to food, toilet paper and blankets. The American Red Cross warned the public to prepare, while many local media outlets posted images on social media of empty retail shelves.

Meteorologists forecast snow, sleet and, treacherously, much freezing rain that is expected to leave thick layers of ice in many areas, potentially turning roads deadly and bringing down power lines while making clearance efforts more difficult. Authorities in southern areas are warning residents to brace for prolonged electricity outages.

Temperatures will plummet well below freezing in southern states, where such cold conditions are not typical, as well as in more northerly states that are more used to dealing with bitter and fierce winter storms.

The National Weather Service said: “Snowfall totals exceeding 12in are likely across the Ohio valley, mid-Atlantic and north-east.”

More than 100 million people across the US can expect to endure temperatures below freezing until at least next Wednesday.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has abruptly stopped firing people, with staff being told the agency would “cease off-boarding” workers who assist in times of disaster and whose contracts were due to expire, CNN reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.

Fema has reportedly drafted plans to eliminate thousands of staff this year, with the agency repeatedly under attack from the White House in the second Trump administration.

Fema send the following statement to the Guardian on Friday morning in response to CNN's reporting: “This is a mischaracterization of how Fema's CORE program works. The CORE program consists of term-limited positions that are designed to FLUCTUATE based on disaster activity, operational NEED, and available funding. Fema's National Response Coordination Center has been activated in response to a historic winter storm, in line with this mission Fema is following standard protocol to ensure mission functions are being met. We urge the media to report on how Americans can stay safe this weekend, not create manufactured drama while a winter storm looms.”

US airlines have already canceled 1,400 domestic flights scheduled for Saturday, according to the site FlightAware, and transportation in all modes is expected to be severely affected by the storm.

Snow-removal equipment was being urgently tested out at Charlotte's airport in North Carolina on Friday morning.

Further north, New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, declared a state of emergency for the entire state and said she was coordinating with the new mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani.

He took office on 1 January after barnstorming the election and is facing the first big test of his skills in managing operational logistics for the severe weather that could bring 18in of snow in a storm of a scale the city has not seen in several years.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Conservative communities accept president's arguments for why the US needs the Arctic island as genuine

Owen Strickland's life as mayor of a town of 568 people between Rocky Mount and Raleigh, North Carolina, is usually small-town politics. But this particular moment has been giving his political science degree – with a concentration in national security policy and international relations – a workout.

Donald Trump's call to annex Greenland has roiled markets and flabbergasted half the world. But the president's supporters in conservative communities – to the degree that this issue has their attention at all – are apt to accept his political argument as genuine.

Americans of either party are unlikely to know much about China's “Belt and Road Initiative”, a series of investments in infrastructure – ports, roads and rail across continents – to connect Chinese trade to the world, Strickland said.

“They started about a decade ago,” Strickland said. “They are attempting to make inroads worldwide, up to and including Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, areas like that. That includes the Arctic, Greenland, Iceland and the extreme north of Canada. They are doing everything they can to reduce western influence.” (The Chinese investments in Greenland, many of which have been blocked are actually part of what it hopes to call the “Polar Silk Road”.)

Strickland is one of many conservatives who believe that Trump's efforts to bring Greenland under American control are justified. “I may not necessarily agree with his approaches,” Strickland said. “But our president is a negotiator, and he's proven where his thought processes are, and he's also proven that he's meant to be believed. Everything with our president is a negotiation.”

Trump also alludes to the “Golden Dome” project, a system of defensive countermeasures to shield the United States from nuclear missiles, as a reason to take over Greenland. The technical elements for knocking down intercontinental ballistic missiles are both untested and classified. Accepting an assertion that the system would work as advertised and requires ownership of Greenland to function is an article of faith to supporters of Trump's push for annexation.

But faith is not in short supply among the converted, said Jack Watts, a Christian author in Atlanta with a large conservative social media following.

“The confidence that people have – particularly conservative Christian people – is that Trump has our best interest at heart,” Watts said. “He's playing chess while others are playing checkers, and what he does they agree with even if they don't understand it.”

A deal was going to happen, Watts said, “and it's going to happen very quickly”.

But for a transfer of sovereignty? Probably not, he added. “I think that it will be like Guantánamo Bay, which is part of Cuba, but we have a permanent lease on it. We have an impenetrable base in Guantánamo Bay and the same thing will happen, and it won't happen near anybody that's living any place.”

Voices to the farthest right of the political spectrum are leaning into the rhetoric of America as empire and Greenland as territory to conquer, taking a cue from Stephen Miller's comments earlier this month in which the senior White House adviser said to news anchor Jake Tapper that “we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world.”

Matt Walsh, host of the rightwing Daily Wire, said that taking over Greenland by force was “worth talking about”, adding: “It's interesting to me when people today get so offended by the very notion that we would try to acquire land, that we would try to grow the empire, and in particular, that we would try to do it by force … that's the only way that America exists in the first place.” (In Davos on Thursday Trump said he would not consider military force in his quest.)

Some conservative leaders have been critical of the Trump administration's demands for Greenland, but more often challenge the provocative process than the underlying rationale.

The conservative commentator Erick Erickson described Trump's fixation on Greenland as evidence of “insane impulse control issues”, arguing that the fixation on Greenland was a product of isolationism within his cabinet. But even Erickson believes the issue is valid.

“The crazy thing here is that I agree with Donald Trump about the strategic importance of Greenland,” Erickson wrote in his newsletter. “But this is counterproductive to accomplishing the security goal he wants. The Europeans cannot now be seen to be bullied into giving up 840,000 square miles of territory to an unhinged and obsessive 80-year-old.”

In either case, the refrain that Trump's bluster – from his tariff threats to his talk at Davos – is the art of the deal reverberates from conservative commentary on talk radio and YouTube through social media into the kitchen table talk of his voters.

Jerry Mobley, chairman of the Winston County Republican party in Alabama, represents a rural conservative community 50 miles north-east of Birmingham. Alabama Republicans are focused more on political primaries than international politics. Hotly contested races for governor, US senator and statewide offices could upend Alabama politics this year. But the Greenland news has been hard to ignore.

“I'd hate to say it's all in the wrong hands,” Mobley said of Greenland. “I think it's a security point … I would just like Trump to make sure that we maintain security for us and all of our allies.”

Antonio Ruiz is a former Army Ranger in New Braunfels, Texas. He's been to Greenland a couple of times, always on the way somewhere else. The prospect of a military confrontation with Nato is absurd to conservatives, even as the public discussion contemplates the possibility, he said.

“We laugh at it because there's no way that, number one, it will get to that point,” Ruiz said. “I mean, it's not like you guys haven't seen how Trump operates. We understand he throws a smattering on the board, but his pinpoint objective is right there at the bottom. It's bringing the people to the table to make a deal.”

Denying China a clear shipping route through the Arctic, and Chinese bases in the region, is a valid strategic objective, Ruiz said. The discussion within conservative military circles has been about how to achieve that objective.

“A majority of them are all believing that this is this is a strategic thing that needs to happen,” Ruiz said. “How we go about it is, all told, we want it diplomatic. I mean, we don't want to have to be watching your backs and going through guerrilla operations to hold a military base installation in Greenland. It's just not feasible.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Team Taiwan on Wednesday won the Team Champion award at the Federation Cynologique Internationale (FCI) World Grooming Competition held in the Philippines. It is their second team grooming title in recent months. 

The team was organized by the Kennel Club of Taiwan (KCT), an organization long dedicated to pet grooming education in Taiwan, Ministry of Agriculture Department of Animal Welfare Deputy Director Chen Chung-hsing (陳中興) said yesterday.

It competed with four other teams from South Korea, Philippines, Malaysia and Spain, he said.

Aside from the team championship, Team Taiwan member Yu Ya-pei (余亞蓓) won the “poodles” category, while Ho Shu-hui (何淑慧) won the “other pedigree dogs trimming” category with a bichon frise.

The KCT yesterday said the Team Champion award was the second win in a row following the Best Grooming Team award won at a grooming competition held in Malaysia last year.

The KCT has been competing on behalf of Taiwan since the first FCI grooming competition was organized and held in Kaohsiung in 2023, it said.

It holds about three to four tryouts a year to select entrants, with about 10 judges invited from home and abroad to evaluate groomers' performance, the KCT said.

Groomers who score the most accumulated points in the tryouts can take part in the national team in competitions the following year, it said.

Recent tryouts usually have about 20 to 30 participants, the KCT said, adding the tryouts are open to all people interested in competing with other pet groomers.

The next tryout is to be held at New Taipei City's Banshu Gymnasium on April 18, when the ministry would present awards, it said.

The KCT issues pet groomer certifications and has signed memorandums of understanding with several vocational high schools to collaborate on training groomers, he said.

As a crucial part of the pet care industry in Taiwan, pet grooming has become a profession that requires practitioners to obtain a Level C certificate, Chen said.

The ministry would continue to bolster the development of pet grooming and animal welfare to help the industry, he said.



                                                                                A preclearance service to facilitate entry for people traveling to select airports in Japan would be available from Thursday next week to Feb. 25 at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Taoyuan International Airport Corp (TIAC) said on Tuesday. 
The service was first made available to Taiwanese travelers throughout the winter vacation of 2024 and during the Lunar New Year holiday.
In addition to flights to the Japanese cities of Hakodate, Asahikawa, Akita, Sendai, Niigata, Okayama, Takamatsu, Kumamoto and Kagoshima, the service would be available to travelers to Kobe and Oita.
The service can be accessed by passengers of 15 flight routes operated by

Guan Guan has said many controversial statements in her videos posted to Douyin (抖音), including “the red flag will soon be painted all over Taiwan” and “Taiwan is an inseparable part of China,” and expressing hope for expedited reunification.
The agency last year received multiple reports alleging that Guan Guan had advocated for armed reunification.
After verifying the reports, the agency last month issued a notice requiring her to appear and explain her actions.

U.S. President Donald Trump stands on the stage prior to addressing a meeting of Global Business Leaders at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press

The War of the Greenlandic Accession appears to have ended before it began, the President of the United States having supposedly negotiated a deal on the island's future with the Secretary-General of NATO, a deal that a) no one can describe in any detail, b) neither of them has any mandate to negotiate and c) appears to amount to a ratification of the status quo. 

Still, the past few weeks have not been a complete waste. They have almost certainly brought an end to NATO as a credible military alliance. They have demonstrated, to a degree that should convince any remaining doubters, that Donald Trump is completely out of his skull. And they have put the final nail in the strategy of accommodating him. There will be no more attempts to flatter, bribe or otherwise sweet-talk the toddler President. America's allies are done with Mr. Trump – and to a lesser extent, America.

Hence the extraordinary reaction to the Prime Minister's Davos speech. It has been, to be sure, wildly overpraised. The rhetoric is not particularly eloquent, the insights not especially scintillating. Its main recommendation, that middle powers should lessen their exposure to the great powers by trading more with each other, is essentially warmed-over friendshoring.

Its impact, rather, comes from its candour, its clarity, and, perhaps most of all, its timing. Had Mark Carney delivered the same speech even six months ago, the response from other world leaders might have been a weary, “Yes, you're right, but.” As it was, it detonated with the force of half a ton of gelignite. Mr. Carney crystallized the rebellious mood in the room, giving it meaning, direction and hope.

The central metaphor, Václav Havel's famous parable of the shopkeeper in a communist state who keeps a sign in his window parroting a regime slogan, though he does not believe in it, seems inapt at first. The point of the story was that the willingness of the shopkeeper, and other like him, to repeat something everyone knows to be untrue – in Havel's phrase, to “live within a lie” – is what really sustained the regime. 

Likewise, Mr. Carney describes the “rules-based international order” that prevailed for the last several decades as having been something of “a pleasant fiction,” one that the richer nations pretended to believe in so long as it seemed to deliver, but which we must now admit is gone forever. It is time, he says, for all these countries to “take their signs down.”

But the RBIO was not a totalitarian order: it was a voluntary association of states – one that, moreover, broadly worked. If we are indeed witnessing its collapse, it is not because those in its thrall discovered a collective will to resist it, but because the great power most responsible for making it work, the United States, has suddenly and willfully decided to throw it in the trash can.

Never mind. I suspect Mr. Carney framed it that way off the top as a cover, to soften his real message, which is a call for those states who, by their submission to great power dictates, have enabled the dismantling of the RBIO, even as they publicly pine for its return, to take down their signs. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney gave a speech at the World Economic Forum that blamed U.S. President Donald Trump, without naming him, for what Carney described as a rupture in global relations.

There can be no return to the RBIO, Mr. Carney said, because the fundamental assumption on which it was based – a relatively benign power, in the form of the United States, as its backstop – no longer applies. The deep trade integration that was possible under the RBIO has been transformed from a broad force for good to a tool of imperialism.

Great powers have increasingly taken to using tariffs, supply chain vulnerability, and investment as weapons against their trading partners. Russia and China led the way. Now they have been joined by the United States.

Continuing to pursue integration with what Mr. Carney tactfully refers to throughout as “the hegemon” is simply an invitation to be manipulated and exploited. “You cannot ‘live within the lie' of mutual benefit through integration,” Mr. Carney advises, “when integration becomes the source of your subordination.” 

What is the alternative? The temptation, Mr. Carney says, is to reduce our vulnerability by retreating within our own borders, closing ourselves to trade generally. The real answer is to trade more with like-minded countries: “Coalitions that work, issue by issue, with partners who share enough common ground to act together.” A network of rules-based orders, in other words, based not on deference to any hegemon but shared values and mutual benefit. 

Opinion: At Davos, a new great game dawns for the world. Which way, Canada?

It's a nervy thing for the leader of a country that depends on the U.S. for 75 per cent of its exports to say.  Which may also account for its impact. 

The good news is: the great powers' grip can be broken. Hegemons, Mr. Carney says, “cannot continually monetize their relationships.” Far from enforcing submission to American hegemony, Mr. Trump's tariffs are inducing other countries to trade around it. The European Union has just signed a free-trade agreement with the Mercosur group of South American countries. Another major deal, between the EU and the Trans-Pacific Partnership is in the works.

One lesson in all this is the importance of legitimacy. Middle powers were willing to collaborate in the Pax Americana so long as the United States was seen as a force for good – not always or perfectly, but on the whole. The narrow self-interest and naked aggression of the Trump regime has destroyed its legitimacy. Without it, without the willing participation of the other powers, the U.S. is at risk of becoming a paper tiger.

The other is the importance of collective action. The whole history of Mr. Trump's rise has been his ability to exploit divisions – within the United States, and between countries – playing one potential opponent off against the other: divide and rule, in other words. 

That era, perhaps, is at an end. The shock of Mr. Trump's threat to invade Greenland seems to have finally shaken Europe, at least, out of its illusions. European leaders stood together against Mr. Trump. In the end, Mr. Trump backed down.

That does not mean the threat has gone away, however. Mr. Trump's moods are mercurial; his promises are worthless. The Greenland issue could return within a month. Or other threats could materialize: in fact, almost certainly will. There is still a madman in the White House, who is unlikely to have learned any lessons from this episode, and who is guided by no principle other than self-aggrandizement.

Opinion: Don't lose sight of the Americans trapped in the Donald Trump nightmare

Worse, the problem is not just Mr. Trump. Something has cracked in American society, that it could elect so manifestly unfit a person, not once, but twice. The checks and balances that were supposed to contain him have manifestly failed. Mr. Trump could fall under the proverbial bus tomorrow. But the world could have no assurance of any lasting return to sanity in the United States.

This new era of great-power predation, then, is quite unlike the last. In the previous century we could always count on the United States to ride to the defence of the democracies against any rising dictatorship. For the foreseeable future it must be counted as an unreliable ally at best, an enemy at worst. The trust on which the NATO alliance, in particular, depends is broken. 

What is to be done? How can the democratic world defend itself, without the United States? How can it defend itself from the United States? How can Canada, in particular, survive and prosper, given the precarity of our situation? 

The answer is to apply Mr. Carney's formula more generally: Stick together. Call things by their proper name. Understand the importance in human events of moral legitimacy – that hard power is insufficient, without the soft power to back it up. But understand, too, that soft power must ultimately be defended by hard power.

The short-term imperative is for the democratic forces in the United States to recover their nerve. The Trumpists seized the advantage over the past year by a combination of speed and fanaticism. They seemed to be moving on all fronts simultaneously, without regard for law, or precedent, or human decency. Mostly, they benefited from their opponents' failure of imagination – their inability to conceive of just what the Trump people were capable of.

That only gets you so far, however. Like the European leaders, Mr. Trump's domestic opponents now understand better what they are up against, and what they have to do to stop it. Fortunately, the people around Mr. Trump are not terribly bright. They have plainly taken on far more than they can handle – provided their opponents act together.

Meanwhile, the rest of the democratic world will have to accept that the alliance with the United States has been irreparably damaged, at least for the time being, and move on. NATO may be dead, but that does not mean other alliances cannot be formed: NATO, minus the U.S., but plus Japan, Canada, Australia and some of the other democracies. 

Perhaps this Democratic League, or whatever it might be called, might also have a trade dimension, complete with what some have called “an economic Article 5”: a provision that a tariff on one member is to be regarded as a tariff on all, with appropriate retaliatory measures.

And Canada? Short-term, the Prime Minister should follow his own logic, and not invest too heavily in a renewed continental trade deal. If experience is any guide, Mr. Trump will issue a series of extravagant demands as the price of his signature. Moreover, we can have no assurance that he would keep any undertakings he made in return. 

And trade, as such, is perhaps the least of our worries. Rather, it is the Trump administration's broader agenda of domination, in which trade is but one of the weapons at its disposal. To counter this, we need to show that we have options (hence the China démarche); allies (hence the expressions of solidarity with Europe, to the point of being willing to send troops, if need be, to Greenland); and capacity economic and military: the ability to endure harm at the hands of the Americans, and to inflict it, if necessary, on them.

Fixing our anemic economic growth rate, in other words, is no longer merely desirable: it is an urgent necessity, a matter of national security. Without it, we will be less able to withstand Trumpian blackmail. Nor will we be able to finance the enormous military buildup on which we are already engaged.

Carney calls for national unity in face of economic challenges ahead

In the longer term, we must understand how fundamentally our world has changed. For the past 150 years, we have had the comfort of knowing that our borders were secure, protected on three sides by oceans and on the fourth, by the Great Republic to our south. Today, who can say whether we will still be in possession of all our present territory at the end of the century – or at the end of the decade – or even at the end of this year?

And the minute any piece of the country is taken, all bets are off. The precedent having been set, other powers will probe further, testing what we are willing to defend, and what we are not. Not only our territory will be in play then, but our democracy, our freedom, our whole way of life.

If we fully understand how much we are now at risk, then we will be willing to make the changes that are required. That starts with inculcating a culture of self-defence, a recognition that we cannot necessarily rely on others to defend us but must be willing to defend ourselves. 

That has not been part of our mindset until now. We have gone to war to defend other nations. We have never had to go to war to defend our own. We have never even had to sacrifice much for it. No Canadian leader of recent times would think of telling Canadians, “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.” Perhaps they should start.

U.S. President Donald Trump takes part in a charter announcement for his Board of Peace at the 56th annual World Economic Forum, in Davos, on Thursday.Denis Balibouse/Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is rescinding Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to join his Board of Peace after the Canadian leader skipped the group's first meeting and delivered a speech widely viewed as rebuking Mr. Trump for ending the U.S.-led rules-based international order.

Mr. Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post as he flew back to Washington from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday.

“Dear Prime Minister Carney: Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,” the President wrote.

Mr. Carney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump struggled to get the U.S.'s traditional allies to join the Board of Peace, which held its first meeting in Davos. French President Emmanuel Macron outright rejected Mr. Trump's invitation, while Britain, Germany, Italy, and most other European countries did not attend.

The board, ostensibly meant to oversee Mr. Trump's Gaza peace plan, has become controversial over fears that Mr. Trump intends it to have a broader mandate as a parallel to the United Nations under his direct control. He has also invited international pariahs such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite his ongoing invasion of Ukraine, and authoritarian Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, to join.

Both Mr. Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, another invitee, are wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court and would have faced arrest if they had set foot in Switzerland.

Earlier in the week, Mr. Carney went viral with a Davos speech that, while it did not name Mr. Trump, appeared squarely aimed at him. In the address, the Prime Minister said the world is “in the midst of a rupture” away from rules-based internationalism and toward a global system of economic “coercion” by major powers. Mr. Carney called on middle powers such as Canada to band together against such “subordination,” including standing up to ostensible allies who engage in economic bullying.

Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs on nearly every country in the world and gotten many to sign lopsided trade deals favouring the U.S. in order to avoid even steeper tariffs.

Mr. Carney left Davos early the next morning around the time Mr. Trump was arriving and the pair did not speak with each other. The President later chided the Prime Minister in his own speech: “Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark,” Mr. Trump said.

Analysis: In Davos speech, Trump speaks to allies in language once reserved for adversaries

Mr. Carney's speech and Mr. Trump's latest move could signal a rockier phase to their relationship. Despite Mr. Trump's hefty tariffs on Canada, Mr. Carney for months cultivated a chummy rapport with him and made several trade concessions, rolling back Canada's retaliatory tariffs and cancelling a planned digital services tax.

Such moves, however, have not gotten Canada a deal to lift U.S. tariffs and Mr. Carney has said the matter may not be resolved until the planned renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which could take a year or more. Last week, Mr. Carney struck a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping that will see Canada lower tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles — breaking with the U.S. — in exchange for China lowering tariffs on canola and other Canadian goods.

Mr. Trump, meanwhile, spent the days leading up to the World Economic Forum threatening to impose tariffs on European countries that opposed his plan to annex Greenland. He abruptly backed down after agreeing to a “framework” for talks on the matter with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, the details of which have not been released. Mr. Trump's annexation talk had also spooked markets and polled poorly among U.S. voters.

The President on Thursday went ahead with the signing of his Board of Peace's charter, even amid the absence of most of the Western alliance.

Opinion: America the predator: Trump wants to show the world he can take what he wants

British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC that her country would not be signing on for now. “This is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace,” she said.

The White House initially listed Belgium as having joined the board before the country's foreign minister corrected the record. “Belgium has NOT signed the Charter of the Board of Peace. This announcement is incorrect. We wish for a common and coordinated European response. As many European countries, we have reservations to the proposal,” Maxime Prevot wrote on X.

Mr. Trump told the Board of Peace charter signing, which included representatives from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia and Turkey, among others, that he saw Gaza as a prime development opportunity.

“I'm a real estate person at heart and it's all about location, and I said ‘look at this location on the sea,'” he said. “Look at this beautiful piece of property, what it could be for so many people.”

Jared Kushner, the US president's son-in-law, who's taken on top roles in high-profile matters, revealed a redevelopment plan to transform Gaza into a glitzy seaside resort.

Using slides showing images of gleaming skyscrapers and apartments, Jared Kushner presented a Trump-backed ""master plan"" for the rebuilding of Gaza.

Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, said during Thursday's presentation at the World Economic Forum in Davos that postwar Gaza would become ""a place that the people … can thrive, have great employment.""

""In the Middle East they build cities like this, you know for 2 or 3 million people, they build this in three years,"" said Kushner, who has no official title but has been part of the US-backed Gaza peace negotiations.

""And so, stuff like this is very doable if we make it happen,"" he said, speaking immediately after Trump presented his ambitious ""Board of Peace"" designed to oversee the Gaza truce and Strip's reconstruction.

Kushner spoke of needing investments of at least $25 billion (€21.3 billion) to rebuild Gaza's shattered infrastructure and public services.

""It could be a hope. It could be a destination,"" he said.

The war between Israel and the Hamas militant group has left much of Gaza damaged or destroyed.

The conflict was triggered by attacks led by Hamas, designated as a terror organization by the United States, the European Union, Germany and other nations, in southern Israel on October 7, 2023.

The October 2025 ceasefire has reduced the level of bombing and fighting and increased aid deliveries.

But hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza continue to live in temporary shelters at displacement camps or in bombed-out buildings.

In Davos, Trump echoed Kushner's confidence, saying ""we're going to be very successful in Gaza.""

""It's going to be a great thing to watch,"" President Donald Trump said.

""I'm a real estate person at heart... and I said, look at this location on the sea. Look at this beautiful piece of property. What it could be for so many people,"" he said.

Nearly a year ago, Trump floated plans to convert Gaza into a ""Riviera of the Middle East,"" a move that drew condemnation from many quarters.

At the time, he also appeared somewhat vague on questions dealing with what would happen to Palestinians living there.

He said it would be populated with ""the world's people ... Palestinians also, Palestinians will live there. Many people will live there.""

The latest in a series of congressional efforts to rein in President Donald Trump's military aggression against Venezuela failed Thursday as Republican lawmakers again defeated a war powers resolution by the tightest possible margin.

House lawmakers voted 215-215 on H.Con.Res.68 — introduced last month by Rep. James McGovern (D-Mass.) — which “directs the president to remove US armed forces from Venezuela unless a declaration of war or authorization to use military force for such purpose has been enacted.”

Unlike in the Senate, where the vice president casts tie-breaking votes, a deadlock in the House means the legislation does not pass.

Every House Democrat and two Republicans — Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — voted in favor of the measure. Every other Republican voted against it. Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) did not vote.

By the tightest margin, Republicans blocked a War Powers Resolution to stop Trump's illegal military action to take Venezuela's oil.Trump is losing support in Congress. The American people are sick of foreign conflicts. Progressives will not stop until we end these wars. https://t.co/Ft38ERyUpC

The House vote came a week after Vice President JD Vance's tie-breaking vote was needed to overcome a 50-50 deadlock on a similar resolution introduced last month by Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 — also known as the War Powers Act — was enacted during the Nixon administration toward the end of the US war on Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The law empowers Congress to check the president's war-making authority by requiring the president to report any military action to Congress within 48 hours. It also mandates that lawmakers approve any troop deployments lasting longer than 60 days.

Thursday's vote followed this month's US bombing and invasion of Venezuela and kidnapping of its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife on dubious “narco-terrorism” and drug trafficking allegations. Trump has also imposed an oil blockade on the South American nation, seizing seven tankers. Since September, the US has also been bombing boats accused of transporting drugs in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.

This is the second time I voted for a War Powers Resolution to stop Trump's unconstitutional attacks on Venezuela.The maniac in the White House does not have the authority to bomb and invade anywhere he wants across the globe. Congress must put an end to this. No more forever…

“If the president is contemplating further military action, then he has a moral and constitutional obligation to come here and get our approval,” McGovern said following the vote.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Gregory Meeks (D-NY) lamented the resolution's failure, saying, “The American people want us to lower their cost of living, not enable war.”

Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said on Bluesky: “Only Congress has the authority to declare war. Today, I voted for a war powers resolution to ensure Trump cannot send OUR armed forces to Venezuela without explicit authorization from Congress.”

Cavan Kharrazian, senior policy adviser at the advocacy group Demand Progress, also decried the resolution's failure.

“We are deeply disappointed that the House did not pass this war powers resolution, though it's notable that it failed only due to a tie,” he said.

“As with the recent Senate vote, the administration expended extraordinary energy pressuring Republicans to block this resolution,” Kharrazian added. “That effort speaks for itself: With the American people tired of endless war, the administration knows that a Congress willing to enforce the law can meaningfully curtail illegal and escalatory military action. We urge members of Congress to continue fully exercising their constitutional authority over matters of war.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks.

Live Updates


• New wave of protests: Hundreds of Minnesota businesses are expected to close and a rally is planned in Minneapolis as organizers urge people to protest the Trump administration's latest surge in its aggressive, nationwide immigration crackdown.
    


• Preschooler taken by ICE: A 5-year-old is one of the latest children caught up in the mass deportation campaign after he and his father were taken by federal agents outside their Minneapolis-area home. They were pursuing an asylum claim, their lawyer says.
    


• Church protest in focus: Three people who denounced federal immigration agents in a protest at a St. Paul church have been arrested – and more arrests could be coming. Minneapolis' Democratic mayor condemned one of the arrests, while the White House welcomed it.
    


            A top Border Patrol and a top US Immigration and Customs Enforcement official used a Friday news conference in Minneapolis to engage in sweeping attacks against immigrants, the media and protesters.
    


            Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino pledged “wholesale” removals of immigrants accused of crimes, some of whose photos were shown on a screen behind him as he spoke.
    


                    “We're going to take them off the streets wholesale,” he said. “It's on. We won't quit.”
                





            Bovino accused the media of failing to cover stories about undocumented immigrants committing violent crimes. He took as an example the 2023 killing of Rachel Morin, which was covered by both local and national media outlets.
    


            ICE Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Marcos Charles accused “political activists” and the media of trying “to deceive the American public about ICE and our operations.” It's been a common theme for DHS officials, who have railed against “fake news” and pushed back on reporting about immigration enforcement operations.
    


            Charles said ICE is arresting “dangerous criminal, illegal aliens” – a contrast to data showing the agency has detained nearly 75,000 people without criminal records.
    


            Charles characterized the anti-ICE protest that disrupted Sunday services at a Southern Baptist church in St. Paul as a “riot” and said it was “not a peaceful protest.” Dozens of demonstrators rushed into Cities Church during worship, chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good” and saying in part they were protesting one of the church's pastors believed to be a senior ICE official.



            Church leaders and politicians, especially on the right, have decried the protest for interrupting a religious service, and multiple people have been arrested. But there haven't been reports of physical violence committed by demonstrators – just disruption.
    


            The 5-year-old who was taken by federal agents from the driveway of his home in Minneapolis after returning from preschool is now being held with his father at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dilley, Texas, according to school district officials and a family attorney.
    


            Family detention, which expanded under former President Barack Obama, had been paused under the Biden administration before resuming this year. The Dilley facility — intended to be a residential detention center, not a criminal facility — is designed to house families, with a series of beige trailers with dedicated spaces for a library, gym and classroom. Children at Dilley range from infants to teenagers.
    


            But over time, immigrant advocates and attorneys have routinely raised alarm over detaining children. And detainees have described that same facility as a place of prolonged stays and despondent children, with limited access to potable water and agents offering money for families to voluntarily leave the country, court declarations filed in December show.
    


            The documents shine a light inside the facility, where families who had either crossed the US-Mexico border or been picked up by authorities in the United States as part of the administration's sweeping crackdown are currently housed.

            Asked about discrepancies between federal and Minnesota officials' counts of non-US citizens in state custody, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Marcos Charles said Friday that ICE has “better databases.”
    


            He said there are over 1,300 people with ICE detainers in state custody in Minnesota.
    


            But Paul Schnell, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections, disputed this number during a Thursday news conference.
    


            Schnell said Minnesota conducted a point-in-time survey of county jails, finding a total of 301 individuals with ICE detainers — nowhere close to the federal figure.
    


            A top ICE official denies allegations from a Minneapolis school that the 5-year-old son of an asylum seeker was used as bait to capture his father.
    


            “(Adrian Alexander) Conejo Arias was not walking to school with the child, and we did not target the child,” said Marcos Charles, executive assistant director of Enforcement and Removal Operations.
    


            ICE officials say the 5-year-old, Liam Conejo Ramos, seen being loaded into a federal vehicle while wearing a backpack and blue beanie with bunny ears, had been abandoned by his father when he saw agents approaching.
    


            “(Agents) cared for him, took him to get something to eat from a drive-thru restaurant and spent hours ensuring he was taken care of,” Charles said.
    


            Columbia Heights school superintendent Zena Stenvik said earlier this week agents took the child to his home to knock and try to draw other members of the family out.
    


            Charles countered, saying the agents were trying to reunite Ramos with other family members.
    


            “Tragically when we approached the door of his residence, people inside refused to take him in and open the door,” he said.
    


            The father eventually asked to have Liam stay with him, Charles said. They are now at South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, according to family attorney Marc Prokosch.
    


            “We do everything in our power not to separate families,” said Charles.
    


            An Immigration and Customs Enforcement official today sharply criticized anti-ICE protesters who disrupted a Sunday church service in St. Paul, calling the incident “a riot” rather than a peaceful protest.
    


            “They rioted at the church. At church services, they screamed and harassed children,” Marcos Charles, ICE's executive assistant director of enforcement and removal operations, said at a Friday morning news conference. “They denied Minnesotans the ability to worship peacefully.”
    


            Demonstrators on Sunday rushed into Cities Church during worship, saying in part they were protesting one of the church's pastors, who they claimed was a senior ICE official. Once inside, they questioned another pastor about his role, according to a protester who spoke with CNN.



            Charles called the targeting of the church “disturbing” and accused the protesters of “viciously harass(ing) innocent families.”
    


            Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino said at a Friday morning news conference that “we are experts in dealing with children,” in the wake of controversy after a 5-year-old boy and his father were taken by ICE in Minneapolis.
    


            Border Patrol officials are “experts in dealing with children, not because we want to be, but because we have to be,” he said.
    


            He claimed that hundreds of thousands of children are trafficked across the border.
    


            Organizers of a march protesting the surge of ICE agents to Minnesota will face a particularly challenging opponent this afternoon: the weather.
    


            “We will walk in below-zero degrees in one of the coldest days in Minnesota,” Emilia González Avalos with UNIDOS Minnesota, one of the groups behind the event, told CNN's Sara Sidner.
    


            The wind chill in Minneapolis is not expected to rise above -20 today. The march that was originally scheduled to begin and end at the city's Commons Park will instead conclude with an indoor rally at Target Center.
    


            “We're asking people to march,” said González. “We're asking people boycott today. We're asking people to get trained as legal observers.”
    


            The event is part of a broader Friday strike activists have called for, encouraging people to stay home from school and work and for businesses to close.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security is calling for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey to turn over a convicted sex offender they said federal agents were searching for when they dragged a US citizen from his St. Paul home on Sunday.
    


            “This is exactly what we have been saying: We need state and local law enforcement engagement and information so we don't have to have such a presence on the streets,” reads a post on X from the agency.
    


            Paul Schnell, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections, told CNN yesterday he had notified DHS that the offender was in state custody.
    


Some context: ICE agents bashed open ChongLy “Scott” Thao's door before detaining him and leading him outside in his underwear in frigid conditions, according to the Associated Press. The episode, captured on video, provoked anger and criticism of the ICE agents' tactics.
    


            DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Thao of living with two convicted sex offenders, the targets of the operation, and said both were still at large.
    


            But Schnell said that one of those sex offenders is already in prison.
    


            “He is, in fact, in prison and subject to a detainer,” Schnell told CNN yesterday. “They should know, because we did notify them that they were in our custody.”
    


            The Trump administration has ordered a review of federal funding sent to more than a dozen Democratic-led states, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The sweeping scale of the review is outlined in a budget data request that was sent Tuesday to all federal departments and agencies except for the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    


            The Office of Management and Budget memo, which was reviewed by CNN, requests detailed spending information to “facilitate efforts to reduce the improper and fraudulent use of those funds.” Notably, the effort “does not involve withholding funds,” the memo says and is part of a “data-gathering exercise.”
    


            The request signals a dramatic escalation of the Trump administration's increasingly aggressive strategy to target federal funding in blue states — an unprecedented policy approach triggered during last year's government shutdown that has rapidly accelerated in the wake of sweeping fraud allegations in Minnesota.

            Federal officers in tactical gear line up at the driveway of a large block-shaped building wedged between the city limits of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Across from them, a crowd of protesters yell at the officers and sometimes try to block cars driving in and out.
    


            The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building has served as the backdrop for the ongoing tense dance in the Twin Cities since federal agents shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good earlier this month. Its stark brick structure is home base for the immigration proceedings at the heart of the crackdown in the state, prompting fear, anger and confusion.



            The man behind the name — Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple — would be standing outside with protesters if he were still alive, one historian and scholar said.
    


            Whipple, Minnesota's first Protestant Episcopal bishop, was known for advocating for the welfare of Native Americans throughout the mid-to-late 1800s, according to historians. While his legacy reflects his advocacy, it falls short of altruism and the building bearing his name perches on sacred land also known for its traumatic and violent history toward Indigenous peoples.
    


            Now, the Whipple building is where many people are temporarily detained after being swept up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — now facing a subpoena from the Trump administration in an investigation of possible obstruction of justice — says the dramatic increase in federal immigration agents is not making his city safer.
    


                    “This is not about safety. It's not even about immigration,” Frey told CNN's Sara Sidner. “What we are seeing right now is that this is political retribution. It's about causing chaos on our streets.”
                





            President Donald Trump has called Frey “a fool” for his support of the city's Somali community and posted on Truth Social earlier this month, “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”
    


            “You don't need to take my word for it,” Frey said. “You can listen to exactly what Donald Trump is saying.”
    


            The United Nations Human Rights Chief is calling on the Trump administration to ensure immigration and enforcement practices “respect the human dignity and due process rights” and to end practices that he says are tearing apart families.
    


            “Individuals are being surveilled and detained, sometimes violently, … often solely on mere suspicion of being undocumented migrants,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said in a news release as he questioned the administration's concern for dignity and humanity.
    


            The Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies “are resulting in arbitrary and unlawful arrests and detentions, as well as flawed removal decisions,” Türk said highlighting “that many arrests, detentions, and expulsions occur without effort to assess and maintain family unity.”
    


            The high commissioner also said he is worried these policies are often enforced without carefully assessing each person's situation. He expressed concern “about the harmful and dehumanising narratives frequently used to describe migrants and refugees.”
    


            He called for “an independent and transparent investigation” into what he said is a concerning rise in the number of detainee deaths while in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.
    


            A Cumberland County, Maine correctional officer recruit was detained by federal agents in Portland's Bayside neighborhood, according to the sheriff. CNN has reached out to DHS for comment but has not yet received a response.

            A Chicago-area man accused of offering a $10,000 bounty for the life of Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino over Snapchat was found not guilty Thursday,  the Associated Press reported.
    


            Juan Espinoza Martinez, 37, faced up to 10 years in prison on a murder-for-hire charge.
    


            Prosecutors cited Snapchat messages from Espinoza Martinez to his brother and a friend who turned out to be a government informant, including one that read, “10k if u take him down,” with a photo of Bovino.
    


            Defense attorneys told jurors the government didn't present any evidence against Espinoza Martinez, who they said didn't follow up on the messages and had only a few dollars in his bank account. Espinoza Martinez did not testify.
    


            His defense attorney Dena Singer did not respond to the AP on its request for comment on the verdict. Neither did the US attorney's office in Chicago nor the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            Born in Mexico, Espinoza Martinez has lived in the US for more than 30 years. He does not have legal permission to stay in the United States.
    


            Hundreds of Minnesota businesses are expected to close on Friday as part of a protest against immigration enforcement in the state.
    


            The strike, organized by local faith leaders and unions, urges Minnesotans to avoid shopping and stay home from work or school, according to CNN affiliate KARE. There is also a rally planned in downtown Minneapolis uniting under the slogan “ICE out of Minnesota.”
    


            The statewide strike comes a day after Vice President JD Vance, who visited Minneapolis, blamed a lack of cooperation from local authorities for some of the problems in the city, and suggested that is why ICE needs such a robust presence in Minneapolis.
    


Here's a look at the latest:  



            The attorney for 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, who were taken by federal agents this week, said the two were “not eluding ICE in any way.” He also pushed back on Vice President JD Vance's comment that agents were arresting an “illegal alien.”

            A new memo obtained by the Associated Press says ICE agents can enter people's homes without a warrant signed by a judge, allowing agents to exercise sweeping new powers. It's a move, CNN's Josh Campbell reports, that can potentially ramp up already tense interactions between the public and immigration officers.

IRVING, Texas (AP) — The College Football Playoff will remain at 12 teams after the commissioners of the Southeastern Conference and Big Ten couldn't come up with a compromise for expansion.

The CFP Management Committee announced Friday the 12-team format would stay the same for the 2026-27 season. The decision provides additional time for evaluation and discussion on the current format and potential changes in the future.

The CFP went from four teams to 12 teams for the 2024 season, and the two most powerful conferences favored further expansion but could not agree on a number.

The SEC pushed for 16 teams, with an emphasis on at-large bids — a format favored by the Power Four leagues other than the Big Ten and most of the smaller conferences that are hoping for access into whatever comes next.

The Big Ten has pushed for a bracket of up to 24 teams with multiple automatic qualifiers from each conference. It could do away with the need for conference title games and replace them with seeding games to determine, say, two or three of the automatic spots.

“After ongoing discussion about the 12-team playoff format, the decision was made to continue with the current structure,” CFP executive director Rich Clark said. “This will give the Management Committee additional time to review the 12-team format, so they can better assess the need for potential change. While they all agree the current format has brought more excitement to college football and has given more schools a real shot in the postseason, another year of evaluation will be helpful.”

The 2026-27 season's format will feature 12 teams based on conference champions and final ranking by the CFP selection committee. First-round games will be played on campus sites, followed by quarterfinals and semifinals hosted by the CFP bowls, and the national championship game, which will take place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 25, 2027.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Outraged critics accused President Donald Trump of “whitewashing history” on Friday after the National Park Service removed an exhibit on slavery at Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park in response to his executive order “restoring truth and sanity to American history” on display at the nation's museums, parks and landmarks. 

Empty bolt holes and shadows are all that remains on the brick walls where explanatory panels were displayed at the President's House Site, where George and Martha Washington lived with the people they owned as property during the years when Philadelphia was the nation's capital. One woman cried silently at their absence. Someone left a bouquet of flowers. A hand-lettered sign said “Slavery was real.”

Crews on Thursday removed the exhibit which included the names and other biographical details about the nine people enslaved by the Washingtons at the presidential mansion. Their names remain engraved on a cement wall at the entrance.

Seeking to stop the display's permanent removal, the city of Philadelphia on Thursday sued Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and acting National Park Service Director Jessica Bowron.

The panels came down because Trump's order requires federal agencies to review interpretive materials to “ensure accuracy, honesty, and alignment with shared national values,” an Interior Department statement said. It called the city's lawsuit frivolous, aimed at “demeaning our brave Founding Fathers who set the brilliant road map for the greatest country in the world.”




The department did not answer questions about what will replace the exhibits that were removed. 

The City of Philadelphia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The people enslaved at the mansion included Oney Judge, who famously ran away and remained free despite Washington's attempts to return her to bondage. Slavery is central to the site's story, Philadelphia's lawsuit argues, adding that the terms of the city's management partnership with the federal government gives the city equal say over any design changes. 

Critics condemned the removals as confirmation that the Trump administration seeks to erase unflattering aspects of American history.

“Their shameful desecration of this exhibit raises broader, disturbing questions about this administration's continued abuse of power and commitment to whitewashing history,” said Rep. Dwight Evans, a Pennsylvania Democrat.

Taking pride in American independence shouldn't mean hiding its mistakes, said Ed Stierli, senior mid-Atlantic regional director for the National Parks Conservation Association, which works to protect national parks. These historic sites should help Americans grapple with the difficult truths and contradictions in how we frame history, he said, and removing the exhibit is an insult to the memory of the enslaved people who lived there.

“It reverses years of collaborative work by the National Park Service, City of Philadelphia, and community members, and sets a dangerous precedent of prioritizing nostalgia over the truth,” Stieri said.

“It shows that the United States is still unwilling to reckon with the horrors of its past and would rather prefer to sanitize the history that it has and try to present a convenient lie,” said Timothy Welbeck, director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University.

The order, which Trump signed last March, accused the Biden administration of advancing a “corrosive ideology” at the nation's historic sites. 

“At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — where our Nation declared that all men are created equal — the prior administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates dismantling ‘Western foundations' and ‘interrogating institutional racism' and pressured National Historical Park rangers that their racial identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting Americans because America is purportedly racist,” the order states.

A California man was arrested and his home was raided after he was accused of stealing millions of taxpayer dollars meant for the homeless.

California officials have arrested Alexander Soofer, who allegedly used tens-of-millions of taxpayer dollars meant to house and feed the homeless to fund his lavish lifestyle, Fox News has learned. Soofer was the executive director of the charity Abundant Blessings, which received government funding for its work.

First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli said in a news conference on Friday that Soofer was charged with wire fraud, a felony that carries a maximum of 20 years in prison.

""I want to tell you a little bit about his organization, Abundant Blessings. It was a South Los Angeles-based charity whose purpose is to help house and properly feed the estimated 72,000 homeless people living in the greater Los Angeles area. His organization received more than $23 million in taxpayer funds for the purpose of housing and feeding the homeless,"" Essayli said.

""California was pushing this money out quickly. A lot of money went out the door, with, frankly, very little vetting, very little checks and balances. And, he's one of the individuals that got it in this organization,"" he added.

Essayli alleged that Soofer provided fake invoices to make vendors appear to be legitimate.

Essayli said that rather than providing the needy with ""at least three healthy, balanced, nutritious meals a day,"" which he was allegedly contracted to do, Soofer gave them ramen noodles and a microwave.

Soofer allegedly used the money to put a down payment on his $7 million mansion, pay for his children's private school tuition and to purchase a $125,000 Range Rover, according to Essayli.

Essayli slammed Soofer, saying ""he was living the high life while the people suffering, homeless on the streets with no shelter, no food, they're living out on the streets. People are literally dying, and this guy is out vacationing, buying homes, buying Range Rovers and going shopping.""

Law enforcement took Soofer into custody in a pre-dawn bust at his multi-million-dollar mansion in Los Angeles. Federal authorities, who claim Soofer used the funds to make improvements on his luxury home, later arrived to tow his Range Rover.

The bust comes after independent journalist Nick Shirley, who worked to expose the fraud scandal in Minnesota, told Congress that the fraud in California could be ""worse"" than what he found in the North Star State. Shirley made the remark in response to a question posed by Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., about whether his state was showing similar signs of fraud to what was seen in Minnesota.

""Fraud in California might be even worse than the fraud in Minnesota,"" Shirley said. When asked to elaborate, he noted the missing $24 billion in homeless funds, as well as various other projects and issues that, in his opinion, appear to signal fraud.

Earlier this month, Essayli dubbed Gov. Gavin Newsom the ""king of fraud.""

""California has spent $24 billion in the last five years on homelessness, and no one can account for where that money has really gone,"" Essayli told ""Fox & Friends"" earlier this month.

In April, Essayli launched a task force to investigate corruption in California, with a focus on homeless services. The task force has already resulted in federal charges against two men accused of using real estate projects to exploit the state's homelessness system for personal profit.

Essayli said those cases, which involve millions of dollars in alleged fraud, are only the ""tip of the iceberg.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ripped Gov. Gavin Newsom in an interview with Politico over his rhetoric at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (Credit: Politico - Jan. 22, 2026)

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent took aim at Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his political stunt at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, brushing the left-wing governor off as operating with a ""brain the size of a walnut.""

""I think Gavin Newsom may be cracking up, some of these things he's saying. I think he may be in over his hairdo,"" Bessent told Politico's ""The Conversation.""

Newsom traveled to Davos, Switzerland, recently to attend the World Economic Forum, where President Donald Trump's presence headlined the event as the administration pressures European leaders to strike a deal for the U.S. to acquire Greenland. 

The Democratic governor is a longtime political opponent of Trump's, and issued a warning to foreign leaders to grow a ""backbone"" with Trump in a political broadside against the White House from the forum Monday. His attack included saying he should have brought ""kneepads"" for foreign dignitaries interacting with Trump while also comparing Trump to a T.rex.

""This is diplomacy with Donald Trump. He's a T.rex. You mate with him, or he devours you, one or the other,"" Newsom said Tuesday. ""The Europeans could be (devoured) if they continue down this path and process. They need to stand tall, stand firm, stand united."" 

Bessent shot back Thursday that the comparison was nonsensical while saying the governor has a ""brain the size of a walnut.""

""Being on the national stage is very different than being governor of California with no signature achievements, but to say strange things, like President Trump is a Tyrannosaurus rex. What the hell does that mean?"" the Treasury secretary said. ""I could say, Gavin Newsom is a brontosaurus with a brain the size of a walnut.""

Newsom did in fact bring kneepads to the forum as part of a political stunt, calling them ""Trump signature series kneepads"" during a speech in Davos, Switzerland.  

Amid his meetings in Davos, Newsom was photographed with left-wing billionaire Alex Soros, the son of billionaire philanthropist George Soros.

Bessent quipped: ""If you brought the kneepads, maybe that was for his meeting with Alex Soros. I don't know.""

The Treasury secretary added that Newsom knows ""less about economics than"" former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he described as ""a terrible place to be in.""

Bessent's remarks to Politico are his latest this week against Newsom, comparing him to a mix of ""American Psycho"" main character Patrick Bateman ""meets Sparkle Beach Ken"" doll Tuesday.

He was the governor of California. We had a really … he would talk about it often. And, somewhere, we just went astray. I just, I just hate the way California is being run.

Former Canadian Olympic snowboarder and FBI Ten Most Wanted fugitive Ryan Wedding has been captured in Mexico with the help of local authorities, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed Friday.

Bondi announced Wedding's capture in a post on X, adding the Canadian national was flown into the United States, where he will ""face justice."" Patel accompanied Wedding on the flight to the U.S., sources said.

""At my direction, Department of Justice agents @FBI have apprehended yet another member of the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted List: Ryan Wedding, the onetime Olympian snowboarder-turned alleged violent cocaine kingpin,"" Bondi said.

""This is a direct result of President Trump's law-and-order leadership. Under @POTUS, criminals have no safe harbor. Director Patel has worked tirelessly to bring fugitives to justice. We are grateful to our incredible Ambassador Ron Johnson and the Mexican authorities for assisting us in this case."" 

Patel highlighted in a separate post on X that Wedding was the first fugitive added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list during his tenure and, ""Now, less than a year later, he is in custody."" 

""Wedding is believed to have been hiding in Mexico for over a decade - and has been wanted on charges for cocaine trafficking and murder since 2024,"" he said in part. 

""This is the SIXTH Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitive this FBI has captured within a year — fugitives who had been on the run for almost 40 years combined. That's no accident. President Trump is letting good cops be cops and the results speak for themselves.""

MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SEIZE $40M IN MOTORCYCLES FROM OLYMPIC SNOWBOARDER TURNED FUGITIVE, FBI SAYS

Wedding, 44, was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted list in March 2025 and is accused of running a transnational drug trafficking network that ""routinely shipped hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia, through Mexico and Southern California, to Canada and other locations in the United States,"" according to the FBI. 

He is also accused of orchestrating multiple murders and attempted murder as a part of his drug trafficking operation. 

Wedding and 14 other alleged associates were specifically accused of orchestrating the January 2025 murder of a witness who was shot and killed at a restaurant in Colombia. He allegedly placed a bounty on the victim's head, thinking the victim's death would lead to the dismissal of charges against him and the drug-trafficking ring he allegedly heads, according to an indictment unsealed in November.

Just last month, FBI officials confirmed that Mexican authorities seized $40 million in motorcycles believed to be owned by Wedding. That news came more than a month after Wedding was hit with additional charges and raised the reward for his capture to $15 million.  

He participated in the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City after missing out on the 1998 Games. It was the only Olympics he competed in.

Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on House Republicans' plan to assist first-time home buyers on 'Special Report.'

Every few years, Washington comes up with a ""creative"" solution to an affordability problem that sounds helpful on the surface and quietly creates a much bigger problem underneath. 

The latest example? A proposal tied to President Donald Trump's housing affordability agenda that would allow Americans to tap their 401(k) retirement savings to fund a down payment on a home. 

I understand the intent. Housing affordability is stretched. Home prices are near all-time highs. Mortgage rates are still hovering around 6%. First-time buyers feel locked out. COVID-19 buyers can't afford to trade up. Politically, this all sounds like a win. 

Financially, it's a terrible idea, in my view. This is the classic case of robbing Peter to pay Paul and, in this case, Peter is your future self.

GEN Z IS STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE — AND REPUBLICANS CAN'T AFFORD TO LOOK AWAY

Trump's solution to the American dream is a nightmare for those who cash in part of their retirement to buy houses. (iStock)

Your 401(k) was designed for one purpose. To fund decades of income when you can no longer work. It was never meant to double as a short-term housing fund or a policy pressure valve when affordability gets tight. 

When you pull money out early of your 401(k), even if it's labeled a ""loan"" or ""special access,"" three brutally damaging things happen:

PRO-TRUMP GROUP UNLEASHES BLUEPRINT FOR CRUCIAL HOUSING INITIATIVE FEATURING TOP MAGA INFLUENCER

That last point matters more than politicians would like to admit. 

AMERICANS HAVE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO MORE LUXURIES, BUT WHY DO WE FEEL SO POOR?

According to multiple retirement studies, a large percentage of 401(k) loans are never repaid because of job changes, layoffs or life disruptions. What do we think will happen when someone takes a 401(k) distribution for a down payment on a home? The odds are it will never ever get paid back for retirement. 

Let's put real numbers behind this. 

If a 35-year-old pulls $50,000 from their 401(k) to buy a home and never replaces it, that single decision could cost them $300,000 to $400,000 by retirement, assuming long-term market averages. That's just math.

And here's the irony about this. The people most likely to use this proposal are the ones who already struggle to save consistently. They don't have excess cash flow. They don't max out retirement plans. So, once the money is gone, it's gone.

TRUMP'S 50-YEAR MORTGAGE JUST INTRODUCES A NEW KIND OF DEBT

Supporters of this idea argue that ""homeownership builds wealth."" That's partially true, but it's also incomplete in the financial planning equation. 

A home is:

Retirement accounts, on the other hand, are:

The truth is uncomfortable right now, but necessary to review. 

Housing isn't unaffordable because Americans aren't creative enough with their retirement money. It's unaffordable because:

SCAMMERS TARGET RETIREES AS MAJOR 401(K) RULE CHANGES LOOM FOR 2026 TAX YEAR AHEAD NATIONWIDE

Letting people tap 401(k)s doesn't fix any of that. It simply injects more demand into a broken system, which can push prices higher and reward sellers not buyers.

6 KICK-BUTT FINANCIAL RESOLUTIONS YOU SHOULD MAKE TODAY TO PROTECT TOMORROW

In other words, this proposal could make homes even more expensive while quietly hollowing out retirement security, putting even more pressure on Social Security. 

Policies that trade long-term stability for short-term relief almost always backfire.

Using retirement money to buy a home concentrates risk instead of spreading it. You're tying your future financial security to one asset in one location at one moment in time.

We've already watched Americans underfund retirement for decades. Encouraging them to drain the one bucket that actually works for them, which is a tax-advantaged long-term, automated saving program, is going to move people backward. 

Homeownership matters.

Once upon a time, you paid fifty bucks for a steak only if your waiter wore a tux. Now you pay it under fluorescent lights at the supermarket. 

That's not inflation. That's a Brazilian beef cartel squeezing American families. Here's the part no one ever explains: 

Beef prices aren't set on the ranch. They're set in the slaughterhouse — the place where cattle are turned into the burgers and steaks you buy at the store. Control that step, and you control the price. Period. 

And right now, America's slaughterhouses are controlled by a foreign-dominated cartel tied to Brazil. 

The United States has over half a million cattle ranches. But almost all of their cattle must pass through a tiny number of meatpacking plants before reaching your plate. Just four companies control about 85% of U.S. beef processing — and two of them, JBS and National Beef, are effectively controlled from Brazil. 

That's not competition. That's a choke point. 

That's because Brazil isn't just another beef producer. It's the largest beef exporter in the world. And China isn't just another customer; It's the world's biggest beef buyer. 

When Brazilian-controlled firms run major U.S. processing plants, American beef prices stop reflecting public conditions. Foreign demand sets the floor — and China ends up setting the price of dinner in America. 

That's how a backyard barbecue turns into a luxury item. 

This Brazil–China beef axis squeezes Americans from both ends. Ranchers get paid less. You pay more — while the profits pour offshore. 

That's not a free market. That's market muscle. 

The danger of this Brazil–China chokehold became impossible to ignore last summer, when trade tensions flared and Brazilian exporters shifted beef away from the United States and toward China. Supplies tightened. Prices jumped. Your grocery bill followed weeks later. 

No cartel or foreign power should have that kind of leverage over what Americans eat. That's why President Donald Trump ordered the Department of Justice to launch a full antitrust investigation into foreign-dominated meatpacking firms. 

We would never tolerate a foreign-aligned cartel embedded in our power grid, our ports, or our telecom networks. We shouldn't tolerate one embedded in our food supply. 

Trump has always understood that economic security is national security — and food security is part of that fight. 

If America raises the cattle, the public should set the price, not a Brazil–China export axis operating through a cartelized-processing bottleneck. 

Antitrust law exists for moments like this. When concentration becomes coercion, the answer isn't hand-wringing. It's restoring competition. And if that means breakups and divestitures, so be it. 

The people didn't vote to have their dinner prices set overseas. 

TRUMP PROVED IT WAS EASY TO CONDEMN ANTISEMITISM

They voted for leaders willing to break cartels — and bring steak back to the dinner table without a tux.

The surprising truth about corporate investment in housing.

Wall Street is “gobbling up” America's homes. Firms with names like BlackRock (or Blackstone or SablePebble) are shouldering their way into every suburban open house and offering 50 percent above asking price — in a bid to consolidate control of local markets and then jack up rents with impunity. As a result, America's young families have been locked out of homeownership, while its renters have been price-gouged into poverty. If we want to make housing affordable again, we must ban Big Finance from buying single-family homes.

This is one of the most influential accounts of America's housing crisis.

The narrative has spread virally for years on social media. More nuanced versions of the tale have appeared in major publications and congressional press releases. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump pledged to “ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes,” then signed an executive order Tuesday that heavily restricts such purchases. And progressive Democrats in the Senate are cheering him on.

Unfortunately, the story spurring these policies is largely false. Corporate investment in single-family homes is not a major driver of Americans' high housing costs. To the contrary, that investment has likely made housing in the United States more affordable. The “BlackRock ate our homes” narrative owes its popularity to its ideological convenience, not empirical validity.

Housing is unquestionably too expensive in the United States.

In 2024, the median price of a single family home hit a record $412,500 — five times the median US income. Back in the 1990s, such a property cost only about three times as much as the typical family earned.

Meanwhile, roughly one-third of Americans — and one half of renters — spend more than 30 percent of their earnings on housing. And this cost crunch is especially severe in vibrant coastal cities, where economic opportunity is concentrated.

Given these facts, if we want to explain America's housing crisis, we need to identify forces that have:

Wall Street investment in single-family homes meets neither of these criteria.

At the national level, such investment is miniscule. As of 2022, institutional investors owned 0.55 percent of single-family homes in the United States, and only 3 percent of single-family rentals. That year, the largest of these investors, Invitation Homes, held just 0.6 percent of America's rental houses.

We lack comprehensive data for more recent years. But we know the picture has not radically changed. The property intelligence company Cotality tracks all home purchases by investor size. And mega-investors have never accounted for as much as 4 percent of annual home sales (and that is including sales of multifamily homes, which large investors are more likely to own).

What's more, these sales have been concentrated in relatively affordable cities.

Institutional investors own a negligible share of single-family homes in New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where housing costs are exceptionally high. Meanwhile, they hold 27 percent of all single-family rental properties in Atlanta, 20 percent in Charlotte, and 22 percent in Jacksonville — all cities where rent-to-income ratios are close to the national average.

Thus, even if we stipulated that Wall Street investment reduces affordability, there simply wouldn't be enough of it — either at the national level or in America's highest-cost cities — for it to explain more than a tiny fraction of our housing problem.

A supporter of Trump's ban might reply: So what?

Perhaps institutional investors aren't the primary cause of high costs nationwide. But they are buying a lot of houses in some cities. And that surely nudges prices up in those places. So why not stop Wall Street from doing that? Why let Big Finance increase ordinary Americans' cost of living even a little?

These are reasonable questions. And there is indeed evidence that institutional investment in single-family homes has marginally increased home prices in some markets.

Nonetheless, such investment has likely done more to reduce rents than to increase prices — and thus, been net-positive for affordability.

All else equal, the more rental homes on the market, the lower rents will be. In theory, institutional investment in single-family homes should expand the rental stock through (at least) three mechanisms.

First, this investment often finances the construction of new houses. In the third quarter of 2025, the real estate trust American Homes 4 Rent acquired 92 percent of its new properties from its own in-house builder. America's largest landlord, Invitation Homes, has embraced similar practices: Of the 526 single-family homes it purchased last summer, 81 percent were new units that had been built to rent.

This investment expands the total stock of homes in the United States, increasing options for renters without reducing options for homebuyers by a commensurate amount. (To its credit, the Trump administration has exempted build-to-rent properties from its ban.)

Second, large landlords can increase the rental sector's productivity through economies of scale. Unlike a small-time landlord, a company that owns 1,000 houses in Atlanta can afford to employ full-time maintenance teams. As a result, when a resident moves out of one of their properties, they will be able to rapidly refurbish that unit and lease it out again — minimizing the amount of time their home lies vacant.

Through these sorts of efficiencies, institutional investors achieve lower operating costs than small landlords. And the less it costs a landlord to provide a single unit of housing, the more units they can profitably produce at any given level of rent. For this reason, large investors can expand rental supply more quickly in response to surges in demand.

Finally, and most controversially, institutional investors redistribute homes from the for-sale market to the rental market. Although Wall Street has shifted towards buying newly built homes in recent years, it does still compete with ordinary homebuyers for some existing houses. And that competition can nudge up prices.

But Big Finance isn't buying these homes because it needs places to store its gold. It's buying them to lease out. Every time Invitation Homes takes a house off the sales market, it adds one to America's rental inventory.

Ideally, we would make housing more affordable for both renters and prospective homebuyers. But Americans who can't qualify for a mortgage tend to be more cost-burdened and economically vulnerable than those who can. For this reason, if we want to minimize the number of Americans who cannot afford decent housing, reducing rents is more urgent than cutting prices.

And empirical research confirms that institutional investment lowers prices in practice, not just in theory. According to a 2025 paper from economists at Dartmouth College and the Department of Justice, rents in Atlanta would be 2.4 percent higher today, in the absence of Wall Street investment in its single-family housing stock.

A separate study from Baruch College's Joshua Coven reports similar findings. He estimates that, for every one percentage point increase in institutional investors' share of an area's single-family rental market, rents fall by 0.7 percent.

Notably, Coven's study accounts for the concern that large landlords may drive up rents by cornering rental markets. His paper suggests that concentrated ownership does lift rents at the margin. But this effect is swamped by institutional investment's positive impact on supply.

And this finding is intuitive. Even in cities like Atlanta — where institutional investment is exceptionally high — no single investor owns more than 5 percent of all single-family rentals. And it is difficult for any business to dictate prices when its rivals own 95 percent of the market.

In any case, Coven's study suggests that — at the national level — institutional investment in houses has reduced rents by a bit more than it has increased home prices. And this is likely to be even more true in the future: In the time period examined by Coven, Wall Street had yet to shift its focus away from buying up existing homes and toward financing new ones.

From a progressive standpoint, institutional investment in single-family homes has an additional benefit: It reduces racial and socioeconomic segregation.

Much of America's working-class lacks the credit necessary to qualify for a mortgage. They therefore cannot live in an area unless it hosts a lot of rental housing. Historically, most affluent suburbs have not fit the bill.

Only single-family housing is allowed on most of America's suburban land. And although large investors have always bought and rented out apartment buildings, they traditionally did not traffic in single-family homes.

Wall Street's entrance into the latter market has therefore opened up many previously class-segregated communities to less well-off Americans. A recent study from Federal Reserve economist Konhee Chang found that institutional investment in Southern suburbs reduced segregation by enabling lower-income, disproportionately nonwhite renters to move into neighborhoods where they couldn't afford to buy.

Likewise, Coven's paper shows that people who rent institutionally owned, single-family homes usually moved there from a poorer neighborhood with worse schools. And that can make a big difference in working-class kids' lives. According to research from Harvard University's Raj Chetty, children who move from impoverished areas to affluent ones are more likely to attend college and earn middle-class incomes as adults.

Of course, not everyone wants more integration. In Chang's study, when institutional landlords made an area more accessible to disproportionately nonwhite, working-class renters, homeowners nearby became more likely to move out, evidently “perceiving renters as a disamenity.”

It's hard not to suspect that this is, in part, what the backlash to Wall Street investment in single-family homes is really about. After all, there's relatively little complaint (outside socialist circles) about large investors buying and renting out apartments. It was only when they began purchasing houses — and thus, undermining the ability of affluent localities to keep out the hoi polloi through single-family zoning — that concern about Wall Street ownership of housing went mainstream.

In truth, housing in the US is expensive because it is scarce. And it is scarce because zoning restrictions outlaw apartment buildings on most residential land, red tape needlessly inflates the cost of housing production, and the government doesn't do enough to channel capital toward the real estate sector, either through subsidies or direct public investment.

Combine these shortage-inducing policies with income inequality, and you end up with homelessness, displacement, and lackluster wage growth.

We can escape this fate. But doing so will require Americans to accept some trade-offs. For housing to become abundant, many middle-class homeowners will need to tolerate more construction noise, traffic, and competition for parking in their neighborhoods. Taxpayers will need to swallow greater public investment in housing construction. Green groups will need to stomach restrictions on environmental review.

And of course, any successful effort to constrain housing prices will, by definition, make most American families' chief financial asset — their homes — less valuable than they otherwise would be.

Given the inconvenience of these truths, it's not surprising that politicians have gravitated toward myths. If you blame the housing crisis on a few conniving corporations, then you don't need to ask your constituents to contribute anything to its resolution. And taking this tack may also endear you to your party's populist activists, many of whom are spoiling for a fight with Big Finance.

The downside is just that your demagogy is liable to make housing even more expensive. Before backing Trump's ban, officials should ask themselves whether that is a price they're willing to pay.

Two things can be true of Tesla's Full Self-Driving: It's an impressive piece of technology, and it still doesn't go far enough.

FSD is Tesla's big bet. CEO Elon Musk and his most bullish investors believe that autonomy will help take Tesla's valuation to new heights.

Today, FSD (Supervised), as the name suggests, is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that requires constant human supervision. The promise is to advance FSD enough to make the system unsupervised — meaning the driver behind the wheel can take their eyes off the road or even fall asleep. Tesla gave a glimpse of this future on Thursday, launching Robotaxi rides in Austin without a safety monitor in the vehicle.

The gap between what the tech can do and what it can't is where my experience landed.

I recently demoed a 2025 Tesla Model 3 that came installed with FSD v14.2.1, the latest software version available at the time.

With my friend riding shotgun, I drove around the East Bay Area, taking the Model 3 through various road environments, including a university campus, parking lots, and the highway, on a clear Saturday afternoon.

FSD proved to be a highly capable driver — so much so that it has spoiled me into wishing that I didn't have to constantly babysit the system.

I drove the Model 3 for a few hours around Berkeley and Alameda. The drive was a little less than 100 miles through a wide range of driving conditions — highly dense urban streets, university roads, canyons, and the highway.

One was when FSD was cautious around pedestrians on Berkeley's campus. I recall a student who wasn't using the crosswalk but was close to it, walking across the road. FSD came to a rolling stop rather than an abrupt halt, which is exactly how I would've handled the situation.

The system also managed to navigate the university's roads and perform a three-point turn when I stopped the car and added a new destination.

FSD's ""Mad Max"" mode is impressive in the way it lane-changed around a few cars that were moving too slowly on the highway for my taste. Calling it ""Mad Max"" feels a little gratuitous, but I appreciate that a more urgent driving mode is available.

At no point did I need to disengage FSD or question the system enough to take over the steering wheel. Tesla FSD is a smooth and cautious driver.

My friend, who doesn't actively follow tech news or everything Musk says as much as I do, described the experience like being in a ""spaceship."" That wasn't necessarily a compliment from his end — he likes older cars — but it's exactly how Musk intended the Tesla experience to be.

I gained enough trust in FSD that I wanted to test the system's limits by closing my eyes while driving down University Avenue — a fairly busy thoroughfare in Berkeley.

The car kept driving for a bit, but I was inevitably warned to pay attention to the road.

As good as FSD is, the technology doesn't allow you to completely disengage mentally. It was like having an itch that's just not quite fully satisfied. The technology is — or at least feels — so, so close.

People who swear by FSD like to say that the system is a game changer, lifting the burden of driving off their shoulders.

I agree that driving can be a tedious chore. I immediately think about the drive between San Francisco and Los Angeles that I do a few times a year. It's about 400 miles and can easily be a 7-hour drive depending on traffic.

The problem isn't that it's hard in a problem-solving sense. The drive is mostly a straight shot. The problem is that I have to stay awake. I can listen to music, put on an entertaining podcast, or get 200 mg of caffeine from a can of Celsius, but the drive is so monotonous that I could easily doze off while on the 5 highway.

I obviously can't do that yet with Tesla FSD, which makes me wonder: How significant is the difference, really, between the cognitive effort it takes to manually drive from SF to LA than having to supervise an ADAS?

FSD feels like the burden of driving was just shifted away from my hands and feet to my attention.

Musk said an FSD (Supervised) is now capable enough for drivers to take their eyes off the road in certain conditions without triggering the warning system.

That would be useful only if Tesla were to take full responsibility when I get pulled over by the police.

A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

I'm likely spoiled because I know what full autonomy feels like.

I have constant access to Waymo. I've filed an entire story inside a robotaxi and used it several times to take me home after a night of drinking.

That's the bar I want Tesla FSD to reach and exceed: a system capable enough to let me sleep behind the wheel on any road, meaning no geofences, and one in which Tesla will take accountability for any issues that arise while FSD is unsupervised.

I'm also thinking about folks like David Moss, who said he broke a record for driving more than 11,000 miles on FSD without touching the steering wheel. Moss told me how FSD could be a life-changer for his father, who is legally blind and unable to drive. If Tesla's ADAS can reliably — and legally — put people like Moss' dad behind the wheel, I can see Full Self-Driving going from a nice-to-have to a need-to-have.

Tesla's decision to remove the safety monitor from some of its robotaxis suggests the company could be close.

For now, it's a tease.

But on Thursday, human resources chief Melissa Kremer sent a memo to staff acknowledging ""the stress many of you may be carrying."" It came as armed federal agents detained thousands of people across the city, and residents protested the moves.

The company declined to comment on the memo.

Some of those encounters have occurred in Target stores and parking lots.

A spokesperson previously declined to comment when video clips that appeared to show an employee being detained and an in-store bathroom break for Commander Gregory Bovino went viral.

""Target does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency,"" Kremer said in this week's memo. ""We're listening and working to de-escalate where possible.""

The memo also mentioned new internal resources for workers about how to safely handle ""disruption near our locations.""

While Target spoke out publicly following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the company has more recently tried to avoid alienating either side of the political aisle on issues such as LGBTQ+ Pride and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

In addition to its corporate headquarters, Target has about 20 stores in the greater Twin Cities metro area and is one of the largest employers in the state.

Some states are stepping in to blunt the financial fallout of lapsed federal subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums. 

California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Mexico have all started offering additional state-funded premium subsidies in 2026 in order to help keep insurance premiums from becoming unaffordable for many residents after enhanced federal subsidies expired at the end of 2025, experts said. 

In most cases, the state assistance is less generous than the lapsed federal aid, they said.

But state subsidies will help many consumers — especially those with lower incomes — and reduce the number of households that drop their insurance coverage, experts said.

""They soften the blow,"" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for healthinsurance.org, an insurance referral site, said of the state-level premium subsidies.

Roughly 2.6 million people in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Mexico received enhanced federal premium subsidies in 2025 — about 12% of all consumers getting them nationwide, according to federal data tracked by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.

The maneuvers may deepen the political divide on the issue of health insurance subsidies, experts said.

Democrats on Capitol Hill have pushed to extend the expired federal subsidies, even centering the record-long government shutdown around the issue. The Republican majority has thus far stymied their efforts.

Blue states are the ones that have chosen to offer extra premium assistance to residents, said Matt McGough, an Affordable Care Act policy analyst at KFF. 

Even then, it's only a ""very small handful"" that have done so, he said. 

Red states like Texas and Florida saw by far the largest growth in ACA enrollment after enhanced federal subsidies took effect in 2021 — and stand to see many of those consumers drop their insurance coverage now that the federal subsidies have ended, McGough said.

About 4.5 million people in Florida and 3.7 million in Texas received premium subsidies — also known as premium tax credits — in 2025, according to a KFF analysis of federal data. 

Together, they account for more than a third of the roughly 22 million Americans who received premium subsidies that year. 

By comparison, in California, the most populous state in the U.S., 1.8 million people received premium tax credits last year. 

The partisan disparity on ACA subsidies comes in a midterm election year in which Republicans are trying to hold onto a razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives, and as affordability has emerged as a key focus for politicians and consumers.

The average person who received a premium tax credit last year is expected to see their insurance premiums more than double in 2026, to $1,904 per month from $888, due to the expiry of the enhanced federal subsidies, according to KFF.

The enhanced subsidies had been in place in 2021. They built on the original framework of premium tax credits that had been available since 2014, in the early days of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. 

That original tranche of federal subsidies remains. They work on a sliding scale, with more assistance available to lower-income households. 

However, they aren't as valuable as the enhanced premium tax credits. The enhanced subsidies had capped out-of-pocket payments for households at 8.5% of their annual income; now, that cap has increased to about 10%.

Additionally, certain households no longer qualify to receive a premium tax credit due to the return of the so-called ""subsidy cliff.""

Specifically, enhanced subsidies allowed middle-income households that earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level — about $63,000 for a single individual or about $129,000 for a family of four — to qualify for a premium tax credit for the first time. 

Now, they're once again ineligible. 

The federal government uses the 2025 poverty guidelines to determine income eligibility for 2026. 

States like New York, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Washington state had already offered additional state assistance to help make health insurance more affordable — on top of federal premium tax credits — before the federal enhanced subsidies lapsed, according to McGough.

Those remain in place, he said.

Other states have taken measures to shore up financial assistance, due specifically to the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies. 

New Mexico is the only state that has fully replaced the enhanced federal subsidies for residents, experts said. 

""They backfilled everything,"" Norris said. ""Nobody lost out on their subsidies in New Mexico. As a result, enrollment really grew.""

ACA enrollment has grown by about 17% year-over-year in 2026, according to state-level data, a dynamic that Norris said bucks the national trend. 

Federal data suggest that about 1.5 million U.S. households had already dropped their insurance coverage by early January. The Urban Institute estimates nearly 5 million people will ultimately drop their health coverage in 2026 and be uninsured due to lapsing subsidies.

New Mexico state lawmakers are offering the funding through June 30. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, has called for an extension beyond June 30 if Congress doesn't legislate additional funding. 

Connecticut is the only other state that has moved to replace at least some of the expiring subsidies for those whose incomes are over 400% of the federal poverty line, the group of consumers who fell off the federal subsidy cliff, Norris said. 

Connecticut will replace half of the lapsed subsidy amounts for those with income between 400% and 500% of the federal poverty level, according to Access Health CT, the state health insurance marketplace. That equates to about $63,000 to $78,000 for a single individual, for example.

Connecticut will also fully fund the expired enhanced subsidy amounts for households with incomes between 100% and 200% of the federal poverty level, or $15,650 to about $31,000.

The state is targeting consumers ""particularly hard hit"" by expiring subsidies, Norris said. 

For example, the average household with an income over 400% of the federal poverty line is expected to see its annual ACA health premiums jump to about $8,500 in 2026 from $4,400, according to the Urban Institute. 

Massachusetts is investing an extra $250 million into its state health insurance marketplace, called ConnectorCare, for 2026, bringing the total to $600 million, according to a Jan. 8 press release issued by Governor Maura Healey and Lt. Governor Kim Driscoll.

The funding comes from the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund, a special revenue fund for state expenses, according to the release. 

The investment means about 270,000 consumers earning less than 400% of the federal poverty line ""will see little to no premium increases because of the expiring federal credits,"" according to the release. 

The state also capped health deductibles and co-pays for the first time, as well as the cost of insulin and inhalers, it said. 

Separately, Massachusetts had also previously established a pilot program offering state premium subsidies for people who earn up to 500% of the federal poverty line, according to Norris. The state extended that program for 2026. 

Other states have taken steps to blunt the impact largely for lower-income households, experts said. 

For example, Maryland's state subsidy program will fully replace the enhanced federal premium subsidies for those under 200% of federal poverty level, according to the Maryland Insurance Administration. 

It will also replace half of the lapse federal subsidies for those between 250% and 400% of the federal poverty level.

California allocated $190 million to offer state subsidies in 2026 for people earning up to 150% of the federal poverty level, according to Covered California, the state's health insurance marketplace. 

The sum ensures ""monthly premiums remain comparable to 2025 levels"" for those with incomes of roughly $23,500 for an individual or $48,000 for a family of four, according to Covered California. 

However, the $190 million offsets just a small share of the total $2.5 billion that California residents are losing in 2026 due to the expiration of the federal subsidy enhancements, according to Norris.

California is also offering ""some additional assistance"" to those earning up to 165% of the federal poverty level, according to the state marketplace. 

Colorado is offering a maximum $80 per month in 2026 for an individual enrollee, and another $29 for each subsequent family member that pays a premium, according to McGough.

The premium subsidy is available to households making between 100% to 400% of the federal poverty level.

The plan will backfill about 40% of the lost federal assistance, McGough said.

Shares of Czech-based defense firm Czechoslovak Group (CSG) soared over 30% on its stock market debut on Friday, underscoring sustained investor interest in defense companies amid Europe's growing push for military sovereignty.

CSG, one of the world's fastest-growing defense firms, made its debut on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 

Shares rose as much as 32% in the session before closing the session up 31.4%.

The Prague-based company, which makes armed vehicles, ammunition and advanced defense systems, raised a total of 3.8 billion euros in its initial public offering. 

Euronext said the listing marked the world's largest defense IPO ever recorded, both in terms of amount raised and market capitalization.

""Today marks a historic milestone for CSG as we join the Euronext Amsterdam market and we welcome the confidence shown in us by investors,"" Michal Strnad, chairman of CSG, said in a statement.

""Becoming a publicly listed company demonstrates our commitment to high standards of transparency, disclosure and corporate governance and strengthens our ability to invest in innovation, expand our global reach and deliver on our mission to be a critical long-term supplier of advanced defence and industrial solutions to NATO states and Government partners worldwide,"" he added.

The listing comes after weeks of mounting geopolitical tensions, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to use military force to seize Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. 

In a surprise development on Wednesday, however, Trump said he had agreed to a framework of a future deal with respect to the self-governing Danish territory. 

In Europe, meanwhile, investors have continued to pile into defense stocks, fueled by a mix of European Union, national and private capital funding.

Strategists have cited Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the end of the U.S. defense umbrella in Europe as underpinning a so-called ""mega-trend in the making.""

Silver prices rose above $100 an ounce ​for the first time ever on Friday, while gold hit another record en route ‌to $5,000/oz as investors pile into safe-haven assets amid geopolitical turmoil and on expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts.

Spot silver jumped 4.5% to $100.49 an ounce.

""Silver should continue to benefit from many of the same forces supporting gold investment demand,"" said Philip Newman, a director at Metals Focus.

""Additional support will come from ‌ongoing tariff concerns and still low physical liquidity in the London market.""

The metal ​has surged more than 200% in the past year, also driven by ongoing challenges in scaling up refining of the metal and a persistent supply shortage in the market.

""Traders pushed steadily for and ‍achieved the milestone $100 print; investors will wait to see if it can sustain through the close or will there be profit-taking from recent speculators,"" said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader.

Spot gold was 0.8% higher at $4,976.49 an ounce, after ⁠touching a record of $4,988.17 earlier. U.S. gold futures for February delivery added 1.3% to $4,978.60.

""Gold's role as ‍a haven and a diversifier in highly uncertain economic and political times is making it a necessity for strategic ‌portfolios. It's ‌more than a perfect storm, which doesn't last, it's a sign of fundamentally changing times,"" Wong added.

Since the start of 2026, friction between the U.S. and NATO over Greenland, concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence, and continued uncertainty over tariffs have driven a surge in demand for safe‑haven assets.

Central bank buying and a ⁠broader move away from ⁠the dollar have also ​underpinned gold's rise. On the U.S. policy front, the Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady at its January 27–28 meeting, but markets still expect two further rate cuts in the second half of 2026

 As a non‑yielding ‍asset, gold is often favoured during periods of low interest rates. Gold hit significant milestones like $3,000/oz and $4,000/oz for the first time last year in March and October respectively. Platinum hit a record high of $2,749.2 an ounce and was last up 4% at $2,735.00. 

his metal is attracting ​investor demand as a cheaper alternative to gold, HSBC said, ‍adding that it expected a structural deficit in this market to widen to 1.2 million ounces this year.

Palladium, meanwhile, jumped by ​4.3% to $2,002.22.

Crypto researcher Axel has provided insights into why the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices are still crashing. This comes as BTC continues to see a supply overhang, which threatens to put more downward pressure on crypto prices. 

Why The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Prices Are Still Crashing

In a research report, Axel noted that anomalous exchange inflows accompanied the BTC breakdown below the $90,000 zone as sellers prepared in advance. The market is also still at risk of further selling pressure as the 1.0 level of the short-term holders' SOPR is now acting as a resistance rather than support. As such, there is a possibility that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices will decline further. 

Further commenting on Bitcoin netflows into exchanges, Axel noted that between January 20 and 21, almost 17,000 BTC flowed into exchanges, coinciding with BTC dropping to as low as $87,000, while Ethereum and Solana prices also dropped. The crypto researcher explained that these anomalously high values followed a period of predominantly negative netflow in the first half of this month. 

In the context of the falling Bitcoin price, Axel stated that such a spike is more likely to reflect supply preparation than neutral transfers. In other words, the breakdown below $90,000 appears to be structural rather than emotional. Meanwhile, Bitcoin netflow returned to neutral levels yesterday, but the accumulated inflow still creates a supply overhang, which could lead to further declines in the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. 

Axel noted that a signal of improvement would be if netflow turns negative again amid rising prices, which could indicate that the overhang has cleared. However, with the short-term holders' 7-day SMA SOPR below 0.996, the crypto researcher suggested that BTC faces increased selling pressure on every recovery as these holders look to sell at breakeven. He added that a reversal trigger could be confirmed if the SOPR breaks above 1.0 from below, with the 7-day SMA holding unity for three to five days to filter out false spikes after the selloff. 

Why A Break Above $100,000 Looks Unlikely For Now

In its latest research report, on-chain analytics platform Glassnode explained that a Bitcoin rally above $100,000 looks unlikely for now as the supply overhang persists. They noted how this overhang supply above $98,000 remains the dominant sell-side force capping short to mid-term rebounds. 

Alluding to the Unspent Realized Price Distribution metric, Glassnode noted that the recent BTC rally has partially filled the prior air gap between $93,000 and $98,000, driven by redistribution from top buyers into newer market participants. 

However, the unresolved supply overhang is expected to likely cap attempts above the $98,400 short-term holders' cost basis and the $100,000 level. A meaningful and sustained acceleration in demand momentum is said to be required for a clean breakout above $100,000 to occur.

An inactive Ethereum whale has just re-entered the trading scene, withdrawing over $15 million worth of ETH in just a single day. Considering Ethereum's slow price growth over the past few months and the whale's sudden appearance despite being dormant for months, there could be a possibility of insider trading.

A sudden $15.14 million Ethereum transaction has caught the crypto market's attention, with the move either driven by insider knowledge or simple strategic positioning. According to data from blockchain analytics platform, Onchain Lens, the transfer shifted approximately 5,099 ETH from a dormant wallet address on Kraken into active circulation on Thursday, January 22. 

Based on on-chain records, the whale, identified by the address ‘0x761F2F,' has remained inactive in the market for more than three months. The last few times the whale was actively moving in the market were when it executed a series of stablecoin and HYPE transactions. The anonymous whale had initiated multiple million-dollar trades in UETH, USDT, and USDC. Meanwhile, the HYPE transactions were primarily token burns. 

After withdrawing 5,099 ETH from Kraken, Arkham Intelligence reported that the whale had transferred the ETH to Lido Finance, converting it into 5,100 STETH. While there is currently no evidence of insider trading, the timing of the transaction raises questions, especially given Ethereum's muted price action over the past few months and the mounting selling pressure from large scale holders. 

Typically, insider trading in crypto occurs when individuals with non-public information make large transactions ahead of major market events that could influence market price. Currently, there has been no spike in Ethereum's price, nor any major news that could suddenly affect its movements. In fact, ETH continues to trade lower, down by roughly 1.7% over the past 24 hours. Its daily trading volume is also down by 34.89%, signaling reduced confidence among traders and investors. 

While dormant large-scale players are suddenly re-entering the market, some active whales remain bullish on Ethereum's long-term prospects despite its ongoing downtrend. According to well-known market analyst Max Crypto, an anonymous whale has just opened a $202 million long position in ETH with 15x leverage. 

The scale of the trade is extraordinary considering Ethereum's recent volatility. It shows strong confidence in the cryptocurrency's future price action and its potential to overcome its ongoing downtrend. Notably, the position has a liquidation price of $2,495, meaning that if ETH falls to that level, the trade could be forcibly closed by the crypto exchange, resulting in substantial losses for the whale. 

Market participants are closely watching the whales' positioning, with some calling it a brave but chaotic bet. Others have even speculated that the position may have been taken based on insider information, fueling discussions about potential market moves and a possible bullish turnaround for ETH.

On January 13, the Maryland Office of Financial Regulation finalized regulations implementing Maryland's virtual currency kiosk statute. The rules establish a detailed framework governing the registration and operation of virtual currency kiosk operators and individual kiosks across the state, building on statutory requirements that apply beginning January 1, 2026.

The regulations convert the statute's registration mandate into prescriptive operational requirements. In addition to outlining registration mechanics, the framework places significant emphasis on consumer protection measures intended to address fraud risks associated with kiosk-based virtual currency transactions.

The finalized rules include several core components:

Putting It Into Practice: Maryland's finalized kiosk rules reflect a broader state-level trend toward treating virtual currency kiosks more like traditional money services infrastructure (previously discussed here). Companies operating across multiple states should also monitor whether other jurisdictions adopt similar kiosk-specific regulatory models in 2026.

The Strychnos alkaloids have long been regarded as landmark targets for chemical synthesis due to their captivating architectures and notorious biological properties. However, the design of approaches that access multiple family members in an asymmetric, concise and atom-economical fashion remains an important challenge. Here we show that thiophene S,S-dioxides (TDOs) offer a modular, rapid entry to Strychnos natural products via inverse electron demand Diels–Alder cascades. We demonstrate that exceptional levels of stereocontrol can be achieved in asymmetric TDO cycloadditions, affording tricyclic indolines of utility in medicinal chemistry research and enabling the stereoselective synthesis of eight Strychnos alkaloids by the shortest routes described so far, including a synthesis of the iconic family member brucine. Using a machine-learning approach, computational studies provide insight into the source of stereoinduction and reveal an intriguing and unexpected spontaneous cheletropic extrusion of SO2.

The Strychnos indole alkaloid natural products have long excited the scientific community, not least because of their potent biological properties and architectural complexity (Fig. 1a). Robinson infamously said of the flagship member of the family, strychnine, that “for its molecular size, it is the most complex substance known”1, and the landmark synthesis of this natural product by Woodward et al.2,3 inspired the design of many synthetic approaches to these alkaloids4,5,6. In addition to the structural challenges, such endeavours have also been stimulated by their potential biological applications, such as the identification of alstolucines B and F as candidates for the re-sensitization of taxanes in multidrug-resistant cancers7. However, synthetic approaches that are asymmetric, sufficiently concise to produce useful quantities of natural product and also sufficiently flexible to enable the ‘collective' synthesis of multiple family members are rare. Additional demands of synthesis ideality, such as the avoidance of protecting groups and the minimization of waste8,9, impose further challenges that continue to limit the wider exploitation of the family. In this context, the six-step racemic synthesis of strychnine by the Vanderwal group10 and the collective asymmetric synthesis of six indole alkaloids by MacMillan et al. (including a twelve-step asymmetric approach to strychnine)11 represent pioneering contributions, with recent elegant approaches having also been described by the Zhang and Snaddon groups12,13.

We questioned whether an entry to the Strychnos family might be designed to meet the stringent demands of contemporary synthetic chemistry, specifically a modular, asymmetric strategy that would enable the construction of the Strychnos core in a handful of steps, and thereby access multiple natural products in a scalable, straightforward manner. We recognized that the polycyclic indoline core of the alkaloids is an attractive motif for ring formation via cycloaddition, in which an indole precursor would serve as an electron-rich 2π component. This concept was exploited by Vanderwal and co-workers using tethered Zincke aldehydes (Fig. 1b)10,14, and also by the Boger and Padwa groups via [3 + 2] cycloadditions with tethered carbonyl ylides15,16. However, these elegant strategies suffer from drawbacks, including the need for harsh reaction conditions when employing aromatic cycloaddition partners such as oxadiazoles (for example, heating at 180 °C for 48 h (ref. 15)), the use of hazardous diazo compounds for carbonyl ylide synthesis16 or the formation of racemic products10 that necessitate late-stage chromatographic resolution15.

We hypothesized that thiophene S,S-dioxides (TDOs, Fig. 1c)17 could address these limitations. These heterocycles are in many ways ‘ideal' diene substrates for inverse electron demand Diels–Alder (IEDDA) reactions as they are non-aromatic and should therefore exhibit enhanced reactivity compared with traditional substrates such as pyrones or tetrazines, while still having the benefits of electron deficiency, an intrinsically s-cis constrained diene and a powerful entropic driving force that renders the cycloaddition irreversible (that is, the loss of SO2 through cheletropic extrusion). However, the deployment of TDOs in target-oriented synthesis is surprisingly rare, with applications so far being restricted to aromatic carbocycles such as the relatively simple illudalane triterpenes, the antiplatelet agent beraprost and the indoline core of the dictyodendrins18,19,20. We questioned whether these underexploited dienes could also be used to assemble the saturated carbocycles found in the Strychnos core, and whether we might simultaneously develop asymmetric TDO cycloadditions, which would render the collective synthesis enantioselective.

Three complementary TDO-based approaches were envisaged to access the Strychnos core, which vary strategically in the order of synthetic events (Fig. 1c). First (Path I), tryptamine could undergo alkylation with side chain 1 suitable for downstream completion of the targeted natural products, followed by addition–elimination (substitution) reaction with a halogenated, chiral TDO 2a to give intermediate 3. The TDO in 3 would react with the tethered indole via a stereoselective intramolecular IEDDA–SO2 cheletropic extrusion pathway to form tetracycle 4 after partial reduction of the intermediate dienamine cycloadduct 5. Further functionalization of 4 would afford the Strychnos natural products. As an alternative, we considered intermolecular approaches such as Path II, in which temporary protection of the tryptamine side-chain nitrogen atom precedes intermolecular cycloaddition with TDO 2a to give diene 6; cleavage of the nitrogen atom protecting group should then lead to intermediate 5 by intramolecular substitution of the TDO-derived halogen atom, thereby converging on Path I. Finally (Path III), we considered the direct cycloaddition of N-protected tryptamine with TDO 2b to form adduct 7. TDO 2b would necessarily feature a disposable substituent (X), which is essential to prevent heterodimerization of the thiophene ring system in the course of its oxidation17. Subsequent to the cycloaddition cascade, deprotection and cyclization of the tryptamine side chain in 7, cleavage of the superfluous substituent X and N-alkylation with side chain 1 would also afford advanced intermediate 4. Here we describe the realization of all three strategies, which culminated in a collective asymmetric synthesis of eight natural products of the Strychnos family. In doing so, we also established asymmetric intermolecular cycloadditions of TDOs, accessing tricyclic indoline scaffolds that are of particular interest for medicinal chemistry applications. Computational studies revealed the source of the stereoselectivity observed in both the intra- and intermolecular IEDDA reactions, and suggested that the intramolecular TDO cycloadditions may benefit from an entropic driving force, where cheletropic extrusion of SO2 occurs in a spontaneous manner along the cycloaddition pathway without the formation of a discrete intermediate [4 + 2] cycloadduct.

With a view to developing an asymmetric route to the Strychnos family, we first addressed the development of hitherto unrealized asymmetric TDO cycloadditions. Investigations began with intermolecular [4 + 2] cycloadditions between indoles and enantioenriched thiophene S,S-dioxides (prepared by peroxyacid oxidation of the corresponding thiophene21) equipped with inexpensive, readily available chiral substituents. We found that the reaction of indole (8a, Table 1, R1, R2, R3 = H) with a TDO substituted with an acyl camphorsultam group22 (9a, R4 = 5-Cl) in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C afforded tricycle 10a as a single diastereomer in high yield. The stereochemistry of 10a was established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, which revealed the indoline ring junction to possess the absolute stereochemistry required for the natural stereoisomers of the Strychnos alkaloids. This method was tested on a range of substituted indoles and showed broad functional group tolerance of both electron-rich (for example, methoxy) and electron-poor substituents (for example, ester, nitro and nitrile) at various positions around the indole ring, as well as useful functionalities such as boronic esters and halides and substitution of the nitrogen atom. All tricyclic products were isolated as single diastereomers in good-to-excellent yields (10b–10m, 68–93%). Variation of the thiophene S,S-dioxide was also well tolerated, including a bicyclic TDO (10n–10p, 54–68%). With a view towards the proposed intermolecular cycloaddition approach to the Strychnos alkaloids, we also evaluated the use of 3-substituted indoles in this chemistry. These reactions were also successful, albeit requiring higher temperatures to effect the cycloaddition due to the steric demand imposed by the additional indole substituent, affording cycloadducts 10q and 10r in 90% and 91% yields, respectively, again as single diastereomers.

Having established highly selective, asymmetric intermolecular TDO cycloaddition reactions, we turned to apply them to the synthesis of the Strychnos alkaloids, exploring both the intra- and intermolecular routes. We first tested an intramolecular (tethered) cascade towards akuammicine (Fig. 2a). A key issue was whether the excellent stereocontrol imparted by the camphorsultam group in the intermolecular cycloadditions would be maintained in an intramolecular setting. In the event, the reaction of TDO 9a with amine 11 (prepared by the N alkylation of tryptamine with known side chain 1223) at room temperature, followed by warming to 80 °C, afforded a single diastereomer of the IEDDA cycloadduct 13. This intermediate dienamine was reduced in situ using acetic acid and sodium cyanoborohydride24,25,26 to afford diastereomers 14 and 14′ in a 1:1.4 ratio and 68% overall yield from 9a (see Supplementary Table 1 for details). The adverse selectivity of this step likely derives from the preferred delivery of hydride to the less-hindered concave face of the intermediate iminium ion24,25,26. To complete the synthesis of akuammicine, the camphorsultam amide was subjected to methanolysis27 to give the corresponding ester 15 (67%), with the camphorsultam moiety recovered in high yield. Heck cyclization28,29 of 15 proceeded to afford (–)-akuammicine in 75% yield in four steps from tryptamine (six steps in the longest linear sequence (LLS) that includes assembly of the side chain 12). This represents the most concise and atom-economical assembly of akuammicine described so far. An intermolecular cycloaddition approach to 13 (corresponding to Path II in Fig. 1c) could also be achieved by tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection of the side-chain amine in 11 (95%). Reaction of the resulting carbamate-protected indole with TDO 9a gave an intermediate cycloadduct that upon treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), followed by basic work-up to trigger cyclization of the free amine onto the dienoyl chloride, also afforded dienamine 13 in 75% yield (see Supplementary Section 2.2 for details).

The poor selectivity observed in the reduction of the dienamine cycloadduct 13 prompted us to test the alternative intermolecular asymmetric cycloaddition strategy (Path III in Fig. 1c). We identified 4-bromo-TDO 9d (as used in the synthesis of 10p, Table 1) as a potential candidate for this route as its bromine substituent would protect the corresponding thiophene from unwanted dimerization during oxidation17 and would also likely be removed under mild conditions later in the synthesis. We found that intermolecular cycloaddition of N-Boc-tryptamine 16 with 9d (used directly from the oxidation of thiophene 17) afforded a single diastereomer of dihydrocarbazole 18. In situ addition of TFA effected Boc deprotection, and subsequent addition of the tryptamine side-chain amine onto the dienoyl motif upon basic work-up gave a single diastereomer of the pyrrolidine product 19 in 57% yield (from 17). We found that the allylic bromide resident in 19 could then be selectively cleaved by hydrogenolysis without reduction of the adjacent alkene; attachment of the vinyl iodide side chain 12 to the debrominated product 20 smoothly afforded 14, thus converging on the intramolecular cycloaddition route, but now with complete control of the stereochemistry at the three contiguous stereocentres within the tetracycle. Including the previously implemented endgame, this alternative synthesis of (–)-akuammicine proceeded in seven steps in the LLS (20% overall yield). Four additional natural products (lagumicine, alstolucines B and F, and echitamidine) were synthesized from akuammicine using established chemistry30, while (–)-norfluorocurarine was prepared from 14 by initial reduction to aldehyde 21 with diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBALH) (69%), followed by Heck cyclization (74%).

Pyrrolidine 20, prepared via the intermolecular cycloaddition route, also provided access to strychnine (Fig. 2b). The alkylation of 20 with side chain 22 (69% yield from 19), followed by para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protection11 of the indoline nitrogen atom gave tetracycle 23 (81%). From here, exhaustive reduction with DIBALH afforded diol 24 (76%), Heck cyclization–lactol formation of which proceeded smoothly to afford the PMB-protected Wieland–Gumlich aldehyde (57% yield). This was converted into (–)-strychnine via deprotection of the PMB group, followed by treatment with malonic acid, acetic anhydride and sodium acetate (50% over two steps)11. Overall, the synthesis of (–)-strychnine was completed in ten steps via this intermolecular cycloaddition route (LLS, including the synthesis of side chain 22), which represents the most concise asymmetric approach reported so far (see Supplementary Information for details of the intramolecular TDO cycloaddition approach, which proceeded in seven steps LLS from tryptamine, but with inferior stereocontrol).

Despite the rich history of the Strychnos alkaloids, there is one family member that has thus far eluded chemical synthesis: brucine. This dimethylcatechol analogue of strychnine has been known for over 200 years, and has been employed by chemists as a chiral resolving agent since Fischer's seminal report in 189931; its catechol derivative has been used as a chiral ligand in asymmetric catalysis32. The challenge for any synthesis of brucine relates to the highly electron-rich nature of the indoline ring, which confers sensitivity towards oxidation and electrophilic degradation. To implement the TDO cascade approach to brucine, we first required N-PMB-5,6-dimethoxytryptamine 25 (Fig. 2c). Due to the aforementioned instability issues, precedents for the synthesis of highly oxidized tryptamines are not well documented, but after extensive investigation we found that 25 could be accessed by Larock indole synthesis33,34 from iodoaniline 26 and alkyne 27, which afforded 25 in good yield (61% over two steps). The successful progression of 25 towards brucine proved possible only via the intramolecular TDO cascade: alkylation of 25 with side chain 22 proceeded uneventfully (92%), but due to the reduced stability of the 5,6-dimethoxyindole, the cycloaddition with 9a benefited from a lower reaction temperature (70 °C) and a longer reaction time, affording 28 after reduction of the intermediate dienamine (28% yield from 25, 1.3:1 diastereomeric ratio (d.r.)). A similar endgame sequence to that employed in the synthesis of strychnine then accomplished the total synthesis of (–)-brucine in nine steps LLS from commercial 2-iodo-4,5-dimethoxyaniline. Attempts to implement the alternative intermolecular TDO cascade proved unsuccessful, with complex mixtures observed under the cycloaddition conditions, presumably reflecting the challenge of deploying a highly electron-rich indole.

To better understand the basis of the remarkable levels of asymmetric induction imparted by the TDO camphorsultam side chain in the inter- and intramolecular cycloadditions, we performed quantum mechanics (QM) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by MACE machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to model the cycloaddition step35. MLIPs ‘learn' the high-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PES) from QM calculations, effectively mapping atomic positions to energies and, often, forces with an accuracy comparable to QM and efficiency comparable to simple empirical force fields36,37.

We first explored the facial selectivity of the intermolecular cycloaddition reaction of TDO 9a with indole at the CPCM(MeCN)-DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-TZVP//CPCM(MeCN)-B2PLYP-D3BJ/def2-SVP level of theory (353 K/1 M, Fig. 3a). Interestingly, we found that the preferred pathway involves a stepwise cycloaddition via TS1, proceeding through a series of shallow energy minima before yielding the experimentally observed product diastereomer 10a (Fig. 3a, right). In contrast, the alternative diastereomer was found to form via a concerted cycloaddition pathway, in which the transition state (TS2) is 3.3 kcal mol−1 higher in energy (Fig. 3a, left). The favoured pathway via TS1 initially leads to Inter1 (Gibbs free energy of reaction ΔG° = +10 kcal mol−1), which undergoes a low-barrier cyclization (TS3, activation energy ΔG‡ = 14.4 kcal mol−1) to form the [4 + 2] cycloadduct Inter3. Exergonic extrusion of SO2 via TS4 (ΔG‡ = 12.6 kcal mol−1) affords the observed product 10a.

a,b, Intermolecular IEDDA cycloaddition of TDO 9a with indole (a) and intramolecular IEDDA cycloaddition of N-methyltryptamine-derived TDO 29. The free-energy profiles were computed at the CPCM(MeCN)-DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-TZVP//CPCM(MeCN)-B2PLYP-D3BJ/def2-SVP level of theory (353 K/1 M). c, MLIP-MD simulations revealed a concerted asynchronous [4 + 2] process involving a short-lived intermediate (Inter′) and a dynamic stepwise extrusion of SO2. \({\bar{{{r}}}}_{\mathrm{CS}}\), mean of the two C–S bonds. d, Time evolution of the C–C and C–S distances after Inter4.

Inset: distributions of time gaps between the formation of \({r}_{1}^{\mathrm{CS}}\) and \({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CS}}\), and between \({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CC}}\) and \({\bar{r}}_{\mathrm{CS}}\). The dashed lines indicate mean values of 32 and 69 fs, respectively. MLIP-MD was trained using the MACE architecture35, with the CPCM(MeCN)-B2PLYP-D3BJ/def2-SVP level of theory used as the ground-truth method (Supplementary Section 4.1.2).

We were curious to understand the energy difference between TS1 and TS2 (2.7 kcal mol−1) as both exhibit stabilizing hydrogen bonding and no obvious steric hindrance. Distortion interaction analysis38 indicated that the higher energy of TS2 compared with TS1 arises from the greater distortion of the TDO 9a (3.2 kcal mol−1 higher in TS2, see Supplementary Section 4.6, and Supplementary Fig. 11). Although this increased distortion is partially compensated by a stronger interaction energy in TS2, the net result is that the electronic activation energy of TS2 remains 2.7 kcal mol−1 higher than TS1.

The intramolecular cycloaddition cascade of the tryptamine–TDO adduct 29, which features a simplified N-methyltryptamine side chain, was found to proceed via a shallower stepwise pathway (Fig. 3b). This held true regardless of which face of the TDO the tethered indole occupies, with an intramolecular hydrogen bond forming between the indole N–H and the sultam SO2 group seeming to favour TS5, which leads to the experimentally observed diastereomer, over TS7 (difference in activation energies ΔΔG‡ = 8.3 kcal mol−1). The PES of the resulting intermediate Inter4 is shallow, such that the second C–C bond formation occurs via a low-energy transition state (TS6, ΔG‡ = 1.7 kcal mol−1). Beyond TS6, an unexpected, spontaneous extrusion of SO2 leads directly to the dienamine product Inter5 (Fig. 3b). Attempts to locate the expected SO2-bridged [4 + 2] cycloadduct (analogous to Inter3) were unsuccessful. Intrigued by this finding, we explored the dynamics of the [4 + 2] mechanism through downhill MD simulations using an MLIP (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Section 4.5 for further details). For this study, 500 trajectories were initialized from TS5 at 353 K and propagated downhill for 5 ps in the direction of either the reactant or product states. Half of the trajectories reverted to the reactant state, while the remainder progressed towards the product state (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Among the latter, 159 trajectories successfully reached the product, while the remaining 91 were trapped at Inter4. These trajectories revealed a highly asynchronous dynamic stepwise process for the cycloaddition reaction, with one C–C bond substantially advanced in the TS5 region (\({r}_{1}^{\mathrm{CC}}\) ≈ 1.84 Å) compared with the other C–C bond (\({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CC}}\) ≈ 3.0 Å). At TS6, the second C–C bond formation has progressed (\({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CC}}\) ≈ 2.44 Å) and a transient sulfur-bridged [4 + 2] cycloadduct (Inter′) is observed in which the C–S bonds remain intact. However, as the system progresses towards the product state, the C–S bonds elongate and SO2 is extruded. The asynchronicity of this process is evidenced in the evolution of the relevant C–C and C–S distances with time (Fig. 3d, t = 0 being TS5). The average time gap between the formation of the two C–C bonds (defined as bond lengths <1.6 Å) is 748 ± 491 fs, ranging from 109–2,459 fs. At around 700 fs, as the second C–C bond starts to form (\({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CC}}\) shortening to 1.6 Å), the C–S bonds begin to elongate, with \({r}_{1}^{\mathrm{CS}}\) lengthening more than \({r}_{2}^{\mathrm{CS}}\). The time gap between the cleavage of the C–S bonds averages 33 ± 13 fs (ranging from 4–80 fs); this elongation continues until SO2 is extruded.

Cascade (or domino) reactions and telescoped synthetic procedures offer useful means to increase the efficiency of target-oriented synthesis. Thiophene S,S-dioxides offer an excellent opportunity to engineer such events as their ability to undergo cycloadditions that are rendered irreversible by the in situ extrusion of SO2 offers a direct means to construct cyclohexadienes. However, TDOs have rarely been exploited in synthetic contexts, and their use in asymmetric cycloadditions has not been reported. Here, TDOs equipped with a cheap, common chiral camphorsultam side chain have been shown to offer efficient, stereoselective and general access to polycyclic indolines, where the cycloaddition step proceeds under remarkably mild conditions (0 °C) for indoles that are unsubstituted at the 2- and 3-positions. The observation that these cycloadditions proceed with exceptional stercocontrol (>20:1 d.r.) suggests that TDOs offer a mild and general method for polycyclic indoline synthesis. Application of this chemistry to various tryptamine derivatives provides an entry to the Strychnos alkaloid framework, which enabled the asymmetric synthesis of eight Strychnos alkaloids via the most concise routes reported so far. This includes the historic natural product brucine which, despite being known since the early 1800s, had yet to succumb to total synthesis.

Key to the wider application of TDOs is an understanding of the basis of their reactivity and selectivity in asymmetric cycloaddition reactions. Computational studies using QM calculations and MD simulations driven by MLIPs provided insight into the source of stereocontrol imparted by the camphorsultam side chain in both inter- and intramolecular cycloaddition pathways, and also revealed highly asynchronous cycloaddition pathways or even stepwise ‘Michael addition' mechanisms for the reaction of the TDO with the indole substrate, along with spontaneous extrusion of SO2. This results in sound principles for the design of further reactions exploiting TDOs as dienes. Overall, these studies demonstrate that TDOs offer broad potential for application in the synthesis of structurally complex architectures across synthetic and medicinal chemistry.

To a stirred solution of trifluoroacetic anhydride (64.3 ml, 463 mmol, 10.2 equiv.) at 0 °C was added H2O2 (30 wt% in H2O, 16.3 ml, 160 mmol, 3.5 equiv.) dropwise. The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 15 min. To the resulting mixture at 0 °C was added (5-chlorothiophen-2-yl)[(3aS,6R,7aR)-8,8-dimethyl-2,2-dioxidotetrahydro-3H-3a,6-methanobenzo[c]isothiazol-1(4H)-yl]methanone (16.4 g, 45.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv.). The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 14 h before it was concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was recrystallized from CHCl3–MeCN (3:1) to afford compound 9a (15.7 g, 40.1 mmol, 88%) as a light-yellow solid.

To a stirred solution of 11 (217 mg, 0.64 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) in MeCN (26 ml) at room temperature was added 9a (250 mg, 0.64 mmol, 1.0 equiv.). The resulting mixture was stirred for 14 h before additional 11 (261 mg, 0.77 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) was added. The resulting mixture was warmed to 80 °C and stirred for 40 h before it was cooled to 65 °C and AcOH (0.55 ml, 9.61 mmol, 15.0 equiv.) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 15 min at 65 °C, and then NaBH3CN (401 mg, 6.38 mmol, 10.0 equiv.) in MeOH (6.5 ml) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at 65 °C for 30 min before it was cooled to room temperature, quenched by the slow addition of a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (20 ml) and then diluted with water (10 ml) and CH2Cl2 (20 ml). The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 30 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with water (50 ml) and brine (50 ml), dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography (silica gel, pentane–Et2O 9:1→3:1) afforded compound 14 and its C3a epimer 14′ (276 mg combined mass, 0.44 mmol, 68%, 1:1.4 d.r.) as a brown foam, along with recovered tryptamine 11 (240 mg, 0.71 mmol). These diastereomers could be separated for the purposes of characterization and the subsequent reduction of 14.

To a stirred solution of Boc-tryptamine 16 (1.00 g, 3.84 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) in CHCl3 (19.0 ml) at room temperature was added 9d. The resulting mixture was warmed to 80 °C and stirred for 23 h, before it was cooled to 0 °C and TFA (9.0 ml) was added. The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 2.5 h before it was cooled to 0 °C, quenched by the slow addition of a saturated aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (200 ml) and then stirred for 20 h. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 50 ml), and then the combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography (silica gel, pentane–EtOAc 9:1→4:6) afforded compound 19 (585 mg, 1.10 mmol, 57% over two steps) as a yellow foam.

To a stirred solution of indole (0.2 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (0.1 M) at 0 °C was added thiophene S,S-dioxide (0.1 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred for 38 h before it was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the crude material, which was purified by flash column chromatography using pentane–EtOAc eluent.

Climate and atmospheric changes are impacting forest function and structure worldwide, but their effects on tropical forest diversity are unclear. Nowhere is the scientific challenge greater than in the Andes and the Amazon, which together include the world's most diverse forests. Here, using 406 permanent plots spanning four decades of intact lowland and montane forest dynamics, we test for long-term change in species richness and assess the influence of climate and other variables. We show that, at a continental scale, species richness appears stable, but this masks substantial regional variation. Species richness increased in Northern Andean and Western Amazon plots, yet declined in the Central Andes, Guyana Shield and Central-Eastern Amazon. Overall, warmer, drier and more seasonal forests lost species, while those at higher elevations, in less fragmented areas and with faster rates of tree turnover experienced increases. Region-specific drivers, particularly precipitation seasonality and demographic factors, modulated these trends. The results highlight the diverse ways in which Amazon–Andes forests are changing and underscore the critical need to preserve large-scale ecosystem integrity to maintain local tree diversity. By doing so, Northern Andean forests in particular could serve as an important refuge for species increasingly displaced by climate change.

The Andes and the Amazon are crucial for carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and climate regulation1,2,3,4,5. However, climate change and land-use change are threatening the stability of these ecosystems and the services they provide5,6,7,8,9,10. Over recent decades, temperatures have increased in this region, precipitation patterns have become more extreme and variable, deforestation has expanded and forest fires have become more frequent7,11,12,13,14,15. Under these increasingly stressful conditions, plant species have two feasible short-term responses to survive: (1) migrate—shift their distribution range in response to changing environmental conditions, or (2) acclimate—utilize their physiological tolerance to maintain function under the new conditions. If species do not manage to migrate or acclimate, their populations will decrease and eventually they may go extinct16.

The response of plant species to climate change could lead to changes in forest structure, composition, diversity and species richness at the local scale17,18,19. The Andes and other tropical mountains are undergoing a process of thermophilization, where higher-elevation forests are incorporating new lower-elevation species that expand their ranges upslope, and current low-elevation species are increasing in relative abundance20,21,22,23. However, lower-elevation forests face the possibility of biotic attrition (a net loss of species), as there is no species pool from even hotter areas able to migrate and fill the new thermal niches24,25,26. While the wet tropics have been suggested to have the highest rates of plant extinction, based on literature reviews27 and model predictions28, we do not know whether this translates into consistent losses of local richness within the different regions in the Andes–Amazon area.

Despite widespread threats across the Andes–Amazon area, climate change and other large-scale disturbances are not distributed evenly across space7,9,29. Moreover, geographical features—such as increased topographical variation, which may provide a potential advantage for species persistence by offering more suitable environmental conditions—are also unevenly distributed30,31.

At the local scale, stressors, such as increasing temperatures and declining rainfall, have been related to mortality-driven compositional shifts, particularly in steep elevational gradients21,30,32,33. Baseline temperature and precipitation regimes have also been shown to relate to the probability of plant species suffering thermal or drought damage34,35. Fragmented areas are also vulnerable to diversity losses, while increasing fire frequency reduces regeneration and species richness13,36,37. However, although several mechanisms have been shown to drive changes in (neo)tropical forest diversity, most studies so far have been limited to local or regional scales and/or lack long-term assessments of tree richness and diversity at consistently monitored sites. Indeed, long-term compositional changes have often been estimated using modelling approaches and have rarely been addressed using field data (but see refs. 33,38).

Here we use 406 long-term floristic plots, measured for different time periods since 1971 across 10 countries in South America to estimate the magnitude and direction of tree richness change through time and to identify their drivers. Across this vast space, ranging from −17 to 8.5 latitudinal degrees and −80 to −47 longitudinal degrees, we explore the change in richness through time for the combined area and independently for each of six predefined regions (based on their geomorphological and biogeographical history and contemporaneous geoecological features), as we hypothesize that different regions are responding in different ways, forced by different drivers. Using consistent methods to identify the spatial distribution of diversity change and the factors that contribute to it at a larger scale is crucial to understanding the current status of the Amazon and Andean forests, predicting future patterns and informing conservation efforts. With this comprehensive plot compilation and a set of climatic and structural variables, we intend to answer the following questions. First, using the complete dataset, we ask: (1) How is tree species richness changing across the Andes–Amazon area? Is there an overall decline? and (2) How are changes in richness related to baseline climate, climate change, landscape context and forest structure?

We predict an overall stability of richness, with local increases and declines balancing each other out. However, we expect the change in richness to be associated with several large-scale variables. In particular, we expect a more pronounced decrease in richness in warmer, drier forests at lower elevations given the thermophilization trend where species are ‘migrating' towards higher elevations that usually tend to be colder and wetter. Similarly, we predict a richness decline in forests that are becoming warmer or drier as dealing with this climate becomes physiologically more challenging. We also expect a decrease in species richness in forests with high fragmentation due to the reduced source of colonizers and habitat connectivity. A summary of all the predictors tested and our hypothesized relationships with species richness change is presented in Table 1.

Then, analysing each of six predefined regions separately, we ask: (3) Does the change in tree richness exhibit the same trend in the different regions of the Andes–Amazon area? and (4) Which of the selected predictors explain the change in species richness for each region?

We expect to find a longitudinal gradient in diversity change across the six Andes–Amazon regions driven by the most pressing stressors in each region. In particular, we hypothesize (a) an increase in richness in the Andes as a consequence of thermophilization and a decrease of richness in the Amazon, particularly in the drier and warmer Central-Eastern regions (Guyana Shield, Central-Eastern Amazon and Southern Amazon), due to biotic attrition; (b) temperature will thus be a crucial factor in the Andean trends, while precipitation could be more important in the Amazon; and (c) landscape integrity will have an important role in the more degraded Southern and Central-Eastern Amazon regions

Half of our plots (203) declined in richness, and 146 increased. Richness change varied widely across plots (range −1.95% to +3.3% per year) but had no consistent direction at the Andes–Amazon scale (bootstrapped mean richness change 0.036, mean confidence interval (CI) −0.09 to 0.16, mean t statistic 0.579, mean P value 0.56, degrees of freedom 179) (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We found a negative relationship between richness change and longitude (slope −2.39, adjusted R2 = 0.047, P < 0.001). At −64.5°, which coincides broadly with the transition between the Eastern and Western Amazon, the change in richness shifts from positive (West) to negative (East) values (Fig. 1). There was no significant relationship with latitude.

In the bivariate regressions with the complete dataset, we found that maximum temperature, precipitation seasonality and precipitation seasonality change had significant negative relationships with richness change (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1; see predictor description in Table 1). Temperature change exhibited a hump-shaped relationship with richness, decreasing slightly where temperatures cooled and more markedly where warming was faster. Annual precipitation, stem abundance change, landscape integrity, elevation and identification effort change had positive significant relationships (Fig. 2). The bootstrapped regressions corrected for spatial bias in plot location supported the representativity of the overall trends found as slope direction and significance coincided for most of the variables (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). The regression with annual precipitation, although always positive, was on average not significant in the bias-corrected analysis, and the one with landscape integrity was typically positive but not significant, probably because of the confounding effect of decreasing tree cover with elevation in the Andes.

Source data

When predicting richness change, we observed significant interactions between precipitation seasonality and its change, precipitation seasonality and annual precipitation, and annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality change (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). Species richness declined with increasing precipitation seasonality, but this decline was steeper for less seasonal forests. Species richness in less seasonal forests increased with annual precipitation. We found marginal support for an interaction between the temperature variables, suggesting that warmer forests experiencing further warming lost more species, whereas cooler forests even showed a slight increase in richness.

Richness change was directional in five of the six regions (Fig. 3). Species richness significantly increased in the Northern Andes and Western Amazon, while the Central Andes, Central-Eastern Amazon and Guyana Shield experienced significant declines. Although the Southern Amazon did not show a significant trend, the mean change was negative and included some of the most extreme negative values. The direction of these changes coincided across the other diversity indices tested (Supplementary Table 4), although the significance of the change was more variable because different indices reflect slightly different aspects of diversity change (Supplementary Note 1).

We used a multigroup piecewise structural equation model (SEM) analysis to identify the relationship between the predictor variables and the richness change directly and indirectly. This SEM (Fig. 4) showed a good fit to the data (Fisher's C = 4.232, P = 0.375). The individual R2 for the component models were 0.18 (mortality), 0.27 (stem abundance change) and 0.30 (species richness change). Complete model results are presented in Supplementary Table 5.

Many of the relationships between climate and environmental variables with stem abundance change and mortality rate were constrained (indicating a similar effect) across regions (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3). For stem abundance change, five out of eight variables were constrained, with two of these being significant; for mortality, four out of the eight variables were constrained, with two of them significant. For richness change, 5 out of 11 variables were constrained, with 4 being significant.

Regarding the intermediate factors mediating indirect effects, mortality rate had a significant negative effect on richness in the Central Andes, and stem abundance change had a significant positive effect on richness change in all regions. We computed the indirect effects that the predictors had on richness change mediated by the structural variables when each path coefficient was significant (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).

Only significant (P ≤ 0.05) direct effects are shown. Indirect effects were calculated by multiplying the significant (P ≤ 0.05) standardized coefficients within each of the possible three indirect pathways (via stem abundance change, via mortality rate, and via mortality rate × stem abundance change) and then adding them. The transparency of the bar represents the effect path, with direct effects being opaque and indirect effects transparent. The bar colour indicates the sign of the effect (red is negative, blue is positive). Region colours are shown in the top line for coherence with Fig. 4. For extended results, including specific P values, see Supplementary Tables 5 and 6. For standardized effects of each predictor variable for each region, see Supplementary Table 7.

Maximum temperature had a total negative effect on richness across regions, while precipitation had a general positive effect. Precipitation seasonality had a strong negative effect in the Andes but positive in the Southern Amazon. Temperature change had a very small negative effect in the Central Andes, Western Amazon and Central-Eastern Amazon. Precipitation change had a large positive effect in the Guyana Shield. Precipitation seasonality change was variable, having a large negative effect in the Northern Andes and Southern Amazon but a positive effect in the Central Andes. Stem abundance change had a positive effect in all regions, while mortality had a negative effect. Landscape integrity had a strong positive effect in the Southern Amazon, weaker positive effects in other regions and a negative effect in the Central Andes. Change in identification effort had a positive direct effect in all regions except the Southern Amazon, while the time frame had very small positive effects in five regions and a negative effect in one region.

We found no overall trend in species richness change across 406 forest-dynamics plots distributed across the tropical Andes and the Amazon. However, this large-scale result masks important regional variations, with richness increasing in the Northern Andes and Western Amazon, while decreasing in the Central Andes, Central-Eastern Amazon and Guyana Shield. This masking or obscuring issue has been raised for global estimations of diversity change based on local trends, and some even question the relevance of these large-scale averages39,40,41. In any case, the absence of a significant overall trend in richness change may also indicate a temporary disequilibrium between current environmental conditions and large-scale vegetation responses42, which should not be misinterpreted as resilience. Lag effects could occur on the leading edge, where trees slowly colonize newly suitable habitats, delaying potential richness gains. Alternatively, lags at the trailing edge could indicate a temporary persistence of species, artificially inflating current richness estimates42. Lowland areas of the Amazonia are expected to experience greater lags due to the long migration distances required to remain at equilibrium with their optimal conditions43. By contrast, mountain regions are thought to have an extinction debt, allowing temporary species accumulation44,45.

Across the Amazon, current tree diversity patterns are largely shaped by seasonality, with higher diversity found in the wet, aseasonal forests of the Western Amazon and lower diversity in the drier, seasonal forests of the Eastern regions46. Our findings on species richness change align with this longitudinal gradient, revealing negative trends in the Eastern regions and positive trends in the Western regions. We first discuss these large-scale patterns, followed by the regional findings that help explain these trends.

Hotter, drier and more seasonal forests and those getting warmer and more seasonal are losing species, but forests with more trees and higher landscape integrity are gaining them. Over the past 40 years, more than 90% of our plots (368/406) have experienced warming with a mean rate of 0.028 ± 0.018 °C per year (321/406 during the individual monitoring periods). Faster-warming forests in the Central-Eastern and Southern Amazon (0.05 ± 0.02 °C per year) are losing species at a higher rate than forests experiencing more moderate warming. In addition, forests in warmer areas within the Andes–Amazon area are also losing more species (Fig. 2). This pattern reflects the contrasting conditions and biotic responses of the Andes and Amazon forests and, supported by the higher rate of species accumulation with increasing elevation (Fig. 2), provides further evidence for thermophilization in the region21,30,47. This phenomenon is also supported by the temperature interaction, where the impact of heating in driving species richness loss depends on the baseline temperature, with hotter forests being more sensitive to a given rate of heating. Nevertheless, most of the forests in the Central Andes that experienced slight cooling (50/76) also showed negative trends in species richness (29/50), probably influenced by a decline in precipitation and an increase in seasonality in all of these plots (29/29). This trend indicates that precipitation change modulates richness responses to temperature.

Rainfall declined in 39% of plots, but its influence was minor relative to that of precipitation seasonality, which increased in 88% of the plots. Forests that are more seasonal—and especially those becoming more seasonal—showed declines in species richness17, with the strongest negative effects in currently less seasonal or wetter forests (that is, higher annual precipitation; Extended Data Fig. 1). These results agreed with findings from the Andean mountain tops, where seasonality across the latitudinal gradient is strongly linked to richness changes, with more aseasonal peaks near the Equator showing richness gains38. While we did not find a latitudinal trend across the study area (Fig. 1), we observed differences between the Northern and Central Andes, which we discuss in detail below.

The more individuals recorded in a census, the larger the gain in the number of species (Fig. 2), as expected because more species from the regional pool have a chance to recruit. This pattern extends beyond individual plots, as forests in less fragmented landscapes (higher landscape integrity), surrounded by more contiguous forest, are more likely to show increases in species richness. By contrast, forests that become more isolated from surrounding fragments tend to experience a decline in species richness36,48,49.

The Western Amazon and Northern Andes are gaining species, while the Central Andes, Guyana Shield and Central-Eastern Amazon are experiencing species loss (Fig. 3). According to the SEM, the processes driving changes in tree density and mortality rates are similar across the Andes–Amazon area (Fig. 4). Generally, mortality rates rose in more seasonal and fragmented forests, while stem abundance declined in warming forests and in forests experiencing higher mortality rates. The relationship between richness change and environmental variables revealed many region-specific drivers, with some variables having opposite effects in different regions, highlighting the context-dependent processes in our vast study area.

The relationship between stem abundance change and richness change was positive across regions. This means that a greater decline in the number of individuals in a plot (in proportion to the initial number) was associated with a more negative change in species richness, and vice versa. Changes in individual abundance are crucial for enabling compositional change, as more recruits increase the likelihood of detecting new species from the local pool50. However, the entry of new species does not necessarily imply a shift in composition outside the existing regional pool, and species loss could reflect local extinctions or shifts within the same pool. Further analysis is needed to determine whether these species are new or are part of the regional pool. All regions showed a negative trend in stem abundance, with the Eastern Amazon (Guyana Shield, Central-Eastern and Southern Amazon) experiencing sharper declines than the Western Amazon and the Andes, which showed higher variability. This is contrary to the results of previous research showing an increase in stem density across 50 Amazonian plots from 1979 to 200251. Although this discrepancy may simply reflect the differing sample sizes and geographical extents of the studies, it could also indicate a recent change in the stem density trend driven by rising temperatures.

Mortality directly affected only the Central Andes, with its effects on other regions mediated through stem abundance change. Thus, the hypothesized disturbance effect of mortality in promoting the colonization of new species is probably limited to the Central Andes.

Across regions, warmer and drier areas are linked to lower rates of richness change. Regional temperature gradients, particularly elevation gradients in the Andes, play a crucial role in richness change. We found an increase in richness in the Northern Andes, which agrees with the reported compositional change caused by the thermophilization process in the area21,30,52 and with research showing a warming-related increase in mountain-top diversity38,44. The encroachment of lower-elevation, warm-adapted species, which would initially be rare in the community, would lead to a potentially temporary increase in the number of species supported by the extinction lag of cold-adapted species that cannot tolerate the new conditions and will eventually become locally extinct53,54. We expected that both Andean regions would share the same pattern; however, the Central Andes showed a decline in richness. Our results suggest that the faster-warming Northern Andes region14 could be more suitable for range shifts than the more moderate—and even cooling—Central Andes (Extended Data Fig. 2). The most important factor determining the richness change in the Northern and Central Andean regions was change in precipitation seasonality, having a negative effect in the Northern Andes and a positive effect in the Central Andes. Across the Andes, precipitation and its seasonality are highly variable, being affected by local orography, orientation and cloud cover14; however, on average, the Central Andes are drier and more seasonal than the Northern Andes, and they are also becoming drier and more seasonal at a faster rate (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 8). We hypothesize that migrating lower-elevation species, particularly those distributed in the Western Amazon, are more likely to succeed expanding into higher elevations of the wetter and less seasonal Northern Andes than in the Central Andes. The Central Andes probably pose a greater barrier from water-related physiological stress (particularly when compared with the Western Amazon) than the Northern Andes. Furthermore, the negative relationship between richness and landscape integrity in the Central Andes probably results from the confounding effect of decreasing tree cover with elevation.

The Western and Central-Eastern Amazon presented a very similar breakdown of driver effects. In both regions, changes in stem abundance were the primary ecological drivers, with minor indirect effects from climate variables, largely mediated by the change in stem abundance. In these regions, forests that are warmer, drier or becoming warmer or drier exhibited declining richness, as these conditions reduce the number of individuals. The Central-Eastern Amazon is drier and is warming faster than the Western Amazon, which could explain the overall richness decrease in the Central-Eastern Amazon as opposed to the increase in the wetter Western Amazon.

In the Southern Amazon, where there was no significant trend in richness change, and in the Guyana Shield, which showed a negative trend, precipitation and its seasonality played predominant roles. In the Guyana Shield, dry forests—and particularly those becoming drier—experienced the greatest species losses. In the Southern Amazon, which is highly seasonal, there is evidence that forests that were more seasonal at baseline tended to gain species; however, increases in precipitation seasonality were associated with richness declines. Nevertheless, in the Southern Amazon (the area with some of the most fragmented forests), landscape integrity exerted the strongest direct effect on richness change: forests embedded within larger, contiguous forested areas tended to gain species, whereas more fragmented forests tended to lose them.

Landscape integrity also had a negative relationship with mortality rate across all regions, indicating that higher landscape integrity supports tree survival, thereby increasing tree abundance, which, in turn, positively impacts richness. This agrees with previous findings on the damaging effects of deforestation and/or degradation in surrounding forests, underscoring the importance of preventing forest fragmentation to support biodiversity conservation55. It also highlights the conservation priority of the Western Amazon–Northern Andes corridor, which appears to be the most feasible pathway for range shifts that could support species persistence.

This study provides a comprehensive assessment of tree richness change in the Andes–Amazon forests using long-term field data. However, we acknowledge that we are working in one of the most diverse and dynamic areas of the planet56, and, as such, there are limitations to our analyses. First, the dataset lacks a historical baseline, so initial conditions may be influenced by uncertain processes39. To minimize bias, we used strict plot selection criteria, excluding plots with any sign of fire or large disturbances and directly including identification effort change and time between censuses as predictors in our analyses. The change in identification effort positively influenced richness change across regions: as more individuals are identified, we encounter more species. Monitoring time had only a small effect on species richness change, where shorter intervals capture more noise relative to the signal than longer intervals.

Second, climatic and environmental data extracted from global databases add uncertainty, especially in topographically complex areas like the Andes. At an even finer scale, it is impossible to know the real climate experienced on the forest floor by each individual tree; further investment in microclimate monitoring in these structurally complex forests is crucial to improve our understanding of climate change effects. Third, we are including only trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 10 cm and are ignoring the potential contribution of smaller size classes to changes in diversity. Finally, there are multiple factors not accounted for in the study that can have important roles in diversity trends. For example, it was beyond the scope of this study to evaluate the roles of past forest history, including Indigenous management, in current richness trends, nor did we evaluate the potential role of biotic pressures (for example, herbivory and pathogens), nor that of conservation efforts and compensation mechanisms, including carbon and biodiversity benefits. Further research should address more complex compositional questions, such as evaluating the taxonomic and functional identities of species being lost or recruited, and whether this indicates that the Andes–Amazon is undergoing taxonomic homogenization, functional homogenization or both.

In conclusion, across the study area, hot, dry and seasonal forests and those becoming warmer and more seasonal are losing species, while forests with higher tree density and higher landscape integrity are gaining them. Our large-scale findings emphasize the critical role of temperature and temperature change in shaping tree richness in the Andes–Amazon area. However, at the regional level, precipitation and its shifts in distribution and annual amounts play more important and region-specific roles, outweighing the influence of temperature57.

This study highlights the uneven impact of changing environmental conditions on tree diversity across different tropical forests, as well as the varied importance of climate and environmental variables across the different regions and scales. Our results underscore the key role of the Northern Andes as a refuge for tree species facing increasingly unsuitable climatic conditions in the Amazon. Finally, our findings highlight the tight relationship between preserving tree abundance and preserving diversity, emphasizing the enormous threat posed by land-use change, which indiscriminately reduces both tree abundance and regional species diversity.

We combined permanent plot data from ForestPlots.net58 (https://forestnet.com/) and from the Madidi project (https://madidiproject.weebly.com). Plot establishment and resurveys were performed by well-trained field teams that followed a detailed protocol that included geolocating plot boundaries, marking subcorners with permanent polyvinyl chloride tubes, taking tree subplot and coordinate data, tagging trees with numbered aluminium tags, and noting and painting the point of measurement. Post-field quality control was carried out by database managers and the field team leader. We selected all plots within the study area (Andean or Amazonian country in areas lower than 4,000 m above sea level (a.s.l.)) that had been censused at least twice. We did not include plots located in the Chocó and the Northern Venezuela regions because of insufficient sample sizes to represent these areas. To avoid the confounding effects of successional trends on diversity change, we included only plots in forests that were undisturbed or had experienced disturbance at least 50 years prior (identified as equivalent to long-term successional forest). For the same reason, we excluded plots that had been recorded on ForestPlots.net as swamp or seasonally flooded forests or as having a history of fire or of large disturbances. We also excluded plots that had been flagged for having taxonomic identification issues.

We obtained curated datasets for each census and plot. For each plot, we selected the first and the last census. Hereafter, we refer to these two censuses as ‘initial' and ‘final'. We ensured that plot area and location exactly matched on both censuses and that the plot sampling strategy was standardized across time. For instance, we excluded palms when they were not measured in every census.

To standardize methodologies, we removed from the dataset subplots (delimited sections within a plot) in which the protocol required a minimum tree DBH greater than 10 cm for inclusion. We also removed all individuals smaller than 10 cm DBH and those belonging to the families Cyclanthaceae and Araceae. Species taxonomic identification was carried out in the field and in the herbaria where reference collections with vouchers are deposited. Any change in an individual's identification was applied across all censuses. To minimize the impact of the change in identification effort (the proportion of individuals identified to species level) between censuses, we restricted our analyses to plots that (1) had more than 50% of the tree individuals identified to species level in the initial census, (2) had a difference in the proportion of identified individuals between first and last census smaller than 10% and (3) had at least 50% of the recruits in the final census identified to species (when there were more than 20 recruits). In some instances, this meant using the next-to-last census within the plot as the final census. The change in the percentage of individuals identified to species level is used in the model as a predictor to account for the potential confounding effect of this factor.

We used the taxonomic name resolution service (TNRS) tool59 (https://tnrs.biendata.org) and R package60 to standardize species names. We manually verified matches with an overall score <0.9, and ‘unclear' and ‘not found' matches. We looked for potential explanations such as spelling errors in the Tropicos (https://www.tropicos.org) and WFO (https://wfoplantlist.org/plant-list) lists, and we either manually modified the accepted name for these species or used only their genus ID if there was no clear option. As the treatment of morphospecies was not curated or standardized across the dataset, we converted any morphospecies codes into ‘Genus indet' format to group morphospecies into genera across the dataset. See the ‘Unidentified species and morphospecies' section for an overview of the process of integrating morphospecies into the analyses.

Given that the plot size varied widely, we grouped plots that were less than 0.5 ha in area if they had other plots within a 7-km radius with no indication of large differences (that is, similar elevation, forest type, soil classification and so on). For quantitative metadata values, such as the time between censuses, we used the mean. We will refer to these plot groupings as ‘plots', given that they are treated as a single unit. We also reduced the size of our biggest plots (plot areas of 25 and 9 ha) by selecting two 1-ha subplots on opposite corners and treating them independently. We then eliminated plots that had intervals of less than 4 years between the two selected censuses, because we considered this time elapsed to be too short to provide mid-to-long-term diversity change information. The time elapsed between the initial and final censuses was used in the model as a predictor to account for its potential confounding effect.

Finally, after preliminary exploration of plot distributions, we removed plots with ten or fewer species in either the initial or final census, as adding or removing even a single species could produce extreme percentage changes (±10%).

After the selection process, our dataset compiled information from 406 plots (or grouped plots) covering ~420 ha (range 0.25–3 ha, mean plot size 1.04 ± 0.26 ha) with a cumulative monitoring time of 4,847 years (range 4.01–44.2, mean 11.94 ± 8.01 years). The earliest census dates were from 1971, and the latest were from 2021 (Supplementary Fig. 4).

We divided the study area into six regions roughly following previous studies61,62,63,64. The division between the Northern and Central Andes was drawn at the border between Peru and Ecuador64. Supplementary Fig. 5 shows the relative floristic similarity of our plots and regions.

We calculated species richness as the number of fully identified species in each plot and census (SP). We calculated the change in species richness (% yr−1) as richness change = (((SPinitial − SPfinal)/SPinitial) × 100)/time; where SPinitial and SPfinal are the richness in the initial and final censuses, respectively, and time is the time interval between the initial and final censuses (in years). Palms (family Arecaceae) were included in the analyses (when included in both the initial and final censuses) as their exclusion did not have a significant effect on the results (Supplementary Fig. 6).

To test whether there was a significant change in richness through time, we used two-sided t-test analyses on richness change both for each of the regions independently and for the combined database. Given that the number of plots was unevenly distributed among the regions, to avoid sampling bias in the combined dataset analysis, we randomly sampled 30 plots per region and carried out a two-sided t-test with this subset. We repeated this process 1,000 times and obtained the averages of the t-test means and P values.

To assess potential linearity issues in the relationship between changes in the number of individuals and species richness, we calculated the change in species richness after rarefying both the initial and final censuses to the minimum number of individuals observed in either census (that is, whichever is lower) (package vegan). The correlation between the resulting rarefied richness change and the non-rarefied estimate (r = 0.74, P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 7) supports the use of richness change and stem abundance change as independent variables (see ‘Predictor variables' section) in the subsequent analyses.

Additional diversity indices and their change through time for each region were calculated using the vegan R package65 and tested in the same way as richness change (Supplementary Note 1).

Despite the considerable identification efforts by all research groups involved in this project, many tree individuals remain unidentified (Indet indet), identified only to the genus level (for example, Ocotea indet) or classified as morphospecies (for example, Ocotea sp1, Ocotea sp2 and so on). These morphospecies codes were maintained through the multiple censuses and retroactively changed to a full species name in the database if one was given; however, the morphospecies criteria were not standardized across plots, nor were they curated. Because there is no obvious way to address these issues, we decided to (1) apply the restrictive selection criteria in terms of identification effort explained above, (2) exclude the unidentified individuals from the dataset, (4) use the genus-level information for the morphospecies (as their classification is not standardized across the dataset) and (4) exclude individuals identified only to the genus level from the species-level analyses. Consequently, some changes in species diversity are not captured due to these exclusions; however, we speculate that such unreported changes are probably caused by a small number of individuals that recruit or die without being identified across multiple censuses and are unlikely to be dominant members of the community.

To support the use of species-level data despite potential issues such as mistakes, changes in botanists and changes in the species concept through time, we calculated the change in genus richness in the same way as the change in species richness (but using the individual's genus-level information, thus including morphospecies). Then, we calculated the correlation between the rate of change in proportional genus and species richness for the combined dataset (r = 0.711) (Supplementary Fig. 8) and for each region independently (Supplementary Table 9). Given the reasonably high correlation between the genus- and species-level richness change, we decided to continue working at the species level. Despite the challenges of working at this scale, we believe it was important to use this very valuable information and to try to address its shortcomings instead of reducing the available information by working at the genus level.

To characterize the average climate and changing patterns for the Andes–Amazon area, we downloaded climatic data from TerraClimate66. We selected this product for its temporal resolution (monthly from 1958 to 2020), its spatial resolution (~4 km) and the availability of data for maximum temperature and annual precipitation. We used the ‘climateR' package67 to download the TerraClimate monthly data from 1979 to 2020 (inclusive) for each of our plot locations based on their coordinates. We restricted the time series to post-1979 because of the higher uncertainty in earlier years. For each year, we used the monthly data to calculate the maximum ‘maximum temperature' (°C), the sum of annual precipitation (mm) and the seasonality of precipitation (using monthly cumulative precipitation, coefficient of variation (CV) = 100 × (standard deviation/mean))68. For each plot, we used the data between 1979 and the year of its final census; for example, if the censuses are in 2000 and 2015, the climate variables provide information from 1979 to 2015. This way, we include any lagged effects of climate on forest dynamics, but we do not include post-census climate events that are not relevant in the database. For each plot, we estimated the mean values for the relevant time period to use as the baseline climate. For the same time period per plot, we performed a linear regression of the variable over time and used the slope as the annual rate of change. We show the relationship between the baseline value and the annual change for these variables (Supplementary Fig. 9). We also calculated the change of each variable in the complete 1979–2020 time period for reference.

To characterize the geography and structure of the area where each of the plots is located, we extracted elevation and landscape integrity from available datasets.

We downloaded and mosaiced the elevation rasters from the SRTM 90-m Digital Elevation Database v.4.1 from CGIAR-CSI69 and extracted the elevation values (m a.s.l.) for our plot locations.

We obtained tree cover data from the Global Forest Cover Change (GFCC) Tree Cover Multi-Year Global 30-m resolution raster70 via Google Earth Engine71. Tree cover is expressed as the percentage of pixel area covered by trees in 2015 (0–100%). We calculated the mean landscape integrity (%) as the mean tree cover for a radius of 50 km around each of the plot locations.

We calculated stem abundance change as the annual rate of proportional change in tree abundance per plot. To calculate this, we first computed the number of live individuals for each plot and census. To calculate the change in the number of individuals, we subtracted the initial from the final number of individuals, divided by the initial number of individuals, and multiplied by 100. Then, to calculate the annual rate of change in the proportional number of individuals, we divided this number by the time elapsed between the censuses. Due to species accumulation curves, this variable is crucial in determining richness change, and, as such, it is treated as an endogenous variable in the SEM.

We calculated the mortality rate (% yr−1) per plot using the ref. 72 equation together with the ref. 73 interval-length correction:

where n0 is the number of stems at the start of the census interval, ns is the number of stems that survive that interval and t is the census interval length.

To account for a potential change in the identification effort (for example, a large increase in individuals identified to genus level only), we calculated the change in the percentage of individuals per plot that were identified to species level in each plot (that is, the change in the percentage of identified individuals). We also included the time frame (years) between the initial and final censuses as a sampling variable. We show the total change in species through time per plot in Supplementary Fig. 10.

Further descriptors of each variable in each region can be found in Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 8.

To investigate the relationship between the predictors and richness change separately for the entire Andes–Amazon area, we performed linear regressions between each of the variables specified above (Table 1) (including census time frame) and the richness change per plot (annual rate of percentage change in richness) for the combined dataset. We explored second-order polynomial relationships for all variables and compared them with linear regressions using analysies of variance. Only temperature change (%) had a better fit using polynomial regression. Mortality rate was log transformed to better fulfil linear model assumptions. To assess the potential interference of spatial bias in the dataset, we bootstrapped each individual linear regression 100 times using random sets of 30 plots per region at each time, and we compared the direction of the slopes and their significance with those obtained from the complete dataset.

Finally, we performed regression analysis with interacting climate variables and richness change. In all cases, model residuals were checked to verify the fulfilment of the linear model assumptions.

To evaluate the effect of the multiple variables directly on the richness change and indirectly via their effect on the stem abundance change and mortality rate, we performed a multigroup piecewise SEM (piecewiseSEM package)74,75 where the regions were the groups. This analysis evaluates the relationships for the combined dataset and each region separately to constrain coefficients with homogeneous effects across regions, leaving the remaining variables to vary freely. The standardized coefficients referred to as the ‘effects' of one variable on another should be interpreted as their relative influence on the mean of the response. We excluded elevation because of the high correlation with maximum temperature (Supplementary Fig. 11) as the piecewise framework is unable to integrate correlated errors in its estimates. The SEM was estimated using three component linear models whose response variables were (1) mortality rate, (2) stem abundance change and (3) species richness change (Supplementary Fig. 12). We tested for normality, heteroscedasticity and the variable importance factor of each of the three component models to verify that the model assumptions were met, and that the inclusion of other variables with moderate correlation (Supplementary Fig. 11) did not create multicollinearity issues (variance inflation factor <4). The structure accounted for both the direct effect of mortality rate on changes in species richness—reflecting its role as a disturbance force that opens space and provides light for recruitment—and the indirect effect of mortality through its influence on changes in stem abundance, acting as a demographic force. Mortality rate was untransformed in order to facilitate the interpretation of results. Changes in identification effort were included only as a predictor of richness change, but not of stem abundance change or mortality rate, as there is no causal connection between these variables—an observation supported by the directed separation tests (P > 0.05) automatically performed in the piecewise analyses (Supplementary Table 10). We maintained this relatively simple partitioning of indirect paths to balance intrinsic uncertainty, the number of predictor variables, and a reduced sample size per region when applying the multigroup approach.

To estimate the indirect effects for each predictor and region, we multiplied the standardized path coefficients for each significant path (for example, maximum temperature → stem abundance change → richness change), considering paths via stem abundance change, mortality rate, and the longer combined path through stem abundance change and mortality rate. We computed these indirect effects only when each path coefficient was significant (P ≤ 0.05). Then, we added the indirect effects obtained by the three potential pathways and added them to estimate the total indirect effect of each predictor on richness change for each region. The direct effects are the standardized coefficients for the path between each predictor and the richness change for each region.

Meta today said that it is pausing teens' access to its AI characters globally across all its apps. The company mentioned that it is not abandoning its efforts but wants to develop an updated version of AI characters for teens, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.

The move comes days before a case against Meta is set to go to trial in New Mexico, in which the company is accused of not making an effort to protect kids from sexual exploitation on its apps. Wired reported Thursday that Meta has sought to limit discovery related to social media's impact on teen mental health.

In October, the company previewed parental controls for AI characters, allowing parents and guardians to monitor topics and block access to certain characters. Meta said parents would be able to completely turn off chats with AI characters. These features were set to release this year, but the company is now turning off AI characters altogether for teens while it updates the AI characters to a newer version.

Meta said that it heard from parents that they wanted more insights and control over their teens' interactions with AI characters, which is why it decided to make these changes.

The company has been cracking down on teens' access to AI content in its apps. Also in October, Meta rolled out parental control features on Instagram, focusing on tailoring the teen experience of interacting with AI on its apps. These features, which were inspired by the PG-13 movie rating, restricted teen access to certain topics like extreme violence, nudity, and graphic drug use.

“Starting in the coming weeks, teens will no longer be able to access AI characters across our apps until the updated experience is ready. This will apply to anyone who has given us a teen birthday, as well as people who claim to be adults but who we suspect are teens based on our age prediction technology,” the company said in an updated blog post. 

Meta added that when it rolls out the new AI characters, they will have built-in parental controls. The company said that the new characters will give age-appropriate responses and will stick to topics like education, sport, and hobbies.

Social media companies are under heavy scrutiny from regulators. Apart from the aforementioned case in New Mexico, Meta is also facing a trial next week, where the platform is accused of causing social media addiction. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to take the witness stand in that case once the trial begins.

Besides social platforms, AI companies have had to modify their experience for teens after facing lawsuits alleging to play a part in aiding self-harm. In October, Character.AI, the startup that allows users to chat with various AI avatars, disallowed open-ended conversations with chatbots for users who were under 18. In November, the startup said it would build interactive stories for kids. In the last few months, OpenAI added new teen safety rules for ChatGPT and started predicting a user's age to apply content restrictions.

Correction: This post was updated to clarify the new version of AI characters will be accessible to everyone, not just teens, when it launches. It will include parental controls.

Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters, summarises its mechanisms and intent quite succinctly: “This is the path that Viktor Orbán took in Hungary, where you use the power of the state to ensure that the media is compliant, that outlets are either curbed and become much less willing to be critical, or they are sold to owners who will make that happen.""

- Do something wildly unacceptable- Media writes an article declaring the action is indefensible- Those involved complain publicly about the unfair nature of the story; their supporters back them up- Next time to avoid controversy media writes a slightly more fair storyIt doesn't even require state power because technically in the US they cannot. There is clearly threat of power kicking journalists out of the  pentagon is a clear example. But it's much more about creating a permission structure through public airing of grievances.

The net effect is that when Trump says ""we are going to fix housing prices by deporting fifty million people"" the Times writes that while the policy may not work it does seem like Trump is trying to tackle the rising cost of housing.

The Biden administration slow-rolled prosecution of Trump for his crimes because they wanted to court moderates and republicans. That failure enabled Trump to run again from somewhere other than prison.""If only the dems had run Romney for president, then they would have won"" is not serious.

IIRC, Biden hemmed and hawwed on border environment until like a couple months before the election, when he issued some executive orders that actually had an impact. But that was too little, too late.> Harris promised to have a republican in her cabinet. She campaigned with Liz Cheney. Did republican voters suddenly jump on board? No.Except that was misunderstanding ""republican voters"" and the energy Trump was tapping into. Getting Liz Cheney on board was just Dem elitists trying to ally with the dying and unpopular elitist wing of the Republican party.I'm talking about something far more radical than some warmed over 2000s centrism: jettison the much of the social-justice activist baggage and co-opt some of Trump's populist appeal, like his rejection of neoliberalism and support for effective border enforcement.

You recall incorrectly. The Biden admin was trying to push congress to pass a bi-partisan immigration bill. It was torpedoed by Trump when he wasn't even in an elected position on the basis that it would help his campaign run on Biden's ""immigration failures"".Here is some reading for you so you don't have to depend only on what you recall:

- trying to appeal to the ""center"" instead of going the other way and channelling the more radical elements' rage against Trump. I believe Bernie would have beaten Trump as the nominee. Yes, the GOP would have painted him as a ""Communist destroying the American Way of Life"", but they did that to Harris anyway so being centrist gave the Dems nothing.- not focusing on prices and jobs from day one, in simple terms the average uneducated worker could understand, and mostly, trying to say ""things are good/better"" which may have been true, but everyone else thought they were not when they went to buy eggs- Biden trying to stay in for a second term instead of bowing out at the start

It sounds a lot like you actually agree; those are all reasons why every Democrat constituent should be livid with the party ""establishment"". Instead, any time this point is brought up, people respond instantly with the ""it's not a 'both sides' issue"" thought-terminating cliché. In this case, one person says, ""Okay, but obviously the other people shot themselves in the foot"" and the response is ""I disagree, here's how they shot themselves in the foot"".

reply

I think so. Something more in the Sanders direction would have been way better, though with a keener eye towards not alienating working-class folks (like putting a massive student loan forgiveness plan front-and-center did), with Trump's rejection of free-trade dogma, and jettisoning the social justice activism that loses rural areas and many working-class voters.

reply

""Both sides"" itself is also often a thought-terminating cliche. It is always important to look at the larger context these points are being made in.Here, the original comment was taking individual Republican voters to task for supporting this performatively-cruel societally-destructive con man with a proven track record. This is something that every individual Republican voter directly did, while Democrat voters did not do and would not have ended up doing [had Harris won]. Harris, for all of her faults and would-have-been letdowns, did not openly run on a platform of destroying our society. Reasonable people can disagree with her policies, but she appeared to be poised to at least lead the country rather than deliberately divide us.But the comment responding to that then tried to equate that blame to ""both sides"", going so far as to use the word ""collectively"" to try and bootstrap personal responsibility from the (obviously terrible) actions of the Democratic party.So no, that is not an equal criticism in the context of criticizing Republican voters who actively voted for overt evil! The many failings of the Democratic party is something that definitely needs to be discussed, but not in the context of the much larger and more serious problems in the Republican party. Rather, bringing it up here seems like yet another instance of the only-Democrats-have-agency fallacy.(I presume the downvotes without comment are just the same old fascism supporters who hate my framing because it clashes with the lies they tell themselves about what they voted for. The funny part is I'm no friend of the Democratic party either - I'm a libertarian who actually believes in many of the issues Trump abuses to rabble-rouse. But my country called, so I swallowed my own independent individualist pride and answered that call rather than falling for the siren song of destructionist grievance politics)

The fact that the dems are weak assholes unable to make even symbolic measures towards someone that's openly violating the constitution and harassing citizens is symptomatic of the deeper rot of attempting to be a 'big tent' party and having zero actual spine or policy.

> The dems are weak, but that's because they want to stay exactly as they are instead of becoming a truly majoritarian party. If the dems make Trump-like power grabs (as many liberals fantasize about), it'll just make Trump stronger, because he can and will use the backlash.At this point, the only recovery from the damage Trump has inflicted upon this country is going to be a massive power grab. That means dissolving ICE and arresting everyone involved, packing the supreme court, pulling out all of the Trump appointees and criminally investigating everyone involved with this administration.

You can arrest however many thousands of politicians and agents; the problem would be exacerbated in that case since the same people who voted for Trump twice would feel even more aggrieved. Many of them like what (they think) he's doing and would jump at any opportunity to vote for someone similar.What you describe would not be the recovery you hope for, at least not long term. Granted, I don't know what would be, but this issue is one of ""post-truth"" where significant amounts of people can simultaneously be convinced of conflicting opinions about an event, even given videos from multiple perspectives, as we learned recently. Throwing an easily-contested ""massive power grab"" into the mix is not a serious suggestion. The political machine that got Trump elected will easily get another demagogue elected off the back of lies mixed with truths about said power grab.

That said, I think ""Trump's voters are all assholes"" is a talking point NOT of liberal voters, but of the Democratic party, because it conveniently avoids any discussion of policy, particularly where the party and its typical voters may differ.Trade is a good example.  The bipartisan consensus since Clinton has largely been that unfettered trade is good.  However, if you work in manufacturing, or are in a labor pool that competes with former manufacturing workers (or workers who might have chosen a career in manufacturing, or mechanical engineering, or processing engineering), then there are certainly some drawbacks to consider.To be clear: I do not in any way endorse Trump's policy.  I am not trying to discount ""owning the libs"", or violent racism, certainly both motivators for a good chunk of the MAGA camp.  I am saying that it is worth considering policy issues that may have convinced people to vote for him.  Especially if you separate campaigning from implementation.  Trump's foreign policy has been intervention-heavy, but his rhetoric was frequently isolationist.

I agree with what you said, that's definitely a talking point meant to maintain a feeling of righteousness while avoiding self-reflection.I disagree with distinction between the ""Democratic party"" and ""liberal voters,"" if anything, I'd say it's the opposite. By and large, I'd expect the professionals of the party to not be so stupid to use ""Trump's voters are all assholes"" as a talking point (even if they think it). IMHO, it's a talking point of extremely polarized liberal voters, who are letting their emotions get the better of them, and themselves thinking and acting in a more Trump-like manner.Both the party and its voters seem extremely reluctant to think about their role in this, and seem to prefer to continue to make the same mistakes, hoping luck or other-side incompetence brings them a better result next time. It's so stupid.

1. ""Defends"" suggests some level of explanation and justification; the White House did not present any here.2. ""AI image showing arrested woman"" could mean a fully-generated image of a woman, rather than editing an image of an existing person under law enforcement control to disguise the actual facts. The first one would be bizarre, the second one is much more problematic.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

Anbernic, the company that has brought us a mountain of retro gaming handhelds over the last several years, is ready to get into high-end peripherals with a controller built for the cross-section of hypochondriacs and gamers. Not only does this controller have a built-in screen, but it also has heart rate sensors inside each controller grip, helping you identify when you're getting a little too into the game you're playing.

Keeping with its typical naming conventions, Anbernic is calling its first pro-level controller the RG G01. The RG in Anbernic's nomenclature stands for “retro gaming,” though there's little about this controller that recalls past screen-based control schemes like the old spaceship-shaped Sega Dreamcast controller. Anbernic's gamepad uses two sensors on either side of the controller grips to measure heart rate and alert you if you may be playing too hard. This data shows up on a 2.5-inch IPS LCD screen shoved in the center of the gamepad. Don't worry, that screen has uses other than just telling you if you need to calm down after a grueling session of Battlefield 6.

Is this controller solving some kind of problem with gamers having heart-related health incidents? A 2023 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology looked at patients at the Mayo Clinic's genetic heart rhythm clinic from 2000 to 2022 and found that heart-related medical incidents when gaming were extremely rare for people with genetic heart conditions. A controller like this may be able to help you if you're concerned your heart rate is impacting performance. On the whole, the RG G01 suggests it's more fun to watch your ECG (electrocardiogram) pump along while you try to not get stomped in your next Call of Duty match.

You already expect a high-end controller to have Hall effect or TMR (tunneling magnetoresistance) joysticks, though Anbernic is going a step further. It's packing the RG G01 with Purple Kirin inductive joysticks, which use capacitive sensing. This measures a small electric current to detect movement and convert that into digital signals that the controller uses for movement. Unlike Hall effect, this type of stick doesn't use any magnetic fields to detect stick orientation. The RG G01 has a touted 1,000Hz polling rate in both wired and 2.4GHz wireless modes, meaning it's a fast controller for those who detest any latency in their controls.

Otherwise, Anbernic's new controller sports many of the same high-end features we're used to, like 6-axis gyroscopes that are compatible with systems like Nintendo Switch 2. It also has two-stage trigger locks for when you want a full analog trigger or a rapid-fire sensation for first-person shooters. The back buttons are programmable with macros that could prove useful for fighting games. If you don't find the screen all that appealing, the clear plastic shell lets you see the haptic rumble motors in action.

Honestly, it's that small detail alone that sold me on the RG G01's appeal, far more than the odd heartbeat sensor. It will come in white, gray, and yellow color schemes and should work on PC, Switch, Android, and iOS. The controller is “coming soon,” though as for price, it's anyone's guess. Anbernic's only other controller, the RG P01, sells for $18. The RG G01 will likely cost more, though we doubt it will be anywhere near as expensive as Nintendo's own $90 Switch 2 Pro gamepad.

Elon Musk spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, making promises about the future of robots, cars, and space travel that you've likely heard before. The chat was uncharacteristically subdued, especially when you remember the billionaire oligarch's flamboyant appearances of 2025, wielding chainsaws and tossing up Nazi-style salutes. But one line stuck out during his chat on Thursday as the most disingenuous.

“I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,” said Musk. “And generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than a pessimist and right.”

Musk is trying to present himself as an optimist about the future of humanity. In reality, his public statements and actions paint a very different picture. And there's a simple reason Musk wants to be seen as an optimist: It helps him make a lot more money.

On its face, declaring yourself an optimist seems like a reasonable thing to say and believe. But contrast Musk's sentiment on Thursday with the rhetoric we've seen since he signed up to publicly support President Donald Trump in the summer of 2024, and it doesn't really give a warm and fuzzy feeling.

In recent years, Musk has obsessed over a dark near future and said that illegal immigration was contributing to “civilizational suicide” in response to a message from the Pope; he said that the “woke mind virus” was destroying the country; he said that humanity needs to become multiplanetary or we're facing an “extinction event.”

“Western Civilization is doomed, unless the core weakness of suicidal empathy is recognized and actions are taken that are hard, but necessary for survival,” Musk wrote in Nov. 2025.

Musk has spent years warning about the threat of artificial intelligence before founding his own AI company called xAI in 2023. Thursday, he warned about the kind of future that you'd find in dystopian fiction, another instance where he wasn't painting a picture of the brightest future.

“We need to be very careful with robotics,” said Musk. “We don't want to find ourselves in a James Cameron movie, you know, Terminator. He's got great movies, love his movies, but we don't want to be in Terminator, obviously.”

But Musk flips back and forth on the threat of AI. Remember back in 2023 when Musk signed a letter that called for a pause on all AI research? The public would later learn he was calling for that pause while starting xAI and staffing up the company. He just wanted to slow down competitors like OpenAI, which had quite a head start. Now, Musk's chatbot is embedded in the systems at the Pentagon. It's all a show to sell more shit, it would seem.

The billionaire's most bleak predictions are often his most racist. “Whites are a rapidly dying minority,” Musk tweeted shortly before appearing on stage at Davos. Quote-tweeting another claim about a rise in the number of Black people living in the UK on Thursday, Musk wrote: “If this continues, entire cultures will be erased.”

They're the kind of tweets that would've been considered extraordinary coming from an American public figure as recently as a decade ago. And when it's not racism, it's transphobia. Musk has disowned his own daughter, misgendering her whenever he talks about her in public. One of the first things he did after buying Twitter in late 2022 was to remove basic protections on the social media platform intended to keep trans users safe. Musk welcomed back not only the anti-trans bigots, but the most hardcore conspiracy theorists and literal Nazis.

Musk sure doesn't sound like an optimist when he talks about liberal democracies around the world that oppose his far-right worldview. The UK has received special scorn from the billionaire, conjuring apocalyptic visions of a future England with mass murder in the streets.

“I really think there's got to be a change of government in Britain. And you can't… we don't have another four years or whatever the next election is. It's too long,” Musk said, speaking with far-right activist Tommy Robinson this past September. “Something's got to be done. There's got to be a dissolution of parliament and a new vote held.”

“I really think there's got to be a change of government in Britain. And you can't… we don't have another four years or whatever the next election is. It's too long.

Bringing down the British government might be “optimistic” in Musk's book. But to most people, it probably sounds like a desire for revolution in the face of government policies he doesn't like. Invariably, his desire is always framed in apocalyptic terms.

Then there's his about-face on the environment. Musk frequently warns of the collapse of civilization but rarely talks about climate change. That wrinkle is actually pretty new. The billionaire used to tout his environmentalist bona fides when President Barack Obama was in office. But when Trump came onto the scene, he could clearly see the winds changing. He didn't need to pretend that environmental concerns mattered now that fascism was on the march. His companies got fat on government subsidies, and now it was time to pull up the ladder behind him.

Musk, who's worth $787 billion according to Forbes, donated over a quarter of a billion dollars to install Trump and his Republican allies into government. And he was rewarded with unprecedented and unlawful authority to just choose which parts of the government he wanted to throw away. Musk bragged about sending USAID through the wood chipper, dissolving an agency created by Congress that could only be abolished by Congress. But Musk did it anyway, moving on to countless government programs that he alone decided should not be funded. Notably, none of Musk's lucrative contracts for SpaceX were cut.

All of this is to say that Musk is always selling something. And everything that comes out of his mouth, which may initially sound “optimistic,” needs to be understood as the work of a salesman. Even his closing line at Davos can be interpreted as a rationalization for his sales tactics. Arguing that “it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than a pessimist and right” takes on a different tone when you remember that he's been over-promising on countless technologies—from full self-driving to visiting Mars to flying cars—and pissing off plenty of investors in the process. He's not failing to deliver, he's just an “optimist,” you see?

Musk might genuinely want to go to Mars one day, the kind of childhood dream that's shared by a lot of people. But Musk's way of talking about it doesn't strike me as optimistic. It's the fantasy of a child with a lot of money, and it helps him sell himself as a dreamer.

Musk's attitude about Mars and space travel actually fits nicely with the tone of a comic strip that ran in U.S. newspapers from the late 1950s and early 1960s, arguably the golden age of 20th-century futurism. The August 16, 1959, edition of “Closer Than We Think,” illustrated by Detroit artist Arthur Radebaugh, featured a cartoon of smiling people who had left Earth due to overpopulation.

“If the earth should ever become overpopulated, emigration to outer space may become a commonplace. Bands of colonists might settle on distant planets, traveling there at lightning speeds in rockets of unbelievable size,” the comic strip explained.

Musk is obsessed with 20th-century futurism, as so many of us are. But it's hard to call something like the “Space Mayflower” of 1959 optimistic, judging from the perspective of 2026.

Here in the 2020s, it seems downright utopian just to imagine a world where masked federal agents aren't abducting preschoolers and shipping them across the country. We don't need Musk promising that his Optimus robot will deliver a post-scarcity world where money doesn't even need to exist. We need universal healthcare and cheaper housing, the kinds of things that Musk did everything he could to destroy while taking a chainsaw to the federal government.

If anything, the idea of a post-scarcity world should fill us with hope. But when Elon Musk is selling it, it's hard to be optimistic.

2026 looks to be a bad year for gamers' wallets.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new leak from tech YouTuber der8auer claims that Nvidia is ending a program dubbed ""OPP"", purportedly an incentive scheme used by Nvidia to ensure that at least some of its graphics cards were sold to consumers at MSRP by AIBs like Asus and others.

By way of historical background, the creator said in his YouTube video that Nvidia's GPUs were previously being sold for way above the suggested retail price for the last few generations, and consumers were starting to notice and complain about it. So, the company instituted the OPP program, which, according to de8auer's sources, is some sort of cash back for participating AIB partners. Although the techtuber does not know what OPP stands for, this is how it allegedly works: board partners sell some models at MSRP and then report that back to Nvidia, after which the GPU manufacturer would give them a rebate on the cost of the chip and the memory of that particular GPU they sold.

According to der8auer's leak, Nvidia apparently stopped this program a few days ago. The sources did not say the reason behind the move, although it is easy to surmise that it's caused by the ongoing memory crisis. We've reached out to Nvidia for comment. There were rumors late last year that the company no longer bundled VRAM with the GPU chips that board partners ordered, but Nvidia refuted this at CES, telling HardwareLuxx [machine translated], “No changes on how Nvidia is handling the memory allocation.”

If the OPP program is indeed real, it seems that the continuous increase in memory pricing is making it difficult even for Team Green, with its record revenues fueled by the boom in AI infrastructure build-out, to sustain the GPU and memory subsidy that allows board partners to at least sell some models at MSRP.

Aside from the end of the “OPP,” der8auer also touched on the recent RTX 5070 Ti news. Another YouTube channel, Hardware Unboxed, was told by an Asus representative that the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB have been discontinued or marked as end-of-life (EOL). Asus refuted this a few hours later, saying that “Certain media may have received incomplete information from an Asus PR representative regarding these products,” and that “Asus has no plans to stop selling these models.”

However, industry sources reportedly told the tech tuber that Nvidia is prioritizing the RTX 5080 over the RTX 5070 Ti for its GB 203 supply. Both GPU models use the same chip, but since the GB 203 has a high yield rate, it's been rumored that the GPU manufacturer wants to maximize its profits and prioritize the more expensive RTX 5080. Because of this, some say that the supply for the 5070 Ti will be heavily cut and that it's going to be shifted towards the 5080.

Nevertheless, that does not mean we expect to see RTX 5080 prices to drop. In fact, the opposite has been true in recent days, with prices for different RTX 5080 models from various AIBs showing an increasing trend on Amazon. And with demand for both memory and AI chips remaining strong, we don't expect gamers and their wallets to get a reprieve anytime soon.

 January 22, 2026  

A study characterizing national patterns of ocular trauma from ball sports in the US found eye injuries due to pickleball rose from 2014 to 2023, disproportionately affecting older adults. These injuries were more frequently associated with falls or orbital fractures than were ocular injuries from dodgeball or kickball.

“These findings support the development of targeted interventions, such as age- and sport- specific protective eyewear, education campaigns, and better injury surveillance. Continued monitoring and prevention efforts will be crucial as participation in athletics continues to increase,” the researchers reported.

The study was led by Jainam Shah and Sachin Pathuri, of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in The Bronx, New York. It was published online on January 16, 2025, in Eye.

The study only included patients presenting to emergency departments. The database lacked detailed clinical data. It also prohibited the release of case-level information that would allow identification, preventing the provision of detailed information on injury. 

The study had no external sources of funding. One author disclosed serving as consultant for various companies and another author declared serving on the editorial board of various ophthalmology-related journals.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

People with obesity and high blood pressure may face a higher risk of dementia, according to a new study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

Dementia is a growing global public health challenge, with no cure currently available. People with dementia experience a severe decline in mental abilities, like memory, thinking and reasoning.

The most common forms of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and mixed dementia. Dementia is a progressive brain disease that causes nerve cell damage that worsens over time, affecting memory, language, problem-solving and behavior.

""In this study, we found high body mass index (BMI) and high blood pressure are direct causes of dementia,"" said study author Ruth Frikke-Schmidt, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Chief Physician at Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""The treatment and prevention of elevated BMI and high blood pressure represent an unexploited opportunity for dementia prevention.""

The researchers analyzed data from participants in Copenhagen and the U.K. and identified a causal link between higher body weight and dementia.

The researchers were able to establish a direct causal link between high BMI and dementia because they used a so-called Mendelian randomization design that mimics a randomized controlled trial. In the Mendelian randomization study design, common genetic variants causing high BMI are used as proxies for BMI altering medications. As active drug versus placebo is randomly assigned due to the randomization process in drug trials, and as BMI-increasing genetic variants versus neutral variants are randomly assorted from parents to offspring, the effects on the disease endpoint will be clear and not affected by confounding factors.

Therefore, this strategy enabled the researchers to establish a direct causal link between high BMI and risk of dementia.

Much of this increased dementia risk appeared to be driven by high blood pressure, suggesting that preventing or treating obesity and high blood pressure could help reduce dementia risk.

This study shows that high body weight and high blood pressure are not just warning signs, but direct causes of dementia. That makes them highly actionable targets for prevention.""

Ruth Frikke-Schmidt, Copenhagen University Hospital

""Weight-loss medication has recently been tested for halting cognitive decline in early phases of Alzheimer's disease, but with no beneficial effect. An open question that remains to be tested is if weight-loss medication initiated before the appearance of cognitive symptoms may be protective against dementia. Our present data would suggest that early weight-loss interventions would prevent dementia, and especially vascular-related dementia,"" she continued.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Trinity Rodman becomes world's highest-paid women's soccer player with historic Spirit contract","https://nypost.com/2026/01/22/sports/trinity-rodman-becomes-worlds-highest-paid-womens-soccer-player/","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:42:00 GMT","

One of women's soccer's biggest names is remaining in the United States and is becoming the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world in one fell swoop.  

Trinity Rodman agreed to a new contract with the NWSL's Washington Spirit to keep her with the team through 2028. It comes with an annual salary of over $1 million, her agent Mike Senkowski of Upper 90 Sports Group told ESPN.

“I've made the DMV my home and the Spirit my family, and I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,” Rodman said in a statement. “I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed. We're chasing championships and raising the standard, and I can't wait to keep doing that with my teammates and the best fans in the NWSL.”

Rodman had been a free agent since the end of 2025 when her contract expired, and there was an ongoing saga to try to sign the star to a new deal. 

Rodman, the daughter of Bulls great Dennis Rodman, was sought after by some of the biggest clubs across the globe. 

ESPN previously reported that teams — namely in England — made offers to Rodman that the Spirit would have struggled to match due to the constraints of the NWSL's salary cap. 

The Spirit and Rodman attempted to get creative to make a deal work in November by backloading a four-year deal worth over $1 million per year, but commissioner Jessica Berman stepped in to cancel the contract. 

Berman said that the deal “violated the spirit of the league.”

In an attempt to keep Rodman in the NWSL, the league's board of governors approved a new rule dubbed the High Impact Player rule, allowing teams to spend up to $1 million over the cap on contracts for star players who meet specific performance and marketability criteria. 

“Trinity is a generational player, but more importantly, she represents the future of this club and the future of women's soccer,” Washington Spirit Michele Kang said in a statement. This agreement reflects our belief that elite talent deserves elite commitment. At the Spirit, we are building something enduring: a club that competes for championships every year, invests in excellence and creates an environment where world-class players can thrive long-term. Trinity choosing to continue her career in Washington is a powerful statement about what we are building here.”

Rodman was selected second overall in the 2021 NWSL Draft at 18 years old and has become one of the biggest names in the league and for the U.S. Women's National Team.

Arsenal are the only European team in the Women's Champions Cup this season

The inaugural Women's Champions Cup winners will earn $2.3m (£1.7m), the biggest-ever single award in women's club football, says its organiser Fifa.

Arsenal will enter in the first Women's Champions Cup at the semi-final stage in January.

The new six-team competition was announced by Fifa last March, along with the introduction of a 16-team Women's Club World Cup.

The runners-up will earn $1m (£735,000), the losing semi-finalists will get $200,000 (£147,000), while Auckland United of New Zealand and China's Wuhan Chegu Jiangda, who both bowed out in the first round of the competition, will receive $100,000 (£73,500).

Fifa secretary general Mattias Grafstrom said it was ""a clear statement of the belief in women's club football and the players, teams and competitions driving its continued rise"".

The Women's Champions Cup is set to run annually, except when there is a Women's Club World Cup - another new Fifa competition that will take place every four years and be held for the first time in 2028.

Arsenal are Europe's representatives in the tournament after they won the Women's Champions League last season.

Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium, which holds around 17,000 fans, will host the two semi-finals on Wednesday, 28 January. USA's Gotham FC play Corinthians of Brazil in the first semi-final (12:30 GMT) followed by Arsenal versus Morocco's AS FAR (18:00).

The final (18:00) and third-place play-off (14:45) will be played at the 60,704-capacity Emirates Stadium, Arsenal's home ground for their WSL matches, on Sunday, 1 February.

Cristiano Ronaldo and an Obsession With History


At this stage of his career, Cristiano Ronaldo appears driven by one final, towering objective: reaching 1,000 official career goals. With his scoring rhythm intact in Saudi Arabia, the debate is no longer if he will get there, but when.





As he continues delivering for Al Nassr, one question keeps gaining traction: could that historic goal arrive on football's biggest stage at the 2026 World Cup?






How Many Goals Does Cristiano Ronaldo Have?


As of January 22, Cristiano Ronaldo sits on 960 career goals, a staggering total that continues to rise with every appearance for club and country, including the Portugal national team.

The math is straightforward. He needs 40 more goals to reach the mythical four-digit mark — a number that would feel unrealistic for most players, but remains very much alive in Ronaldo's case.






The Road to the 2026 World Cup


The idea of the 2026 World Cup hosting goal No. 1,000 is enticing, though the context makes it a tall order. Between now and the tournament, Al Nassr's schedule projects roughly 20 official matches, excluding friendlies and potential games where rotation could come into play.

To reach the milestone before the World Cup, CR7 would need to score one — or even two — goals per match consistently. That demand clashes with his current average of 0.74 goals per game, according to ESPN data.






Recent Numbers Cool the Narrative


A closer look at his recent output further tempers expectations. Across his last 20 matches, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 15 goals — an impressive return, but not enough to push him into immediate contention for the 1,000-goal mark.

If that same pace holds heading into the World Cup, Ronaldo would arrive at roughly 975 goals, effectively ruling out the possibility of reaching the milestone during the tournament itself.






Annual Averages Tell a Clear Story


Another key factor lies in his yearly production. Historically, Cristiano Ronaldo averages around 40 goals per calendar year, a benchmark that offers a more realistic projection.

His goal totals by year since 2018:



2018: 49
2019: 39
2020: 44
2021: 47
2022: 16
2023: 54
2024: 43
2025: 41



Based on that trend, the most logical window for goal No. 1,000 points to late 2026 or even early 2027, rather than during the World Cup itself.






Hunger Remains, Even as Logic Pushes Back


What never fades is Cristiano Ronaldo's relentless appetite. Every match reinforces the same message: age, context, and probability remain secondary to his pursuit of goals.

Could an unexpected scoring streak shatter every projection? With CR7, it's never off the table. Still, based on current data, the numbers suggest his 1,000th goal is more likely to arrive around the World Cup — not at it.

The countdown continues. And as long as he's on the pitch, Cristiano Ronaldo will keep chasing the one number still missing from his legendary résumé.

Inclement Weather Has Canceled Shows This Weekend. Here's What's Already Rescheduled.

Emma Ruby

Audio By Carbonatix

U.S. Sen. John Cornyn took a break from the campaign trail Thursday afternoon to join Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson and local and federal law enforcement leaders at the Dallas Police headquarters for a conversation on public safety during this summer's FIFA World Cup games. 

The One Big Beautiful Bill, which Congress passed last July, included a $625 million appropriation for security during the World Cup, and Cornyn stated that he believes Texas will receive around $100 million of that funding. The money will be used to reimburse costs taken on by local law enforcement agencies during the games. 

 

According to Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux, the funds will be key to covering overtime hours worked by Dallas and Arlington police officers during the region's nine games. The funds can also be used for equipment needs, though it was unclear from Thursday's briefing which technologies the departments may need. 

The Department of Homeland Security announced a separate federal funding package in January to develop drone surveillance programs and counter-drone technologies ahead of the games, something Rick Burkhead, a regional safety liaison with FIFA, described as “a concern.” 

Cornyn — perhaps not that far off from the campaign trail after all — emphasized that the funding is a crucial step in affirming the federal government's support of local law enforcement efforts. 

“To me, our support for our law enforcement agencies is non-negotiable. I know there are some who say we should defund the police, or we should abolish ICE, or we should interfere with law enforcement officers enforcing the laws of Congress,” said Cornyn. “I think that's absolutely wrong.” 

Present at Thursday's briefing was Christina Foley, special agent in charge of the United States Secret Service. Foley will serve as the federal coordinator for the Dallas matches, communicating between local and federal law enforcement agencies. Five departments within the Department of Homeland Security will be active in monitoring security threats throughout the World Cup, Foley said. 

What are those threats, specifically, you ask? So did the media members present on Thursday. Mums the word.

Millions of soccer fans are expected to visit Dallas for the World Cup, which Johnson touted as an “incredible opportunity to market our neck of the woods to the world.” But details were also few on whether local law enforcement leaders are communicating with federal immigration officials about plans to ensure that international visitors are not affected by President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. 

Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department stopped issuing visas to immigrants from 75 countries, including several that have already qualified for the North American games. Officials have stated that the pause will not affect tourist visas for those hoping to enter the U.S. for the World Cup. 

Still, the American Immigration Council has warned that public arrests by ICE agents, fast-changing federal policy, and altercations like the shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent may have a chilling effect on those who are willing to travel to the U.S. for the games. 

When asked how North Texas officials were preparing for this summer's intersection of international visitors and ICE's presence, Cornyn described Trump's federal immigration policy as part of the “mandate” he received from voters, said ICE's being in North Texas “should not be a problem at all,” and moved to the next question.

Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations when it comes to the US-shaped problem

Could European countries really decide to boycott the World Cup this summer? It is an astonishing question to be asking in 2026 and an indictment of the bind in which, as Donald Trump sows confusion around a potential annexation of Greenland, the world's most popular sport finds itself. But the idea is at least seeping into the mainstream and senior figures are asking what, in a worst-case scenario, it would take for football to meet the moment.

Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations. As the Guardian reported this week, an anniversary party for the Hungarian FA on Monday became the forum for unofficial discussions among national association heads about how a unified approach to the US-shaped problem might take shape.

While flexibility is essential in a volatile, fast-moving situation, there is an acceptance that no one can afford to be asleep if the time for action comes.

That is why there is a growing belief that Europe's governing bodies, whether led by individual federations or by Uefa itself, must cohere behind a common position – or at least prepare one. Sources have described a tightening of unity since Trump, whose suggestion on Wednesday he will not take Greenland by force – and later that there was the outlines of a deal – must surely be treated with caution.

While some federations are understood to have been relatively unbothered by the spectacle of Trump receiving a peace prize from the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in December, choosing in certain cases to find a funny side, the gravity of current events is lost on no one.

The tight bond between Infantino's leadership and the Trump administration means European football cannot look away. There is a consensus that Fifa has chosen to politicise itself; that could bring consequences if the US president intensifies his designs on a territory that belongs, indisputably, to a Uefa member in Denmark.

Then there is the precedent of recent history. Russia was quickly frozen out of international competition after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, essentially because other countries refused to compete against them. Why should the US be treated differently if it sent in the troops, and why should its part in the World Cup be indulged into the bargain?

Some key figures expect military aggression would be the breaking point for Uefa and the federations it covers. In the event Trump's latest pronouncements stand the test of time, it means any whispers about a boycott will remain hushed for now. It remains a far-flung prospect.

None of Europe's FAs are in a rush to go public with a stance and plenty may follow their governments' positions. The question is whether that would be enough for those who feel football has a unique opportunity to assert itself.

The French sports minister, Marina Ferrari, said on Tuesday, in response to calls from elsewhere on the political spectrum, that the country has no plan to boycott but added the caveat “as it stands now”. But the German minister for sports, Christiane Schenderlein, deflected any decision making to “the competent sports associations”.

There are certainly some within football's corridors of power who feel a stand could be made while politicians prevaricate. Trump has wedded himself to the World Cup project since his first term, naturally making mention of his own hard work in steering the bid when it succeeded in 2018.

The prospect of visible, palpable damage to his latest big moment would not be easy for the president to stomach. Perhaps, if Uefa and its federations flexed their muscles, Infantino could even feel compelled to engage in far-reaching diplomacy with his friend around the Greenland problem.

Some within Uefa would strain at the leash to see Infantino put in his place. Football's biggest governing bodies endured a high-profile falling-out in May over Infantino's conduct around the Fifa congress in Paraguay, although it was quickly smoothed over in public. More moderate forces close to the organisation may not favour incendiary moves this time, with the future of global football facing enough uncertainty, but the sport has been planted in uncharted waters and could find it needs to swim hard.

The hypotheticals continue but they cannot be purely dismissed as such. Recent events have underlined that football's leadership must be agile and the message is hitting home. Initiatives such as the hugely popular petition in the Netherlands, urging a boycott of the World Cup, suggest public sentiment would be supportive of decisive action if the unthinkable came to pass.

The pitch may quietly have been rolled. The enduring hope is that, for reasons in which football is unpleasantly enmeshed, it never needs testing out.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

The American teenager is into the second week of a major tournament for the first time after knocking out No. 8 seed Jasmine Paolini in straight sets.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 23, 2026 copy_link

MELBOURNE, Australia—When preparing to play one of the biggest tennis matches of your life, it doesn't hurt to get some advice from a 24-time Grand Slam champion.Iva Jovic revealed a chat with Novak Djokovic helped inspired the 18-year-old into a maiden Top 10 victory over Jasmine Paolini, conquering the No. 8 seed, 6-2, 7-6 (3).“He gave me some very attentive tips for my game and something I can try to incorporate into this match that I just played,” Jovic said in her post-match press conference on Friday, “so that was one of the things in the forefront of my mind, because I think when Novak gives you some advice, you follow it!”Jovic, a Serbian-American born in Torrance, California, first met Djokovic during last year's Wimbledon Championships, the chance meeting facilitated by USTA coach Kathy Rinaldi.

“We were practicing on the indoor courts at Wimbledon and he just walked in to a court close to us. His son was playing, and Kathy was like, ‘Let's go up to him right now!' I was like, ‘Kathy!'” Jovic laughingly recalled during the 2025 US Open.“He just wished me luck and told me to keep working,” she added. “It was kind of just a little bit of an introduction. I met Jelena there too, and his sons were playing. It was just so cool. There was nothing super specific said but just the way he talks, he has a thing about himself where you can tell that he's great. Not even seeing him on the tennis court, he has that presence, which is super cool.”In the midst of playing his 21st Australian Open main draw, Djokovic was more specific this time in talking to Jovic, who is playing her second.“It was just to open up the court a little bit better, to not rush into the shots all the time, find some more width,” Jovic explained.“So, I tried to do that, and it ended well. So I'm just going to try to keep listening to Novak.”

You always think about those moments where you're going to meet your idols a little bit, and I think sometimes for certain people it can be a little bit deflating if they are maybe not as nice or as open as you anticipated...I think he's almost even kinder and even more attentive outside the cameras than what he's portrayed! Iva Jovic on meeting idol Novak Djokovic

The teenager, who attracted a substantial gaggle of Serbian reporters and ended her press conference by taking questions in Serbian, was building towards a big result like this for several months. She won her first WTA 500 title in Guadalajara in September and kicking off the 2026 season with a runner-up finish at the Hobart International. She's yet to drop a set in Melbourne, but even if she's earned it, there's still something surreal about getting advice from your idol.“It's pretty insane,” admitted Jovic, who is closing in on a Top 20 debut. “You always think about those moments where you're going to meet your idols a little bit, and I think sometimes for certain people it can be a little bit deflating if they are maybe not as nice or as open as you anticipated.  I think that happens a lot of times where you kind of see, ‘Oh, wow, that's definitely not how it looks like on TV.' I think he's almost even kinder and even more attentive outside the cameras than what he's portrayed!“I mean, he's so intelligent and smart and really wants to help the younger generation. So, I'm really grateful to have that advice. Hopefully I'll speak with him more.”

On an early idol trajectory of her own, Jovic will play former world No. 20 Yulia Putintseva for the chance to reach a first Grand Slam quarterfinal—another potential goal achieved by the youngster so early into the new season.“You never know how the year is going to start,” Jovic admitted. “Obviously I had my hopes to start well and win a lot of matches, but you just never know when everything is going to click. It's really nice to be getting good results this early in the season, and hopefully I can keep going and winning some more.”And perhaps Djokovic will be watching.

First look at Ferrari's 2026 car

Hamilton reflects on Ferrari's 'remarkable' journey at Maranello launch

George Russell and Kimi Antonelli returned to the track in the new-look Mercedes W17 at Silverstone.

1 / 6

Mercedes' 2026 car made its on-track debut at Silverstone at the hands of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli, completing its first laps of the year as part of a filming day.

The Brackley outfit recently revealed a revised livery featuring their trademark black and silver colour scheme for this season, in which every team will battle to capitalise on the sweeping regulation changes.

Their unchanged driver line-up clocked nearly 200km of mileage in typically damp conditions at the British circuit on 22 January to kickstart their pre-season preparation, with the squad joining the other 10 teams for the shakedown in Barcelona next week.

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director, said: “We have had a sensible first day of
running with the W17 at Silverstone. As with any shakedown, the focus is on ensuring
everything operates safely and reliably.

""We were able to get through our allotted mileage, with both George and Kimi getting to experience the 2026 car on track for the first time. That is testament to the hard work of everyone at Brackley and Brixworth.

""Our attention now turns to Barcelona where we will look to build on today's running and add to our understanding of the W17.”

Gayle Rankin and Grant O'Rourke also star as uncivilized off-the-grid siblings who resist being evicted by the Scottish Council from their island home.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	The British Isles can be treacherously vulnerable to twee overload in movies, though last year's The Ballad of Wallis Island showed that it can be avoided, remaining a minor-key charmer even while it embraced every oddball eccentricity that writer-stars Tom Basden and Tim Key could concoct. Louis Paxton's The Incomer is not so resilient. Set on an even more remote island, this one off the northeast coast of Scotland, it centers on orphaned siblings who have grown up in isolation, without the comforts of modern mainland life — in thrall to mythical seagull legends that make this abrasively unfunny comedy strictly for the birds.

	The movie's saving grace is Domhnall Gleeson as Daniel, a gentle-natured mainlander working as a land recovery coordinator for the Northeastern Scottish Council. He's an awkward outsider in the office, his moral misgivings about foreclosures and evictions, turfing people out of their lifelong homes, leading his careerist boss Roz (Michelle Gomez) to treat him like a bleeding-heart fool. He's also “a ginger” with eczema, which doesn't exactly raise his stock.

The Bottom Line

	
	A shipwreck.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (NEXT)Cast: Domhnall Gleeson, Gayle Rankin, Grant O'Rourke, Emun Elliott, Michelle Gomez, John HannahDirector-screenwriter: Louis Paxton

								1 hour 42 minutes			






	With Daniel's empathy perceived as a weakness, Gleeson makes him the ideal mediator to communicate with two people positioned even further out on the margins. Calum (Emun Elliott), the thuggish staffer usually in charge of doorstep evictions, is out of commission due to some legal strife, so Roz sends Daniel in his place to a tiny island where brother and sister Sandy (Grant O'Rourke) and Isla (Gayle Rankin) — on-the-nose names that make them seem like they belong in Bikini Bottom with Spongebob — have lived alone since their parents passed 30 years ago.

	











	Paxton makes clever use of Selina Wagner's doodling animation to pencil in the island's ancestral folklore, frequently recounted by bossy Isla to dim bulb Sandy, when she's not caw-cawing at birds like a witch. The isle belongs to the gulls, and the siblings were taught as children to defend the birds' sanctuary from “incomers,” bringing with them the decadence and deceit of the mainland. Even so, Isla jealously guards the flotsam that drifts ashore, including a bendy sex toy that they think must be a weapon of some kind. Oh, the hilarity!


	The brother and sister sustain themselves by digging up peat bog to burn in an ancient, dilapidated house with no utilities, and hunting seabirds. But it's a meager existence. “I could go for some whale blubber right now,” says hungry Sandy.


	Probably three readers at most will get this reference, but the establishing scenes on the island poked my repressed memory PTSD, hate-watching 1970s British children's fantasy TV series like Catweazle, a show about a creepy time-traveling wizard that dialed up the whimsy to 11. The movie also brought back those cringe-inducing scenes at the end of another drama set on a windblown Scottish island, The Outrun, in which Saoirse Ronan “conducts” turbulent nature with an invisible baton.


The Incomer follows similar cues. Rankin plays Isla as a shrill, feral version of Gaby Hoffman (no offense to the wonderful Gabs) given to physical violence, while O'Rourke gets to play the sweet, constipated dolt, talking wistfully of the days when his “bottom mess” flowed more freely. I'm serious. Isla also has frequent exchanges with a “fin man” (poor John Hannah), part of a mythical species of whiskered seal-like creatures that haunt the waters, bobbing up to lure land-dwellers into the murky depths.

	











	One of Isla and Sandy's preferred deterrents to keep incomers away is to dress up in home-made Wicker Man-type bird costumes and masks — which at least gets them out of their hideous knitwear. If their hostile squawking doesn't work, they take up primitive weapons. Daniel is greeted with a rock to the head and then dangled over a cliff. But he saves himself by telling Isla and Sandy he's a wizard (like Catweazle!), snapping a photo of them on his cellphone and threatening to use it to delete their souls.


	What follows is a predictable détente during which Daniel paints a rosy picture of relocation to a comfortable home and easier lives on the mainland. Given that stories are Isla and Sandy's chief currency, he also entertains them by taking ownership of Tolkien and recasting himself as Gandalf.


	Romantic complications ensue when time spent with Daniel sparks impulses that the siblings don't know what to do with, beyond roping him into a gull initiation ceremony. And violence intrudes when Roz grows impatient for results and deploys hotheaded Calum to clean up the mess.


	But this is designed to be a heartwarming comedy and debuting feature director Paxton is more assured with the outcome than he is about getting there. Some actual funny gags in the late action — a queer awakening avec bear; a hard headbutt when Daniel moves in for a kiss, confusing Isla — hint at what the story could have been with a less cutesy touch.


	Almost in spite of its full-scale charm offensive — the score's plucky strings and horns really are a bit much — The Incomer acquires poignancy through Gleeson's playful, unassuming performance. Watching Daniel stand up to Roz is a victory for social justice in a rapacious modern world, while the fear of change embodied by Isla and Sandy ultimately is quite touching. While I found the movie a mostly annoying guano pileup, some no doubt will respond more receptively to its quirky exploration of human connection.

The new album is slated to drop later this winter.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Harry Styles fans knew they were going to get a new music video on Friday (Jan. 23) for “Aperture,” the singer's latest single, but what they didn't realize beforehand was that they were going to get the tracklist to his upcoming album, too.


	While waiting for the visual to premiere at noon ET, fans with the video's countdown pulled up on YouTube noticed that the filler image kept changing. One by one, the titles of all 12 songs on Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally popped up, styled in the form of a circular spiral.

	











	With minutes left to go before the “Aperture” music video went live, the final track name — “Carla's Song” — appeared, completing the design. 


	According to the graphic, “Aperture” won't just serve as the lead single off of Styles' fourth solo LP — it will also be the opening number on the tracklist. Other intriguing titles include “American Girls,” “Season 2 Weight Loss,” “Pop” and “Dance No More.”




	Though fans got to hear the house-inspired, dance-inducing “Aperture” on Thursday (Jan. 22) and watch its music video the next day, they'll have to wait until March 6 to hear Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally in full. The One Direction alum's next project will come more than three years after his last full-length, Harry's House, dropped in 2022 and spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. 


	“It just became really obvious that it was music that was meant to be played loud,” Styles said of making Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally in a recent interview with John Mayer. “That is when it feels its best … I hope that people will kind of road test it in a couple different ways and see how their album experience kind of shifts.”

An aircraft of an unusual triangular shape was spotted over the area of the well-known U.S. test airbase Groom Lake (Area 51).

The Aviationist reported on this.

Planespotter Anders Ottosson was observing nighttime aviation activity in the early morning hours of January 14, 2026.

During the monitoring, he captured thermal images of a sharp-angled, triangular aircraft flying in airspace near the base.

The aircraft spotted at night over Nevada bears a striking resemblance to an object photographed during the daytime over Wichita, Kansas, in 2014.

It is worth noting that although the photograph of the mysterious aircraft over Wichita was taken in February 2014, it was not made public until April, about a month after another high-profile sighting.

On March 10, 2014, Steve Douglas and Dean Mussett took a series of photographs of three unidentified aircraft flying at very high altitude over Amarillo, Texas.

Despite years of speculation, no official explanation has ever been provided for these objects. The aircraft recorded over Wichita was never publicly identified and has not appeared in open-source observations since.

The current sighting in the Area 51 region is particularly noteworthy for the striking similarity between the thermal images and the 2014 photographs, despite more than 10 years separating the two events and the footage being captured under different conditions and with entirely different equipment.

It is worth noting that the United States operates several aircraft with highly unconventional designs developed under so-called “black projects”—research and development programs with an extremely high level of secrecy.

The public learned about most of these projects only many years after their creation, while some black programs still remain on the borderline between reality and speculation.

There have also been openly “exotic” or nearly “space-like” aircraft designs, including the Northrop Tacit Blue, the RQ-3 DarkStar, and the Boeing Bird of Prey.

A vivid example of a “black project” is the experimental Lockheed Have Blue aircraft, which later became the basis for the production F-117 stealth fighter.

Strategic bombers such as the B-2 and the future B-21 followed a similar path, remaining out of public view for a long time and being classified by observers as unidentified flying objects for years.

Elon Musk has provided the world with a shocking update on the possibility of there being alien life beyond Earth.

It's an age-old question that still remains unanswered - is there life outside of our planet?

Despite extensive efforts, experts still haven't been able to conclusively find any evidence but many people believe extraterrestrial life could exist.

In recent years, billionaire Musk has also set his sights on the stars, with hopes for his space firm SpaceX to establish permanent bases on both the Moon and Mars.

And now, the tech mogul has spoken out at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to give people an update on his thoughts about intelligent life possibly being out there in space.

During a conversation the billionaire had with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk joked that he is often asked whether there are aliens among us, adding: “And I'll say that I am one. They don't believe me.”

He continued: “The bottom line is, I think we need to assume that life and consciousness is extremely rare and it might only be us and if that's the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished.”

Musk has previously said that he believes SpaceX could achieve ‘self sustaining life' on Mars in the next 20 to 30 years.

Speaking out last year, he said: “Starship is the first rocket that has the potential to make life multi-planetary, make us a multi-planet civilization for the first time in the history of Earth and that's truly profound.”

The billionaire added: “We are going to be able to take astronauts to Mars, in fact we want to take anyone who goes to Mars and ultimately build a self-sustaining civilization on Mars.

“That is the long-term goal of the company, to make life multi-planetary.”

SpaceX anticipates that Starship will have the ability to travel 140 million miles to the Red Planet in a journey time of six months.

It is also hoped that it will be capable of refueling there before making the return trip.

This will be done by ‘leveraging Mars' natural H2O and CO2 resources to refuel on the surface of Mars'.

According to the SpaceX site: “Mars is about half again as far from the Sun as Earth is, so it still has decent sunlight. It is a little cold, but we can warm it up.

“Its atmosphere is primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other trace elements, which means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","“Enough to Let the Light In” Brings Drama, Supernatural to Silver Spring Stage","https://www.sourceofthespring.com/silver-spring-news/2895948/enough-to-let-the-light-in-brings-drama-supernatural-to-silver-spring-stage/","Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:00:23 GMT","

Silver Spring Stage presents the local debut of “Enough To Let the Light In,” a 2022 play by Paloma Nozicka that blends human drama with the supernatural. Director Rob Gorman explores the play's complex themes in a recent Q&A, highlighting its psychological twists and chilling, suspenseful conclusion.

Source of the Spring: This play has only two characters. Tell us a little about each of them.

Rob Gorman: Cynthia is played by Katherine Leiden. She's an artist who had a thriving career until something we about learn through the play, some event happened, that made her, essentially, retire from producing art. She was a high-powered artist, and she's now working at art store.

Marc, who is played by Shampa Basu, is a psychiatrist. She met Cynthia on a dating app. The play begins when they have been dating for about six months.

Source: The play is set on an important night for their relationship, a declaration of greater seriousness and commitment.

Gorman: Yes, and it also contains a lot of secrets. It seems to start pretty straightforwardly, but we learn at least one of these characters is holding a number of secrets she wants to reveal but is struggling to reveal. One of the things that makes the play so fascinating [is] we see the other sides of the person come out, and they come out in oblique ways, like when they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Cynthia has a reason to want to play, to reveal something, but it does not work out how she hopes.

So we learn a lot about them right from the start, but then the onion starts to peel back and we learn much more.

Source: Do you see Cynthia or Marc as driving more of the action than the other? Or are they basically equals?

Gorman: I do see Marc as the one who is, to some extent, driving the relationship. She very much loves Cynthia and she sees in Cynthia hope for her future, for having love in her future. She wants so desperately to lock that in.

Cynthia is more reserved and reactive. I guess Marc takes a little more of the traditional role of the pursuer and the one who has a protective aura about her. Cynthia at least on the surface comes across as a little more reactive and fragile, in a sense. But she's very, very resilient and very strong and capable.

Source: Why did you pick each of the actors for their roles?

Gorman: I considered Shampa for both parts (I think she knows this!) because she has the range. Marc's character can be serious and professional and controlling, with a maternal vibe to her. But she can also be very light and smiley and fun, and she brings a sense of joy. It's hard to find someone who can bring that entire range.

I've seen Katherine [Cynthia] in other shows. She has a magnetic personality on stage and a great stage presence. I'm extremely fortunate in real life that she is an artist and [that experience] resonates with her character in ways I had not guessed before casting her. She brings some lived experience that is unteachable.

Source: There are a lot of conflicts in the play between these two obviously loving people. To name a few, there's belief or disbelief in God; the value or lack thereof of counseling and psychological therapy; high career ambitions vs. giving up a career; and their versions of reality. Pick one and tell us how you see it.

Gorman: To me, the biggest conflict in the play – and it's one that I think is relatable to people, especially these days – is when one person expresses a belief in what somebody else finds unbelievable. This happens so often in today's society, whether about a political conviction, or how life works, or religion, or whatever other issue. The other person says, not only do I not believe that, but I don't even know if I can connect with you as a human any more because of the things you are telling me you believe.

Source: In this play, that belief on the part of Cynthia is really unusual.

Gorman: The conflict comes when you love someone tremendously and think you know them, and they reveal something about themselves that is so true to their core beliefs that it makes you rethink everything about them. How can you accept that person when they present something that you can't understand?

Cynthia is unwavering in her belief … but it seems completely impossible to Marc. It really makes Marc think, I love this person, but do I know them at all?

Source: The two characters are lesbians in a long-term relationship. You're a straight, married man directing this play. Did that cause any issues?

Gorman: When you come to Silver Spring Stage with a proposal, you come with a particular show, and you explain that you want to direct it, and why. Generally, if the play is selected, it's a package deal: the director and play. But they can accept the play and not the director, or the other way around.

With that said, the play-reading committee did ask me essentially that question. I told them I don't think it's about lesbians or the lesbian experience. Its core is not about being a woman with a same-sex partner. This play could have been about a straight couple, and Marc could have been a guy. It would be slightly different, not enormously.

“Enough To Let the Light In” is about all these other things. It's about belief. How do we respond when we think we know somebody, and we realize maybe we don't? And it's about trauma and how we process it. None of that is specific to the lesbian experience. It's about the humanity.

They say 80% of good directing is good casting. I'm very fortunate to be working with Shampa and Katherine, and I hope the experience has been equally positive for them.

“Enough To Let the Light In” debuts on Friday, January 23, and runs through Sunday, February 8. Tickets are $25-$28, including fees, and available online at ssstage.org.","{'href': 'https://www.sourceofthespring.com', 'title': 'sourceofthespring.com'}","other"

            Top Wall Street bankers during the Trump 2.0 era have tread carefully around the subject of politics generally and President Donald Trump specifically. The consensus has generally been: Smile and nod, stay in your lane, don't become a target.
    


            But when a Trump “affordability” proposal earlier this month targeted banks' profit engine, the mood shifted. Publicly and forcefully, Wall Street executives were telling Trump “no.”
    


            It's not going over well.
    


            On Thursday, the notoriously litigious president sued JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, alleging the bank improperly “debanked” Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol. Trump is seeking $5 billion in damages.
    


Trump sues JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon for dropping him as a customer after Jan. 6 attack



            Trump has previously threatened the suit, which was likely in the works for months. But, perhaps not coincidentally, its filing in Florida state court came one day after Dimon told a room full of powerful people at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Trump's proposal to slash credit card interest rates roughly in half would be “an economic disaster.”
    


            The White House referred questions about the case to Trump's outside counsel, Alejandro Brito. His law firm didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            Dimon's public critique breached what has become an unofficial, often uneasy, agreement among the leaders of Corporate America: Stay out of the Trump's way, even when his policies directly affect the bottom line.
    


            When Trump last spring rolled out steep global tariffs that threatened to sap corporate profits, executives stayed quiet. Ditto when Trump began going after the Federal Reserve, a body whose independence is vital for a stable business environment. Even when he started explicitly meddling in private companies, carving out a cut of revenue for the government from companies like Nvidia and Intel, no one spoke out.



Corporate America is silent as Trump abandons free-market principles



            Corporate America comes by its trepidation honestly. Since Trump's second term began a year ago, he and his administration have investigated, sued or brought charges against an array of perceived enemies, including media companies like CBS, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal. He threatened Apple with massive tariffs last year over a perceived slight from CEO Tim Cook, and Trump said he would block Exxon from entering Venezuela because Trump didn't like CEO Darren Woods' lack of enthusiasm during a meeting of oil executives earlier this month.
    


            Privately, some trade groups were drafting plans to push back against the Trump administration in defense of their business interests, people familiar with the matter told CNN at the time. But those plans were shelved, as members worried about inviting the ire of the White House.
    


            And CEOs across the board are “very alarmed” by the administration's attack on the Fed's independence, according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. Sonnenfeld and his research team found that 80% of the CEOs they surveyed believed Trump was not acting in America's best interest by pressuring Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. (Notably, that survey was conducted before the Department of Justice launched its criminal investigation into the bank and Powell.)
    


            But for Wall Street, the president seemed to finally cross a red line with the proposed 10% cap on credit card rates. In a Truth Social post on Jan. 9, the president, who is struggling to convince voters that Republicans care about the cost-of-living crisis, said the public will no longer be “ripped off” by credit card companies, which charge an average interest rate of 20% on card purchase.
    


Trump's affordability pledge strikes directly at the heart of Wall Street's profit engine



            Even though such a cap would probably need to come from Congress, the statement rattled Wall Street, prompting rare critical public statements from executives.
    


            “A rate cap is not something that we can support,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, on the bank's earnings call.
    


            Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan — no stranger to being publicly dressed down by Trump — said last week that a cap wouldn't have the effect Trump is seeking: “If you bring the caps down, you're going to constrict credit, meaning less people will get credit cards and the balance available to them on those credit cards will also be restricted.”
    


            But Dimon's “economic disaster” statement at Davos was a more direct critique, coming from the most prominent figure on Wall Street, and someone who has had a rocky personal relationship with Trump.
    


            Trump and Dimon have had an uneasy relationship for years.
    


            In 2018, in a comment Dimon almost immediately walked back, the Wall Street titan told a panel at the bank's headquarters that he “could beat Trump” in a head-to-head presidential race “because I'm as tough as he is, I'm smarter than he is.
    


            Trump responded online, calling Dimon “a poor public speaker & a nervous mess.”
    


            Dimon's approach to the president during his second term has been far more measured. In his Davos interview, Dimon said he disagreed with some of Trump's policies, agreed with others, but largely avoided a question about why he and other CEOs have been so unwilling to stand up to the president.
    


            He may have seen the writing on the wall. After a tepid statement on JPMorgan's earnings call disagreeing with Trump's credit card rates plan (“it would be dramatic on subprime”) and his criminal investigation of Powell (“not a good idea”), Trump called out Dimon publicly.
    


            “Jamie Dimon probably wants higher rates,” Trump said on January 15. “Maybe he makes more money that way.”
    


            Two days later, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had previously offered Dimon the Fed chair role, Trump announced he would sue.
    


            “There was never such an offer and, in fact, I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest,” Trump said on Truth Social.

FIFA has raised the bar for women's club football by unveiling a record-breaking prize pool for the first-ever FIFA Women's Champions Cup. The 2026 champions will earn USD 2.3 million, the highest single payout in the history of the women's club game, as the new intercontinental tournament makes its debut in London.

In total, nearly $4 million will be distributed among the six participating clubs based on performance. The two losing semifinalists will each receive USD 200,000, while Auckland United FC (New Zealand) and Wuhan Chegu Jiangda WFC (China PR), eliminated in the earlier rounds, will earn USD 100,000 each.

FIFA Secretary General Mattias Grafström said the prize structure reflects the organization's belief in the rapid growth of the women's club game and its commitment to making long-term, meaningful investments that elevate competitions worldwide.

The tournament will bring together the champion clubs from each confederation to determine the first women's intercontinental club champion. The final stage will take place in London, with the semifinals scheduled for Jan. 28, at Brentford Stadium.
