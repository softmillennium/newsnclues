Earlier this month, reports suggested that Nvidia has added SK hynix as a GDDR7 supplier for its RTX 50 series GPUs, after previously only sourcing from Samsung. On Chiphell, a user recently got their hands on a Gigabyte Gaming OC RTX 5070 Ti with SK hynix memory and found its overclocking potential similar to what we've seen from Samsung, via UNIKO's Hardware. While thermal and efficiency data are missing, this is nonetheless a positive indication. Each generation, Nvidia casts a wide net to broaden its memory supplier base, ensuring multiple options. This is a common approach with many products, especially SSDs, many of which often ship with revised controllers or NAND flash modules later in their lifecycle. This shouldn't impact the average consumer as Nvidia likely validates all memory chips to run at a minimum of 28 Gbps (or 30 Gbps for the RTX 5080), at defined power, voltage, and temperature settings. A user at Chiphell secured an RTX 5070 Ti from Gigabyte (SK hynix memory) earlier this week. hynix g7 oc tested by user michelelee.hynix g7 on 5070ti runs at 28gbps out of the box and it can be overclocked to 34gbps without problems.although bios for Samsung g7 can be flashed on cards that use hynix g7, the card will be bricked.user michelelee on chh shares his… https://t.co/T6Yn7LjL3J pic.twitter.com/77ZLbYJRfnApril 26, 2025 A common theory being put forward is that RTX 50 BIOS versions are memory vendor-dependent, so firmware for Samsung will not work on SK hynix-based cards, and conversely. Even though memory offerings from SK hynix, Micron, and Samsung are mostly comparable and rigorously validated by Nvidia, there have been slight inconsistencies in the past. Likewise, the overclocking headroom, voltage requirements for specific speeds, and thermals can differ between memory technologies, making it a bit of a lottery for enthusiasts and overclockers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell's diehard support for Donald Trump's election lies has landed him in multiple legal entanglements, including a case in Denver, where the pillow salesman is currently being sued for defamation by a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems. Eric Coomer, who previously worked for the election vendor, has accused Lindell of having defamed him with his paranoid rantings about the 2020 presidential election having been rigged against Trump. In a situation that is already adequately stupid, there is always room for things to get stupider, as this week it was reported that Lindell's lawyer was in hot water for having filed a legal brief that was written with generative AI. In a filing made this week, Wang sought to clarify why Kachouroff and Lindell's other lawyer, Jennifer DeMaster, had allowed such a disastrously unprofessional thing to happen. The brief that Kachouroff previously submitted was stuffed full of “nearly thirty” glaring errors, including, among other things, “citation of cases that do not exist,” court papers show. “Time and time again, when Mr. Kachouroff was asked for an explanation of why citations to legal authorities were inaccurate, he declined to offer any explanation.” According to the filing, Kachouroff previously claimed that the errors were the result of his own mistakes, stating: “Your Honor, I may have made a mistake and I may have paraphrased and put quotes by mistake. I don't think the quote is far off from what you read to me.” Now, however, Kachouroff has admitted that the reason there were so many errors in the brief is that it was generated by a chatbot. Wang has now given Kachouroff and DeMaster until May 5th to explain how this moronic bungling of legal practice came about. If they can't explain it sufficiently by then, Wang says the two attorneys will be referred for disciplinary proceedings for having violated the rules of professional conduct to which they're sworn.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Think about how many pirates do piracy because they think copyright is unethical, versus how many of them are data hoarders, or just want shit for free, or are reselling shady IPTV boxes on eBay. Then keep in mind how basically any free shit tends to be almost immediately abused by children with an Internet connection and no access to payment rails.Homebrew scenes seem like a candidate for doing things "the right way", but culturally they're a lot closer to piracy scenes than anyone wants to admit, at least in front of a court. I would guess one of three cases:- They didn't want to respect the GPL, because they thought their library would be less popular if it were GPLed. For instance, they just pointedly didn't care about copyright at all, which is a very different position than just not caring about code being proprietary. (I can respect the position of "we're ignoring the copyright on this old game, so that we can do some awesome modding/romhacking", which is very different than ignoring Open Source licenses and failing to even give credit. I don't see the former as hypocrisy; it's just "we should be able to hack on anything". Console game modders / romhackers / etc tend to have a huge amount of respect for the original game and its authors, and give due credit, even if they're technically violating copyright.)

For context, The Homebrew Channel itself was one of these projects. fail0verflow had put shittons of work into DRM for the Channel and its installer... purely so that you couldn't remove an anti-scam warning screen that they'd put in there to warn people about shady people trying to sell The Homebrew Channel.Thing is, GPL requires you to explicitly allow that behavior[0], so HBC can't use GPL software.

LibOGC accepts donations via Patreon, which means -- if the allegations are true -- they're profiting off stolen code. RTEMS could and should sue for damages.This isn't the first time I've seen an open source project stolen by someone trying to pass it off as their own work while accepting Patreon donations. I'd like to see some justice every now and then... This isn't the first time I've seen an open source project stolen by someone trying to pass it off as their own work while accepting Patreon donations. What they should do is add attributions and fix their licensing (libogc needs to be GPLv2), or remove the code. You can't violate the terms of a contract while still benefiting from it.I don't know how much was stolen here, but if it's foundational enough to the project that HBC had to give up development, then they might have a case, but IANAL. Not doing anything though would mean letting them get away with their ill-gotten gains (again - if true), and I just don't think that's right.

Not doing anything though would mean letting them get away with their ill-gotten gains (again - if true), and I just don't think that's right. Considering attribution was removed, I doubt it was approved, but it's not impossible that they somehow learnt and decided not to care as enforcement can be unreasonably cumbersome. One can easily find a bazillion of "github repos" that distribute what is evidently directly decompiled game code with minimal cleanup. Bonus points if they also claim it is OK as long as the game art is not distributed, which in addition to being wrong is disrespectful to developers as a whole.But when the Nintendo copyright czar wakes up, they're the bad guys... Note that e.g. copyright does not apply to decompiled source code (the original authors did not write the decompiled source, unlikely assets taken verbatim - maybe that's where the arguments you mention stem from - although note that there may be regional regulatory differences). Though, the spectrum between copy-pasting HexRays output verbatim and rewriting things yourself is fairly large. devkitpro needs to be shamed for knowingly shipping stolen code! Commit 3ba50ec which Marcan is complaining about was pushed in 2008 and didn't just delete attrib specifically, but all (?) "The authors of libogc didn't just steal proprietary Nintendo code (...)  ignorance about the copyright implications of reverse engineering Nintendo binaries" ---> AFAIK it's software RE work, and nothing done in the console hacking scenes is truly cleanroom at all, and there's no point to it either as Nintendo can knock&talk and/or send strongly worded letters when they please, legality be damnedI don't know much about the Wii scene specifically, and libogc seems to be a mess in general, but what I do know is that libctru (3ds)/libnx (Switch) don't have that drama nor made the mistakes made in libogc "The authors of libogc didn't just steal proprietary Nintendo code (...)  ignorance about the copyright implications of reverse engineering Nintendo binaries" ---> AFAIK it's software RE work, and nothing done in the console hacking scenes is truly cleanroom at all, and there's no point to it either as Nintendo can knock&talk and/or send strongly worded letters when they please, legality be damnedI don't know much about the Wii scene specifically, and libogc seems to be a mess in general, but what I do know is that libctru (3ds)/libnx (Switch) don't have that drama nor made the mistakes made in libogc I don't know much about the Wii scene specifically, and libogc seems to be a mess in general, but what I do know is that libctru (3ds)/libnx (Switch) don't have that drama nor made the mistakes made in libogc There's a wide gradient of how much effort people put into reverse engineering consoles in a legal way vs. just copying code straight from their decompiler and slapping an open source license on it. libogc is very much on the "didn't even try" side of that gradient, it's been known since pretty much forever, and even their documentation is straight up copied from Nintendo's SDKs for part of their libraries.What's new here is discovering that even the parts people thought were developed "fresh" and not just straight-up asm2c'd from Nintendo are actually stolen from other open source projects in a way that tries to conceal the origin of the code.Whether you'll find that "more morally reprehensible" or not will largely depend on your personal morals, but clearly for some people that seems to be the case...

With summer just around the corner, more and more individuals are turning to portable power stations: They're ideal for camping trips, van life, or any outdoor activity where you need electricity. Yet these devices aren't just for summer-they're a lifesaver when winter storms cause the power to go out and you've got a Bluetti. Currently, the Bluetti AC180 is listed on Amazon at a record-low price: thanks to a $250 coupon, the heavy-duty station goes for only $449-a whopping 60% below its initial summer 2023 launch price of $1,149. You can also get the Bluetti AC180 and 200W solar panels for 699$, down from the original $1,599 price (our favorite deal, but slightly more expensive). The Bluetti AC180 is one of the best available portable power in the crowded market, and for several reasons: At its core is a robust 1,152Wh battery which known for both its safety and longevity. LiFePO4 technology ensures the battery can withstand over 3,500 full charge cycles before dropping to 80% capacity which makes it far more durable than many competitors that rely on standard lithium-ion cells. Four AC sockets allow you to plug in multiple high-demand devices at once while a plethora of USB-A, USB-C, 12V car, and wireless charging points offers compatibility with just about anything you'd need to power. Charging the Bluetti AC180 is also fast: Through standard AC charging, you can fill it from zero to 80% in just 45 minutes with a full fill-up in about an hour-ideal for those last-minute preparations to depart or in case of an unexpected outage. Moreover, it weights in at around 16 kilograms and with a compact design so it is easy to shift around and stow whether you are putting it in the car for a weekend away or keeping it on hand at home in case of unexpected outages. The unit is silent in its operation so it is a far more pleasant companion than noisy gas generators, and it produces no emissions. Bluetti is one of the most popular brands on the market, and seeing this 60% discount (on both options) is a great opportunity. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI chatbots available on Meta's platforms like Facebook and Instagram can engage in sexually explicit conversations with underage users, according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ says that after learning about internal concerns about whether the company was doing enough to protect minors, it spent months conducting hundreds of conversations with both the official Meta AI chatbot, as well as user-created chatbots available on Meta platforms. In another conversation, the chatbot imagined a police officer catching Cena with a 17-year-old fan and telling him, “John Cena, you're under arrest for statutory rape.” A Meta spokesperson described the WSJ's testing as “so manufactured that it's not just fringe, it's hypothetical.” The company estimated that in a 30-day period, sexual content accounted for 0.02% of responses shared via Meta AI and AI studio with users under 18. “Nevertheless, we've now taken additional measures to help ensure other individuals who want to spend hours manipulating our products into extreme use cases will have an even more difficult time of it,” the spokesperson said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This feature warns you of minute changes in your GPU's placement. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Asus's flagship GPU line, the ROG Astral, recently received a new feature called Equipment Installation Check that allowed users to check if their expensive graphics card is still securely attached to their motherboard. Reviewers missed this feature because it wasn't available at launch, but we spotted it being discussed on Reddit earlier in the month, and Uniko's Hardware (machine translation) subsequently looked more closely at the feature - which arrived via the GPU Tweak utility after a recent update. The ROG Astral uses a Bosch Sensortec BMI323 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) chip, which allows it to detect any changes in its position. Because of this, the GPU Tweak utility can then detect any changes to your graphics card's position, helping you prevent GPU sagging. Many manufacturers have started introducing reinforced PCIe slots to help prevent these heavy add-in boards from damaging their premium motherboards. Despite that, it's still often not enough to support the stresses these lengthy GPUs put on such a small area, leading to long-term mechanical strain. Most hefty GPUs come with a support bracket in the box to address this issue, while a few other companies introduced screw holes on the other side of the graphics card that secures them to compatible VGA holders. You can also get a generic bracket, which are widely available online. After all, most users rarely move their desktop PCs, meaning any changes in the GPU's position are likely unwanted. This, alongside other features like Power Detector+, which measures power distribution on the 12V cables, and Thermal Map, which uses temperature sensors strategically placed around the GPU's board to monitor hotspots, is likely one of the reasons why the Asus ROG Astral is such a heavy and expensive GPU. All of these might be too much for some users, but if you dropped around $3,000 or more for an RTX 5090 GPU, you likely want to get every protection for your four-digit investment.

Amazon is shaking up the market this weekend with aggressive price drops on Apple's newest devices, ignoring tariffs and slashing prices to unprecedented levels-even on Black Friday or Prime Day. If you've been waiting for the perfect moment to upgrade your tablet, this is it: Amazon is offering the new 11-inch iPad (A16 chip, 128GB, Wi-Fi 6) for an incredible $299-a record low price (original price : $349) that beats the previous best deal of $319 by a wide margin. The chip's advanced Neural Engine and machine learning capabilities make quick work of everything, whether editing 4K video or multitasking. This iPad is built to keep pace with your work and entertainment demands, all while offering all-day battery life. You will also love the latest 11-inch Liquid Retina display which delivers vivid colors and sharp details which is pefect for streaming movies or photo editing. Apple has also enhanced the user experience with iPadOS which brings multitasking, natural gestures and support for essential accessories like the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and Magic Keyboard Folio. Touch ID is also integrated into the top button for convenience so that you can unlock your device, log in to apps and make secure payments with Apple Pay. The cameras are also a lot better than in the past and this iPad is featuring a 12MP front camera with Center Stage for dynamic video calls and selfies along with a 12MP wide rear camera with True Tone flash for document scanning or capturing high-quality photos and 4K videos.

Deals on brand-new Apple hardware like this do not appear every day… Such discounts on brand-new Apple products are unheard of even during Amazon's biggest shopping events. Apple products are infamous for holding their value and very rarely seeing significant price cuts outside of special events so this sale is a great buying opportunity.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The UK Foreign Office has implemented a ban on game controller exports to Russia, reports BBC News. We hope that the ban will at least narrow the options available to Russian drone pilots attacking Ukraine and its people. Among the freshly banned items are other electronic products and components that might also be repurposed by the Russian military, as well as a broad range of chemicals, machinery, and metals. "Gaming consoles will no longer be repurposed to kill in Ukraine," said Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty. "Putin thought he could use British markets to boost his war effort, buying harmless goods and turning them into tools of war - but the UK is exposing and acting on this sinister trade." Doughty signaled that the new sanctions would “degrade Russia's military machine.” Taking a step back, it seems likely that Russia-friendly nations like China will find it easy to fill any latent demand precipitated by the UK's new measures on game controller exports. Some might therefore look at this particular sanction as a symbolic one. Nevertheless, if the change can impact Putin's aggression against Ukraine in any way, and save even one life, we can't criticize the new measure(s). PC and games console-originated technology has played a surprisingly important role in the war in Ukraine, as have technologies like drones and 3D printing.

If a Transformers toy existed for grown women, it would be Parallelle's Traveller series of toiletry bags. Ribbed on the outside like Optimus Prime's boots, the Traveller looks like a typical (albeit stylish) makeup bag on the outside, but peer inside and you'll see a warren of different-sized pockets and loops and adjustable dividers. When you're done, flip the sides up, pull the zippers back to the top, and it's back to being a travel bag, sturdy and secure enough to toss in a suitcase sideways or even upside down. She liked to take a SoulCycle spin class before work, but found herself either forgetting her makeup and toiletries, being unable to find them in her bag, or having to lay out all her items on the communal counter. “When I started designing the Traveller, structure was key,” Fan says. “It needed to function like a portable vanity—keeping everything visible, secure, and exactly where you need it, without the need to unpack.” As for the design procedure, it was a matter of constant fine-tuning. "Every detail had to be carefully considered, from the flexibility of the layout to how everything stays organized and accessible,” Fan says. Today, there are now four sizes of Traveller, all with the same sturdy, vegan leather and water-resistant cotton exterior. All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. Each of the pockets is the perfect size for anything from travel toiletry bottles and hair elastics to makeup and a travel container of dry shampoo. I was even able to fit a few Cadence Capsules into the divided compartments, regardless of how full the pockets were. The marks are no more difficult to remove than with any other makeup bag, but I'm often too tired to clean my makeup brushes every single day when I'm traveling, so it would be nicer to have an easier-to-wipe-clean surface. This wasn't easy when it was full, especially in the case of the Brush version when it contained full-size products. In fact, with the Brush bag I just gave up and carried it from the bottom, which is gross with a bag that has gotten damp from sitting on a bathroom counter. But this is a pretty small nit to pick. Still, this is the best makeup bag I have ever used. I love that it can hold different sizes of products, and that small things like bobby pins and small rubber bands won't get lost. It's also a plus that the 4.5-inch-wide (for the Medium) base is narrow enough to fit on most surfaces, whether a cluttered hotel bathroom counter, car's center console, or gym locker room bench. But most of all, the winning feature for me is being able to see everything I packed lined up neatly and visible at a glance. “I love how easily the Traveller unzips and folds open,” she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. For computer scientists, solving problems is a bit like mountaineering. Classical and quantum researchers compete using different strategies, with a healthy rivalry between the two. This contest almost always ends as a virtual tie: When researchers think they've devised a quantum algorithm that works faster or better than anything else, classical researchers usually come up with one that equals it. Just last week, a purported quantum speedup, published in the journal Science, was met with immediate skepticism from two separate groups who showed how to perform similar calculations on classical machines. But in a paper posted on the scientific preprint site arxiv.org last year, researchers described what looks like a quantum speedup that is both convincing and useful. The researchers described a new quantum algorithm that works faster than all known classical ones at finding good solutions to a wide class of optimization problems (which look for the best possible solution among an enormous number of choices). Reports of quantum algorithms get researchers excited, partly because they can illuminate new ideas about difficult problems, and partly because, for all the buzz around quantum machines, it's not clear which problems will actually benefit from them. A quantum algorithm that outperforms all known classical ones on optimization tasks would represent a major step forward in harnessing the potential of quantum computers. But at the same time, he cautioned that it's still quite possible researchers will eventually find a classical algorithm that does just as well. The algorithm might inspire new work on the classical side, according to Ewin Tang, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who came to prominence as a teenager by creating classical algorithms that match quantum ones. The new claims “are interesting enough that I would tell classical-algorithms people, ‘Hey, you should look at this paper and work on this problem,'” she said. When classical and quantum algorithms compete, they often do so on the battlefield of optimization, a field focused on finding the best options for solving a thorny problem. What's the best way for a delivery truck to visit 10 cities in three days? Classical methods of solving these problems, which often involve churning through possible solutions in clever ways, quickly become untenable. You need to come up with a mathematical function that passes through these points. This gives you a curved line that wiggles up and down as it moves across the page. Variations of this problem show up in various forms across computer science, especially in error coding and cryptography—fields focused on securely and accurately encoding data as it's transmitted. When the researchers behind DQI started working on their algorithm, they didn't even have this problem in mind. “It would have been entirely plausible for a goal-oriented researcher to start by stating the problem and then investigating whether quantum algorithms could solve it faster than classical algorithms,” said Stephen Jordan, a physicist at Google Quantum AI and one of the main architects of DQI. We came upon it by a backward and circuitous route.” Stephen Jordan helped come up with a quantum approach to certain problems that works better than any classical approach—so far. Jordan embarked on that route in 2023, when he joined Google and found out he'd be working with Eddie Farhi, a physicist at Google whose work has long focused on quantum algorithms that outperform classical ones. (Farhi was once Jordan's doctoral adviser at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.) Jordan knew that in 2014, Farhi had made a quantum attack on an optimization problem by thinking of energy, with lower energies corresponding to better solutions. He turned to another concept built into quantum physics—recognizing everything as waves. In doing so, he could manipulate the quantum system so that bigger waves (in the form of higher quantum amplitudes) corresponded to better solutions. But there was still a huge challenge that had to be overcome. By translating an optimization problem into a quantum one, and then applying the decoding lens to it, he had stumbled into a new way to develop quantum algorithms. Together with Noah Shutty, also at Google, Jordan began testing decoding schemes, seeing how they fared against classical algorithms on various optimization problems. They needed both the right approach and a problem where it worked. “It turns out classical algorithms are hard to beat,” Jordan said. “After a few months of trying, we still had not notched up any wins for quantum.” But eventually, the pair landed on a decoding algorithm first introduced in the 1960s to find and fix individual errors in an encoded message. “Maybe there is some classical method that can efficiently replicate your entire approach,” Jordan said. To assuage those fears, they consulted with Mary Wootters, a coding theory expert (and Shutty's former doctoral adviser at Stanford University). She carefully searched for any known classical algorithm that might match their quantum speedup. The team's checks likewise suggest that it will continue to hold. Jordan had worried that it might be too niche, with no wider applications, but Shutty recognized that this decoding problem was a variation of well-known and useful problems in encryption and other fields. “DQI cannot run on present-day quantum computers,” he said. So far, Jordan said, he expects that DQI can beat classical algorithms in those problems, too. “Finding quantum algorithms that show an advantage over classical algorithms is a very exciting endeavor of the last three decades, and the number of definite algorithms that show such an advantage is not large,” Kalai said.
