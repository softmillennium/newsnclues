Content creator and actress Sahiba Bali, who starred in Imtiaz Ali's Chamkila alongside Diljit Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra, recently opened up on Instagram about a chilling paranormal experience in Egypt that left her 'shook' after her gifts mysteriously disappeared overnight.  In the video, the actress showed a table where she had placed souvenirs brought back from Egypt — including dates, pieces of jewellery, a small tomb figurine, and a crystal fragment — and explained how they suddenly went missing.

Sharing the 'freaky' incident, Sahiba took to her Instagram story and was heard saying, "I am not someone who necessarily believes in paranormal activities or ghosts but I do believe in energies and it's so weird. I don't know why I am sharing this but on top of this table (pointing at the table), I kept some gifts that I got from Egypt. There were some dates, jewellery, a tomb and a crystal."

Check out the video:

Further, Bali explained that the tomb symbolised death, and the crystal, which was part of a pyramid also representing death, was placed on the table that night. However, when she woke up the next morning, the items were gone, despite no one entering her room and her never leaving it.

"I kept everything here and the dates and random jewellery is there but the two things that are not there are the tomb and the crystal," added the actress.

A post shared by Sahiba Bali (@sahibabali)

"That is extremely freaky," concluded Sahiba.

On the work front, Sahiba was last seen in the second season of Sudhir Mishra's Tanaav.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bassett says he believes it is clear the Catholic Church knows about UFOs - and likely has documented evidence hidden in their archives. He insists "extraordinary" information sits locked away in the Vatican Library - collected from millions of confessions reporting strange sightings or close encounters. It comes after Pentagon whistleblower David Grusch claimed Italy had uncovered a UFO during Mussolini's reign in 1933. “I do not think that the next pope is going to be selected on the fact that he's a pro ET. The remarks come ahead of Pope Francis's funeral, which took place on Saturday following his death at the age of 88. Cardinals from across the world will soon gather in Rome to elect a successor. But whoever wears the white cassock next, Bassett believes UFO truth-seekers shouldn't hold their breath for a Vatican revelation. He claims the church has quietly gathered UFO-related information over centuries. Bassett said: "Millions of Catholics over the last 800 years bringing every rather unusual encounter they had to the priests... where do you think that information is gonna go? Bassett said: "It is a matter of national security... this is not the Pope's job to come out and say, ‘I can confirm today this is in fact advanced technology non-humans.' "That's why it has to begin with a single head of state, which I believe is going to be Donald Trump,” he said. "He may be the president that ends this truth embargo, and it will be one of the greatest political legacies of all time for anyone. This issue is bigger than your political dislikes." Millions of Catholics over the last 800 years bringing every rather unusual encounter they had to the priests... where do you think that information is gonna go? Bassett points to Trump's declassification of JFK files as proof that UFO documents could be next. "It started getting JFK papers... which means that their commitment to get the other things, such as the UAP stuff, is being well established.” Last year, whistleblower Grusch told a Congressional hearing that the US possesses fully intact and pieces of "craft" of "non-human origin". And the former Air Force intelligence officer claimed to NewsNation that Italy had uncovered one of those UFOs in the 1930s. He claimed that the then-Pope Pius XII had "backchannelled" it to US president Franklin Roosevelt who "ended up scooping" up the craft. Bassett said investigation was going to be needed into the claims. But it would prove the US government knew about extraterrestrial life long before the famous Roswell incident in 1947, he said. And he doesn't doubt that Grusch claim could be true. Basset said years of political groundwork, whistleblower testimony, and growing public interest have created a perfect storm for disclosure – a formal acknowledgement that aliens are real. "I have never seen a president more likely to act in a much more independent way than President Trump," Bassett said. “The Catholic Church can step in and say, ‘God's universe is far greater than we thought. "And of course, if you're troubled by any of this, feel free to come to your priest and talk about it." As preparations get underway to choose the next Pope, Bassett's message is clear: don't look to the balcony at the Vatican for UFO truth – look to Washington.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charisma has been linked to electoral victory (just ask Bob Hawke), but defining it can be difficult For all the gen Z slang that has been thrown around by politicians in recent months, one term has been largely absent from the election campaign: “rizz”. Oxford University Press's 2023 word of the year is defined as “style, charm or attractiveness”; in gen Z parlance it refers specifically to romantic appeal. Bob Hawke, Australia's longest-serving Labor prime minister, had it in spades. As does – depending on who you ask – Barack Obama, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. The German sociologist Max Weber is credited for the term charisma in its modern usage, which he defined as an individual “treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers. In the past, Weber's definition has been taken to mean that leaders intrinsically possess a preternatural je ne sais quoi – an interpretation that Alex Haslam, a professor of social and organisational psychology at the University of Queensland, takes issue with. We treat charisma as if it's a property or a thing that they possess, but it's clearly based on our relationship with them,” he says. Michael Platow, a professor of psychology at the Australian National University, agrees. “It's not something that you are born with,” he says. In Haslam and Platow's book, The New Psychology of Leadership, co-authored with Prof Stephen Reicher, they characterise charismatic leaders as those who are most successful in creating a sense of shared social identity – a sense of “us-ness”. Leaders must articulate not only their policies to voters, Platow says, but also “a vision of us collectively. Politicians try to place themselves at the centre of that ‘us'.” One way researchers measure charisma is simply to ask people what they think of someone. Ample evidence supports the idea that charisma is not a fixed, innate trait. Research has found that for a given description, a business executive is perceived as more charismatic if people are told the performance of their company improved. A linked phenomenon in politics is the incumbency effect: “If the economy is doing well or if other macroeconomic factors are good, then people like who is currently in office, because they basically attribute the success to that person,” says Lisa Lu, a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales, whose dissertation focuses on leadership and charisma. Success is only one ingredient in the secret sauce, however. One analysis of five Australian prime ministers from Gough Whitlam to John Howard, based on monthly public opinion polling, found that “Bob Hawke was the only one of the five to exhibit significant charisma; his approval rating was over 10 percentage points higher during his period of office than would otherwise have been expected by his economic or political performance.” Keating, it found, “was the least charismatic, by about the same margin”. Central to Hawke's public image was that of a quintessentially Australian beer-skolling, sports-loving larrikin. It is unsurprising, then, that a 2020 survey of political scientists and historians ranked Hawke first among Australian prime ministers for “communication effectiveness”, as well as his “relationship with the electorate”. “As we move into the election, watch how each candidate defines ‘us', how they position themselves as being the ‘prototypical' Australian,” Platow says. Perceptions of charisma are also bound up in factors an individual cannot change. How tall one is, for example: height is associated with greater charisma in male leaders, and US presidents have been much taller than the average American man. Some studies have found that followers attribute greater charisma to women than men, but Assoc Prof Jessica Flanigan has pointed out that these tracked perceived emotional intelligence rather than overall likability. “When I was growing up, you were presented with almost no plausible female candidates that we were encouraged to perceive as charismatic … I think that's different now.” Given charisma isn't innate, what should a leader desperate to increase their appeal do? Research co-authored by Haslam studied 48 heads of state who died in office between 2000 and 2013. “You can think of all the things they did for us,” he says. In life, charisma can be taught, other research suggests. The more charismatic candidate, as defined by their model, won 23 out of 24 US presidential elections they studied. Even a cursory survey of history's autocrats – Hitler and Mussolini among them – and cult leaders like Jim Jones reveals the dark side of charisma. As Lu says, charisma is “a tool that can be used for good or for bad … even if you can develop it in people, that doesn't necessarily mean everybody should.”</p>
