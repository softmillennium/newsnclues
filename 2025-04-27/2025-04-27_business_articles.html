Armed security personnel stand guard near ongoing roadwork in Aleppo, Syria on April 13.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar pledged to pay Syria's debt to the World Bank, removing one obstacle for the country's new leadership to receive funds from the international lender as it struggles to revive its war-hit economy.

The Gulf nations announced their commitment to pay off the roughly $15 million that's outstanding after high-level discussions on post-war Syria at the sidelines of the 2025 World Bank/International Monetary Fund spring meetings last week, as they seek to support economic recovery under the new government of President Ahmed Al-Sharaa. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China's Huawei Technologies is preparing to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, hoping to replace some higher-end products of U.S. chip giant Nvidia, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The Chinese company hopes that the latest iteration of its Ascend AI processors will be more powerful than Nvidia's H100, and is slated to receive the first batch of samples of the processor as early as late May, the report added. Reuters reported on Monday that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month. Huawei and its Chinese peers have struggled for years to match Nvidia in building top-end chips that could compete with the U.S. firm's products for training models, a process where data is fed to algorithms to help them learn to make accurate decisions. Seeking to limit China's technological development, particularly advances for its military, Washington has cut China off from Nvidia's most advanced AI products, including its flagship B200 chip. The H100 chip, for example, was banned from sale in China in 2022 by U.S. authorities before it was even launched. Nvidia declined to comment while Huawei did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, when Microsoft pulled the plug on planned data centers in Ohio last month, it added to questions about whether the nascent data center boom had already gone bust. A Wells Fargo report last Monday saying some data centers planned by Amazon Web Services were being reconsidered added to market anxiety. But the bust may have been over before it ever began. "We continue to see accelerated scaling of AI deployments across the data center market, with strong demand signals reinforcing both our near- and long-term growth," said Giordano Albertazzi, CEO of Ohio-based data center supplier Vertiv on an earnings call last week. Amazon and Nvidia both reaffirmed last week that the data center market remains strong. "There's been really no significant change," Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, said at a conference organized by the Hamm Institute for American Energy. "We continue to see very strong demand, and we're looking both in the next couple years as well as long term and seeing the numbers only going up." That doesn't mean the strategic thinking about how, where and when exactly to spend isn't changing as the AI market evolves and breakthroughs need to be digested. In the span of six weeks this year, China's DeepSeek burst onto the scene, President Trump's $500 billion AI-powered Stargate initiative was announced, and concerns over tariffs and trade wars roiled markets. "I think it is a temporary pause," Lynch added, noting that the project pipeline and its funnel remain significant and CBRE continues to execute deals. "I remain cautiously optimistic about future demand, particularly when you think of large AI training models," Lynch said. Microsoft had pledged a $1 billion investment in Ohio-based data centers in the same area where Intel has planned chip factories, but the timeline has slowed. "Microsoft bought up as much available leased data center capacity as it could in 2022-2024 and now has the visibility to eliminate some of these 'early-stage projects,'" UBS wrote. Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet CFO, described the cloud supply-demand environment as "tight" after its latest earnings on Thursday. "We could see variability in cloud revenue growth rates depending on capacity deployment each quarter," she said. "We expect relatively higher capacity deployment towards the end of 2025." The most significant players, he says, are not pulling back, with Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon planning to spend over $300 billion in capex this year-largely tied to AI infrastructure. "Rather than a bust, this is a reshuffling of the deck in an environment where power in particular, along with fiber, water, and land — are scarce and strategic," Carrafiell said. "We aren't even in the first inning yet," he said. Power is the lifeblood of data centers, but data centers aren't plug-and-play operations, requiring copious amounts of electricity for computing power and fans to keep the infrastructure cool. As generative AI adoption moves from early experimentation to enterprise-scale application, the need for low-latency, high-efficiency data centers near end-users will intensify, but it will take time for the right set of conditions to line up with the expected data center square footage. "New data centers are increasing in size so dramatically that the grid cannot keep up," said Allan Schurr, chief commercial officer of microgrid developer Enchanted Rock. Three years ago, a large data center was 60 megawatts — enough power to supply 20,000 homes, but now he says new data centers to support all the uses of artificial intelligence are requesting 500 megawatts or more. This rapid growth in electricity use is on top of new demand from manufacturing and the electrification of transportation, which together are weighing on supply and infrastructure. "This is why some utilities are quoting long interconnection wait times for data centers," Schurr said. "Utilities need to invest in new substations and may also need to expand transmission and generation, all of which takes time," he added. CBRE has seen data centers go from comprising 2% of its portfolio in 2022 to 10% in 2024, and Lynch expects that to keep growing, and power proximity is driving the current marketplace, as data center builders seek areas with access to plentiful power. Georgia, Texas, and Ohio all check a lot of the boxes builders are looking for, and if an area doesn't have the grid or infrastructure capacity, it needs to be able to scale up fast. "Having large power availability inside of 36 months is attractive to clients," Lynch said. Three percent of the world's power is now tied up in data centers, according to Datacenters.com. There is an important distinction to be made between the idea of a broader slowdown and some of the recent pauses enacted by major technology companies, according to McKinsey & Company senior partner Pankaj Sachdeva, who researches data center development and expects an ebb and flow. Tariff changes will introduce new cost pressures across AI and data center supply chains, particularly with critical mineral tariffs on the horizon. "These disruptions will elevate hardware costs, impact sourcing strategies, and require businesses to rethink their long-term procurement models," said John Archer, senior delivery principal and supply chain transformation Leader at Slalom Consulting. "Longer-term, a push towards geographic diversification, co-manufacturing in tariff-friendly regions, and deeper integration of AI-driven supply chain analytics can be expected to adapt to evolving trade policies," Archer said. One factor that hasn't changed is that compute power is currently expensive, and much more of it is needed for AI software and hardware, according to Suresh Venkatesan, CEO of POET Technologies, a publicly-traded company that develops power solutions for data centers. "The explosion in AI challenges data centers to find more efficient solutions because AI requires compute power in such volume that it's unlike anything we have ever witnessed," he said. "While one data center project may hit a wall, others are likely to spring up, because there is no indication of a slowdown in demand for connectivity," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global stock markets continue to be volatile, influenced by the news around wavering tariffs and trade tensions. While the Trump administration's relaxation of certain tariffs could provide some relief, the ongoing uncertainties and macro challenges might continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Given this scenario, investors can take cues from the recommendations of top analysts and pick some attractive stocks that have the ability to thrive despite short-term headwinds. With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. First on this week's list is financial services company Charles Schwab (SCHW), which offers a wide range of brokerage, banking, and advisory services through its operating subsidiaries. Following the upbeat results and a positive conference call, TD Cowen analyst William Katz raised his 2024-2026 earnings estimates. He also reaffirmed a buy rating on Charles Schwab stock and increased his price target to $95 from $88, saying, "SCHW remains our top pick." Katz noted that management's commentary was essentially bullish, highlighting positives like solid momentum in new business trends/demographics and operating leverage. He added that April started on a robust note for the company, thanks to strong trading, continued rise in client cash, relatively durable client margin balances, and likely solid net new assets (NNAs). The analyst believes that despite positive EPS revisions and ongoing market volatility, his model is still conservative when it comes to key drivers like NNAs/client cash. Katz sees the possibility for additional P/E multiple expansion, driven by robust/more consistent management execution, favorable organic growth dynamics, notable operating leverage, and rapid improvement in balance sheet flexibility. 323 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Next up is streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), which recently posted a significant earnings beat for the first quarter of 2025. Impressed by the Q1 print, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated a buy rating on NFLX stock and raised the price target to $1,150 from $1,025. Anmuth noted that on the offensive side, Netflix offered solid content in Q1 2025, with "Adolescence" and three films breaking into the streaming platform's all-time most popular list. On the defensive side, the analyst pointed out Netflix's subscription-based model, low churn, strong engagement and high entertainment value. While Netflix is not directly hit by tariffs, Anmuth noted that the company's shareholder letter and interview highlighted its commitment to international programming and production in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and the U.K. Overall, Anmuth is bullish on Netflix  stock due to several positives, including the expectation of double-digit revenue growth in 2025 and 2026, a continued rise in operating margin despite growth investments, and a dominant position in the streaming space. 81 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See Netflix Hedge Fund Trading Activity on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at Verra Mobility (VRRM), a provider of smart transportation solutions like integrated technology to help customers manage tolls, violations, and vehicle registrations and school zone traffic cameras. Recently, Baird analyst David Koning upgraded Verra Mobility stock to buy from hold with a price target of $27. He finds a tough macro environment as a good time to upgrade the stock, because he views "high-quality companies as less pressured by investors during tougher/uncertain times." While Koning acknowledged the potential impact of macro pressures on travel volumes, he is bullish on Verra Mobility due to its strong moat. Additionally, Koning emphasized the renewal of the New York City (NYC) contract, which accounts for nearly 16% of Verra Mobility's total revenue. The analyst also thinks that states/municipalities may require more cameras during a challenging macro environment to drive more ticket revenue. Koning expects Verra's EPS estimates to be largely intact in a market where the earnings estimates of many companies could be lowered. At a valuation of 15x the 2026 EPS estimate, the analyst finds Verra stock attractive, given that it is a high-moat business. 232 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even the strongest and happiest relationships can falter when seemingly small, frustrating habits are left unaddressed. They slowly pile up until, suddenly, their weight seems unbearable. Here are the five most common and annoying habits that I've seen destroy relationships: Instead of expressing their needs clearly, many people expect their partners to know exactly what they need, when they need it. But this is an easy way to set yourself up for disappointment. Psychologists refer to it as the "illusion of transparency," a cognitive bias where people assume that their emotions and desires are obvious to others, when they really aren't. And according to research, overestimating how much your partner knows about your internal thoughts can be harmful and lead to resentment, since communication is the foundation of a strong, healthy relationship. DON'T MISS: How to change careers and be happier at work In successful relationships, both partners create a safe place where they can each express their needs and wants without fear or shame. So instead of expecting your partner to pick up on cues, just spell it out for them: "It'd mean a lot to me if you helped with the dishes tonight." Healthy relationships can quickly turn sour when couples start tallying up each other's good deeds and missteps. Research shows that keeping track of who did what in a relationship — whether it's chores, favors or sacrifices — almost always results in indebtedness. This tit-for-tat mentality often gives rise to a transactional relational dynamic; kindness becomes a means to an end, and it loses all authenticity. While it isn't necessarily overt, research shows that passive-aggressive behavior often signals dissatisfaction and resentment, which is something that shouldn't be ignored in a romantic relationship. No one likes unsolicited advice, nor does anyone want to feel like they're being managed, especially in their own relationship. Relationship satisfaction plummets once a partnership starts feeling like a parent-child dynamic, which happens quickly once helpfulness morphs into perpetual backseat driving. One of the most negligent things a partner can do is to listen purely for the sake of preparing their next response, rather than actively listening. And if you aren't learning, exploring or absorbing yourself in what your partner is truly saying, research suggests you'll likely only come across as arrogant, not helpful. If any of these habits hit a little too close to home, don't panic. You're not doomed, and your relationship isn't broken beyond repair. Relationships take work, and that work often starts with catching yourself in the act, taking a breath and choosing a different way forward. So if you find yourself slipping into any of these patterns, or perhaps even getting annoyed by your partner exhibiting them: Talk about it, own it and try again.

Zimbabwe's central bank is again issuing gold coins it scrapped 10 months ago, a step it took to ramp up the bullion stockpile used to back up the local currency, the ZiG.

Minting of the so-called “Mosi-Oa-Tunya” 22-carat coins, named after the iconic Victoria Falls, was scrapped in July, central bank Governor John Mushayavanhu told Bloomberg in an interview at the time. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the average cost of a new car edging toward the $50,000 mark, affordable, basic transportation is becoming increasingly difficult for many Americans. Slate, a new EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, believes its new $25,000 pickup truck, which could cost less than $20,000 with tax credits, could help change that, its CEO, Chris Barman, told Business Insider. "There's a massive population of people out there when it comes to safe, reliable, affordable transportation; there just really aren't many alternatives for them," Barman told us in an interview ahead of the unveiling of the new EV this week. A $25,000 price point would mean achieving something the current EV sales king, Tesla, has been unable to do. Elon Musk has long teased consumers with the prospect of a $25,000 Tesla model, but there's no firm timeline for its release. Electric pickups are even more expensive, with prices exceeding $100,000 on models like the Ford F150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and Tesla Cybertruck. My first car was a 1984 Ford Ranger pickup, with a five-speed manual, manual windows, and no air conditioning," Barman said. Barman, who joined as CEO in May 2022, is a mechanical engineer by trade. She spent most of her career with Chrysler in product development, culminating in her role as Fiat-Chrysler Automotive's Vice President of Electrical and Electronics. For example, Barman explained that their EV has a key fob because the cheaper metal blade key is more of a hassle to use, especially at night, while the fancier passive touch-sensitive locks are more convenient but would have added too much cost. "That's just an example of how we went through system by system and talked about, and were really thoughtful about what it means to get the cost out of the vehicle," Barman said. By offering a basic, no-frills base model, which the company refers to as a "blank slate," the startup's business model is centered on letting the consumer decide what creature comforts they need in a vehicle and when they can afford it. "It gives freedom of choice to the owner of what accessories they would want to put on the vehicle, either at the time of purchase or over time, depending on their budget," Barman said. You can upgrade or personalize almost every part of the vehicle, except the battery pack, at any point during its service life. "It's a complete paradigm change in the car buying experience," she told us. This means an owner on a tight budget can start with the base truck, which has crank windows and no radio, and steadily upgrade and personalize the vehicle over time with different color wraps or upgraded infotainment. "It may be, they were single when they first purchased the truck, and they recently got married, and a few years later, they have, a family, and instead of having to exchange it out for a completely new vehicle, they can convert it into a five passenger SUV and continue to use the vehicle," Barman explained. This saves the consumer from having to sell or trade in a paid-for vehicle and generates additional revenue for Slate from a single sale. As vehicles become increasingly complex and expensive, Slate is becoming a rarity as one of the few manufacturers encouraging owners to work on their cars. This includes series hardware installs like adding power windows and even the SUV Kit, including rear seats, a roll cage, and airbags. "We would like to see what we can do to go into an existing facility that has been shuttered and reindustrialize and revitalize that community," Barman said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk said he's backing away from DOGE in May, but that doesn't mean the federal worker firings are over. While the first era of DOGE firings continues to face legal issues, the next set could be on stronger footing. That's because agencies have the chance to craft more methodical plans. In particular, many are offering buyout-like deferred resignation plans for workers to voluntarily quit in exchange for months of paid administrative leave. These methods could prove to be on a more solid legal footing than the first round of firings, which focused on new or newly promoted workers, cited low performance ratings, and did not provide notice. That round of cuts saw several snafus because, rather than targeting specific programs, DOGE simply removed many people who had been working for less than a year or two. That led to scenarios like workers who handle the nuclear stockpile or study bird flu getting fired and then ultimately rehired. It also faced legal issues, with a judge ordering in March that those workers needed to be reinstated. Going back to the drawing board with terminations means a chance to execute reduction-in-force plans, or RIFs, that follow proper procedures. "I think probably the courts have done a huge favor to DOGE by putting people back in their office until they can do a more well-calculated RIF," Michele Evermore, a senior fellow at the left-leaning think tank the Century Foundation, said. The White House and DOGE office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI. Over the past month, new RIFs have gone out. The Department of Education announced in March that it was terminating over 1,300 workers, slashing its workforce by 50%. The Small Business Administration said it would reduce its workforce by 43%. The Department of Health and Human Services had already started terminating employees as part of its plan to slash 10,000 from its workforce. Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement that the union would "pursue every legal avenue to stop this unprecedented attack on the very foundation of our national government." David Super, an administrative law professor at Georgetown Law, said that the plans may vary by department, and some could be more vulnerable to legal challenges than others. In lieu of RIFs, some agencies are choosing another acronym: DRPs. Some Social Security Administration employees have also received a DRP. Two internal emails at the Internal Revenue Service, viewed by BI, said that over 10,000 agency employees applied for the second round of the deferred resignation program and that further reductions in force are coming. While DRPs might help the government shed workers, the payout could end up being less than the severance provided in a RIF, said Alan Lescht, an employment attorney specializing in federal workers. "They're trotting this out to people who are being targeted for RIFs or could potentially be in a RIF. And, opting into a DRP means workers are giving up rights to their positions — essentially, forfeiting the ability to be reinstated. He suggests workers take a "deep dive" into their job prospects before opting out. "For many people, it may turn out that the best option is to stay and fight because the government has to satisfy a lot of requirements in order to justify a firing under the RIF rules," Lescht said.</p>
