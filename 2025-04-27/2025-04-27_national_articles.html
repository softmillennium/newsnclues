John Kennedy, R-La., weighs in on the state of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, why Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and whether the Trump administration is in compliance regarding the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. As Russia continues its warfare against Ukraine, one outspoken Republican senator is encouraging President Donald Trump to put Russian President Vladimir Putin in his place. His latest proposal is, well, nothing. He wants to keep all the territory that he's taken," Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said on the latest installment of "Fox News Sunday." Voters are also split over what to do when it comes to U.S. support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., didn't mince words on what President Trump should do to assert dominance over Vladimir Putin's Russia. More airstrikes from Moscow continued overnight in Ukraine following days of military fighting, around the same time as President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met face-to-face for the first time since their infamous Oval Office spat in February, as they were attending Pope Francis' funeral in Rome. "He has jacked around President Trump at every turn. I don't think it's gonna get any better until we make it clear to Mr. Putin that we are willing to turn him and his country into fish food." The day before, on Wednesday, Trump blasted Zelenskyy after he said that Ukraine would not recognize Russian control over Crimea, which Putin invaded in 2014. Putin so far has rejected several U.S. proposals for a peace deal, but the White House remains optimistic about Trump's ability to end the war. "We need to get Russia down and choke them. Europe's got to start paying its own bills." "If it wasn't for the American taxpayer, Putin would be in Paris right now. But mainly," he emphasized, "we've got to make Putin understand that there is a price to be paid for his jacking our president around." Fox News' Rachel Wolf contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One person is in custody and multiple additional arrests are expected in a theft ring recently targeting Washington, DC's, Penn Quarter area, the source said. “We have also determined that this incident had no protective nexus to Secretary Noem or her role as Secretary of Homeland Security. The investigation revealed alleged criminal activity, including potential device and credit card fraud,” McCool said. Noem thanked the US Secret Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a post on X on Sunday and described the man in custody as a “career criminal who has been in our country illegally for years.” “Unfortunately, so many families in this country have been made victims by crime, and that's why President Trump is working every single day to make America safe and get these criminal aliens off of our streets,” Noem wrote. As CNN previously reported, surveillance footage of the incident at The Capital Burger restaurant in Washington, DC, showed the suspect purposefully moving close to Noem as he zeroed in on her Gucci bag near her feet, a second law enforcement source said. The thief, dressed in dark clothing, sat down at an empty table next to Noem with his back facing her and used his left foot to slide the bag away, the source said. Items inside the bag included a Louis Vuitton Clemence wallet, Noem's driver's license, medication, apartment keys, passport, DHS access badge, makeup bag, blank checks, and about $3,000 in cash, multiple sources said. The Secret Service was inside the restaurant with Noem, who was dining at a table with her family, according to a source familiar. Commenting on the large sum of cash Noem was carrying immediately following the incident, a DHS spokesperson said: “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren – she was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities, and Easter gifts.” Law enforcement experts have raised concerns about whether the incident, which involved a thief getting so close to a Cabinet official and then absconding with her belongings, may have been a lapse in security. Secret Service “will maintain jurisdiction over the case and intends to present its findings to a federal court in coordination with the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia,” McCool said. This story was updated with comment from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. CNN's Samantha Waldenberg and Kit Maher contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The man suspected to have stolen Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's high-value Gucci bag from a restaurant in Washington, D.C., has been arrested. It is not believed that the suspect targeted Noem because of her role in the federal government. The theft is part of multiple purse robberies believed to be a theft ring recently targeting Washington, D.C.'s Penn Quarter. You could see how he scouted the room out,” Martin told the outlet. Authorities are looking for a second suspect who is also believed to be in the country illegally. Martin said Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now involved due to the man's believed illegal status. Noem was dining at the chain restaurant The Capital Burger last week when her purse containing $3,000 in cash, her passport, DHS access badge, Louis Vuitton wallet, apartment keys, and checkbook, was stolen. According to CNN, security footage of the theft showed the suspect moving close to Noem as he locked in on her Gucci bag near her feet. The man was dressed in dark clothing and sat down at an empty table next to Noem with his back facing her after surveying the restaurant. He then used his foot to slide the bag away.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once firmly in his corner, many Sunshine State Republicans have lately turned on DeSantis, stymying his agenda and frustrating him to no end. At the same time, Casey DeSantis, long regarded as a political force in her own right, is encountering quiet but firm resistance as she lays the groundwork for a potential run to succeed her husband — a campaign that would pit her against President Donald Trump's handpicked choice to lead the state, Rep. Byron Donalds. Lawmakers spent the spring investigating why $10 million from a state Medicaid settlement was routed to a charity connected to Hope Florida, which then transferred the same amount to two groups that financially backed a DeSantis-led campaign against legalizing recreational marijuana. Key lawmakers have publicly suggested the flow of money appears illegal. The couple have fiercely stood by their work and denied wrongdoing. DeSantis this week called the criticism of Hope Florida “all political.” Standing alongside her husband Thursday, Casey DeSantis characterized the program as “a philosophy” that “shows we can help people in need.” Remarkably, the investigation into Hope Florida was not by Democrats, but by Republicans — a striking sign of DeSantis' eroding clout in a state capital he once controlled with unchallenged authority. Donors, fundraisers and operatives are fleeing their orbit, and at the moment, few in Florida politics seem willing to sign up for another campaign with the couple. Multiple people have turned down positions in a potential gubernatorial campaign, according to two sources who remain in contact with the governor's remaining team. “These days, I can't tell the difference between being their friend and their enemy,” a longtime Republican operative once close to the governor told CNN. Even among their remaining allies, there is a growing sense that Casey shouldn't announce a bid until the cloud hanging over the couple is lifted, though few people are willing to share those sentiments directly with them. “It wasn't well received,” the person said, “and no one has tried to give them advice since.” As they mount a public defense, the couple is also privately engaged in an intensifying lobbying campaign to keep Trump's involvement in the Florida Republican primary to a minimum. Casey joined Trump for a round of golf and DeSantis was recently spotted playing with the president's son, Eric, at Trump National Doral Miami. But soon after these engagements, Donalds accompanied Trump to a UFC event in Florida – a joint appearance that signaled to many that the overtures from Ron and Casey had fallen short. A visibly exasperated DeSantis, watching Tallahassee allies drift away from him and his legislative priorities, recently asked aloud during a press conference: “Why the hell are they doing this?” Casey DeSantis launched Hope Florida in 2021 with a mission to wean people off government assistance by connecting them with faith-based and other charitable help in their communities. Eventually, Casey and Ron DeSantis would tout the program in other states as they campaigned for president as a one-two punch in 2023. Last year, the foundation saw its coffers boom by $10 million. The two organizations then sent $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a committee that spearheaded the successful fight last November against a ballot measure that would have amended the state constitution to legalize recreational marijuana. Keep Florida Clean was operated by James Uthmeier, the governor's chief of staff at the time who DeSantis later named Florida's attorney general. The committee could ultimately be used to support Casey DeSantis' political ambitions. State Rep. Alex Andrade, a Republican who led the House investigation, told CNN the money trail “looks very much like wire fraud and money laundering to me.” On Thursday, he announced his committee has concluded its work, but he has publicly encouraged law enforcement agencies to review the committee's findings. “I hope @PamBondi is paying attention,” Andrade wrote on X, tagging Trump's attorney general and former top prosecutor in Florida. DeSantis contended at an appearance earlier this month that the $10 million was separate from the state settlement and “kind of like a cherry on top, where they agreed to make an additional contribution.” Bryan Griffin, a spokesman for the governor, argued that neither Ron or Casey DeSantis has a role in the Hope Florida Foundation and said the state program “has been extremely successful and has helped 30,000 Floridians reduce or eliminate reliance on public assistance.” Her husband Carlos Vidal is the company president and CEO. Several of the foundation's top donors contributed to DeSantis' political committee as well, including Centene, according to tax documents and campaign finance records. And then there's Unite Us, a health technology company hired to build the web-based portal that connects people in need to local services. Nine days after the state executed the contract with Unite US, DeSantis' presidential campaign announced Coppola and Eagle would serve on his national finance committee. The state awarded the $3.9 million deal to Unite Us despite a track record of supporting initiatives that clashed with DeSantis' crackdown on progressive priorities, like promoting transgender rights and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The technology company's positions on those issues could provide Republican foes another attack line against Casey DeSantis tied to Hope Florida. In the past, Unite Us had publicly boasted on its website its commitment to diversity in hiring, gender neutral restrooms at its New York and Los Angeles offices and use of gender pronouns on internal communications. Days after Casey DeSantis barnstormed through Iowa in June 2023 sporting a custom-made leather jacket embroidered with the slogan “Where Woke Goes to Die,” Unite Us announced a workplace culture award, noting its DEI efforts and that most of its staff were women, non-binary and minorities. “In so many organizations, ‘diversity,' ‘equity,' and ‘inclusion' are just big-ticket buzz words,” said a quote on archived web page for Unite Us. “But at Unite Us, diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to our mission.” The webpage no longer appears to be operational. Miguel Nevarez, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said a team of negotiators for the contract unanimously selected Unite Us. Nevarez also noted that DCF has provisions in its contracts “that restricts the use of any state funds for the purpose of promoting, advocating for, or providing training or education on “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.” The contract with Unite Us specified that the portal could not “list categories or subcategories related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.” Close allies of Trump are gleefully watching the funding scandal unfold. Laura Loomer, a deeply devoted Trump ally and a regular DeSantis tormenter, has amplified the developments out of Tallahassee to her 1.6 million followers on X. Former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who remains close to Trump and is weighing his own gubernatorial run, has also seized on the controversy through his One America News program. DeSantis has responded with characteristically aggressive counter attacks and has accused Republican lawmakers of attempting to smear his wife for political gain. Let's just be clear about that,” DeSantis said at a press conference earlier this month. You're very worried because she runs circles around their people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pope Francis had a great sense of humor. When I met him once at the back of the papal plane, I cracked a joke with him that was a little bit close to the line. Luckily, he roared with laughter and told me “Sei cattivo!” (“You're naughty!”). Every day, he used to say, he prayed the words of St. Thomas More: “Lord, give me a sense of humor.” But he never took himself too seriously. One thing that struck me about him was his intuition and pastoral instincts. “Whenever they see a man in white, they think I'm a doctor and about to give them some medicine!” he joked. When he met bishops, he would get them into a circle and ask which one wanted to start speaking. It allowed him to understand the dynamics of a group, which helped him make appointments and decisions in the future. Francis liked to make himself accessible. He would say his door was always open – but that same door also had a sign on it that read “no whining.” There was never a dull moment covering his pontificate. As pope, he gave more media interviews than anyone else, but he never had a spokesperson or media advisers. Predicting his next move was notoriously difficult, and when it came to appointing new cardinals, no one knew in advance who he'd be choosing or when. New cardinals would talk about their phones blowing up in the middle of a Mass as people tried to contact them to tell them the news. He was a politically savvy pope, very decisive and often stubborn.</p>

With 1.8 seconds remaining, Nikola Jokić's airball appeared to signal that the game was headed to overtime with the scores tied at 99. But Gordon had other ideas, slamming the ball down with 0.1 seconds on the clock before wheeling away in jubilation. When it was announced that he had, the Nuggets' celebrations restarted in earnest, and boos rang out from the crowd at Intuit Dome.

So, I'm just trying to clean up everything on the glass. He shot it with enough time to give us a chance to rebound it,” the former Slam Dunk Contest finalist added. When James Harden was fouled by Christian Braun near midcourt, Harden began exchanging words with the Nuggets shooting guard. The resulting skirmish saw Gordon rush in and catch Norman Powell's face with an open hand. Despite Clippers fans chanting “Kick him out!” Gordon received a technical foul, along with Harden, Braun, Powell, Jokić and Kris Dunn. A free throw and a basket from Jokić made it 99-97, before Ivica Zubac appeared to send the game to overtime. Gordon's heroics ensured that would not be the case. Gordon finished with 14 points, six rebounds and five assists. Jokić led the scoring with 36 points, 21 rebounds and eight assists – in doing so becoming only the fourth player in NBA history to rack up at least 35 points, 20 rebounds and eight assists in a playoff game. Braun and Michael Porter Jr. each added 17 points for Denver, while Leonard led the scoring for the Clippers with 24 points, nine rebounds and two assists. Game 5 takes place in Denver on Tuesday night. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was back to his best after a difficult first three games in the series for the NBA MVP favorite, scoring 38 points.</p>

Fox News Digital spoke with Ari Lightman, a digital media and marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University, on Casey Anthony's latest venture on Substack. "America's most hated mom," Casey Anthony, is now raking in money in her latest lucrative venture as a subscription-based blogger. Anthony was accused of killing her two-year-old daughter, Caylee, in 2008 but was found not guilty in 2011. "It has been more than 16 years since my name became a household one," Anthony wrote in her Substack bio.

(Joe Burbank, Orlando Sentinel via Getty Images) In Anthony's case, subscription prices start at $10 a month and can climb as high as $250 per year. The subscription price will allow followers to interact with Anthony. The 39-year-old has over 5,000 subscribers to her Substack. Fox News Digital spoke with Ari Lightman, a digital media and marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University, on Anthony's latest venture. He emphasized how platforms like TikTok, which didn't exist during Anthony's trial, now allow public figures to reintroduce themselves to a new generation that is largely unaware of past controversies. "It's an opportunity for this person and this personality to do a refresh within the U.S. public and reinvent herself," he said. Lightman noted the rise in engaging in content that people are opposed to, also known as "hate clicking." "People enjoy hate-clicking on things or hate-reading and are fascinated with either the mystery or what they're up to now," he noted. Casey Anthony cries next to her attorney, Jose Baez (L), after she was acquitted on first-degree murder charges of her daughter Caylee at the Orange County Courthouse Orlando, Florida, July 5, 2011. On March 1, Anthony launched her TikTok account and quickly garnered thousands of followers. "This is my first of probably many recordings on a series I am starting," Anthony said in a March 1 video posted to TikTok. I have been in the legal field since 2011, and in this capacity, I feel that it's necessary if I'm going to continue to operate appropriately as a legal advocate that I start to advocate for myself and also advocate for my daughter." She continued: "For those of you who don't know, my name is Casey Anthony. My parents are George and Cindy Anthony. This is not in response to anything that they have said or done. "The question I would have is: Are we going to see this happen more and more often? This provides an example of people cashing in on their fandom. Does that imply that people will deliberately try to create fame — by any means necessary — whether positive, which is much harder to achieve, or through scandal, which is much easier?" Caylee Anthony was two-years-old when she vanished in June 2008. In 2008, Casey was charged with the murder of Caylee after the little girl was reported missing and later found dead in Orlando, Florida. The prosecution claimed that Casey had intentionally killed her daughter to free herself from parental responsibilities, while the defense argued that Caylee had accidentally drowned and that Casey's father had helped to cover it up. In 2011, after a highly publicized trial, Casey Anthony was acquitted of the most serious charges, including first-degree murder, but was found guilty on four counts of providing false information to law enforcement. The verdict sparked widespread outrage and debate, and Casey has remained a controversial figure ever since. Fox News Digital's Audrey Conklin contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The top United Nations court on Monday will begin hearing from 40 countries on what Israel must do to provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel over a month ago again cut off all aid to Gaza and its over 2 million people. Israel has disputed that there is a shortage of aid in Gaza, and says it is entitled to block the aid because it says Hamas seizes it for its own use. The Hague-based court has been asked to give an advisory opinion, a non-binding but legally definitive answer, in the latest judicial proceedings involving Israel and the 18-month war in Gaza. That is expected to take several months. All 193 U.N. member states are members of the ICJ, though not all of them automatically recognize its jurisdiction. Last year, the court issued an unprecedented and sweeping condemnation of Israel's rule over the occupied Palestinian territories, finding Israel's presence unlawful and calling for it to end. The ICJ said Israel had no right to sovereignty in the territories, was violating international laws against acquiring territory by force and was impeding Palestinians' right to self-determination. Two decades ago, the court in another advisory opinion held that Israel was violating international law by constructing a barrier between Israel and the West Bank. That opinion, also requested by the U.N. General Assembly, dismissed Israeli arguments that the wall was needed for security. South Africa went to the court last year to accuse Israel of genocide over its actions in the war in Gaza, which began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many are civilians or combatants. The offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble, and most of its people remain homeless. Israel rejects South Africa's claim and accuses it of providing political cover for Hamas. South Africa also asked judges to make nine urgent orders known as provisional measures. The court has ruled several times on that request, including ordering Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza. The International Criminal Court was established in 2002 as the court of last resort to prosecute those responsible for the world's most heinous atrocities: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. While the ICJ deals with disputes between two or more countries, the ICC seeks to hold individuals criminally responsible. In November, a three-judge panel issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas' military chief, Mohammed Deif, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the war in Gaza. The warrants said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and Gallant have used “starvation as a method of warfare” by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeted civilians in Israel's campaign against Hamas, charges Israeli officials deny. The warrant marked the first time a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the global court of justice and has sparked major pushback from supporters of Israel, including the U.S. However, Palestine is, and judges ruled in 2021 that the court had jurisdiction over crimes committed on Palestinian territory.</p>

Iran and the United States began in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, talks that likely will hinge on the Islamic Republic's enrichment of uranium.

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Iran and the United States held in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, ending the discussions with a promise for more talks and perhaps another high-level meeting next weekend. “This time, the negotiations were much more serious than in the past, and we gradually entered into deeper and more detailed discussions,” he said. “We have moved somewhat away from broader, general discussions — though it is not the case that all disagreements have been resolved. A senior U.S. administration official said that the talks were “positive and productive.” “This latest round of direct and indirect discussions lasted over four hours,” the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has mediated the two previous round of talks in Muscat and Rome, offered a positive note at the end of Saturday's negotiations. Iran and the U.S. “identified a shared aspiration to reach agreement based on mutual respect and enduring commitments,” al-Busaidi posted on X. “Core principles, objectives and technical concerns were all addressed. Talks will continue next week with a further high level meeting provisionally scheduled for May 3.” Meanwhile on Saturday, a major explosion rocked a port in southern Iran just after the talks began, killing 18 people and injuring some 800 others. Authorities offered no immediate cause for the blast, which appeared to have been caused by a highly combustible material — though officials ruled out its oil and gas industry. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. Trump, traveling to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, again said that he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't. “The Iran situation is coming out very well,” Trump said on Air Force One. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. He added: “There are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal — a much nastier deal — and I don't want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.” Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. The demand that all enrichment stop also has been repeated by Rubio. However, Iranians remain hopeful that the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows during which it took more than 1 million rials to buy $1. After all, we've suffered a lot for this program.”</p>

A Pennsylvania Air National Guardsman, once trusted with America's security, is facing federal charges after allegedly building explosives, promoting extremist violence and vandalizing a Jewish synagogue, all while lying about his loyalty to the U.S. A federal grand jury in Pittsburgh returned a nine-count indictment against three Pittsburgh-area residents, acting United States Attorney Troy Rivetti announced this week. Hamad and Lubit had previously been indicted for their roles in allegedly defacing Jewish religious property with pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel graffiti. According to an indictment, Hamad enlisted in the Air Force, Pennsylvania Air National Guard (PAANG) in 2023, joining the 171st Maintenance Squadron based near Pittsburgh International Airport. As part of his enlistment, he sought a top-secret security clearance. While undergoing his background investigation, including three in-person interviews, Hamad allegedly made a series of false statements, swearing his "ultimate allegiance" was to the U.S​. In reality, court documents show Hamad privately celebrated terrorist groups and expressed deep hostility toward America. In messages, he stated, "It's still Palestine on top though make no mistake," and "let America lick my a--." He declared that Lebanon and Palestine were "number 1" in his heart and said he wanted to learn combat skills to protect them​. Throughout late 2023 and 2024, while attending military training, Hamad allegedly shared violent pro-Hamas videos, glorified terrorist attacks and praised Hamas fighters as "freedom fighters," according to the indictment​. The indictment further alleges that, during this same period, Hamad conspired with co-defendant Collins to manufacture and possess destructive devices. One chilling conversation captured Hamad admitting he was "actually scared" of the bomb he built, while Collins excitedly discussed the potential to "take bros ankles." On social media, he openly posted images supporting Hamas operatives, expressed envy of jihadists killed in action and posted threats such as, "I can't wait until the day Muslims kill you. In a separate conspiracy, Hamad and Lubit allegedly targeted Chabad of Squirrel Hill, a synagogue and Jewish educational center in Pittsburgh. Wearing a Hamas-style headband, Hamad conducted surveillance of the synagogue. Lubit later allegedly spray-painted "Jews 4 Palestine" along with a red inverted triangle — a symbol used by Hamas to mark targets — onto the synagogue's exterior​. In this undated photo from court documents, defendant Mohamad Hamad allegedly posted a picture of an assault rifle on social media with a caption that said "each bullet in this mag[azine] kisses the foreheads of the Zionist oppressor," according to a federal indictment. Federal investigators later linked Hamad and Lubit to additional vandalism of a Jewish Federation sign nearby, further escalating community concerns about targeted antisemitic threats. "As alleged in the Superseding Indictment, Mohamad Hamad lied about his loyalty to the United States, among other false statements, in an attempt to obtain a Top-Secret security clearance," Rivetti said. "During that time, he openly expressed support for Lebanon, Hezbollah and Hamas." That includes all our communities," said FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek. He vowed the FBI remains committed to investigating individuals who engage in "dangerous, menacing and illegal activities." An image from court evidence shows a makeshift explosive device composed of spray paint cans and a fuse, allegedly manufactured by the defendants. Assistant U.S. attorneys Nicole Vasquez Schmitt and Carolyn J. Bloch are prosecuting the case with assistance from the Department of Justice National Security Division.
