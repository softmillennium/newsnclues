SZA's SOS scores a 13th nonconsecutive week at No. The album continues to profit from its expansive deluxe reissue on Dec. 20, 2024 (dubbed SOS Deluxe: LANA), with 15 additional tracks, in addition to a Feb. 9 reissue with four more bonus cuts. LAPD Releases Footage From Shooting Involving Jillian Lauren, Weezer Bassist's Wife SOS was originally released on Dec. 9, 2022, as a 23-track album and spent 10 weeks at No. All versions of the album, old and new, are combined for tracking and charting under the title SOS. With SOS earning 52,000 units in the latest tracking week, that marks the smallest weekly sum for a No. 1 album in over three years, since the April 23, 2022-dated chart, when Lil Durk's 7220 returned to No. We last had a top 10 absent of a debut on the Feb. 22-dated list, when the highest arrival was outside the top 40 (Dream Theater's Parasomnia at No. While there are no debuts in the top 10 on the latest chart, there is a title reaching the region for the first time, as Doechii's Alligator Bites Never Heal flies 24-10 following its wider availability on vinyl, as well as its first release on CD.

Alligator Bites Never Heal was released in 2024 as a 19-song album. It was reissued in March with one bonus track — the gone-viral breakout hit “Anxiety” — on “extended” digital download and streaming editions. All physical versions contain the original 19-song tracklist. Until April 18, the set was only available to purchase as a download and in two vinyl variants. On April 19, it garnered a wider availability on vinyl, including two new vinyl editions (both color variants) exclusively available via Target and Urban Oufitters, along with a widely available CD. “Anxiety” reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart dated March 29 (rising 13-10), marking Doechii's first top 10.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While paying tribute to director Francis Ford Coppola with the AFI Life Achievement Award, he and co-star Al Pacino reminisced about their time with the filmmaker on his seminal mafia film franchise. “Francis, thank you for not casting me in The Godfather,” said De Niro during Saturday's gala at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. “It was the best job I ever, never got. And it meant I was available for The Godfather Part II. Following Pacino's breakout performance as Michael Corleone in 1972's adaptation of Mario Puzo's book, the 1974 sequel followed the parallel paths of father and son with De Niro as a young immigrant Vito Corleone (portrayed in the first film by Marlon Brando). Pacino prefaced his tribute with a quote from Coppola himself. (WATCH) Al Pacino and Robert De Niro muse on Francis Ford Coppola and ‘The Godfather' during the director's AFI Lifetime Achievement Award presentation pic.twitter.com/wrB6GJk4ta “You know, none of us were fired from The Godfather, but some of us got pretty close,” added Pacino as the audience laughed at his self-deprecating nod. And Francis just fought for us all the time. Yet, it could have gotten him fired. Now, years later, here we all are to celebrate him for it. I am eternally grateful in kind to be part of your Godfather family.” Filmmaking peers like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Spike Lee and more were also on hand to celebrate Coppola, as well as collaborators like Adam Driver, Elle Fanning and Diane Lane. The Life Achievement Award is AFI‘s highest esteem for a career in film. Coppola's predecessors include Nicole Kidman, Julie Andrews, Denzel Washington, George Clooney, Diane Keaton and John Williams. Coppola's The Godfather, The Godfather Part II and Apocalypse Now are ranked among history's greatest films in AFI's 100 Years…100 Movies list. A six-time Academy Award winner, his other iconic feature credits, as writer, director and/or producer, include Patton, American Graffiti, The Conversation, The Outsiders and Bram Stoker's Dracula, to name just a few. The AFI Life Achievement Award Tribute returns this year to TNT, with encore presentations to follow on Turner Classic Movies. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump bragged that he had made “200 deals” on trade and tariffs in a recent interview, but when pressed for details, two members of his cabinet could not name a single country that has agreed to one of Trump's alleged deals. Two weeks after he announced a 90-day pause on his punishing import tariffs, Trump claimed he has made many deals while refusing to say which countries agreed to those deals. “I've made 200 deals,” Trump told Time magazine in an interview published Friday, adding, “100 percent.” If that were true and every deal is with a different nation, it would mean Trump has already finalized deals with nearly every country in the world. “The president told Time magazine, quote, ‘I have made 200 deals,” Bash said. Has he actually inked any trade deals, and with whom?” @DanaBashCNN asks @SecRollins about Trump's trade deals: "My understanding is we should have several this week that are coming forward that are very, very close." Of course, having some deals that are “very, very close” is not the same thing as having made “200 deals,” as Trump has explicitly claimed. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China has already led to an increase in canceled shipments between Asia and North America after Trump jacked up tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent. China, meanwhile, has implemented retaliatory tariffs in addition to economic restrictions of exports of rare earth mineral to the United States and restrictions on 18 major U.S. manufacturers and defense companies. When confronted with that statement, Trump insisted a journalist had his “reporting wrong.” Reporter: “[China is] saying it's fake news that trade talks are happening.”Trump: “Well, they had a meeting this morning.”Reporter: “Who's they?”Trump: “I can't tell you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By that time, Brian was divorced and Mika was a single mom to her daughter Jade — but they quickly became a family of three. On April 24, 2025, the “100 Day Dream Home” stars opened up about their co-parenting journey on WFLA's “Maggie & The Moms” show, with Brian revealing that becoming a “bonus dad” to Jade has been “one of the best things to ever happen to me.” Brian has been vocal about his crush on Mika when they attended the same Florida high school. But they didn't find a love connection until years later, when she accidentally included him in an email to other classmates, they told Tampa Bay Parenting in 2024. “It was just crazy how things, they felt right,” she continued. So I've been in Jade's life pretty much her entire life and (it's) one of the best things to ever happen to me.” Tapping Mika on the shoulder, Brian sweetly clarified, “One of my best friends. But Jade is fantastic and I'm so glad that both of you are in my life.” On Jade's 16th birthday in February, Brian posted a series of videos with Jade on Instagram and wrote, “These past 16 years have been the SWEETEST of my entire life! Mika and Brian are both outgoing, extroverted personalities, but told Rodriguez that it's been interesting learning the best ways to co-parent Jade, who is “so different” than they are. “Jade's a little more introverted, unlike both of us,” Mika laughed. “But I do think that now, we're probably 50/50 on, like, the discipline and just making sure we have open conversations with her about life and things that are happening in her life.” One of those benefits is Brian's ability to keep Mika calm or take over during stressful situations, the couple revealed, including teaching Jade how to drive. “I think I made her nervous because I'm freaking out,” Mika admitted, noting that she was making noises and flinching in the backseat until Jade announced she couldn't handle having both of them in the car. Mika then got out, and Brian calmly took over. Brian can stay calm in times where I'm frantic, so it's like he grounds me a little bit.” After giving her a stuffed animal he brought, Brian said, “Barriers broke down, we became friends right away, and nothing's been the same (since) in all of our lives, really.” New episodes of “100 Day Dream Home” air Tuesday nights at 8 p.m. Eastern time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Cory Booker and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are holding a livestreamed sit-in on the Capitol steps in protest of a forthcoming Republican budget they say will gut Medicaid — a federal and state program that helps to cover medical costs for people with limited income as well as disabled children and adults. “We are here on a Sunday morning… to have a conversation grounded in our faith traditions — and not just ours but the nation's as a whole — to talk about what we think is a moment of moral urgency that we are in this moment,” Booker said at the beginning of the event. Committees in Congress are expected to start working on the budget this week after a budget resolution was adopted by both houses. The biggest targets for those cuts are Medicare and Medicaid. GOP leadership has said they hope to have Trump sign the bill by Memorial Day. Among their ideas to cut federal spending is a plan to add work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries, something Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has endorsed. The vast majority of Medicaid recipients — 92 percent — are already either working, going to school, or caretaking for others, an analysis by health policy research firm KFF found. They wrote that they “will not support a final reconciliation bill that includes any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.” “Martin Luther King said budgets are moral documents, and that's the spirit we come here this morning, hoping to have a larger conversation,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American Music Honors, an annual event organized by the Bruce Springsteen Archives & Center, took place Saturday at Monmouth University in West Long Branch, New Jersey, this year honoring Smokey Robinson, John Fogerty, Emmylou Harris, Tom Morello, and Joe Ely. Every honoree with the exception of Joe Ely was on site to receive the award, as well as perform their classic songs with help from Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul, Bruce Springsteen, and surprise guests Jackson Browne, Nils Lofgren, Nora Guthrie, and Darlene Love. In other words, an all-star event on par with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony was staged in front a mere 714 people on a college campus, and there's no plans to air it on television. Fortunately, phones were allowed, and there's lots of fan footage. (Let's give a special shoutout to Dr. Marty Jablow for his great camera work.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Amy Sherman-Palladino has always wanted to make television about dance. The “Gilmore Girls” and “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” creator's latest, “Étoile,” follows two prestigious dance companies in New York and Paris who decide to swap their top talent in an attempt to shake things up and bring more eyes to the arts. This often manifests with middling movie musicals, and on the TV side with shows like “Smash,” (a cult favorite now on Broadway) “Mozart in the Jungle,” (notorious for winning a Golden Globe and prompting Google searches for “What is ‘Mozart in the Jungle'”), “Fosse/Verdon” (critically acclaimed but not widely watched), and “Bunheads” itself (poorly received by critics though it had its own fan following). None of these titles struggles with love for the source material. The same themes ultimately manifest on a show like “Friday Night Lights,” where the discipline of high school football isn't inherently relatable but resonated mightily with viewers for the show's lovable characters and tight-knit community. Yet for performing arts, that connection usually only translates through reality competitions instead of narrative fiction. It doesn't help that “Mozart” and “Étoile” are set in the siloed world of the arts elite, a space of privilege that is accessible to few (even as an audience member trying to find affordable tickets). (“Smash” just descended into chaos, but I personally cannot fault it for that.) “Friday Night Lights” might be set in the more widely beloved world of sports rather than the arts, but it offers a strong template for what could bring the performing arts to life on screen. Like any good show, the project has to be character-driven; in his review of “Étoile,” IndieWire's Ben Travers noted that the characters were “enormously, fruitlessly difficult — difficult to each other, difficult to invest in, and difficult to see clearly until it's far too late to care.” This is a risk when telling the story of egomaniacs and divas, but dare I say it worked for an enormously successful series called “Glee.” This might feel like Screenwriting 101, so how can it be applied here? Two prestigious ballet companies need money — probably not the sweeping audience hook that it could be. Now that might resonate with anyone who sings in the shower. An inexperienced oboe player ends up under the wing of her eccentric conductor? Not a situation we've all been in, but an intriguing dynamic. And lastly, also noted in IndieWire's review of “Étoile” — the show or film has to explore performing arts in a manner distinct from the real-life experience. Putting a camera in the wings, on stage, up close and personal — using a mix of static and tracking shots and difference angles in a way that no one can experience in an auditorium — now that's worth watching. Why be restricted by laws of physics when you've got movie magic on your side? “Smash” Season 1 often jumped between the rehearsal room and a staged version of the same song, a great and simple way to make each number more engaging. That and “Glee” indulged in their fair share of dream sequences, with mixed results but points for effort. There's no need to get too far in the weeds with any of it — if “Friday Night Lights” had spent more scenes on the details of every play or depicting games in real-time, I might not have made it to the end. The series always made time for Midge's (Rachel Brosnahan) inner life and personal relationships, illustrating how those factors affected her stage performance and overall life trajectory. No one on “Étoile” has a life outside of the ballet, which could itself be a compelling thread to pull at but remains unexplored like the rest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Cruise may often be tagged “the last great movie star” and “the man who saved the film industry” during lockdown but, according to his co-star and friend Kenneth Branagh, he remains “underestimated” in his acting. Cruise's contribution to filmmaking in the UK is being recognised with a BFI Fellowship – the British Film Institute's highest award for an actor and producer who has brought millions of pounds into the UK with his catalogue of movies made there over the past four decades – from fantasy Legend through Eyes Wide Shut to the recent Mission: Impossible blockbusters. “If he ever tires of wowing the world with action, he's going to surprise those who view him as only a movie star. What he's done with Mission and Top Gun is unique — cinematic entertainment with a serious intent to give you a wonderful time at the movies. But he's an underestimated actor — for whom a golden age of performance beckons.” Branagh added that Cruise has enjoyed many an evening in a traditionally British pub, where he enjoys respect from locals but a lack of fuss. On news of receiving the Award from the BFI, which will be accompanied by a month-long showcase of his films, Cruise said: I've been making films in the UK for over 40 years and have no plans to stop.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

He said: ““We look back on that now as a medieval, absurd thing to try and say, and I think the way the trans community is being demonised and othered is exactly the same.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Dorit Kemsley's estranged husband, Paul (PK) Kemsley, was spotted kissing “Amazing Race” season 12 contestant, Shana Wall, outside a restaurant in Beverly Hills on April 25, E! According to her IMDb, Wall is a native Californian who was born on July 27, 1974. As an actress and model, she had bit parts in shows such as “Married… with Children,” “Walker, Texas Ranger,” and “Entourage.” During her time on “Amazing Race,” she teamed up with her friend Jennifer McCall, and they ended up finishing in 7th place after arguing about using the U-Turn. Wall told Reality TV World in 2007, “I was approached by one of the casting directors and asked if I wanted to audition for the show. So that was the original way it came about, and then from there we went on and made a tape and did all the auditioning process that everybody else did.” When asked how her ex-boyfriend Ryan Seacrest felt about her “Amazing Race” stint, Wall said, “His reaction was he was beyond impressed. I can't believe you could actually do that! We've known each other for six years. Wall and Seacrest began dating in 2003 and broke up two years later, Us Weekly reported. Although Wall used to be in the entertainment industry, she now works as a professional sommelier. Her LinkedIn profile states that she's certified with the Court of Master Sommeliers and has a culinary degree from the Epicurean School of Culinary Arts in Los Angeles. Wall regularly posts about food and wine on her Instagram page, which has over 12,000 followers. In August 2024, she shared some cheaper options for champagne and told fans, “If you're like me and you love champagne but you don't love the price tag, I have a little insider tip for you — Crémants.” “Crémants are French sparkling wines made in the same traditional method as champagne from neighboring regions in France at a fraction of the cost,” she said. The food and wine expert also used to host a now-defunct YouTube channel called “The Hot Dish: With Shana,” where she posted quick and easy recipes, such as deviled eggs and pesto. “I paired my pesto with E. Prove, a Vermentino from Corsica. It has a great acidity to lift the pesto, plus a lemon peel note, which lends itself perfectly to the basil, garlic, and cheese.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many fans have noticed the three wildly gifted backup singers who've been supporting the contestants during season 23, even discussing on social media if they could win the show (spoiler alert: they're all too old). Like Underwood, Felicia Barton knows how it feels to be an “Idol” contestant. According to She made it to the top 36 during season 8, when Kris Allen won the title and Adam Lambert was runner-up. Barton went on to become a songwriter, penning tunes for artists including Demi Lovato, Lea Michelle, and Lauren Alaina, but never stopped finding ways to showcase her own voice. When “Dancing With The Stars” asked her to become one of its “principal singers,” she was all in, telling Voyage LA Magazine, “This was something I had dreamed about. Then, when ABC relaunched “Idol” in 2018, a year after FOX ended its run there, music director Kris Pooley asked Barton to join the show 10 years after she'd been a contestant. She told Voyage LA it was “the ultimate full-circle moment for me.” In between appearing on her two ABC shows, Barton is busy being a proud “momager” (with a new podcast of the same name!) He has repeatedly shared on Instagram how grateful he is to be part of the “Idol” crew, writing in 2023, “I love them with all my heart and they are my family.” When Winbush isn't singing his way through “Idol” episodes, he's often serving as backup singer for “Idol” alum Lauren Daigle. According to Winbush's X profile, he has served as the Background Vocal Leader for artists including Justin Bieber, Patti LaBelle, and “American Idol” alums Jordin Sparks and Tori Kelly. While Barton and Winbush are now in their eighth years as “American Idol” backup singers, Norelle Simpson is in the midst of her first. On April 14, as the Hawaii episodes were airing, she posted a photo with the musicians onstage and expressed her thanks on Instagram. She wrote, “So happy to be with the American Idol Family for season 8!!!!!!! So much gratitude and love to @krispooley & @feliciabarton for having me with you guys!!!!!! It's a true honor to be under your leadership!!! In February, the Cleveland native appeared on the Super Bowl twice, singing backup for Cheryl Lee Ralph and Rihanna, according to Fox8 News. The next episodes of “American Idol” air on back-to-back nights — April 27 and 28 at 8 p.m. Eastern time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles police have released video from the shooting of author Jillian Lauren, the wife of a Weezer band member, during a chaotic backyard confrontation that culminated in a volley of gunfire. Lauren — listed by police as Jillian Lauren Shriner — was released on a $1 million bond on suspicion of attempted murder pending further investigation. She is scheduled to appear in court April 30. Police released the excerpts from body camera recordings, surveillance video and audio of 911 dispatch conversations on Friday (April 25). An officer indicates that the woman has cocked a gun — “Oh, she racked it” — immediately before the sound of at least six shots rings out. In a separate segment of silent surveillance video from Lauren's backyard, she can be seen exiting the home barefoot and carrying a pistol in her right hand. Another segment shows Lauren from behind, apparently raising a gun that is briefly visible. Further body camera video shows Lauren lying prone in the middle of a residential road as police place handcuffs behind her back, while noting that she has a wound on her arm. Lauren's published works include two bestselling memoirs, 2010's Some Girls: My Life in a Harem and 2015's Everything You Ever Wanted.

'You' Co-Showrunners Unpack Epic Series Finale and "Unmasking the Monster" That Is Joe Goldberg Penn Badgley Admits "It Was a Struggle" to Live Apart From His 'Gossip Girl' Character The You star admitted that he hadn't crossed paths with Trachtenberg “in over a decade” and didn't want “to claim to have known her well,” but that he'd continue to remember her as a “really pure heart.” Many of Trachtenberg's Gossip Girl co-stars reacted to her death, with Blake Lively recalling the late star as “electricity” in an Instagram Story. Lively wrote, “You knew when she entered a room because the vibration changed. Chace Crawford, who played Nate Archibald in the beloved high school drama, also posted an Instagram tribute post where he remembered Trachtenberg as “a force of nature and just so, so unapologetically funny and magnetic.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
