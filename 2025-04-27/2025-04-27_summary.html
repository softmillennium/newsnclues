Airstrike in Donetsk kills three and drone attack in Dnipro leaves one dead, according to local sources

Russia has continued its assault on Ukraine with a series of drone attacks and airstrikes, hours after Donald Trump cast doubt on Vladimir Putin's readiness to end the conflict.

Three people were killed and four wounded on Sunday morning in airstrikes on Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region, according to the regional prosecutor's office. In a drone attack on the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipro region, a person was killed and a 14-year-old girl wounded after a third consecutive night of assaults, the local governor, Serhiy Lysak, said.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, described the coming week as “very critical” for US attempts to end the war, telling the American broadcaster NBC that the administration would need to “make a determination about whether this is an endeavour that we want to continue to be involved in”.

He was speaking after what was described in diplomatic circles as a potentially historic meeting between Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the US president, albeit only a 15-minute conversation, on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday.

In a social media post sent during his flight back to the US afterwards, Trump suggested Russia was not committed to negotiating a ceasefire.

“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” he wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along.” He also implied he was considering further sanctions against Russia.

The meeting had been the two men's first encounter since their highly antagonistic confrontation in the Oval Office two months ago.

Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Russia would not stop targeting sites used by the Ukrainian military, including those involving European contributions to aid Kyiv or connected to foreign fighting forces. He claimed in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation that a residential building in Kyiv last week, which was hit by a Russian missile killing at least 12 people, had not been an “absolutely civilian” target.

“We will continue to target the sites used by the military of Ukraine, by some mercenaries from foreign countries and by instructors who the Europeans officially sent to help target Russian civilian sites,” he said in the interview, which was recorded on Thursday.

Zelenskyy denied Moscow's claims made on Saturday that Ukraine's army had been forced out of Russia's Kursk region. “Our military continues to actively defend the designated areas of the Kursk and Belgorod regions,” he wrote on Telegram, admitting that the situation remained difficult in those, and many other, areas.

Ukraine's army has dismissed as “propaganda tricks” Russia's claims to have carried out the “full liberation” of the Kursk region, where Ukraine made considerable gains during a surprise offensive in August 2024.

Zelenskyy said the tense situation on the frontlines and the position of the Russian army were an indication of the inadequacy of the “current pressure on Russia to end this war”. He said increased pressure on Moscow could bring more opportunities for “real diplomacy”.

In Moscow, a man suspected of killing a Russian general in a car bomb explosion on Friday has said he was paid by the Ukrainian security service to carry out the deed, according to Russian authorities who said he had pleaded guilty to terrorism charges.

Ignat Kuzin said he had received payment from Ukraine for killing Lt Gen Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the general staff of the Russian armed forces, who died just outside Moscow on Friday after a car bomb exploded as he was walking past.

Ukraine has yet to respond to the accusations that it was involved in the second attack of its kind in four months in which a high-ranking Russian military officer was killed.

Asked in his Sunday appearance on NBC's Meet the Press about possible concessions to Russia, Rubio stressed the need to be “grownups and realistic”.
 “There is no military solution to this war. The only solution to this war is a negotiated settlement where both sides are going to have to give up something they claim to want and are going to have to give the other side something they wish they didn't,” he said.

            Iranian authorities have not said what caused the massive explosion at the port of Bandar Abbas on Saturday, killing at least 40 people, amid unconfirmed reports of the possible presence of a chemical used to make missile propellant.
    


            Eyewitness accounts and video indicate chemicals in an area of shipping containers caught fire, setting off a much larger explosion. The death toll has spiked sharply, with  1,000 others reported injured, according to the Associated Press, citing Iranian state TV. Of those wounded, 190 remain in hospital, said Pir Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran's Red Crescent society.
    


            One surveillance video distributed by the Fars news agency shows a small fire beginning among containers, with a number of workers moving away from the scene, before a huge explosion ends the video feed. Emergency workers hoped the blaze would be fully extinguished by Sunday afternoon, after aircraft doused the site with seawater. About 80% of the fires had been contained, Iranian state media reported earlier.
    


            CNN has previously reported that hundreds of tons of a critical chemical for fueling Iran's ballistic missile program arrived at the port in February. Another shipment is reported to have arrived in March.
    


            The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an official as saying the explosion was likely set off by containers of chemicals, but did not identify the chemicals. The agency said late Saturday that the Customs Administration of Iran blamed a “stockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area” for the blast.
    


            Iran's national oil company said the explosion at the port was “not related to refineries, fuel tanks, or oil pipelines” in the area.
    


            Iranian officials have denied that any military material was held at the port. The spokesman for the national security and foreign policy committee of the Iranian parliament, Ebrahim Rezaei, said in a post on X Sunday that according to initial reports the explosion had “nothing to do with Iran's defense sector.”
    


            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian arrived in Bandar Abbas on Sunday afternoon to investigate the situation and oversee relief efforts, according to state media. The president also met with those injured in yesterday's blast.
    


            “We have to find out why it happened,” Pezeshkian said at a meeting with officials aired by Iranian state television.
    


            The region's governor, Mohammad Ashouri, declared three days of mourning.
    


            The blast comes at a time of high tensions in the Middle East and ongoing talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran's nuclear programme, but no senior figure in Iran has suggested the blast was an attack.
    


            Videos and images from the scene, some of which have been geolocated by CNN, show orange-brown smoke rising from part of the port where containers were stacked. Such a color would suggest a chemical such as sodium or ammonia was involved.
    


            The New York Times reported Sunday that a person “with ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said that what exploded was sodium perchlorate, a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters.”
    


            CNN cannot confirm what was being stored in the area at the time of the explosion and it is unclear why such chemicals would be kept at port for so long.
    


            Other experts suggested more mundane chemicals might explain the huge blast.
    


            “This bears the hallmarks of an ammonium nitrate explosion. Ammonium nitrate is a commodity chemical that is widely used as a fertilizer and as an industrial explosive, but it is well known that poor storage can significantly raise the risk of an explosion in the event of a fire.” said Andrea Sella, a professor of chemistry at University College London.
    


            “Material ignites and burns fiercely less than a minute later followed seconds later by the devastating detonation. It is the supersonic pressure wave from that that would have shattered windows.”
    


            In February CNN reported that the first of two vessels carrying 1,000 tons of a Chinese-made chemical that could be a key component in fuel for Iran's military missile program had anchored outside Bandar Abbas.
    


            The ship, Golbon, had left the Chinese port of Taicang in January loaded with most of a 1,000-ton shipment of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the solid propellant that powers Iran's mid-range conventional missiles, according to two European intelligence sources who spoke with CNN.
    


            Sodium perchlorate could allow for the production of sufficient propellant for some 260 solid rocket motors for Iran's Kheibar Shekan missiles or 200 of the Haj Qasem ballistic missiles, according to the intelligence sources.
    


            The Chinese Foreign Ministry told CNN in February that “China has consistently abided by export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations,” adding that “sodium perchlorate is not a controlled item by China, and its export would be considered normal trade.”

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the victims of the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, on Sunday, condemning the loss of lives and reiterating New Delhi's commitment to punish the perpetrators. 

Speaking on the radio show Mann Ki Baat, the country's leader started by expressing deep anguish over the slaughter, in which 26 tourists were gunned down while visiting a popular picnic spot on April 22.

It marked the second time in the last few days that Modi promised justice to the families of the victims. He vowed to pursue the murderers to the “end of the earth” during a political rally in Bihar state. Speaking in English – somewhat rare for him – he vowed that India would identify, trace, and punish every terrorist and their supporters.

“Today, as I talk my heart out with you, there is a deep agony in my heart. The Pahalgam terrorist attack of 22 April has left every citizen of the country heartbroken. Every Indian feels deep sympathy for the families of the victims. No matter which state one belongs to, no matter which language one speaks, I understand every citizen is seething with anger after seeing the images of the terrorist attack,” Modi said. “The conspirators and perpetrators of this attack will face the harshest response. The harshest punishment,” he reiterated.

The prime minister said the attack occurred at a time when peace, economic revival, and democracy were returning to Kashmir, and that the terrorists and their masterminds wanted to destroy the region once again. Kashmir has been a point of connection between India and Pakistan and has witnessed decades of violence and insurgencies. It has experienced relative stability in recent years, with the local economy improving due to increased tourist inflow.

“The entire world stands with the 1.4 billion Indians in our fight against terrorism. Once again, I assure the victims' families that they will get justice. The conspirators and perpetrators of this attack will face the harshest response,” Modi added. 

India has linked Pakistan to the fatal attack, accusing its neighbor of “support for cross-border terrorism” – a long-standing claim New Delhi has made in various international forums. In response to the attack, India suspended the significant Indus Waters Treaty, expelled Pakistani diplomats, closed its land border, and suspended visas for Pakistani citizens, effectively ordering them to leave Indian soil within a few days. Meanwhile, Indian security analysts suggested the government could be weighing various military options in retaliation.

Islamabad has denied involvement and announced tit-for-tat countermeasures. It also warned that if India follows through on its threat to block rivers, it would take this as “an act of war.” The Indus Waters Treaty governs the shared waters of one of the world's biggest river systems, which affects millions of lives in both countries. India has never suspended the treaty before, even in times of open conflict.

‘The Chinese will see this high tariff level is unsustainable for their business,' says Scott Bessent

The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said “there is a path” to an agreement with China over tariffs after he had interactions with his Chinese counterparts last week in Washington.

“I had interaction with my Chinese counterparts, but it was more on the traditional things like financial stability, global economic early warnings,” Bessent told ABC News's This Week on Sunday, explaining that he spoke to the Chinese during International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington. “I don't know if President Trump has spoken with President Xi,” he added.

On Friday, Donald Trump asserted in an interview that tariff negotiations were under way with China, comments he repeated on his way to Rome to attend the funeral of Pope Francis, but were later denied by China's foreign ministry, which said the US “should stop creating confusion”.

A day later, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, said Beijing abides by international rules on US-imposed tariffs and would seek solidarity with other countries.

“Certain countries adhere to their own priorities, engage in bullying pressure and coercive transactions, and provoke trade wars for no reason, exposing their extreme egoism,” Wang said on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Kazakhstan.

On Sunday, Bessent attempted to weave through the conflicting signals over what progress was being made to de-escalate a trade war threatening to sap global growth.

“The Chinese will see this high tariff level is unsustainable for their business,” he said. He added that Beijing's denial that negotiations are ongoing was for a Chinese audience.

“I think they're playing to a different audience,” Bessent said. “We have a process in place, and, again, I just believe these Chinese tariffs are unsustainable.

“The first path will be, again, a de-escalation, which I think the Chinese are going to have to have. Then I think there can be an agreement in principle, these 17 or 18 important trade deals that we're negotiating.”

But Bessent warned that “a trade deal can take months” and said negotiations with other significant US trading partners were progressing. “Some of those are moving along very well, especially the – with the Asian countries,” he said, praising Trump's negotiating strategy.

“In game theory it's called strategic uncertainty,” he said. “So, you're not going to tell the person on the other side of the negotiation where you're going to end up. And nobody's better at creating this leverage than President Trump.”

The treasury secretary's comments come as top US retailers have reportedly warned the White House that tariffs will cause empty store shelves and price hikes within weeks.

Bloomberg reported that Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein raised US prices of its products from dresses to kitchenware on Friday ahead of imminent tariffs on small parcels. The average price for the top 100 products in the beauty and health category increased by 51%; more than 30% for home and kitchen products and toys; and a 377% increase in the price of a 10-piece set of kitchen towels.

Separately on Sunday, US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said the US was holding daily conversations with China over tariffs. “Every day we are in conversation with China, along with those other 99, 100 countries that have come to the table,” Rollins said on CNN's State of the Union.

Rollins said the president was prepared to bail out American farmers if the trade war continues squeezing commodity exports, particularly soybean and pork sales to China.

“First of all, the prayer is that that doesn't need to happen – but secondly, if it does, for the short term, just as in Trump 1, we are preparing for that,” Rollins said.

Rollins said it could take months before it is known if a bail-out is needed.

“I don't think we're going to need it, but if we do, it will be there,” Rollins said.

Global finance leaders came to Washington this past week seeking clarity on what it would take to get some relief from US President Donald Trump's multi-layered tariff assault and on just how much pain it will bring to the world economy.

Most headed home with more questions than answers.

Many participants in the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings had a sense that Trump's administration was still conflicted in its demands from trading partners hit with his sweeping tariffs.

During the whirlwind week, many finance and trade ministers sought to meet with US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent and other key Trump administration officials, to no avail. Those that did were often told to be patient — even as the clock steadily ticks down on the 90-day pause Trump had granted on the steepest levies.

Indeed, not a single deal was finalized over the course of the week despite the Trump administration touting the receipt of 18 written proposals and a full slate of negotiations.

"We are not negotiating. We are just presenting, discussing the economy," said Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski. He added that he stressed "how this uncertainty is bad for Europe, for the US. I mean, it's actually bad for everyone."

Warnings that the tariffs — 25 percent on all US imports of vehicles, steel and aluminum and currently 10 percent for most everything else — would cause painful damage to the US and other major economies went largely unheeded by US officials.

"We know that they think — that it won't be that bad," Domanski said. "They think it's a short-term pain, long-term gain. And I'm afraid that we'll have short-term pain, long-term pain." 

The Trump administration's most substantial trade negotiations during the week were with Japan and South Korea, but the results were inconclusive as Bessent cited "productive" talks with both countries. Specific currency targets for the Japanese yen were not discussed, but both countries' currency policies are expected to be part of future talks as the US sees currency weakness against the US dollar as a nontariff barrier to American exports. 

The IMF took a slightly more optimistic view of the economic fallout from the highest US tariffs in more than a century, slashing growth forecasts for most countries in its World Economic Outlook but stopping far short of predicting recessions — even for the US and export-dependent China, which now faces US tariffs of 145 percent on many goods.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva acknowledged that member countries were anxious about the uncertainty shock to a global economy buffeted by pandemic, inflation and wars but held out hope that trade negotiations would ease the tariff strains.

"We recognize that there is work under way to resolve trade disputes and reduce uncertainty," Georgieva told reporters. "Uncertainty is really bad for business, so the sooner there is this cloud that is hanging over our heads is lifted, the better for profit, for growth, for the world economy." Several finance officials told Reuters that odds of recession were higher than the IMF's 37 percent chance, citing private sector forecasts.

Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, a faith-based nonprofit group advocating debt relief, said that the IMF's forecasts were clearly aimed at preventing market panic, even as officials in private meetings expressed concerns about new debt crises emerging. "It was a do-nothing kind of week," LeCompte said, adding that debt discussions were inconclusive and overshadowed by tariff talks.

 US WITHDRAWAL

Policymakers did breathe a sigh of relief when Bessent expressed US support for the IMF and the World Bank, declaring that they have "enduring value" but criticizing their "mission creep" into climate, gender and equality issues. 

Rather than withdrawing from the institutions as prescribed by the Project 2025 Republican policy manifesto, Bessent said he wanted to refocus them on their core missions of economic stability and development, with expanded World Bank energy financing options and an end to China loans. 

Participants at the meetings, along with financial markets, were encouraged by Bessent's comments early last week that triple-digit US tariffs on Chinese goods and vice versa were unsustainable, suggesting that a deal to ease them could be reached soon. But China denied Trump's assertions that tariff negotiations were under way with Beijing, adding to the week's confusion over his tariffs and offering little reassurance to country delegations.

"I think most people left here bracing for things to get worse from an economic perspective," said Josh Lipsky, a former IMF adviser who is now senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center. "The broad picture, when you step back, is very concerning."

But a big challenge for developed countries at the moment was the recent selloff in US Treasury debt and other US dollar-based assets, which indicated an erosion of trust in US economic policies, Lipsky said.

Trust in US economic leadership was the fundamental reason that the US dollar had achieved reserve currency status, he said. 

While the US economy is too big to ignore the US dollar for now, trading partners will try to seek alternatives unless that trust is repaired, he added.



                                                                                Intel Corp chief executive officer Lip-Bu Tan (陳立武) is expected to meet with Taiwanese suppliers next month in conjunction with the opening of the Computex Taipei trade show, supply chain sources said on Monday.
The visit, the first for Tan to Taiwan since assuming his new post last month, would be aimed at enhancing Intel's ties with suppliers in Taiwan as he attempts to help turn around the struggling US chipmaker, the sources said.
Tan is to hold a banquet to celebrate Intel's 40-year presence in Taiwan before Computex opens on May 20 and invite dozens of Taiwanese suppliers to exchange views                                    



                                                                                Application-specific integrated circuit designer Faraday Technology Corp (智原) yesterday said that although revenue this quarter would decline 30 percent from last quarter, it retained its full-year forecast of revenue growth of 100 percent.
The company attributed the quarterly drop to a slowdown in customers' production of chips using Faraday's advanced packaging technology.
The company is still confident about its revenue growth this year, given its strong “design-win” — or the projects it won to help customers design their chips, Faraday president Steve Wang (王國雍) told an online earnings conference.
“The design-win this year is better than we expected. We believe we will win                                    



                                                                                Quanta Computer Inc (廣達) chairman Barry Lam (林百里) is expected to share his views about the artificial intelligence (AI) industry's prospects during his speech at the company's 37th anniversary ceremony, as AI servers have become a new growth engine for the equipment manufacturing service provider.
Lam's speech is much anticipated, as Quanta has risen as one of the world's major AI server suppliers. The company reported a 30 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated revenue to NT$1.41 trillion (US$43.35 billion) last year, thanks to fast-growing demand for servers, especially those with AI capabilities. The company told investors in November last year that                                    



                                                                                Power supply and electronic components maker Delta Electronics Inc (台達電) yesterday said it plans to ship its new 1 megawatt charging systems for electric trucks and buses in the first half of next year at the earliest.
The new charging piles, which deliver up to 1 megawatt of charging power, are designed for heavy-duty electric vehicles, and support a maximum current of 1,500 amperes and output of 1,250 volts, Delta said in a news release.
“If everything goes smoothly, we could begin shipping those new charging systems as early as in the first half of next year,” a company official said.

DOHA, April 27. /TASS/. Qatar and Saudi Arabia have undertaken to repay Syria's debts to the World Bank Group amounting to $15 million, according to their joint statement cited by the Saudi Press Agency.

"In continuation of the ongoing efforts by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Qatar to support and accelerate the recovery of the Syrian Arab Republic's economy, and in light of recent discussions held during the High-level Roundtable on Syria on the margin of the 2025 WBG/IMF Spring Meetings, the ministries of finance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Qatar jointly announce their commitment to settle Syria's outstanding arrears to the World Bank Group, totaling around $15 million," the agency said.

According to the statement, this commitment "will pave the way for the World Bank Group to resume support and operations in Syria after a suspension of more than 14 years."

Apart from that, Riyadh and Doha called on international and regional financial institution to "promptly resume and expand their development engagement in Syria."

World Bank officials visited Damascus on April 14 to discuss the potential resumption of financing to ensure the restoration of the energy infrastructure and payments in the public sector. Syrian Finance Minister Mohammad Yusr Barnieh‘s meeting with the WB delegation was the first public contact between the sides in recent years. On the same day, Reuters said, citing its sources, that Saudi Arabia may settle Syria's arrears to the World Bank Group, opening the way for international assistance to the country's restoration efforts.

            Iranian authorities have not said what caused the massive explosion at the port of Bandar Abbas on Saturday, killing at least 40 people, amid unconfirmed reports of the possible presence of a chemical used to make missile propellant.
    


            Eyewitness accounts and video indicate chemicals in an area of shipping containers caught fire, setting off a much larger explosion. The death toll has spiked sharply, with  1,000 others reported injured, according to the Associated Press, citing Iranian state TV. Of those wounded, 190 remain in hospital, said Pir Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran's Red Crescent society.
    


            One surveillance video distributed by the Fars news agency shows a small fire beginning among containers, with a number of workers moving away from the scene, before a huge explosion ends the video feed. Emergency workers hoped the blaze would be fully extinguished by Sunday afternoon, after aircraft doused the site with seawater. About 80% of the fires had been contained, Iranian state media reported earlier.
    


            CNN has previously reported that hundreds of tons of a critical chemical for fueling Iran's ballistic missile program arrived at the port in February. Another shipment is reported to have arrived in March.
    


            The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an official as saying the explosion was likely set off by containers of chemicals, but did not identify the chemicals. The agency said late Saturday that the Customs Administration of Iran blamed a “stockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area” for the blast.
    


            Iran's national oil company said the explosion at the port was “not related to refineries, fuel tanks, or oil pipelines” in the area.
    


            Iranian officials have denied that any military material was held at the port. The spokesman for the national security and foreign policy committee of the Iranian parliament, Ebrahim Rezaei, said in a post on X Sunday that according to initial reports the explosion had “nothing to do with Iran's defense sector.”
    


            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian arrived in Bandar Abbas on Sunday afternoon to investigate the situation and oversee relief efforts, according to state media. The president also met with those injured in yesterday's blast.
    


            “We have to find out why it happened,” Pezeshkian said at a meeting with officials aired by Iranian state television.
    


            The region's governor, Mohammad Ashouri, declared three days of mourning.
    


            The blast comes at a time of high tensions in the Middle East and ongoing talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran's nuclear programme, but no senior figure in Iran has suggested the blast was an attack.
    


            Videos and images from the scene, some of which have been geolocated by CNN, show orange-brown smoke rising from part of the port where containers were stacked. Such a color would suggest a chemical such as sodium or ammonia was involved.
    


            The New York Times reported Sunday that a person “with ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said that what exploded was sodium perchlorate, a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters.”
    


            CNN cannot confirm what was being stored in the area at the time of the explosion and it is unclear why such chemicals would be kept at port for so long.
    


            Other experts suggested more mundane chemicals might explain the huge blast.
    


            “This bears the hallmarks of an ammonium nitrate explosion. Ammonium nitrate is a commodity chemical that is widely used as a fertilizer and as an industrial explosive, but it is well known that poor storage can significantly raise the risk of an explosion in the event of a fire.” said Andrea Sella, a professor of chemistry at University College London.
    


            “Material ignites and burns fiercely less than a minute later followed seconds later by the devastating detonation. It is the supersonic pressure wave from that that would have shattered windows.”
    


            In February CNN reported that the first of two vessels carrying 1,000 tons of a Chinese-made chemical that could be a key component in fuel for Iran's military missile program had anchored outside Bandar Abbas.
    


            The ship, Golbon, had left the Chinese port of Taicang in January loaded with most of a 1,000-ton shipment of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the solid propellant that powers Iran's mid-range conventional missiles, according to two European intelligence sources who spoke with CNN.
    


            Sodium perchlorate could allow for the production of sufficient propellant for some 260 solid rocket motors for Iran's Kheibar Shekan missiles or 200 of the Haj Qasem ballistic missiles, according to the intelligence sources.
    


            The Chinese Foreign Ministry told CNN in February that “China has consistently abided by export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations,” adding that “sodium perchlorate is not a controlled item by China, and its export would be considered normal trade.”

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

Acting commander of Russia's 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin that "scattered groups and individual soldiers" of the Ukrainian Armed Forces fighting in the Kursk region "will soon be destroyed," Russian government-controlled RIA Novosti reported on April 27. 

The statement, contradicts an earlier report by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov that Russian forces have fully recaptured the territory of Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region partially held by Ukraine since last August. 

According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, fighting in Kursk Oblast continues. 

"Our troops continue active defensive operations in designated areas of the Kursk and Belgorod regions," Zelensky reported on April 27, acknowledging that the heaviest fighting is taking place in Kursk and Donetsk oblasts. 

Ukraine also earlier denied the Kremlin's claim, saying that the statements "do not correspond to reality."

"Ukrainian defensive operations in certain areas of Kursk Oblast continue," Ukraine's General Staff said on April 26, adding that Kyiv's forces repelled five Russian ground assaults in the area on April 26.

"The situation is difficult, but our units continue to hold certain positions and carry out tasks as assigned," the statement read, noting that there is no threat of encirclement. A military source also told the Kyiv Independent that Kyiv continues to hold territories in Kursk Oblast.

Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. The operation aimed to disrupt a planned Russian offensive on the neighboring Sumy Oblast and draw Russian forces away from the embattled Donbas region.

Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha.

On April 26, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov for the first time acknowledged the participation of North Korean troops in the campaign, praising their "fortitude and heroism." 

Kyiv and Seoul have previously said that North Korea has dispatched around 11,000 troops to Kursk Oblast, though Moscow has not openly confirmed this until now.

            Russian authorities say they have charged a “Ukrainian special services agent” with terrorism, after he was detained in connection with a car explosion that killed Russian General Yaroslav Moskalik on Friday.
    


            The suspect – Ignat Kuzin – allegedly purchased the car that exploded in Balashikha, less than 20 miles east of Moscow, according to TASS citing Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Russian Investigation Committee. The suspect's nationality is unclear; according to the FSB, he has a residence permit in Ukraine.
    


            Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) allegedly recruited Kuzin, who “confessed to the murder” of Russian General Yaroslav Moskalik, TASS reported. He was promised $18,000 for the attack, which had been planned since September 2024, added TASS.

            The FSB had accused him of planting an explosive device in the car, but said that it was detonated from Ukraine. Video published by TASS on Saturday appeared to show charred electronics and parts of the car. Russia's Investigative Committee had previously said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device packed with shrapnel.
    


            Russian General Moskalik was deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces. The influential Russian military blog Rybar said Moskalik was not in the Volkswagen car when it exploded but was close to it after walking out of a nearby building. CNN cannot independently verify this report.
    


            Photos released by Russian authorities appear to show the suspect driving a dark green Volkswagen with license plates that match those purportedly found at the site of the blast.
    


            TASS video also showed the man being put into a van, and included footage of him apparently in custody describing his alleged recruitment by Ukraine's special services. It's unclear if he was under duress during the confession.
    


            No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion. CNN has reached out to the SBU and the country's Foreign Ministry for comment on the case.
    


            Moskalik was killed on the same day US special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin to discuss efforts to end Russia's war on Ukraine.
    


            After the three-hour meeting, US President Donald Trump initially voiced optimism that both sides were “very close to a deal.”
    


            But the next day, Trump questioned whether Putin wants a peace deal shortly after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican for Pope Francis' funeral.
    


            In a Truth Social post sent as he returned from Rome after the meeting, Trump raised the prospect of apply﻿ing new sanctions on Russia after its assault on Kyiv last week.
    


            “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking' or ‘Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!”

Health care workers know from experience that only organizing will lead to enforceable standards and better conditions. 

Health care workers know from experience that only organizing will lead to enforceable standards and better conditions. 

Five years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic caught our health care system unawares, nurses and other health care workers say we are no more prepared for the next threat.

“It's scary,” says Tatiana Mukhtar, a nurse in New Orleans. The exposure during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic “was horrific, for patients and for health care workers” she says, “and having been there and having experienced that, I feel like we have learned nothing because [health care systems] are still not doing what we need to do.”

Although the emergency feeling of spring 2020 may have faded, the need for public health measures to combat the spread of disease remains urgent. COVID is still circulating widely, and studies show that at least 35 million adults have experienced Long COVID, and that COVID increases the risk of heart disease in both children and adults. This has also been the most dangerous flu season in 15 years, with up to 92,000 people dying of the flu between October 1, 2024 and mid-February this year.

The U.S. also faces a resurgence of both tuberculosis (TB) and measles, the latter of which is one of the most contagious viruses on Earth. Meanwhile, with the threat of a bird flu outbreak among humans also looming on the horizon, the Trump administration is eliminating what Mary Bowman, a nursing assistant professor, refers to as our “already meager public health infrastructure.”

“In truth, what was laid bare by the beginning of COVID was how disinterested capitalism is in people caring for themselves when they're sick, when they could be sick, when they could get other people sick, when their families are sick, when someone dies,” Bowman told Truthout. “There's just no space for humanity in it.”

Early in the pandemic, nurses fought against dangerous work conditions, and were in many cases successful. Celia Nieto, an ICU nurse in Nevada and member of the National Nurses United (NNU) union, says hospital administrators “tried to force us to recycle our masks to chemically disinfect them and we absolutely refused to.”

“We had to fight for everything, you know, every bit of PPE [personal protective equipment] and precautions,” echoes Nick Shillingford, a nurse and former union steward who is unaffiliated with NNU. “Their starting point was not giving us the protections we needed.” The anomaly, says Shillingford, was the temporary mask mandate that hospitals implemented once public opinion forced them to do so.

Now many of those gains have disappeared. Mukhtar, a member of NNU, told Truthout that despite nurses' successful fights for access to adequate PPE in 2020, there are no N95 masks available in her unit now. Finding an N95 in the hospital “is like pulling teeth,” she says. Mukhtar's experiences are echoed by NNU's national survey from Fall 2024, which shows that almost 20 percent of nurses surveyed are still forced to reuse N95s designed for single use, even now that there is no legitimate excuse for hospitals not to stockpile adequate PPE.

“We were called health care heroes because we worked under horrible conditions, but the moment we start demanding better for ourselves, we are heartless and we want too much.”

In the same survey, only 37.1 percent of registered nurses said that patients are screened for COVID, TB, respiratory syncytial virus or flu when they arrive. Without screening, it's likely that contagious patients are spending significant time around both workers and other patients without being isolated or asked to mask. Nurses repeatedly mentioned to Truthout that in the places they work, even the insufficient infectious disease protocol is generally not practiced until after a test comes back positive, meaning that workers may have already interacted closely with someone in a room for several days before any precautions are instituted.

Even worse, contact tracing systems, many of which were developed on the fly in 2020, also seem to have disappeared in most facilities. Mukhtar says that “not long ago we had TB exposures and employees were never notified.” By the time workers found out, the patient had been in the hospital for two weeks.

Current approaches to both worker and patient safety leave a lot to be desired even when isolation protocols are followed. Mukhtar said that in her hospital, patients on such protocols, like those with TB and COVID, are allowed to leave their rooms unmasked and move throughout the hospital. And only 36.1 percent of nurses surveyed by the NNU said their facility standard is a respirator (N95 mask) with a confirmed measles case.

Nurses have not forgotten the trauma of the early pandemic, and many health care workers are frustrated at having to continue to fight for basics. “We were called health care heroes because we worked under horrible conditions, but the moment we start demanding better for ourselves, we are heartless and we want too much,” Mukhtar says.

Why do hospitals and other health care facilities make it so hard for nurses and health care workers to protect themselves and their patients from infectious diseases? Part of the lack of precautions around COVID and other contagious diseases goes back to a decades-old distinction between “droplet” and “airborne” pathogens. This standard, which most working professionals today have been drilled on, holds that most contagious illness is spread via droplets that are too large and heavy to spend much time in the air. The spread of these diseases is prevented by handwashing, cleaning of other surfaces, and surgical masks (which remain abundant in clinical settings).

Several health care workers who spoke with Truthout expressed frustration that their workplaces enforced “handwashing audits” that monitored how consistently staff washed their hands before and after contact with patients while simultaneously not enforcing any kind of masking standard. Such audits are part of the industry's out-of-date focus on “droplet rules,” says Jane Thomason, the lead industrial hygienist for NNU.

In reality, there is no such clear binary between “droplet spread” and “aerosols.” Pathogens are better thought of as on a continuum between the two, Thomason says, with many more viruses than previously thought spreading via small particles in the air rather than in droplets. This means that pathogens can travel much further — hundreds of feet — and can linger in the air for hours.

Getting hospital administrators to implement policies based on this shift in understanding, however, has been difficult. Whereas a droplet protocol puts more pressure on individuals to stop the spread of infectious disease, an understanding of inhalation transmission requires more systemic adjustments — like changes to air filtration, universal masking, regular fit testing to make sure that respirators are airtight, and negative pressure rooms to isolate patients.

Beyond the old thinking about droplets, it's also easy in the current political context for hospital administrators to hide behind the excuse that workers don't want better precautions. Masking is unpopular across the U.S., with only 4 percent of people masking regularly and many people expressing “pandemic fatigue.” Health care workers who do mask all the time at work have disclosed some frustration with their colleagues' indifference regarding the need for universal respirator usage.

Letting workers argue with each other about masks rather than implementing a policy, though, is part of a tried-and-true tactic of employers everywhere, says Thomason: Let bad conditions drive stress and conflict between workers in ways that divide them so it's harder for workers to collectively organize against management.

“Care workers are already balancing on the blade of a knife in terms of wanting to be there and having what they need to do their jobs well,” Bowman says. “So asking them to do one more thing while still not providing the actual resources or staffing that they need to do their job well and prevent infection would be a problem.”

NNU has long been fighting for health care facilities to adopt the precautionary principle in their approaches to infection control. In other words, the health care system should not assume new diseases or new strains are not very contagious or only spread in large droplets until proven otherwise, but rather the opposite: Until more is known, the highest level of precautions should be taken.

Several nurses that spoke to Truthout described being told not to wear masks in March 2020 as COVID ripped through the United States because masks would supposedly “scare the patients.” Still, many nurses are continuing to wear high-quality masks and doing their best to protect themselves and their patients even as they describe a near total lack of COVID or airborne infection protocols where they work. These workers continue to advocate for more robust masking and control of infectious diseases, including COVID.

Alex, a nurse in a community clinic in Ohio, did not want to share his last name for fear of repercussions. Alex wears a respirator at work every day and keeps extra masks to share with patients or colleagues. Measures beyond that, he says, are “just such a hard push and pull, you know, like what battles to fight.”

Bowman works in a collectively run clinic that has retained a mask requirement for patients and clinicians. In fact, the clinic is currently trying to figure out how to increase precautions by providing KN95 or higher masks to patients. “Masking is about so much more than infection prevention. It's about solidarity. It's about signaling to other people … I care about you. And I'm willing to be inconvenienced or made slightly physically uncomfortable,” Bowman says.

Some nurses and health care workers are focusing on the slow, steady work of public health education and agitation to improve community protections against infectious disease, like the People's Health Education Program. Others are focused on labor organizing that includes minimum standards for safer conditions for patients and workers.

Mukhtar is organizing with other nurses at her New Orleans hospital for their first collective bargaining contract. Alongside safe staffing, she hopes for easy access to N95 masks on her unit and stronger isolation protocols. Mukhtar says they're fighting for protection: “Protection for us, infection control, holding [administrators] accountable. … We are trying to have a seat at the table so that way we can make the best decisions possible for us and for our patients.”

In California, nurses won a statewide regulation that requires employers to have a three-month stockpile of PPE on hand. Nationally, NNU has been pushing for a permanent OSHA standard to improve infectious disease controls, as well as fighting back against the Trump administration's cuts to public health agencies and withdrawal from the World Health Organization.

Nurses won a temporary OSHA standard in 2021, after what Thomason calls “tireless advocacy.” While it was in place, she says, “We saw improvements in facilities across the country. We saw fit testing, saw access to respirators, things that actually saved people's lives.” Thomason says that standard was supposed to be a temporary fix while a permanent one was developed, but it was allowed to expire while work on the permanent standard dragged on. Now, under the Trump administration, that work has stopped entirely and it is unclear when or if it will begin again.

Nurses say they wish their bosses would just “do the right thing,” but they know from experience that only organizing will result in enforceable standards and better conditions. The health care system is where many people end up in some of their most vulnerable moments — meaning that whatever nurses and other health care workers do to increase their own safety at work is a win for everyone.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

The Ultimate Fighting Championship, the world's leading mixed martial arts organization, never stopped working with Russian fighters despite international tensions, UFC president Dana White has said.

At the post-fight press conference following UFC on ESPN 66 in Kansas City, a reporter asked White about comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin's aide, Kirill Dmitriev, that talks were ongoing to bring UFC events back to Russia.

While White did not explicitly confirm that negotiations were taking place, he emphasized that the UFC never ceased cooperation with Russian athletes.

“Yeah, listen, we never stopped. Our fighters still fought, and those things all happened during all that,” White replied.

White stressed that Russian athletes have always remained active in the UFC throughout periods of political tension and international sanctions. “We're a global business,” he continued. “Bad shit happens all the time all around the world and, uh... yes we will run the business like we always have.”

Earlier in April, Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's special representative for investment and economic cooperation, said efforts were underway to bring UFC tournaments back to Russia. Dmitriev, who is also CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has emerged as a key figure in recent Russia-US diplomatic engagements, particularly concerning the conflict in Ukraine.

His announcement regarding the UFC came after a meeting with Steve Witkoff, special envoy for US President Donald Trump, in St. Petersburg.

Since 2018, RDIF has partnered with UFC Russia to promote mixed martial arts in the country. Earlier this year, Dmitriev urged Russian fans to stay optimistic about the UFC's return following Magomed Ankalaev's victory at UFC 313, where he became the first Russian fighter to win the UFC light heavyweight title. White had previously indicated that a full UFC return to Russia could depend on improved diplomatic relations.

In 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from global competitions, but leading promotions such as UFC, Bellator, and One FC did not enforce the recommendation. Despite international sanctions imposed on Moscow after the escalation of Ukraine conflict, Russian fighters have continued to compete in major mixed martial arts (MMA) organizations.

Ukrainian forces operating NASAMS air defense systems downed 11 Russian cruise missiles in less than two minutes during a mass aerial attack, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Kyrylo Peretyatko said in a video published on April 27. 

"We probably broke all records of other countries for reload speed, and we are ready to keep doing it constantly to defend our country, as long as we have the missiles," he said. 

"In one air defense battle, we shot down 11 cruise missiles. The operation lasted no more than two minutes," Peretyatko said. 

He did not specify which Russian mass missile attack he was referring to.

The U.S./Norwegian-made National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) systems have been in service with Ukrainian forces since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid escalating Russian airstrikes. 

The NASAMS system, which has a maximum range of 50 kilometers depending on the model used, is particularly valuable for Ukraine as it uses the AIM-120 AMRAAM interceptor missile, which is the same missile used in air-to-air function in Western fighter jets.

Kyiv has consistently urged Western allies to expand air defense assistance, with President Volodymyr Zelensky even offering to buy Patriot air defense systems from the U.S., warning that existing systems are insufficient. U.S. President Donald Trump later rejected the offer. 

While Ukraine presses for an unconditional ceasefire, in line with proposals from the U.S., Russia continues to reject the terms. It has reportedly intensified its aerial campaign and offensive operations across the front line. 

Over the past week, the Ukrainian air force downed 442 Russian Shahed kamikaze drones and over 230 other attack drones, as well as 31 Kh-101/Kh-55SM cruise missiles, seven Iskander ballistic missiles, six Kalibr cruise missiles, and four Kh-59/Kh-69 guided air-launched missiles, the Air Force reported on April 27. 

Apart from the front-line areas, Russian attacks targeted cities all over Ukraine, with a mass drone and missile attack on Kyiv overnight on April 24 killing 12 people and injuring 90, including children.

Conservationists fear fallout from president's proclamation on fishing in federally protected area of Pacific Ocean

Environmental conservation groups are expressing major concerns over Donald Trump's recent proclamation to reverse fishing regulations across the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine national monument, a federally protected area in the central Pacific Ocean spanning nearly 500,000 sq miles.

As one of the most pristine tropical marine environments in the world, the monument is now at risk following Trump's decision last week to unleash American commercial fishing in the area with far-reaching environmental consequences.

Established by George W Bush in 2009 and expanded by Barack Obama in 2014, the monument encompasses seven federally protected islands and atolls, as well as 165 seamounts – underwater mountains that are biodiversity hotspots.

In addition to being home to many threatened, endangered and depleted species including 22 kinds of seabirds, green and hawksbill turtles, giant clams, bumphead parrotfish, dolphins and whales, the monument contains fragile ecosystems surrounding some of the world's most ancient coral colonies.

It is also home to Kingman Reef, the most undisturbed coral reef within the US. According to Unesco, Kingman Reef has the greatest proportion of apex predators of any coral reef ecosystem that has been studied in the world. It hosts various shark species roam including grey reef sharks, as well as as oceanic white tips, hammerheads and silky sharks – all of which provide critical ecological balance.

Trump's proclamation – which American Samoan tuna lobbyists heavily advocated for – allows US-flagged vessels to fish commercially within 50 to 200 nautical miles of the monument's boundaries. The proclamation – which comes as more than 80% of the world's coral reefs have been hit by the worst global bleaching event on record – also directs the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, to “amend or repeal all burdensome regulations that restrict commercial fishing” in the area.

As part of his quest to make the US the “world's dominant seafood leader”, Trump called the regulations “so horrible and so stupid”, saying that American fishers are being “forced to go and travel four to seven days to go and fish in an area that's not as good”.

David Henkin, an attorney for the environmental conservation group Earthjustice, pushed back on Trump's claims that federal regulations are hindering American fishers.

“When he is saying that fisher folks from Hawaii or American Samoa need to travel for days to go fish. Well, you need to travel for days to get to these remote Pacific islands. They're some of the most remote places on Earth … and they're certainly not right next to Hawaii,” Henkin said.

According to a 2023 study, in the last five years, the US-flagged purse-seine fleet only spent 0.52% of their effort fishing in the two areas where commercial fishing is currently allowed in the Pacific Islands Heritage area.

Echoing similar sentiments as Henkin, David McGuire, the founder of the shark conservation group Shark Stewards, said: “It's grandstanding … These fishermen don't travel 2,000 or 3,000 miles … They're already out there, four or five hundred miles. There is no incentive for them to go to the more central islands.”

Environmental experts also point to Trump's mass firings across the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – which manages the monument – as well as his efforts to set the federal government's top scientific agencies on to a “non-science trajectory”.

“You will no longer have staff, you won't have the science and you won't have the management biologists in Washington or elsewhere at universities that are funded by National Fisheries or Noaa,” McGuire said.

Other concerns surrounding the proclamation's environmental impact is the potential rise in illegal fishing as well as bycatch. Research has shown that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) accounts for one of every five fish caught in the wild.

Speaking to the Guardian, Arlo Hemphill, Greenpeace's US project lead on ocean sanctuaries, said: “Having a legal commercial fishery provides cover for illegal fishing. If you just see a fishing boat going through waters, you are not there watching what they're catching.”

Furthermore, despite sharks playing a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems, more than 100m of the oft-misunderstood animals are killed every year as part of bycatch and shark-finning.

Douglas McCauley, a marine biology professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, warned that the proclamation can have profound impacts on shark conservation. “You can catch a lot of the tuna that you want, but you also catch and kill many sharks,” he said.

Essential to nutrient cycling, prey and invasive species control, as well as disease reduction, sharks have existed for over 450m years. Yet Trump's proclamation can rapidly undo years of shark conservation in just minutes. “If you open up a section of ocean that has all of these very long-lived, slow-growing sharks, you can decimate 100 years of conservation in almost 15 minutes of fishing because it takes so long for those sharks to rebound and regrow their populations,” McCauley said.

Other marine animals at risk in the monument are sea turtles. With six of the global seven sea turtle species being classified as threatened or endangered worldwide due to human activity, many come into the islands to feed around the reefs.

However, Trump's proclamation puts them at risk in various ways, with McCauley saying: “Either they take a hook and bite on to the hook or drown because they cannot come up to breathe in a longline fishery, or they are scooped up and drown in the course of purse-seine fishing.”

Speaking to the Guardian, Solomon Kaho'ohalahala, a Hawaiian elder and leader with the Pacific Island Heritage Coalition, which advocates for the monument, pointed to the interconnectedness of the islands to the broader ocean.

“It's an integrated kind of ecosystem that isn't isolated by just the islands themselves … It's difficult to think that we can divide them into separate areas and then be successful in preserving all of them. It doesn't work that way,” he said.

For environmental experts, in addition to fragile ecosystems, Trump's proclamation will negatively impact American fishers in the long run, leading to higher seafood prices for American consumers.

Research has repeatedly shown spillover benefits from large marine protected areas including increases in catch rates outside of the areas. Opening up the monument for commercial fishing will have what Hemphill describes as the “opposite effect” of what Trump's administration hopes for.

“The current administration has its mentality of ‘let's become the greatest seafood producer.' But if you take everything, then you over-exploit and the populations collapse. Then what you'll see in the long term is actually a reduction of catch,” he said.

Similarly, Kaho'ohalahala said: “Opening this sacred place for exploitation is short-sighted and does not consider current or future generations of Pacific People who rely on a healthy ocean, and know this special ocean space as our ancestral home.”

With mounting concerns surrounding the Trump administration's environmental impact, marine experts are urging the public to consider the ecological and cultural significance of marine regulated areas that are akin to national parks.

“It's a special piece of America… It's as if we had just allowed commercial hunting into a place like Yellowstone,” McCauley said.

At least 11 people have been killed and over 20 others injured after a man drove a car into a crowd during a street festival in Vancouver, local police said on Sunday.

The driver has been taken into custody.

“We will provide more information as the investigation unfolds,” the police force added.

Prime Minister Mark Carney, who changed the scheduling of his campaign events following news of the incident, said the police described it as a “car ramming attack.”

“An investigation is ongoing to determine how and why this horrific attack occurred. Authorities have confirmed one person is [in] custody and it is believed they acted alone.”

Images from the scene show the police investigating a black SUV which has its hood crumpled and engine underneath exposed.

Police said they arrested the suspect, a 30-year-old Vancouver man, at the scene and that its Major Crime Section is overseeing the investigation.

“At this time, we are confident that this incident was not an act of terrorism,” the police department posted on Sunday.

The man was arrested after bystanders initially apprehended him, Interim Vancouver Police Chief Steve Rai said at a news conference.

Social media videos showed a man wearing a black hoodie with his back against a chain-link fence, flanked by a security guard and bystanders who were screaming and swearing at him.

“I'm sorry,” the man said while holding his hand to his head.

Rai did not comment on the video, but described the person in custody as a “lone male” who was “known to police in certain circumstances.”

Rai told reporters during a later press conference that those injured in the attack were taken to nine different hospitals and the number of dead “could rise in the coming days or weeks.” He said victims are both male and female and that “young people” are included among the dead.

“I said it's the darkest day in Vancouver's history and I stand by that,” he said.

One witness told CTV News he saw a black vehicle driving erratically in the area of the festival just before the crowd was struck.

The Vancouver Sun reported that thousands of people were in the area. Fraser Street was filled with food trucks and people at the time of the attack.

“I didn't get to see the driver, all I heard was an engine rev,” Yoseb Vardeh, co-owner of food truck Bao Buns, said in an interview with Postmedia.

“I got outside my food truck, I looked down the road and there's just bodies everywhere,” Vardeh said, his voice breaking. ”He went through the whole block, he went straight down the middle.”

Speaking in Mississauga, Ont., on April 27, Poilievre said the loved ones of those who lost their lives in this attack will have a “deep hole in their hearts today, and we will try and fill that with love.”

“All Canadians are united in solidarity with the Filipino community,” the Tory leader said. “All Canadians are united with you in mourning the loss of these treasured lives.”

“I don't have the words to describe the sorrow that I'm feeling right now, but I want the Filipino community to know we're standing with you. You do not grieve alone,” he said in Burnaby, B.C.

Singh said he had not been briefed about the details of the mass casualty attack.

“We don't know any details about it, whether it turns out whatever the motive is, either way, the Filipino community was targeted, because this was a clearly Filipino event,” he said.

“We will work to provide more information as soon as we can,” he said.

“Our thoughts are with all those affected and with Vancouver's Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time.”

“We are in contact with the City of Vancouver and will provide any support needed,” Eby said. “My thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.”

Several world leaders or officials also extended condolences, including France's President Emmanuel Macron, UK's foreign minister David Lammy, Ukraine's foreign minister Andriy Sybiha, and Czech Republic's foreign minister Jan Lipavský.

Donald Trump has the chance to become the "greatest president in U.S. history" if he follows the "iconic" examples of previous incumbents such as John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, a Ukrainian lawmaker has told the Kyiv Independent.

"He wants to be great, and he wants to be remembered in history as a great president. And for him, Ukraine is his chance," Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, said.

Merezhko cited Kennedy's 1963 "Ich bin ein Berliner", and Reagen's 1987 "tear down this wall" speeches as moments in history when U.S. presidents were immortalized on the world stage. 

"And so for Trump, if he comes to Kyiv and says something like 'I'm Ukrainian' or 'We express solidarity with you, we are on your side, you're fighting for the right cause,' he will go down in history as a person who might eclipse even Kennedy and Reagan," he said.

"I believe that Trump really can become the greatest president in the history of the United States — he could become iconic."

The Trump administration has been spear-heading efforts to end Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine though concerns have been raised that the White House has been favouring the interests of Moscow over Kyiv.

Trump has applied various forms of pressure on Ukraine including temporarily cutting off military aid, but has yet to take any meaningful steps to force the Kremlin to make any concessions as part of a possible peace deal, even after a series of devastating Russian attacks against Ukrainian civilians.

But in a dramatic change of tone on April 26 after a meeting between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican, the U.S. president said "there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days."

"It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through banking or secondary sanctions?" Trump added.

Merezhko said it was clearly an "important meeting" and could potentially pave the way for more positive dialogue between Trump and Zelensky.

"If he uses this chance, he will become great," Merezhko said, adding: "If not, he will be remembered in a negative way."

Zelensky and Trump were among the many leaders who arrived in Vatican City to attend the funeral of Pope Francis, who died on April 21 after suffering a stroke, at the age of 88.

The White House described the meeting as a "very productive discussion," while Zelensky also called it a "good meeting," noting that they discussed "a lot one-on-one."

Latest updates:

Eleven people are dead and several are injured, police say, after a person drove a car through a Filipino street festival in Vancouver Saturday night. A suspect has been taken into custody.

The incident at a Lapu Lapu Day block party on the city's east side has shaken the tight-knit Filipino community and the region as a whole. 

Three eyewitnesses describe what they saw when a car struck revellers at a Filipino street festival in Vancouver on Saturday night.

The Associated Press

So far there are few details about the victims or the suspect. Here's a look at what we know so far.

At a Sunday morning press conference, the Vancouver Police Department said it has confirmed 11 people were killed.

“We believe dozens more are injured, some seriously, and the number of dead could rise in the coming days or weeks,” said Interim Vancouver Police Chief Steve Rai.

Two nearby hospitals declared a “Code Orange” late Saturday night, signifying mass casualty protocols were undertaken.

A witness's video of the aftermath of the incident, broadcast live on social media and verified by The Globe and Mail, shows several individuals attempting resuscitation efforts as first responders made their way onto the scene.

A man in his 30s is now in police custody. Witnesses allege the suspect fled the vehicle after it came to a stop. Police confirmed that bystanders held him at the scene until police arrived. 

The chief said the driver has “a significant history of interactions with police and healthcare professionals related to mental health.” He said the man is not yet being identified, as charges have not been laid.

  

 Police said early Sunday morning they are “confident that this incident was not an act of terrorism.”

Interim Chief Rai said investigators do have some details of the interaction between the suspect and bystanders.

Police say festival organizers were provided with wooden barriers to block off the road for the event, but it is not yet known whether they were in place when the vehicle drove into the crowd.

Some witnesses said the barriers had at times during the day not been in place to allow vendors and performers to pass through.

Further details about the victims and the conditions of those who were injured will be released once all have been identified and their families contacted, Interim Chief Rai said.

Thousands of people are estimated to have attended the festival throughout the day, including several high-profile attendees and dozens of performers including members of the Black Eyed Peas.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh visited the festival earlier in the day as he campaigned in Vancouver before Monday's federal election, and addressed the incident in nearby Burnaby, B.C., later that day. Liberal MP for Vancouver South Harjit Sajjan made his way to the scene late Saturday.

Several members of Vancouver City Council, including Lenny Zhou and Sean Orr, also attended the event and returned later in the day. Mr. Zhou said Mayor Ken Sim, who was out of town at the time, was on his way back to Vancouver.

Mr. Singh said he doesn't “have the words to describe the pain that I'm feeling now at the lives that were lost. … We don't know the motives, we don't know any of the details. But ultimately, this is something that targeted the Filipino community and the Filipino community right now is reeling."

Liberal Leader Mark Carney said he was briefed on the incident overnight and spoke with the B.C. Premier on Sunday.

“Last night, families lost a sister, a brother, a mother, a father, a son or a daughter. Those families are living every family's nightmare,” Mr. Carney said in Hamilton.

“And to them and to the many others who were injured, to the Filipino-Canadian community, and to everyone in the broader Lower Mainland Vancouver, I would like to offer my deepest condolences and my wishes for strength and compassion in this tragic time.”

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre visited a Filipino church in Mississauga on Sunday and said all of Canada stands with their community in mourning.

“I hope that we can pray for those who've been lost and for those who survive in mourning, their loved ones, their brothers, sisters, daughters, sons, mothers, fathers, all of them will have a deep hole in their hearts today,” Mr. Poilievre said.

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said on Sunday he was “shattered to hear about the terrible incident” in Vancouver. Marcos said the Philippine Consulate General in Vancouver was working with Canadian authorities to ensure that the incident would be thoroughly investigated.

The Vancouver mayor said in a statement that he was “shocked and deeply saddened.” 

“Our thoughts are with all those affected and with Vancouver's Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time,” Mr. Sim said.

B.C. Premier David Eby said in a post on X that he's “shocked and heartbroken” to hear about the lives lost and those injured at the festival.

King Charles said he was saddened by the news.

“Both my wife and I were profoundly saddened to learn of the dreadful attack an utterly tragic loss of life in Vancouver, which took place as the Filipino community came together to mark the celebration of one of their most special festivals,” he said in a statement posted on X. 

Lapu Lapu Day is named after an Indigenous resistance fighter in the Philippines who fought against Spanish colonization in the 16th century.

Saturday's event was the second annual street celebration of Lapu Lapu Day in Vancouver, and organizers had said it was an opportunity to mark “the enduring impact on Filipino values, notably the spirit of bayanihan – the collective community effort.”

Filipino BC, which presented the event, said in a statement early Sunday morning that it is devastated for the families and victims. 

“We are still finding the words to express the deep heartbreak brought on by this senseless tragedy.”

Nine people were killed after a man drove through a crowd at a Filipino community festival in Vancouver on Saturday, April 26. A 30-year-old man was arrested at the scene, but police say they were confident it was not an act of terror.

MOSCOW, April 27. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian over the aftermath of the explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port.

"Please accept my deepest condolences over the loss of life and the massive destruction caused by the explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port. Please convey my sincere sympathy and support to the families and friends of the victims, as well as wishes for a speedy recovery to all those injured," the telegram published on the Kremlin website reads.

The President also expressed Russia's readiness to assist in eliminating the aftermath of the tragedy.

On Saturday, April 26, a powerful explosion occurred in the port of Shahid Rajaee, located in the city of Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf. According to the latest data, 25 people were killed and almost 1,400 were injured. The cause of the explosion was not officially announced. According to The New York Times, sodium perchlorate, which is used in solid rocket fuel, may have detonated in the port.

Eleven people are dead after an SUV barreled through a large Filipino street festival in Vancouver Saturday evening, in what Vancouver Police Department Interim Chief Steve Rai has called “the darkest day in our city's history.” 

“We believe dozens more are injured, some seriously, and the number of dead could rise in the coming days or weeks,” Mr. Rai said at a press conference in Vancouver on Sunday morning. 

He said investigators are still working to determine the motive for the attack, but police don't believe it was an act of terrorism.

Mr. Rai described the 30-year-old driver as having “a significant history of interactions with police and police and health care professionals related to mental health.” 

He said the man, who is from Vancouver, is not currently being identified, as charges haven't been laid against him yet. He is currently in a secure cell in police custody.

The names, ages, or genders of the victims are also not yet being released. 

“It is impossible to overstate how many lives have been impacted forever by this lone individual. There are many unanswered questions about this horrific crime, the motive of the person who did it, and whether anything could have been done to prevent it,” Mr. Rai said. 

“There are many things we still don't know. We are working hard to get all of the answers.” 

The attack happened shortly after 8 p.m. on Saturday night, when a man driving a black Audi SUV drove into a large crowd of people at the Lapu Lapu street festival, which was happening near John Oliver Secondary School at 41st Street and Fraser Street. 

Mr. Rai said the event was wrapping up around that time, but there were still many people in the area when the SUV approached from the west and entered a small, enclosed area where food trucks were parked. 

The SUV then drove into the crowd, striking multiple people before coming to rest in the street. 

The driver of the vehicle was apprehended by people at the scene and taken into police custody. 

Videos from the scene showed bodies strewn on the ground, as people tried to resuscitate and aid the injured. A black SUV could be seen on the road, with its hood and bumper crushed. 

Mr. Rai said the vehicle is owned by someone associated with the family of the accused. 

“It is hard to make sense of something so senseless, and I know there are questions about whether this tragedy could have been prevented,” Mr. Rai said.

He said police worked with the City of Vancouver to conduct a risk assessment before the festival, most of which took place on the grounds of the high school, not directly accessible via public roadway. 

“We review over 3,200 events every year, and assess the risks with City partners. This event was no exception,” he said. 

“We determined through consultations with the City of Vancouver and festival organizers that dedicated police officers and heavy vehicle barricades would not be deployed at the festival site.”

Mr. Rai says he's confident that the joint risk assessment and public safety plan for the event was sound, but that police will be reviewing the circumstances around the attack. He said “it goes without saying this will change the landscape for deployment for police going forward.” 

He said more than 100 police officers are currently working on the investigation, working with the injured, interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence from the crime scene.

Soft conversation and music fill the cafe but it's the figure behind the glass that commands the room. Whether joking about a bathroom break or announcing a new order, the barista's voice rises above the chatter. Drinks come and go but no one is behind the counter.

At NCM Cafe in San Jose, the first in its county to feature an AI-powered robot barista, robot C isn't just a part of the shop—it's the centerpiece.

As C's recent debut paves the way for robot baristas to appear in coffee shops across Silicon Valley, some see innovation and novelty.

But in San Jose's deeply rooted local coffee scene, where shops like Roy's Station, Nirvana Soul, and Chromatic Coffee Co. take pride in creating a sense of community, some are wondering what's lost when the human touch disappears.

For shops like Roy's Station in San Jose's Japantown, community is part of their identity. Longtime customer Alicia Arranaga, who visits with her daughter two to three times a week, says she thrives off of the experience of meeting new people and making connections. She finds herself coming back for the warm atmosphere, where the same barista talks to her family each visit.

Owner Jasmine Rast recognizes that the sense of community is what sets Roy's apart. It used to be her grandfather's gas station—her dad still sweeps the sidewalks and her mom and takes care of the plants. For Rast, interaction with servers is the gem of local businesses.

“Being a barista is more than just making drinks,” says Dap Ashaolu, owner of Nirvana Soul in downtown San Jose. He thinks that providing good customer service by treating people kindly and creating genuine connections is something that people will be better at than robots for a long time.

While robot baristas may not provide the same experience as humans, regulars at NCM may be surprised to find that C recognizes repeat customers through facial recognition technology. Carlos Alatorre, who enjoys supporting local coffee shops in San Jose and studied artificial intelligence in school, is not phased by the technology. However, he recognizes that customers in the United States may not be as comfortable. “Would people want their data being used like that, without them knowing?”

In the United States, privacy concerns are more of an issue. Arranaga mentioned that she would not feel comfortable with a robot barista recognizing her face. “What are they doing with that information?”

But the conversation goes beyond just technology. Jacob Inda, a barista at Chromatic Coffee Co. in San Jose, thinks that “coffee is just as much an art as it can be a job.”

As a self-professed coffee geek, he values the shared experience of pushing further into coffee with others who also love the craft, something a robot cannot recreate.

For Inda, Chromatic represents both a community hub for local artists and regulars, and a place to have fun and experiment with coffee together.

NEW YORK, April 27. /TASS/. Sodium perchlorate used in solid rocket fuel could be the cause of an explosion at Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, The New York Times reported, citing a source in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC, the elite unit of Iran's armed forces).

However, the source did not specify what might have caused the substance to explode.

On Saturday morning, a powerful explosion occurred in Iran's Shahid Rajaee port on the Persian Gulf coast. According to the latest reports, at least eight people were killed and more than 750 injured. Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni arrived at the scene. The cause of the explosion has not yet been officially announced.

Reuters

11:40 JST, April 27, 2025

VATICAN CITY, April 26 (Reuters) – Presidents, royalty and simple mourners bade farewell to Pope Francis on Saturday at a solemn funeral ceremony, where a cardinal appealed for the pontiff's legacy of caring for migrants, the downtrodden and the environment to be kept alive.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who had clashed with the pope on those issues, sat with the rows of foreign dignitaries on one side of Francis' coffin in the vast St. Peter's Square.

On the other side sat cardinals who will pick Francis' successor at a conclave next month, deciding if the new pope should continue with the late pontiff's push for a more open Church or cede to conservatives who want to return to a more traditional papacy.

The Argentine pope, who reigned for 12 years, died at the age of 88 on Monday after suffering a stroke.

“Rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today's challenges, Pope Francis truly shared the anxieties, sufferings and hopes of this time,” said Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who presided over the funeral Mass.

In spiritual language, the 91-year-old Re gave a simple message: there was no going back. The first pontiff from Latin America had been “attentive to the signs of the times and what the Holy Spirit was awakening in the Church,” he said.

Francis repeatedly called for an end to conflict during his papacy. His funeral provided an opportunity for Trump, who is pushing for a deal to end Russia's war with Ukraine, to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy inside St. Peter's Basilica.

Applause rang out as Francis' coffin, inlaid with a large cross, was brought out of the basilica and into the sun-filled square by 14 white-gloved pallbearers at the start of the Mass.

The Vatican estimated more than 250,000 people attended the ceremony, cramming the square and the roads around.

The crowds clapped loudly again at the end of the service when the ushers picked up the casket and tilted it slightly so more people could see.

Aerial views of the Vatican showed a patchwork of colours – black from the dark garb of the world's leaders, red from the vestments of some 250 cardinals, the purple worn by some of the 400 bishops and the white worn by 4,000 attending priests.

After the funeral, as the great bells of St. Peter's pealed in mourning, the coffin was placed on an open-topped popemobile and driven through the heart of Rome to St. Mary Major Basilica.

Francis, who shunned much of the pomp and privilege of the papacy, had asked to be buried there rather than in St. Peter's — the first time a pope had been laid to rest outside the Vatican in more than a century.

The burial itself was conducted in private.

The popemobile left the Vatican from the Perugino Gate, a side entrance just yards away from the Santa Marta guesthouse where Francis had chosen to live, instead of the ornate Renaissance apartments in the papal palace.

Crowds estimated by police as numbering some 150,000 lined the 5.5-km (3.4-mile) route to St. Mary Major. The scene resembled many popemobile rides Francis took in his 47 trips to all corners of the world.

Some in the crowd waved signs and others threw flowers towards the casket. They shouted “viva il papa” (long live the pope) and “ciao, Francesco” (goodbye, Francis) as the procession made its way around Rome's ancient monuments, including the Colosseum.

The last time Trump had met Zelenskiy was in the White House in late February, when he gave him a public dressing down, but Saturday's encounter appeared more cordial.

In one photograph released by Zelenskiy's office, the two men were sitting close together on red-backed chairs, leaning towards each other as they talked in the marble-floored church.

A White House official said they had a “very productive discussion” and Zelenskiy called it a “good meeting”.

Among the other heads of state who attended the funeral were the presidents of Argentina, France, Gabon, Germany, the Philippines and Poland, together with the prime ministers of Britain and New Zealand, and many royals, including the king and queen of Spain.

Francis' death ushered in a meticulously planned period of transition, marked by ancient ritual, pomp and mourning. Over the past three days, around 250,000 people filed past his open coffin, laid out before the altar of the cavernous basilica.

Choirs at the funeral sang Latin hymns and prayers were recited in various languages, including Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese and Arabic, reflecting the global reach of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church.

Many of the faithful camped out overnight to try to secure spots at the front of the crowd, while others hurried there in the early morning.

“When I arrived at the square, tears of sadness and also joy came over me. I think I truly realised that Pope Francis had left us, and at the same time, there is joy for all he has done for the Church,” said a French pilgrim, Aurelie Andre.

Francis, the first non-European pope for almost 13 centuries, battled to reshape the Church, siding with the poor and marginalised, while challenging wealthy nations to help migrants and reverse climate change.

“Francis left everyone a wonderful testimony of humanity, of a holy life and of universal fatherhood,” said a formal summary of his papacy, written in Latin, and placed next to his body.

Traditionalists pushed back at his efforts to make the Church more transparent, while his pleas for an end to conflict, divisions and rampant capitalism often fell on deaf ears.

The pope carried his desire for greater simplicity into his funeral, having rewritten the elaborate, book-long funeral rites used previously.

He also opted to forego a papal tradition of three interlocking caskets made of cypress, lead and oak. Instead, he was placed in a single, zinc-lined wooden coffin.

His tomb has just “Franciscus”, his name in Latin, inscribed on the top. A reproduction of the simple, iron-plated cross he used to wear around his neck hangs above the marble slab.

Attention will now switch to who might succeed him.

The secretive conclave is unlikely to begin before May 6, and might not start for several days after that, giving cardinals time to hold regular meetings beforehand to sum each other up and assess the state of the Church, beset by financial problems and ideological divisions.

NEW YORK, April 27. /TASS/. Donald Trump's activity as US President in his first 100 days in office meets the expectations of seven out of ten Americans, according to the results of a public opinion poll conducted by the NORC research center among over 1,200 Americans for the Associated Press news agency.

Only three out of ten respondents said their expectations did not match Trump's actions. According to the news agency, this does not mean that the majority of Americans are satisfied with the policies of the current US leader. A total of 44% of respondents believe that Trump has set the wrong priorities, while 24% agree with his choice. In addition, 62% of respondents believe that the US is going in the wrong direction under Trump.

Overall, four in ten respondents approve of Trump's performance as president. About a third of Americans polled said they approve of Vice President J.D. Vance's performance. Four in ten respondents had a favorable opinion of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., weighs in on the state of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, why Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and whether the Trump administration is in compliance regarding the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

As Russia continues its warfare against Ukraine, one outspoken Republican senator is encouraging President Donald Trump to put Russian President Vladimir Putin in his place.

"Putin has reneged on every promise that he has made to President Trump. His latest proposal is, well, nothing. He wants to keep all the territory that he's taken," Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said on the latest installment of "Fox News Sunday."

"He wants to prohibit Ukraine from joining NATO, and he wants America and Europe to stop helping Ukraine," he added. "I think that Putin thinks that America has taken the bullet train to Chumptown."

A recent Fox News poll indicated that 36% of the American people do not approve of President Trump's job performance on Russia, and 39% don't approve of his handling of Ukraine. Voters are also split over what to do when it comes to U.S. support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

More airstrikes from Moscow continued overnight in Ukraine following days of military fighting, around the same time as President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met face-to-face for the first time since their infamous Oval Office spat in February, as they were attending Pope Francis' funeral in Rome.

"I think he thinks we're afraid of him," Sen. Kennedy said of Russia's leader. "He has jacked around President Trump at every turn. He has disrespected our president. I don't think it's gonna get any better until we make it clear to Mr. Putin that we are willing to turn him and his country into fish food."

On Thursday, Trump demanded Putin "stop" strikes on Kyiv and said he was "not happy" with the Kremlin for continuing attacks on Ukraine. The day before, on Wednesday, Trump blasted Zelenskyy after he said that Ukraine would not recognize Russian control over Crimea, which Putin invaded in 2014.

Putin so far has rejected several U.S. proposals for a peace deal, but the White House remains optimistic about Trump's ability to end the war.

"We need to get Russia down and choke them. They're not going to come to the table otherwise," Kennedy said Sunday. "I want a settlement in Ukraine. We also have to ask Europe to do better. Europe's got to start paying its own bills."

"If it wasn't for the American taxpayer, Putin would be in Paris right now. Europe's gotta do more. But mainly," he emphasized, "we've got to make Putin understand that there is a price to be paid for his jacking our president around."

            An arrest has been made in the investigation of the theft of a high-end Gucci bag belonging to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN.
    


            One person is in custody and multiple additional arrests are expected in a theft ring recently targeting Washington, DC's, Penn Quarter area, the source said.
    


            Authorities have not yet released specific details about the man's identity, but the arrest came after the US Secret Service launched an investigation to find the perpetrator who stole her bag as she ate dinner with her family on Easter Sunday.
    


            A spokesperson for the Secret Service initially declined to comment on the arrest, but in a statement to CNN Sunday, Washington Field Office Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool said the “the defendant is a serial offender.”
    


            “We have also determined that this incident had no protective nexus to Secretary Noem or her role as Secretary of Homeland Security. The investigation revealed alleged criminal activity, including potential device and credit card fraud,” McCool said.
    


            Noem thanked the US Secret Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a post on X on Sunday and described the man in custody as a “career criminal who has been in our country illegally for years.”
    


            “Unfortunately, so many families in this country have been made victims by crime, and that's why President Trump is working every single day to make America safe and get these criminal aliens off of our streets,” Noem wrote.
    


            As CNN previously reported, surveillance footage of the incident at The Capital Burger restaurant in Washington, DC, showed the suspect purposefully moving close to Noem as he zeroed in on her Gucci bag near her feet, a second law enforcement source said.
    


            The thief, dressed in dark clothing, sat down at an empty table next to Noem with his back facing her and used his left foot to slide the bag away, the source said. He surveyed the restaurant before eventually picking up the bag, covering it with his jacket and leaving.
    


            Only when Noem got up from the table did she realize her bag was missing, the source said.
    


            Items inside the bag included a Louis Vuitton Clemence wallet, Noem's driver's license, medication, apartment keys, passport, DHS access badge, makeup bag, blank checks, and about $3,000 in cash, multiple sources said.
    


            CNN reached out to The Capital Burger's parent company, Darden Restaurants, which did not respond to a request for comment.
    


            The Secret Service was inside the restaurant with Noem, who was dining at a table with her family, according to a source familiar. The source didn't specify how many agents accompanied Noem or where they were inside the restaurant.
    


            Commenting on the large sum of cash Noem was carrying immediately following the incident, a DHS spokesperson said: “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren – she was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities, and Easter gifts.”
    


            Law enforcement experts have raised concerns about whether the incident, which involved a thief getting so close to a Cabinet official and then absconding with her belongings, may have been a lapse in security.
    


            Secret Service “will maintain jurisdiction over the case and intends to present its findings to a federal court in coordination with the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia,” McCool said.

The man suspected to have stolen Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's high-value Gucci bag from a restaurant in Washington, D.C., has been arrested. 

The suspect is believed to be in the country illegally, Ed Martin, the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, said in an interview with NBC News.

It is not believed that the suspect targeted Noem because of her role in the federal government. The theft is part of multiple purse robberies believed to be a theft ring recently targeting Washington, D.C.'s Penn Quarter.

“This was not an amateur. This was a person, a thief, that knew how to do this. You could see how he scouted the room out,” Martin told the outlet. Authorities are looking for a second suspect who is also believed to be in the country illegally.

The investigation is being handled by the Metropolitan Police and the U.S. Secret Service. Martin said Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now involved due to the man's believed illegal status.

MILLIONS DO NOT HAVE A REAL ID. HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW BEFORE THE MAY DEADLINE

Noem was dining at the chain restaurant The Capital Burger last week when her purse containing $3,000 in cash, her passport, DHS access badge, Louis Vuitton wallet, apartment keys, and checkbook, was stolen. 

According to CNN, security footage of the theft showed the suspect moving close to Noem as he locked in on her Gucci bag near her feet. The man was dressed in dark clothing and sat down at an empty table next to Noem with his back facing her after surveying the restaurant. He then used his foot to slide the bag away.

            A year after his presidential ambitions collapsed, Gov. Ron DeSantis and his wife Casey can no longer lay claim to the future of the Republican Party. And in Florida, even their present is in jeopardy.
    


            Once firmly in his corner, many Sunshine State Republicans have lately turned on DeSantis, stymying his agenda and frustrating him to no end. At the same time, Casey DeSantis, long regarded as a political force in her own right, is encountering quiet but firm resistance as she lays the groundwork for a potential run to succeed her husband — a campaign that would pit her against President Donald Trump's handpicked choice to lead the state, Rep. Byron Donalds.

            Now, a funding scandal involving one of Casey's signature initiatives — a state assistance program known as Hope Florida — is casting a shadow over the governor's legacy and complicating her political ambitions. Lawmakers spent the spring investigating why $10 million from a state Medicaid settlement was routed to a charity connected to Hope Florida, which then transferred the same amount to two groups that financially backed a DeSantis-led campaign against legalizing recreational marijuana. Key lawmakers have publicly suggested the flow of money appears illegal.
    


            The couple have fiercely stood by their work and denied wrongdoing. DeSantis this week called the criticism of Hope Florida “all political.” Standing alongside her husband Thursday, Casey DeSantis characterized the program as “a philosophy” that “shows we can help people in need.”
    


            Remarkably, the investigation into Hope Florida was not by Democrats, but by Republicans — a striking sign of DeSantis' eroding clout in a state capital he once controlled with unchallenged authority. Outside Tallahassee, some of Trump's staunchest allies in Florida have helped to amplify the controversy to their MAGA followers.
    


            Amid the fallout, the DeSantises have grown increasingly isolated. Donors, fundraisers and operatives are fleeing their orbit, and at the moment, few in Florida politics seem willing to sign up for another campaign with the couple. Multiple people have turned down positions in a potential gubernatorial campaign, according to two sources who remain in contact with the governor's remaining team.
    


            “These days, I can't tell the difference between being their friend and their enemy,” a longtime Republican operative once close to the governor told CNN.
    


            Even among their remaining allies, there is a growing sense that Casey shouldn't announce a bid until the cloud hanging over the couple is lifted, though few people are willing to share those sentiments directly with them. Earlier this year, Ryan Tyson, the pollster for DeSantis' presidential campaign, gave the couple a blunt assessment of the hurdles Casey would face in trying to extend their political dynasty, according to one of the sources.
    


            “It wasn't well received,” the person said, “and no one has tried to give them advice since.”
    


            As they mount a public defense, the couple is also privately engaged in an intensifying lobbying campaign to keep Trump's involvement in the Florida Republican primary to a minimum. Casey joined Trump for a round of golf and DeSantis was recently spotted playing with the president's son, Eric, at Trump National Doral Miami. They also recently dined with Trump.
    


            But soon after these engagements, Donalds accompanied Trump to a UFC event in Florida – a joint appearance that signaled to many that the overtures from Ron and Casey had fallen short.
    


            A visibly exasperated DeSantis, watching Tallahassee allies drift away from him and his legislative priorities, recently asked aloud during a press conference: “Why the hell are they doing this?”
    


            Casey DeSantis launched Hope Florida in 2021 with a mission to wean people off government assistance by connecting them with faith-based and other charitable help in their communities. It quickly became her hallmark project as she built up her profile, regularly distributing novelty checks carrying the state seal and her signature. Eventually, Casey and Ron DeSantis would tout the program in other states as they campaigned for president as a one-two punch in 2023.
    


            Around that time, the Florida Department of Children and Families created the Hope Florida Foundation, a separate nonprofit entity assigned to bolster the state program. In its first year, the foundation raised about $800,000 in donations and awarded only $40,000 in financial assistance, according to a recently released tax return.
    


            Last year, the foundation saw its coffers boom by $10 million. At the time, few people noticed. But a Florida House committee probing the organization discovered the source of the windfall: A state settlement with Centene, a Medicaid contractor that had overbilled Florida and other states. The agreement with Centene included an unusual provision that required the company to donate $10 million to the Hope Florida Foundation.
    


            Within days of the donation, the foundation awarded two $5 million grants to a pair of political groups, according to documents first reported by the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald and provided to CNN by the foundation's lawyer, Jeff Aaron. The two organizations then sent $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a committee that spearheaded the successful fight last November against a ballot measure that would have amended the state constitution to legalize recreational marijuana.
    


            Keep Florida Clean was operated by James Uthmeier, the governor's chief of staff at the time who DeSantis later named Florida's attorney general. Uthmeier has denied any wrongdoing.
    


            After the election, campaign finance records show Keep Florida Clean shifted $1.2 million to the Florida Freedom Fund, a political committee controlled by the governor. The committee could ultimately be used to support Casey DeSantis' political ambitions. A spokesperson for the governor's political operations did not respond to a request for comment.
    


            State Rep. Alex Andrade, a Republican who led the House investigation, told CNN the money trail “looks very much like wire fraud and money laundering to me.” On Thursday, he announced his committee has concluded its work, but he has publicly encouraged law enforcement agencies to review the committee's findings.
    


            “I hope @PamBondi is paying attention,” Andrade wrote on X, tagging Trump's attorney general and former top prosecutor in Florida. Bondi's office declined to comment.
    


            DeSantis contended at an appearance earlier this month that the $10 million was separate from the state settlement and “kind of like a cherry on top, where they agreed to make an additional contribution.” Bryan Griffin, a spokesman for the governor, argued that neither Ron or Casey DeSantis has a role in the Hope Florida Foundation and said the state program “has been extremely successful and has helped 30,000 Floridians reduce or eliminate reliance on public assistance.”
    


            Other elements of Hope Florida illustrate the coziness between the governor's political orbit and his wife's top priority.
    


            The chairman of the Hope Florida Foundation is Joshua Hay, the CEO of Indelible Solutions, a company that the state has paid tens of millions of dollars – including for work related to Hope Florida – since he joined the charity, the Times and Herald reported. His company donated $125,000 to DeSantis' 2022 reelection. A board member for the foundation, Tina Vidal-Duart, is executive vice president for CDR Enterprises, a consulting company that donated $1 million to a Super PAC that supported DeSantis' presidential campaign. Her husband Carlos Vidal is the company president and CEO.
    


            Several of the foundation's top donors contributed to DeSantis' political committee as well, including Centene, according to tax documents and campaign finance records.
    


            And then there's Unite Us, a health technology company hired to build the web-based portal that connects people in need to local services. Unite Us rostered a noteworthy team of lobbyists that included Dane Eagle, DeSantis' former Secretary of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity; his former chief of staff Adrian Lukis and former deputy chief of staff Courtney Coppola. Nine days after the state executed the contract with Unite US, DeSantis' presidential campaign announced Coppola and Eagle would serve on his national finance committee.
    


            The state awarded the $3.9 million deal to Unite Us despite a track record of supporting initiatives that clashed with DeSantis' crackdown on progressive priorities, like promoting transgender rights and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The technology company's positions on those issues could provide Republican foes another attack line against Casey DeSantis tied to Hope Florida.
    


            In the past, Unite Us had publicly boasted on its website its commitment to diversity in hiring, gender neutral restrooms at its New York and Los Angeles offices and use of gender pronouns on internal communications. Days after Casey DeSantis barnstormed through Iowa in June 2023 sporting a custom-made leather jacket embroidered with the slogan “Where Woke Goes to Die,” Unite Us announced a workplace culture award, noting its DEI efforts and that most of its staff were women, non-binary and minorities.
    


            “In so many organizations, ‘diversity,' ‘equity,' and ‘inclusion' are just big-ticket buzz words,” said a quote on archived web page for Unite Us. “But at Unite Us, diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to our mission.” The webpage no longer appears to be operational.
    


            The governor's office said he had no involvement in the awarding of the Unite Us contract. Miguel Nevarez, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said a team of negotiators for the contract unanimously selected Unite Us.
    


            Nevarez also noted that DCF has provisions in its contracts “that restricts the use of any state funds for the purpose of promoting, advocating for, or providing training or education on “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.” The contract with Unite Us specified that the portal could not “list categories or subcategories related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.”
    


            Close allies of Trump are gleefully watching the funding scandal unfold. Roger Stone, Trump's longtime political adviser, recently dissected the scandal on his podcast with the help of the Florida Democratic Party leader. Laura Loomer, a deeply devoted Trump ally and a regular DeSantis tormenter, has amplified the developments out of Tallahassee to her 1.6 million followers on X.
    


            Former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who remains close to Trump and is weighing his own gubernatorial run, has also seized on the controversy through his One America News program.
    


            DeSantis has responded with characteristically aggressive counter attacks and has accused Republican lawmakers of attempting to smear his wife for political gain. He has also sought to fundraise off the controversy, asking donors to send money to his political committee to fight “squishy” House Republicans, according to an email obtained by CNN.
    


            “Some people feel threatened by the first lady. Let's just be clear about that,” DeSantis said at a press conference earlier this month. “If you're looking at 2026 and you've got some horse, you don't want her anywhere near that. You're very worried because she runs circles around their people. Everybody knows that.”

            Pope Francis had a great sense of humor. When I met him once at the back of the papal plane, I cracked a joke with him that was a little bit close to the line. Luckily, he roared with laughter and told me “Sei cattivo!” (“You're naughty!”). Every day, he used to say, he prayed the words of St. Thomas More: “Lord, give me a sense of humor.”
    


            Francis took what he did seriously. But he never took himself too seriously.
    


            One thing that struck me about him was his intuition and pastoral instincts. Whatever the situation, he always seemed to find the right words to say. When I met him with my family one time, my youngest child was crying.
    


            “Whenever they see a man in white, they think I'm a doctor and about to give them some medicine!” he joked.
    


            His ability to read people was also vital in his leadership. When he met bishops, he would get them into a circle and ask which one wanted to start speaking. It allowed him to understand the dynamics of a group, which helped him make appointments and decisions in the future.
    


            Francis liked to make himself accessible. He would say his door was always open – but that same door also had a sign on it that read “no whining.”
    


            There was never a dull moment covering his pontificate. As pope, he gave more media interviews than anyone else, but he never had a spokesperson or media advisers. Predicting his next move was notoriously difficult, and when it came to appointing new cardinals, no one knew in advance who he'd be choosing or when. New cardinals would talk about their phones blowing up in the middle of a Mass as people tried to contact them to tell them the news.
    


            Francis wasn't naïve, however. He was a politically savvy pope, very decisive and often stubborn. He wanted to stay true to himself and not become scripted. My enduring memory is of a very human pope who was full of surprises. He leaves big shoes to fill.

Follow:


            A dramatic, historic buzzer-beating dunk by Aaron Gordon sparked wild celebrations on Saturday night as the Denver Nuggets beat the Los Angeles Clippers 101-99 to tie their playoff first round series 2-2.
    


            With 1.8 seconds remaining, Nikola Jokić's airball appeared to signal that the game was headed to overtime with the scores tied at 99. But Gordon had other ideas, slamming the ball down with 0.1 seconds on the clock before wheeling away in jubilation.
    


            What followed was nearly three minutes of suspense as Gordon and Co. waited on the court for the referees to determine whether he had released the ball before the buzzer had sounded. When it was announced that he had, the Nuggets' celebrations restarted in earnest, and boos rang out from the crowd at Intuit Dome.
    


            Whether they wanted to or not, the LA crowd had just witnessed NBA history – Gordon's slam was the first game-winning, buzzer-beating dunk ever made in the playoffs since the dawn of the detailed play-by-play era in 1997-98.

            “Nice pass,” Gordon joked with Jokić at their post-game press conference.
    


            “Joker was trying to get in his bag with the Sombor Shuffle. He's made shots like that before. So, I'm just trying to clean up everything on the glass. He shot it with enough time to give us a chance to rebound it,” the former Slam Dunk Contest finalist added. “I was just in the right place at the right time.”
    


            The Nuggets led by two points at halftime, but arguably the most notable event up to that point had come with 6.6 seconds remaining in the second quarter.
    


            When James Harden was fouled by Christian Braun near midcourt, Harden began exchanging words with the Nuggets shooting guard. The resulting skirmish saw Gordon rush in and catch Norman Powell's face with an open hand.
    


            Despite Clippers fans chanting “Kick him out!” Gordon received a technical foul, along with Harden, Braun, Powell, Jokić and Kris Dunn.
    


            Denver went from strength to strength in the third quarter, outscoring LA 35-17 to open up an 85-65 lead. But, spurred on by 10 points by Kawhi Leonard, the Clippers fought back in the fourth quarter and took the lead for the first time in the game with 1:11 remaining thanks to Bogdan Bogdanović's offensive rebound and basket.
    


            A free throw and a basket from Jokić made it 99-97, before Ivica Zubac appeared to send the game to overtime. Gordon's heroics ensured that would not be the case.
    


            Gordon finished with 14 points, six rebounds and five assists. Jokić led the scoring with 36 points, 21 rebounds and eight assists – in doing so becoming only the fourth player in NBA history to rack up at least 35 points, 20 rebounds and eight assists in a playoff game.
    


            Braun and Michael Porter Jr. each added 17 points for Denver, while Leonard led the scoring for the Clippers with 24 points, nine rebounds and two assists.
    


            It is the second time in the series that the Nuggets have prevailed by fine margins – they won Game 1 by two points in overtime. Game 5 takes place in Denver on Tuesday night.
    


            Elsewhere in the NBA, Steph Curry ensured that the Golden State Warriors did not miss the injured Jimmy Butler, racking up 36 points, seven rebounds and nine assists in a 104-93 win over the Houston Rockets to take a 2-1 lead in the series.
    


            Meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder became the first team to make it to the second round of the playoffs, completing a four-game sweep of the Memphis Grizzlies with a 117-115 victory. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was back to his best after a difficult first three games in the series for the NBA MVP favorite, scoring 38 points.

Fox News Digital spoke with Ari Lightman, a digital media and marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University, on Casey Anthony's latest venture on Substack.

"America's most hated mom," Casey Anthony, is now raking in money in her latest lucrative venture as a subscription-based blogger.

Anthony was accused of killing her two-year-old daughter, Caylee, in 2008 but was found not guilty in 2011.

As the 39-year-old works to establish a new identity, she has turned to Substack, a platform that allows followers to pay to subscribe to personal writings, videos, and other communications.

"It has been more than 16 years since my name became a household one," Anthony wrote in her Substack bio. "Everyone seems to have an opinion — about me, and about my life. I am an advocate, a researcher. These are my words, this is my REAL life."

In Anthony's case, subscription prices start at $10 a month and can climb as high as $250 per year. The subscription price will allow followers to interact with Anthony.

The 39-year-old has over 5,000 subscribers to her Substack.

Fox News Digital spoke with Ari Lightman, a digital media and marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University, on Anthony's latest venture.

He emphasized how platforms like TikTok, which didn't exist during Anthony's trial, now allow public figures to reintroduce themselves to a new generation that is largely unaware of past controversies. 

"It's an opportunity for this person and this personality to do a refresh within the U.S. public and reinvent herself," he said.

Lightman noted the rise in engaging in content that people are opposed to, also known as "hate clicking."

"People enjoy hate-clicking on things or hate-reading and are fascinated with either the mystery or what they're up to now," he noted.

CASEY ANTHONY'S PARENTS TOOK POLYGRAPH TEST TO ‘CLEAR THEIR NAME,' EXPERT SAYS

On March 1, Anthony launched her TikTok account and quickly garnered thousands of followers.

"This is my first of probably many recordings on a series I am starting," Anthony said in a March 1 video posted to TikTok. "I am a legal advocate. I am a researcher. I have been in the legal field since 2011, and in this capacity, I feel that it's necessary if I'm going to continue to operate appropriately as a legal advocate that I start to advocate for myself and also advocate for my daughter."

She continued: "For those of you who don't know, my name is Casey Anthony. My daughter is Caylee Anthony. My parents are George and Cindy Anthony. This is not about them. This is not in response to anything that they have said or done. . . .The whole point of this is for me to begin to reintroduce myself."

Lightman wondered whether Anthony's ability to profit from her fame — even though it stems from scandal — will inspire more people to try to become famous.

"The question I would have is: Are we going to see this happen more and more often? This provides an example of people cashing in on their fandom. Does that imply that people will deliberately try to create fame — by any means necessary — whether positive, which is much harder to achieve, or through scandal, which is much easier?"

In 2008, Casey was charged with the murder of Caylee after the little girl was reported missing and later found dead in Orlando, Florida. 

The prosecution claimed that Casey had intentionally killed her daughter to free herself from parental responsibilities, while the defense argued that Caylee had accidentally drowned and that Casey's father had helped to cover it up.

In 2011, after a highly publicized trial, Casey Anthony was acquitted of the most serious charges, including first-degree murder, but was found guilty on four counts of providing false information to law enforcement.

The verdict sparked widespread outrage and debate, and Casey has remained a controversial figure ever since.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The top United Nations court on Monday will begin hearing from 40 countries on what Israel must do to provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

Last year, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice to weigh in on Israel's legal obligations after the country effectively banned the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main provider of aid to Gaza, from operating. The United States, Israel's closest ally, voted against the resolution.

Israel over a month ago again cut off all aid to Gaza and its over 2 million people. Israel has disputed that there is a shortage of aid in Gaza, and says it is entitled to block the aid because it says Hamas seizes it for its own use.

The Hague-based court has been asked to give an advisory opinion, a non-binding but legally definitive answer, in the latest judicial proceedings involving Israel and the 18-month war in Gaza. That is expected to take several months.

Set up in the aftermath of World War II, the ICJ is an organ of the U.N. and adjudicates disputes between countries. Certain U.N. bodies, including the General Assembly, can request advisory opinions from the court's 15 judges.

All 193 U.N. member states are members of the ICJ, though not all of them automatically recognize its jurisdiction.

Last year, the court issued an unprecedented and sweeping condemnation of Israel's rule over the occupied Palestinian territories, finding Israel's presence unlawful and calling for it to end. The U.N. General Assembly sought the opinion after a Palestinian request. The ICJ said Israel had no right to sovereignty in the territories, was violating international laws against acquiring territory by force and was impeding Palestinians' right to self-determination.




Two decades ago, the court in another advisory opinion held that Israel was violating international law by constructing a barrier between Israel and the West Bank. That opinion, also requested by the U.N. General Assembly, dismissed Israeli arguments that the wall was needed for security.

Israel has not participated in previous advisory opinion hearings but has submitted written statements.

South Africa went to the court last year to accuse Israel of genocide over its actions in the war in Gaza, which began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many are civilians or combatants. The offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble, and most of its people remain homeless.

Israel rejects South Africa's claim and accuses it of providing political cover for Hamas.

South Africa also asked judges to make nine urgent orders known as provisional measures. They are aimed at protecting civilians in Gaza while the court considers the legal arguments.

The court has ruled several times on that request, including ordering Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza. The proceedings are ongoing and likely to take years to reach a conclusion.

The International Criminal Court was established in 2002 as the court of last resort to prosecute those responsible for the world's most heinous atrocities: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression.

While the ICJ deals with disputes between two or more countries, the ICC seeks to hold individuals criminally responsible.

In November, a three-judge panel issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas' military chief, Mohammed Deif, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the war in Gaza.

The warrants said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and Gallant have used “starvation as a method of warfare” by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeted civilians in Israel's campaign against Hamas, charges Israeli officials deny.

The warrant marked the first time a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the global court of justice and has sparked major pushback from supporters of Israel, including the U.S.

Israel and its top ally, the United States, are not members of the court. However, Palestine is, and judges ruled in 2021 that the court had jurisdiction over crimes committed on Palestinian territory.

Iran and the United States held in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, ending the discussions with a promise for more talks and perhaps another high-level meeting next weekend.

Iran and the United States began in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, talks that likely will hinge on the Islamic Republic's enrichment of uranium. Iranian state television reported the talks had begun in Muscat, the mountain-wrapped capital of this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Iran and the United States held in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, ending the discussions with a promise for more talks and perhaps another high-level meeting next weekend.

The talks ran for several hours in Muscat, the mountain-wrapped capital of this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula. 

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state television after the talks that the parties exchanged written points throughout the day in discussions that he described as “very serious and work-focused.”

“This time, the negotiations were much more serious than in the past, and we gradually entered into deeper and more detailed discussions,” he said. “We have moved somewhat away from broader, general discussions — though it is not the case that all disagreements have been resolved. Differences still exist both on major issues and on the details.”

A senior U.S. administration official said that the talks were “positive and productive.” 

“This latest round of direct and indirect discussions lasted over four hours,” the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. “There is still much to do, but further progress was made on getting to a deal. We agreed to meet again soon, in Europe, and we thank our Omani partners for facilitating these talks.”

Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has mediated the two previous round of talks in Muscat and Rome, offered a positive note at the end of Saturday's negotiations. 




Iran and the U.S. “identified a shared aspiration to reach agreement based on mutual respect and enduring commitments,” al-Busaidi posted on X. “Core principles, objectives and technical concerns were all addressed. Talks will continue next week with a further high level meeting provisionally scheduled for May 3.”

Araghchi arrived Friday in Oman on the eve of the talks and visited the Muscat International Book Fair, surrounded by television cameras and photojournalists. Witkoff was in Moscow on Friday to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and arrived on Saturday to Oman.

Meanwhile on Saturday, a major explosion rocked a port in southern Iran just after the talks began, killing 18 people and injuring some 800 others. Authorities offered no immediate cause for the blast, which appeared to have been caused by a highly combustible material — though officials ruled out its oil and gas industry. The private security firm also linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant to the port as well.

The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on a half-century of enmity. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.

Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. 

Trump, traveling to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, again said that he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't.

“The Iran situation is coming out very well,” Trump said on Air Force One. “We've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.”

He added: “There are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal — a much nastier deal — and I don't want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.”

From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi headed up Tehran's expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.

The U.S. technical team was led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Anton doesn't have the nuclear policy experience of those who led Washington's efforts in the 2015 talks. 

Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. The demand that all enrichment stop also has been repeated by Rubio. 

However, Iranians remain hopeful that the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows during which it took more than 1 million rials to buy $1.

“It's OK to negotiate, to make the nuclear program smaller or bigger, and reach a deal,” Tehran resident Farzin Keivan said. “Of course we shouldn't give them everything. After all, we've suffered a lot for this program.”

Lord Andrew Roberts, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group, discusses a landmark report on the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas terrorists.

A Pennsylvania Air National Guardsman, once trusted with America's security, is facing federal charges after allegedly building explosives, promoting extremist violence and vandalizing a Jewish synagogue, all while lying about his loyalty to the U.S.

A federal grand jury in Pittsburgh returned a nine-count indictment against three Pittsburgh-area residents, acting United States Attorney Troy Rivetti announced this week. 

The indictment names Mohamad Hamad, 23, of Coraopolis; Talya A. Lubit, 24, of Pittsburgh; and Micaiah Collins, 22, of Pittsburgh, as defendants. 

Hamad and Lubit had previously been indicted for their roles in allegedly defacing Jewish religious property with pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel graffiti.

YALE DROPS ALLEGED HAMAS-TIED STUDENT GROUP'S STATUS AFTER 'DISTURBING ANTISEMITIC CONDUCT'

In an image included in a federal indictment, Mohamad Hamad allegedly posted a photo of himself wearing a Hamas-style headband and holding a combination Israeli-U.S. flag. (U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Pennsylvania)

According to an indictment, Hamad enlisted in the Air Force, Pennsylvania Air National Guard (PAANG) in 2023, joining the 171st Maintenance Squadron based near Pittsburgh International Airport. As part of his enlistment, he sought a top-secret security clearance.

While undergoing his background investigation, including three in-person interviews, Hamad allegedly made a series of false statements, swearing his "ultimate allegiance" was to the U.S​.

PALESTINIAN LEADER DEMANDS HAMAS RELEASE REMAINING HOSTAGES

In reality, court documents show Hamad privately celebrated terrorist groups and expressed deep hostility toward America. In messages, he stated, "It's still Palestine on top though make no mistake," and "let America lick my a--." He declared that Lebanon and Palestine were "number 1" in his heart and said he wanted to learn combat skills to protect them​.

Throughout late 2023 and 2024, while attending military training, Hamad allegedly shared violent pro-Hamas videos, glorified terrorist attacks and praised Hamas fighters as "freedom fighters," according to the indictment​.

A social media post allegedly shared by Mohamad Hamad shows a Hamas funeral procession with text expressing jealousy of fallen fighters and a wish to "fight and die," according to court documents.  (U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Pennsylvania)

The indictment further alleges that, during this same period, Hamad conspired with co-defendant Collins to manufacture and possess destructive devices. They allegedly purchased materials like potassium perchlorate and aluminum powder, built explosives including pipe bombs and detonated them during testing​.

One chilling conversation captured Hamad admitting he was "actually scared" of the bomb he built, while Collins excitedly discussed the potential to "take bros ankles."

Hamad's actions were not limited to building bombs. On social media, he openly posted images supporting Hamas operatives, expressed envy of jihadists killed in action and posted threats such as, "I can't wait until the day Muslims kill you. I would be so happy..."​

In a separate conspiracy, Hamad and Lubit allegedly targeted Chabad of Squirrel Hill, a synagogue and Jewish educational center in Pittsburgh. Wearing a Hamas-style headband, Hamad conducted surveillance of the synagogue. Lubit later allegedly spray-painted "Jews 4 Palestine" along with a red inverted triangle — a symbol used by Hamas to mark targets — onto the synagogue's exterior​.

In this undated photo from court documents, defendant Mohamad Hamad allegedly posted a picture of an assault rifle on social media with a caption that said "each bullet in this mag[azine] kisses the foreheads of the Zionist oppressor," according to a federal indictment. (U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Pennsylvania)

In encrypted messages, Lubit chillingly stated, "I can literally feel myself starting to see Jews as my enemies," according to the indictment​.

Federal investigators later linked Hamad and Lubit to additional vandalism of a Jewish Federation sign nearby, further escalating community concerns about targeted antisemitic threats.

"As alleged in the Superseding Indictment, Mohamad Hamad lied about his loyalty to the United States, among other false statements, in an attempt to obtain a Top-Secret security clearance," Rivetti said. "During that time, he openly expressed support for Lebanon, Hezbollah and Hamas." 

Rivetti emphasized that his office remains "resolute" in safeguarding the Jewish community and the public​.

"Protecting the American people is spelled out in the Mission of the FBI. That includes all our communities," said FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek. He vowed the FBI remains committed to investigating individuals who engage in "dangerous, menacing and illegal activities."

An image from court evidence shows a makeshift explosive device composed of spray paint cans and a fuse, allegedly manufactured by the defendants. (U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Pennsylvania)

The law provides for maximum penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for Hamad, five years and a $250,000 fine for Collins and one year and a $100,000 fine for Lubit, depending on the seriousness of the offenses and any prior criminal history.

Armed security personnel stand guard near ongoing roadwork in Aleppo, Syria on April 13.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar pledged to pay Syria's debt to the World Bank, removing one obstacle for the country's new leadership to receive funds from the international lender as it struggles to revive its war-hit economy.

The Gulf nations announced their commitment to pay off the roughly $15 million that's outstanding after high-level discussions on post-war Syria at the sidelines of the 2025 World Bank/International Monetary Fund spring meetings last week, as they seek to support economic recovery under the new government of President Ahmed Al-Sharaa.

China's Huawei Technologies is preparing to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, hoping to replace some higher-end products of U.S. chip giant Nvidia, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The Chinese company hopes that the latest iteration of its Ascend AI processors will be more powerful than Nvidia's H100, and is slated to receive the first batch of samples of the processor as early as late May, the report added.

Reuters reported on Monday that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month.

Huawei and its Chinese peers have struggled for years to match Nvidia in building top-end chips that could compete with the U.S. firm's products for training models, a process where data is fed to algorithms to help them learn to make accurate decisions.

Seeking to limit China's technological development, particularly advances for its military, Washington has cut China off from Nvidia's most advanced AI products, including its flagship B200 chip.

The H100 chip, for example, was banned from sale in China in 2022 by U.S. authorities before it was even launched.

Nvidia declined to comment while Huawei did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Sprawling, power-thirsty data centers have become as much a staple of suburbia in some places as shopping malls and soccer fields. However, when Microsoft pulled the plug on planned data centers in Ohio last month, it added to questions about whether the nascent data center boom had already gone bust. A Wells Fargo report last Monday saying some data centers planned by Amazon Web Services were being reconsidered added to market anxiety.

But the bust may have been over before it ever began. And if anything, a "pause" on some data center projects comes within a spending environment that remains strong.

"We continue to see accelerated scaling of AI deployments across the data center market, with strong demand signals reinforcing both our near- and long-term growth," said Giordano Albertazzi, CEO of Ohio-based data center supplier Vertiv on an earnings call last week. Its shared ended the week up 22%.

Amazon and Nvidia both reaffirmed last week that the data center market remains strong.

"There's been really no significant change," Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, said at a conference organized by the Hamm Institute for American Energy. "We continue to see very strong demand, and we're looking both in the next couple years as well as long term and seeing the numbers only going up."

That doesn't mean the strategic thinking about how, where and when exactly to spend isn't changing as the AI market evolves and breakthroughs need to be digested. In the span of six weeks this year, China's DeepSeek burst onto the scene, President Trump's $500 billion AI-powered Stargate initiative was announced, and concerns over tariffs and trade wars roiled markets.

"All of that has created a scenario where the data center industry is taking a bit of a pause, broadly," said Pat Lynch, executive managing director for commercial real estate company CBRE's Data Center Solutions. "I think it is a temporary pause," Lynch added, noting that the project pipeline and its funnel remain significant and CBRE continues to execute deals. "I remain cautiously optimistic about future demand, particularly when you think of large AI training models," Lynch said.

Microsoft had pledged a $1 billion investment in Ohio-based data centers in the same area where Intel has planned chip factories, but the timeline has slowed.

"After careful consideration, we will not be moving forward with our plans to build data centers at the Licking County sites at this time. We will continue to evaluate these sites in line with our investment strategy," a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.

A UBS report from last week concluded that among all the possible explanations for data center cancellations, it was most likely that Microsoft had overcommitted amid the AI rush, and was now zeroing in on the projects that currently make the most sense. It noted that Microsoft's leased capex was up 6.7x in the span of two years, with lease obligations of roughly $175 billion. "Microsoft bought up as much available leased data center capacity as it could in 2022-2024 and now has the visibility to eliminate some of these 'early-stage projects,'" UBS wrote. "We find the least support for the 'demand lull' explanation," its report added.

Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet CFO, described the cloud supply-demand environment as "tight" after its latest earnings on Thursday. "We could see variability in cloud revenue growth rates depending on capacity deployment each quarter," she said. "We expect relatively higher capacity deployment towards the end of 2025."

"We're not seeing a retreat from demand but a strategic reallocation," said John Carrafiell, co-CEO of BGO, a global real estate investment manager with $83 billion in assets under management, including a significant data center portfolio. The most significant players, he says, are not pulling back, with Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon planning to spend over $300 billion in capex this year-largely tied to AI infrastructure. And, he says, that doesn't include other major players, such as OpenAI and Oracle, both involved in the Stargate project.

"Rather than a bust, this is a reshuffling of the deck in an environment where power in particular, along with fiber, water, and land — are scarce and strategic," Carrafiell said. Long-term enterprise adoption will drive AI demand and data center demand for the next decade. "We aren't even in the first inning yet," he said. 

Power is the lifeblood of data centers, but data centers aren't plug-and-play operations, requiring copious amounts of electricity for computing power and fans to keep the infrastructure cool. As generative AI adoption moves from early experimentation to enterprise-scale application, the need for low-latency, high-efficiency data centers near end-users will intensify, but it will take time for the right set of conditions to line up with the expected data center square footage.

"New data centers are increasing in size so dramatically that the grid cannot keep up," said Allan Schurr, chief commercial officer of microgrid developer Enchanted Rock. Three years ago, a large data center was 60 megawatts — enough power to supply 20,000 homes, but now he says new data centers to support all the uses of artificial intelligence are requesting 500 megawatts or more.

This rapid growth in electricity use is on top of new demand from manufacturing and the electrification of transportation, which together are weighing on supply and infrastructure. Data centers pose a unique challenge to utilities, which must ensure they can supply power to all customers, even in times of peak demand. "This is why some utilities are quoting long interconnection wait times for data centers," Schurr said. "Utilities need to invest in new substations and may also need to expand transmission and generation, all of which takes time," he added. 

CBRE has seen data centers go from comprising 2% of its portfolio in 2022 to 10% in 2024, and Lynch expects that to keep growing, and power proximity is driving the current marketplace, as data center builders seek areas with access to plentiful power. Georgia, Texas, and Ohio all check a lot of the boxes builders are looking for, and if an area doesn't have the grid or infrastructure capacity, it needs to be able to scale up fast.

"Having large power availability inside of 36 months is attractive to clients," Lynch said.

Three percent of the world's power is now tied up in data centers, according to Datacenters.com.

Schurr said Enchanted Rock's data indicates there is plenty of power available to meet demand — most of the time. Of the 8,760 hours of the year, the grid is only under stress for a fraction of them. "If we can alleviate demand on the grid for those 100 to 500 hours, the long interconnection delays can be shortened," he said.

There is an important distinction to be made between the idea of a broader slowdown and some of the recent pauses enacted by major technology companies, according to McKinsey & Company senior partner Pankaj Sachdeva, who researches data center development and expects an ebb and flow.

Based on recent McKinsey modeling, which does not include tariffs impact, the data center market is expected to grow in the 20%–25% range over the next five to seven years, but year to year there will be variations in the growth rate. "It will not be linear," he said.

Tariff changes will introduce new cost pressures across AI and data center supply chains, particularly with critical mineral tariffs on the horizon.

"These disruptions will elevate hardware costs, impact sourcing strategies, and require businesses to rethink their long-term procurement models," said John Archer, senior delivery principal and supply chain transformation Leader at Slalom Consulting. In the short term, AI and cloud providers will need to implement cost-mitigation strategies such as renegotiating supplier contracts and optimizing inventory.

"Longer-term, a push towards geographic diversification, co-manufacturing in tariff-friendly regions, and deeper integration of AI-driven supply chain analytics can be expected to adapt to evolving trade policies," Archer said.

One factor that hasn't changed is that compute power is currently expensive, and much more of it is needed for AI software and hardware, according to Suresh Venkatesan, CEO of POET Technologies, a publicly-traded company that develops power solutions for data centers. "The explosion in AI challenges data centers to find more efficient solutions because AI requires compute power in such volume that it's unlike anything we have ever witnessed," he said. "While one data center project may hit a wall, others are likely to spring up, because there is no indication of a slowdown in demand for connectivity," he added.

Global stock markets continue to be volatile, influenced by the news around wavering tariffs and trade tensions. While the Trump administration's relaxation of certain tariffs could provide some relief, the ongoing uncertainties and macro challenges might continue to weigh on investor sentiment.

Given this scenario, investors can take cues from the recommendations of top analysts and pick some attractive stocks that have the ability to thrive despite short-term headwinds.

With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

First on this week's list is financial services company Charles Schwab (SCHW), which offers a wide range of brokerage, banking, and advisory services through its operating subsidiaries. On April 17, the company announced better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the first quarter of 2025.

Following the upbeat results and a positive conference call, TD Cowen analyst William Katz raised his 2024-2026 earnings estimates. He also reaffirmed a buy rating on Charles Schwab stock and increased his price target to $95 from $88, saying, "SCHW remains our top pick."

Katz noted that management's commentary was essentially bullish, highlighting positives like solid momentum in new business trends/demographics and operating leverage. He added that April started on a robust note for the company, thanks to strong trading, continued rise in client cash, relatively durable client margin balances, and likely solid net new assets (NNAs).

The analyst believes that despite positive EPS revisions and ongoing market volatility, his model is still conservative when it comes to key drivers like NNAs/client cash.

Katz sees the possibility for additional P/E multiple expansion, driven by robust/more consistent management execution, favorable organic growth dynamics, notable operating leverage, and rapid improvement in balance sheet flexibility.

Katz ranks No. 323 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.2%. See Charles Schwab Financials on TipRanks.

Next up is streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), which recently posted a significant earnings beat for the first quarter of 2025. Higher-than-expected subscriptions and ad dollars helped boost revenue and earnings in the quarter.

Impressed by the Q1 print, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated a buy rating on NFLX stock and raised the price target to $1,150 from $1,025. "NFLX continues to play offense in its business, while the stock remains defensive in the uncertain environment," said the analyst.

Anmuth noted that on the offensive side, Netflix offered solid content in Q1 2025, with "Adolescence" and three films breaking into the streaming platform's all-time most popular list. He added that the company is strategically raising prices, including the recently announced increase in France and the upcoming hikes in the U.S. and U.K. Another positive highlighted by Anmuth was the rise in Netflix's advertising business, supported by growing user scale and monetization.

On the defensive side, the analyst pointed out Netflix's subscription-based model, low churn, strong engagement and high entertainment value. Its low-priced ad tier ($7.99/month in the U.S.) also makes the service very accessible. While Netflix is not directly hit by tariffs, Anmuth noted that the company's shareholder letter and interview highlighted its commitment to international programming and production in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and the U.K.

Overall, Anmuth is bullish on Netflix  stock due to several positives, including the expectation of double-digit revenue growth in 2025 and 2026, a continued rise in operating margin despite growth investments, and a dominant position in the streaming space.

Anmuth ranks No. 81 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.3%. See Netflix Hedge Fund Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Finally, let's look at Verra Mobility (VRRM), a provider of smart transportation solutions like integrated technology to help customers manage tolls, violations, and vehicle registrations and school zone traffic cameras.

Recently, Baird analyst David Koning upgraded Verra Mobility stock to buy from hold with a price target of $27. The analyst highlighted the company's solid market position. He finds a tough macro environment as a good time to upgrade the stock, because he views "high-quality companies as less pressured by investors during tougher/uncertain times."

While Koning acknowledged the potential impact of macro pressures on travel volumes, he is bullish on Verra Mobility due to its strong moat. Specifically, the analyst noted the solid position of the company's Commercial unit via its rental vehicle toll transponders and the moat in its Government unit through products like speed/red light/school zone cameras.

Additionally, Koning emphasized the renewal of the New York City (NYC) contract, which accounts for nearly 16% of Verra Mobility's total revenue. The analyst also thinks that states/municipalities may require more cameras during a challenging macro environment to drive more ticket revenue.

Koning expects Verra's EPS estimates to be largely intact in a market where the earnings estimates of many companies could be lowered. At a valuation of 15x the 2026 EPS estimate, the analyst finds Verra stock attractive, given that it is a high-moat business.

Koning ranks No. 232 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 55% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.2%. See Verra Mobility Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Even the strongest and happiest relationships can falter when seemingly small, frustrating habits are left unaddressed. They slowly pile up until, suddenly, their weight seems unbearable.

When relationships end this way, exes often ruminate over the "straw that broke the camel's back." As a psychotherapist who has worked with over 100 couples, I've seen firsthand how some unchecked behaviors can drive a wedge between partners.

Here are the five most common and annoying habits that I've seen destroy relationships:

Instead of expressing their needs clearly, many people expect their partners to know exactly what they need, when they need it. But this is an easy way to set yourself up for disappointment.

Psychologists refer to it as the "illusion of transparency," a cognitive bias where people assume that their emotions and desires are obvious to others, when they really aren't.

And according to research, overestimating how much your partner knows about your internal thoughts can be harmful and lead to resentment, since communication is the foundation of a strong, healthy relationship.

DON'T MISS: How to change careers and be happier at work 

In successful relationships, both partners create a safe place where they can each express their needs and wants without fear or shame. So instead of expecting your partner to pick up on cues, just spell it out for them: "It'd mean a lot to me if you helped with the dishes tonight."

Healthy relationships can quickly turn sour when couples start tallying up each other's good deeds and missteps. Once one or both partners "keep score," the relationship eventually turns into a competition — and, sadly, one person usually comes up short.

Research shows that keeping track of who did what in a relationship — whether it's chores, favors or sacrifices — almost always results in indebtedness. This, in turn, can also diminish gratitude. 

This tit-for-tat mentality often gives rise to a transactional relational dynamic; kindness becomes a means to an end, and it loses all authenticity. In reality, however, giving without expecting anything in return is the best way to build a reciprocal, loving partnership.

Passive-aggressive behavior is a surefire way to express dissatisfaction with a partner without actually solving the problem. Imagine your partner being upset with you and choosing to let you know by withholding affection or making subtle jabs.

While it isn't necessarily overt, research shows that passive-aggressive behavior often signals dissatisfaction and resentment, which is something that shouldn't be ignored in a romantic relationship.

Not only is it hurtful and confusing, it also leaves partners with no way to move forward. Without a direct, open conversation about the problem at hand, there's no chance for it to be addressed in a constructive way. 

Constantly being told how to handle your job, hobbies or even your friendships will leave you feeling controlled and condescended. No one likes unsolicited advice, nor does anyone want to feel like they're being managed, especially in their own relationship.

Relationship satisfaction plummets once a partnership starts feeling like a parent-child dynamic, which happens quickly once helpfulness morphs into perpetual backseat driving. The line between constructive feedback and hostile criticism can be easy to overstep — and according to research, the latter can lead to lowered relationship satisfaction. 

The most important role you play as a partner is to know when to offer your input and, more importantly, when it's your job to simply support them.

One of the most negligent things a partner can do is to listen purely for the sake of preparing their next response, rather than actively listening.

And if you aren't learning, exploring or absorbing yourself in what your partner is truly saying, research suggests you'll likely only come across as arrogant, not helpful. The happiest couples listen to each other with the goal of understanding, not just to give their two cents on the matter.

If any of these habits hit a little too close to home, don't panic. You're not doomed, and your relationship isn't broken beyond repair.

Relationships take work, and that work often starts with catching yourself in the act, taking a breath and choosing a different way forward. So if you find yourself slipping into any of these patterns, or perhaps even getting annoyed by your partner exhibiting them: Talk about it, own it and try again.

Most of the time, it's not the habit itself that breaks a relationship, but rather the refusal to change it.

Companies that were once loud and proud in supporting LGBTQ+ community celebrations are pulling back.

LGBTQ+ Pride festivals across the country have faced significant sponsorship challenges this year, with some losing corporate partners that collectively provided six-figure donations. As a result, organizations say they've had to modify their programming, pivot to other funding sources and reconsider their dependencies on corporate dollars.

Many companies have cited economic concerns as their impetus to delay or exit partnerships with Pride groups. But LGBTQ+ group leaders also noted an increasingly hostile climate for diversity, equity and inclusion efforts that has prompted some businesses to rethink their support. In turn, Pride organizations are seeking clarity on how much their values still align with those of their corporate contributors.

"For this many companies to be dropping off, I think, points to that we're in a different political environment than we have been maybe in a long, long time," San Francisco Pride executive director Suzanne Ford told CNBC.

Many LGBTQ+ groups consider certain corporations to be longtime partners, but organizers said they often ink one-year deals that are negotiated in the months before the annual Pride celebrations. That leaves them vulnerable if once-reliable companies decide to withhold their dollars, and several organizations said they are facing sponsorship deficits that weigh on budgets and plans for festivals in the summer.

Among the largest shortfalls, Seattle Pride and New York City Pride say they have to make up for $350,000 deficits, and San Francisco Pride and Minnesota's Twin Cities Pride say they are each facing a $200,000 cut.

Some festivals have named which previous sponsors aren't returning, while others said they are keeping that information private to avoid burning bridges.

San Francisco Pride's Ford said Anheuser-Busch, Comcast, Diageo and Nissan have told the organization that they are not sponsoring the festival this year. All were previously longtime partners, Ford said.

The companies gave a variety of reasons for the change.

A Comcast representative said the company is participating in other Pride events in San Francisco and is supporting Pride parades in California in Oakland, Sacramento and Silicon Valley. A Diageo representative said the company will appear at Pride events across the country through its Smirnoff brand this year. A Nissan spokesperson said in a statement that the automaker will not sponsor any Pride festivals this year as it reviews all marketing and sales spending. Anheuser-Busch didn't respond to a request for comment.

Washington, D.C.-based Capital Pride Alliance, which is organizing the biannual, global WorldPride celebration this year, said Comcast and Deloitte had regularly supported the group's Pride festival but declined to do so this year, while Booz Allen Hamilton initially committed to sponsoring the event before later withdrawing.

A Booz Allen Hamilton spokesperson said in a statement that the defense giant's sponsorship decisions do not reflect a pullback in support for employees.

Ryan Bos, Capital Pride Alliance's executive director, said economic uncertainty, safety and security issues, and fear of losing federal funding have all discouraged companies from returning as sponsors. He highlighted President Donald Trump's executive order ordering government agencies to investigate and sue companies supporting DEI.

"The sad thing is corporations have long been the first to step into our corner," Bos said, citing companies' support of domestic partner benefits and LGBTQ+ employment programs. "The fact that some are questioning their commitment now during this uncertain time is very disheartening, hurtful and frustrating for many."

Ford said the White House's anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and executive orders targeting transgender people have impacted corporate America.

"We've all seen the culture wars playing out as far as how corporations respond, and I think this is part and parcel of that movement," she said.

The White House didn't respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Even corporations that are sticking with Pride festivals have reduced their support. Denver Pride's returning sponsors have pared down their contributions by 62% on average, according to Natalie Zanoni, interim CEO of LGBTQ+ organization The Center on Colfax. The center organizes the Denver Pride celebration, which faces a total deficit of $230,000.

Festivals are also still in wait-and-see mode. St. Pete Pride president Byron Green-Calisch said several sponsors had asked the Tampa Bay, Florida-area organization if they could discuss sponsorships closer to April rather than the usual period beginning in January. As of late March, St. Pete Pride said it had achieved 55% of its fundraising goal, compared with the usual 80% to 90% at this time of year.

Seattle Pride executive director Patti Hearn said the group expects about $400,000 in sponsorships this year, compared with its total budget of $1.5 million. While she said the organization will be able to pull off its planned events this year, it would need to change its programming in the future if its $350,000 deficit became permanent.

Corporate sponsors are responsible for 75% of Twin Cities Pride's budget, executive director Andi Otto told CNBC. As a result of sponsorship losses, the Minnesota organization had to cut a performance stage for the upcoming festival and will have to reduce its year-round programming, Otto said.

Not all businesses are taking a step back from festival sponsorships. Several groups said Delta Air Lines, among others, remains a strong supporter of their events. Others said small businesses have been steadfast.

Pride organizations are also reexamining their relationships with sponsors that have rolled back DEI policies or visible support for their communities, further complicating their financial outlook.

Seattle Pride hasn't engaged with previous sponsor Boeing this year, Hearn said, because she had a sense that the aerospace giant didn't align with the organization's values and would decline to return as a festival partner. Boeing reportedly shut down its DEI team in November, according to Bloomberg. The company didn't respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Cincinnati Pride development director Jake Hitch said the Ohio group has rejected sponsorships from previous partners this year based on their nondiscrimination policies, involvement in the LGBTQ+ community and support for employees.

"With everything happening politically and in 2025 that is consistently coming against our community, we thought, what better time to really reset our expectations and align with our community on what they want to see?" Hitch said.

Twin Cities Pride dropped Target, which had sponsored its festival for over 15 years, after looking into the retailer's DEI policy changes announced in late January. Changes to its supplier diversity commitment, community representation principles and participation in external DEI surveys concerned Otto enough for him to refuse the $50,000 sponsorship offer, he said.

"It did not feel right for my community to accept that money," Otto said.

Target didn't respond to a CNBC request for comment.

San Francisco Pride's Ford said the group no longer has a relationship with previous sponsor Meta, in part due to its changes to fact-checking policy but also because Meta staffers who had previously worked with SF Pride had left the company in the past couple of years.

A Meta spokesperson said in a statement that since 2024, the company has allowed local employee resource groups to make their own decisions on Pride sponsorships.

Some organizations have maintained productive relationships with corporations that have modified their DEI efforts, although understanding the policy changes can present its own challenge.

Dave Wait, chairperson of Detroit's Motor City Pride, said some community members were spreading misinformation on social media about a sponsor shutting down its LGBTQ+ health care services, and that Motor City Pride had to clear it up with the company before signing the sponsorship deal for this year.

Twin Cities Pride's Otto said although festival sponsor 3M has removed several DEI-related pages from its website, the industrial giant explained to the organization that it was only changing the language, not the substance of its DEI policies. 3M did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Lowe's had sponsored Charlotte Pride's festival and parade in North Carolina for nine years, but in August the home retailer ended its support for parades amid other DEI policy reversals. Lowe's has pivoted to funding the LGBTQ+ group's job fair and scholarship and internship programs, Charlotte Pride managing director Meredith Thompson told CNBC.

Some community members spoke out against the decision to continue working with Lowe's, Thompson said, but she didn't hesitate to do so because of their previous relationship.

"My attitude is, we need our corporate sponsors and we meet them where they are," Thompson said.

Lowe's did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Some national corporations that have curtailed DEI efforts are still showing up as sponsors through local affiliates and operators. McDonald's, which retired numerous diversity goals in January, has regional operators sponsoring WorldPride and Charlotte Pride. And although Anheuser-Busch is not sponsoring San Francisco Pride or Pride St. Louis this year, Bud Light distributor Adams Beverages is returning as a sponsor for Charlotte Pride.

While LGBTQ+ organizations have long debated the role that corporations should play in Pride celebrations, this year has amplified the idea that Pride groups should rely less on businesses.

Several groups have turned to grassroots campaigns. Twin Cities Pride started a crowdfunding effort to help compensate for dropping Target, and it eventually raised over $110,000. Stonewall Columbus has received $8,500 in donations, Cincinnati Pride has netted over $43,000 and San Francisco Pride has fundraised $35,000, all through crowdfunding.

Green-Calisch of St. Pete Pride said the group will focus more on community donations moving forward and will also increase its year-round presence so that donors understand the work that the organization does beyond Pride Month.

"We are the people. This is about people power and being able to use your dollar to advocate," Green-Calisch said.

Local governments have also grown more involved in some festivals. Stonewall Columbus executive director Densil Porteous said the Ohio-based group has received increased support from Franklin County, Columbus' home county, to help make up for the organization's $96,000 sponsorship deficit.

Pride Northwest executive director Debra Porta said the group is "very intentional" about not overly depending on corporate sponsors for Portland Pride, with its top sponsorship level totaling just $15,000. Other festivals offer sponsorship packages with costs that stretch well beyond $100,000.

Pride groups say that above all they're focused on their communities, not sponsors. Although some festivals have ticketed programs or charge for entry, many organizations stress the importance of making Pride as accessible as possible.

"We never want to put the burden back on our community, because this is supposed to be their celebration," Twin Cities Pride's Otto said.

Zimbabwe's central bank is again issuing gold coins it scrapped 10 months ago, a step it took to ramp up the bullion stockpile used to back up the local currency, the ZiG.

Minting of the so-called “Mosi-Oa-Tunya” 22-carat coins, named after the iconic Victoria Falls, was scrapped in July, central bank Governor John Mushayavanhu told Bloomberg in an interview at the time.

With the average cost of a new car edging toward the $50,000 mark, affordable, basic transportation is becoming increasingly difficult for many Americans. 

Slate, a new EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, believes its new $25,000 pickup truck, which could cost less than $20,000 with tax credits, could help change that, its CEO, Chris Barman, told Business Insider.

"There's a massive population of people out there when it comes to safe, reliable, affordable transportation; there just really aren't many alternatives for them," Barman told us in an interview ahead of the unveiling of the new EV this week.

A $25,000 price point would mean achieving something the current EV sales king, Tesla, has been unable to do. Elon Musk has long teased consumers with the prospect of a $25,000 Tesla model, but there's no firm timeline for its release.

The average price of an EV in the US is $59,000. Electric pickups are even more expensive, with prices exceeding $100,000 on models like the Ford F150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and Tesla Cybertruck.

The Slate Truck, which comes standard with 150 miles of range, is expected to be the cheapest new electric vehicle and pickup truck in the US, staking out a spot in the market no truck — electric or otherwise — has been able to. 

According to Barman, the focus on simplicity and affordability drew her to Slate.

"I grew up on a farm. My first car was a 1984 Ford Ranger pickup, with a five-speed manual, manual windows, and no air conditioning," Barman said. "It was basic transportation, but I loved the freedom it gave me to go places and do things."

Barman, who joined as CEO in May 2022, is a mechanical engineer by trade. She spent most of her career with Chrysler in product development, culminating in her role as Fiat-Chrysler Automotive's Vice President of Electrical and Electronics.

During the design process of the EV truck, Barman and the Slate team considered how to meet customers' needs while also achieving the affordability target.

For example, Barman explained that their EV has a key fob because the cheaper metal blade key is more of a hassle to use, especially at night, while the fancier passive touch-sensitive locks are more convenient but would have added too much cost.

"That's just an example of how we went through system by system and talked about, and were really thoughtful about what it means to get the cost out of the vehicle," Barman said.

By offering a basic, no-frills base model, which the company refers to as a "blank slate," the startup's business model is centered on letting the consumer decide what creature comforts they need in a vehicle and when they can afford it.

"It gives freedom of choice to the owner of what accessories they would want to put on the vehicle, either at the time of purchase or over time, depending on their budget," Barman said.

You can upgrade or personalize almost every part of the vehicle, except the battery pack, at any point during its service life.

"It's a complete paradigm change in the car buying experience," she told us.

This means an owner on a tight budget can start with the base truck, which has crank windows and no radio, and steadily upgrade and personalize the vehicle over time with different color wraps or upgraded infotainment.

There's even a kit that transforms the truck into a five-passenger SUV.

The wide array of accessories allows the Slate EV to grow and evolve with its owner's needs.

"It may be, they were single when they first purchased the truck, and they recently got married, and a few years later, they have, a family, and instead of having to exchange it out for a completely new vehicle, they can convert it into a five passenger SUV and continue to use the vehicle," Barman explained.

This saves the consumer from having to sell or trade in a paid-for vehicle and generates additional revenue for Slate from a single sale.

As vehicles become increasingly complex and expensive, Slate is becoming a rarity as one of the few manufacturers encouraging owners to work on their cars.

Since it plans to deploy a direct sales model, it doesn't have to worry about sustaining a network of dealers who depend on their service departments to make ends meet.

According to Slate's CEO, upgrade work on its vehicles is designed to be easily enough for owners to do themselves, and the company plans to offer instructional videos called "Slate University" to guide them through the work.

This includes series hardware installs like adding power windows and even the SUV Kit, including rear seats, a roll cage, and airbags.

Although the company plans to have local partner facilities that can do the work professionally if the owner isn't up to doing the wrenching themselves.

The Slate truck, which is expected to be built in an as-yet-unnamed facility in the Midwestern US, will begin customer deliveries at the end of 2026, the company says. 

"We would like to see what we can do to go into an existing facility that has been shuttered and reindustrialize and revitalize that community," Barman said.

Reservations are open with a refundable $50 fee.

There was no president. There was no comedian. What remained at the White House Correspondents' Association's annual dinner on Saturday night were the journalists and the First Amendment.

The stripped-down festivities were a reflection of the somber tone in Washington at the beginning of President Donald Trump's second term, in which he has battled with the press on multiple fronts and wrested from the correspondents' association the power to decide which outlets have the most access to Trump.

Trump's deeper involvement in politics began after then-President Barack Obama roasted the New Yorker's presidential ambitions during the 2011 correspondents' dinner. He skipped the annual gala during his first term, and his absence had been widely expected this year.

The association scrapped a scheduled appearance at this year's dinner by comedian Amber Ruffin after she referred to the new administration as "kind of a bunch of murderers" on a podcast last month. The organization, a nonprofit that helps White House journalists provide robust coverage of the presidency, decided to forgo the event's traditional levity and focus on celebrating journalism.

Association President Eugene Daniels said in an email to the organization's 900 members last month that the dinner was meant to "honor journalistic excellence and a robust, independent media covering the most powerful office in the world."

The event, which raises money for journalism scholarships, remains a highlight of the Washington social calendar. The ballroom at the Washington Hilton was still packed with journalists, newsmakers and even a few celebrities. Daniels singled out Debra Tice, whose son Austin has been missing for a decade since disappearing in Syria.

"We've been tested and attacked. But every single day our members get up, they run to the White House — plane, train, automobile — with one mission, holding the powerful accountable," Daniels said.

He later showed a video of past presidents, from Ronald Reagan to Joe Biden, who addressed the dinner, saying that the association invites the president to demonstrate the importance of a free press in safeguarding democracy.

Trump counter-programmed the last dinner during his first term, holding a rally to compete with the event in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic canceled the 2020 dinner. This year, Trump had just flown back from Pope Francis' funeral in Rome and had no events Saturday night.

The Trump administration has had multiple skirmishes with the press in recent months. The FCC is investigating several media companies, the administration is working to shut down Voice of America and other government-run outlets, and The Associated Press has sued the administration for reducing its access to events because it has not renamed the Gulf of Mexico in line with Trump's executive order.

A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction ordering the administration to stop blocking the AP from presidential events. In response, the White House adopted a new press policy that gives the administration sole discretion over who gets to question Trump and sharply curtails the access of three news agencies, including AP, that serve billions of readers around the world.

For many years previously, the correspondents' association determined which news organizations had access to limited space events.

Alex Thompson of Axios, who won The Aldo Beckman Award for his coverage of the coverup of Biden's decline while in office, addressed complaints from some on the right that the press had gone too soft on the Democrat.

"We — myself included — missed a lot of this story, and some people trust us less because of it," Thompson told the room of journalists. "We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows."

Saturday's dinner also recognized the winners of a number of journalism awards, in addition to Thompson. They included:

—The Award for Excellence in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure (Print): Aamer Madhani and Zeke Miller of the AP, for reporting on the White House altering its transcript to erase Biden calling Trump supporters "garbage."

—The Award for Excellence in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure (Broadcast): Rachel Scott of ABC News, for her coverage of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.

—The Award for Excellence in Presidential News Coverage by Visual Journalists: Doug Mills of the New York Times, for his photograph of Biden walking under a painting of Abraham Lincoln.

—The Katharine Graham Award for Courage and Accountability: Reuters, for its series on the production and smuggling of the deadly narcotic fentanyl.

—Collier Prize for State Government Accountability: AP for its series, "Prison to Plate: Profiting off America's Captive Workforce."

—Center for News Integrity Award: Anthony Zurcher of the BBC for his coverage of the fallout from Biden's handling of the Gaza War.

Elon Musk said he's backing away from DOGE in May, but that doesn't mean the federal worker firings are over.

In fact, they're only heating up.

While the first era of DOGE firings continues to face legal issues, the next set could be on stronger footing. That's because agencies have the chance to craft more methodical plans. In particular, many are offering buyout-like deferred resignation plans for workers to voluntarily quit in exchange for months of paid administrative leave.

These methods could prove to be on a more solid legal footing than the first round of firings, which focused on new or newly promoted workers, cited low performance ratings, and did not provide notice. It all means that the DOGE ethos is alive and well in the federal government, with or without Musk.

Musk and DOGE spent much of the last three months overseeing a wave of probationary federal workers. Those workers were at the start of their tenure in their new roles, including internal promotions. They have fewer protections than longer-serving federal employees.

That round of cuts saw several snafus because, rather than targeting specific programs, DOGE simply removed many people who had been working for less than a year or two. That led to scenarios like workers who handle the nuclear stockpile or study bird flu getting fired and then ultimately rehired. It also faced legal issues, with a judge ordering in March that those workers needed to be reinstated.

Going back to the drawing board with terminations means a chance to execute reduction-in-force plans, or RIFs, that follow proper procedures.

"I think probably the courts have done a huge favor to DOGE by putting people back in their office until they can do a more well-calculated RIF," Michele Evermore, a senior fellow at the left-leaning think tank the Century Foundation, said.

The White House and DOGE office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.

Over the past month, new RIFs have gone out. The Department of Education announced in March that it was terminating over 1,300 workers, slashing its workforce by 50%. The Small Business Administration said it would reduce its workforce by 43%.

The Department of Health and Human Services had already started terminating employees as part of its plan to slash 10,000 from its workforce.

While the next round of reductions appears to be more targeted, it doesn't mean they're immune to litigation.

Federal worker unions have vowed to fight back. Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement that the union would "pursue every legal avenue to stop this unprecedented attack on the very foundation of our national government."

It's unclear if they'll have a case. David Super, an administrative law professor at Georgetown Law, said that the plans may vary by department, and some could be more vulnerable to legal challenges than others.

He added that it's "entirely possible that those agencies work really, really carefully and produce correct RIF plans."

In lieu of RIFs, some agencies are choosing another acronym: DRPs. Deferred resignation programs are the next round of the "Fork In The Road" that offered employees early resignation earlier in the year, and might be an easier solution for those aiming to trim head count because workers voluntarily opt into them. Bloomberg reported, for instance, that nearly 20% of Department of Labor workers have opted for voluntary separation. Some Social Security Administration employees have also received a DRP.

Two internal emails at the Internal Revenue Service, viewed by BI, said that over 10,000 agency employees applied for the second round of the deferred resignation program and that further reductions in force are coming.

While DRPs might help the government shed workers, the payout could end up being less than the severance provided in a RIF, said Alan Lescht, an employment attorney specializing in federal workers.

"They're trotting this out to people who are being targeted for RIFs or could potentially be in a RIF. And for federal employees that are like that, the RIFs may actually provide a larger payout," Lescht said. And, opting into a DRP means workers are giving up rights to their positions — essentially, forfeiting the ability to be reinstated. He suggests workers take a "deep dive" into their job prospects before opting out.

"For many people, it may turn out that the best option is to stay and fight because the government has to satisfy a lot of requirements in order to justify a firing under the RIF rules," Lescht said. "The RIF rules are very extensive and very complicated, and it's very likely that with the speed with which the government is moving, that they will make mistakes."

Sportswear giant Nike is reportedly facing a lawsuit following the closure of its non-fungible token (NFT) business.

In 2021, Nike purchased RTFKT Studios, a collectibles firm known for creating viral sneaker designs, memes and other fashionable digital collectibles as it ventured into the metaverse, but the company shut down the project in December.

Reuters reports that investors of Nike-themed NFTs and other crypto assets led by Australian resident Jagdeep Cheema filed a suit on Friday, claiming that they suffered significant losses as demand for their digital collectibles dropped following the announcement that RTFKT was winding down its operations.

The investors say that they would not have bought the NFTs had they known that the tokens were unregistered securities. To date, the legal status of NFTs is not yet settled, and several lawsuits involve questions on whether or not these assets should be considered as securities. 

The suit also accuses Nike of orchestrating a “rug pull”, or the sudden abandonment of a project that leaves investors with worthless assets.

The plaintiffs are seeking more than $5 million in damages for the alleged violation of consumer laws in New York, California, Florida and Oregon.

Nike has not yet issued a statement regarding the lawsuit.

In the cryptocurrency world's coming-of-age story, 2025 looks increasingly like the year when adolescent growing pains meet adult responsibilities. After a decade-plus evolution from niche experiment to multi-billion-dollar industry, crypto's early players are being forced to reckon with their past as they build toward their future.

The cryptocurrency sector has traveled light years from its cypherpunk origins. Major players who once operated in regulatory gray areas are now implementing comprehensive compliance frameworks. Binance, after years of regulatory pushback, has established proper KYC teams and AML procedures. Tether, long criticized for transparency issues, is making serious noise about obtaining a full audit.

This evolution isn't merely voluntary. It's existential. Practices that worked when crypto was a small, experimental space simply don't scale to international businesses handling trillions in transactions. The innocent hacks and operational shortcuts from the industry's early days have become potential liabilities in today's regulated environment.

In this maturation process, companies like Chainalysis have carved out a profitable niche as the industry's compliance backbone. Positioning themselves as the bridge between crypto's inherent transparency and regulators' demands for accountability, these blockchain analytics firms have become essential to the ecosystem's legitimacy.

Chainalysis markets itself as "the blockchain data platform," providing "data, software, services, and research to government agencies, exchanges, financial institutions, and insurance and cybersecurity companies," according to their marketing materials. Their mission statement emphasizes developing "clearer regulations, establishing standard audit practices, and implementing powerful compliance controls."

When integrated into exchanges and financial services, these tools help identify potentially suspicious transactions and flag sanctioned addresses. Law enforcement relies on them to trace illicit funds, while regulators view them as essential guardrails for the industry.

Blockchain surveillance operates at the intersection of raw blockchain data, customer network information, and open-source intelligence (OSINT). According to Chainalysis materials, their technology helps "businesses understand and mitigate on-chain threats through the use of sophisticated analytics, enhancing visibility into cyber attacks and enriching the understanding of an adversary's tactics, techniques, and procedures."

The process begins with data collection from multiple sources. Raw blockchain data provides the foundation, capturing every transaction on public ledgers. This is supplemented by customer network information shared by exchanges and financial institutions, and open-source intelligence gathered from various public channels.

Chainalysis then applies proprietary analytics to identify relationships between entities, track activities across blockchains, and establish connections between cryptocurrency transactions and real-world identities. Their systems categorize transactions into various threat types, including cyber attacks, data breaches, ransomware, malware, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

The company claims their blockchain intelligence allows organizations to "track illicit activity, manage risk exposure, and develop innovative market solutions with intelligent customer insights." Chainalysis positions this capability alongside traditional cybersecurity frameworks, mapping their services to stages of the "cyber kill chain" to help organizations disrupt attacks at various points.

Their marketing materials emphasize human verification of data, noting that customers benefit from "rigorously verified data by human experts, ensuring unmatched reliability and credibility" in investigations. However, this reliability and credibility is precisely what critics question in legal challenges.

As cryptocurrency enters the mainstream financial system, the scientific foundations of blockchain surveillance are facing unprecedented scrutiny.

"Chainalysis heavily promotes its reputation as a credible third-party investigation firm. It calls itself 'the blockchain data platform,'" notes independent researcher L0la L33tz in a recent article in The Rage. She points out that this reputation has made Chainalysis the largest US Government contractor for blockchain surveillance software, with over $93.2 million in awarded funds.

But in court cases from Bitcoin Fog to Tornado Cash, defense attorneys have begun challenging the scientific validity of these surveillance tools, questioning whether the black-box algorithms claiming to trace billions in crypto merit the same evidentiary weight as DNA or fingerprint analysis.

The recent lawsuit filed by Celsius Network's debtors against Chainalysis represents perhaps the most direct challenge yet to the industry's accountability framework.

According to bankruptcy court filings, Celsius debtors allege that "Chainalysis knowingly and willfully fueled one of the biggest cons in cryptocurrency history, deceiving customers, propping up a sham company, and accelerating Celsius's catastrophic collapse."

The lawsuit centers around a December 2020 press release where Chainalysis and Celsius claimed completion of "an audit confirming $3,318,368,196.40 of assets by Chainalysis." This figure, according to court documents, included approximately $1.3 billion in CEL tokens—artificially inflating Celsius's assets under management through "highly inaccurate and misleading valuations."

The Celsius debtors allege this was no innocent error. Their complaint states:

Following publication of the press release, Celsius's customer base reportedly exploded, with the price of CEL tokens skyrocketing from $2.21 in December 2020 to over $8 by June 2021.

The scientific reliability of blockchain analytics has been contested in other high-profile cases. As reported in Fortune, in the criminal prosecution of Bitcoin Fog operator Roman Sterlingov, defense attorney Tor Ekeland painted Chainalysis software as a "black box," arguing the firm had financial interests in securing convictions that utilized their technology.

The judge in that case ultimately allowed the Chainalysis evidence, ruling it sufficiently reliable based on government expert testimonies, a logic Fortune writer Leo Schwartz described as "circular."

Meanwhile, in the ongoing Tornado Cash case, developer Roman Storm's defense team has sought disclosure of "any statement made by Chainalysis personnel in which they discuss any errors related to their analysis of Tornado Cash," particularly in light of Chainalysis' recent wrongful attribution of over $300 million to North Korea.

The scrutiny facing Chainalysis bears striking parallels to traditional financial auditors. Firms like Arthur Andersen once enjoyed unquestioned authority until cases like Enron revealed fundamental flaws in their approach.

The methodological questions surrounding blockchain surveillance create similar concerns. Any analytics system will generate both false positives and false negatives. When these errors merely result in compliance inconveniences, the stakes are manageable. But when they determine criminal prosecutions, the standards for accuracy must be significantly higher.

Despite these challenges, the increased scrutiny ultimately signals cryptocurrency's evolution into a mature financial sector. True accountability requires testing assumptions, challenging authorities, and establishing reliable standards that balance innovation with responsibility.

For Chainalysis and similar firms, this moment of reckoning may be uncomfortable but necessary. The heuristics and methodologies that proved adequate for crypto's early days must now demonstrate scientific rigor sufficient for courtrooms and criminal prosecutions.

The industry's future depends not just on adoption and market capitalization, but on building accountability frameworks that can withstand serious scrutiny. As cryptocurrency continues its journey from rebellious political movement to established financial infrastructure, these growing pains represent not a crisis but an inevitable passage into maturity.

In the crypto universe, where every project dreams of replicating the pioneers' successes, the illusion of easy replication remains strong. But some remind us that not all paths can be copied, especially when the irrational comes into play. While Ripple continues to surprise despite criticism, voices rise to warn that Ethereum will not be able to follow the same path. Between narratives, fundamentals, and market maturity, the debate ignites at the heights of the cryptosphere.

Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, did not mince his words: Ethereum will not be able to follow the “playbook” of XRP. In a striking post on X, he states:

Just because something irrational happens in the world does not mean it will happen to you, or that you can make it happen.

According to him, the success of XRP is not reproducible because it relies on dynamics that defy classical rational logic. XRP managed to capture value not through strict engineering or solid fundamentals, but through a combination of market sentiment, institutional adoption, and collective vibes.

Yakovenko points out with a touch of irony:

If you cannot model why XRP or BTC have value, you cannot design it, and therefore you cannot compete with it.

In other words, without deeply understanding why certain assets capture value despite their irrationality, it is illusory to think one can “imitate” their trajectory.

The “XRP model” belongs to a specific universe, shaped by its history, supporters, and unique ecosystem. Ethereum, with its own architecture and challenges, will have to find its path differently.

The debate doesn't stop there. Omid Malekan, associate professor at Columbia Business School, also added fuel to the fire by reminding that the crypto market remains “deeply immature“. According to him, the recent success of XRP proves that narratives, vibes, and sentiments still weigh much more than fundamentals.

In his X intervention, he emphasizes that XRP now surpasses Ethereum in Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) despite the fact that “a corporation owns half of the supply“. A situation he describes as “maddening” for those who stubbornly analyze only through the prism of technical design or real revenues.

In response to this argument, Jon Charbonneau, co-founder of the investment fund DBA, replies:

Unique outliers do not mean that these rules apply to everyone Des valeurs aberrantes uniques ne signifient pas que ces règles s'appliquent à tout le monde.

He reminds us that the XRP exception does not justify abandoning the search for solid fundamentals. He compares this absurd logic to that of a CEO declaring:

GameStop and AMC exploded without profits, so we don't need to make money either!

In this battle of ideas, Ethereum must, according to Charbonneau, stay true to its fundamentals to ensure its long-term legitimacy.

While the community debates, Ripple, the parent company of XRP, quietly charts its path to the top. The plan is clear, methodical, almost surgical.

According to an analysis published by All Things XRP, Ripple is heavily investing in pillars of the future:

Far from the hype surrounding memecoins and other ephemeral projects, Ripple is patiently building a serious crypto infrastructure ready to attract banks, financial institutions, and Web3 players.

All Things XRP states:

Ripple wants to become the invisible engine behind real-time, regulated, and transparent global payments.

This strategy reveals an ambition: to be the trusted gateway between traditional finance and blockchain.

Ultimately, Ripple does not just ride the “vibes”: it builds a cathedral where others erect only mirages.

The fate of Ethereum and XRP now seems to follow diverging trajectories. One clings to fundamentals, the other capitalizes on its unique positioning and institutional network. Perhaps in the crypto universe, there is no universal model: just singular paths, shaped by vision, perseverance, and sometimes, the irrational.

Early signs are out, and expert investors are already taking action, accumulating as many $RTX tokens as possible at its current presale price of $0.0757. For these experts, Remittix ($RTX) has all the makings of the best crypto presale this quarter for massive returns. From its record-breaking presale figures to its increasing global adoption rate and the simplified solution it offers, this PayFi presale sensation sure has a lot going for it.

This article examines Remittix's presale success, the solution it offers and its promise for investors who act fast, according to expert analysis. 

Table of Contents

From the start, Bitcoin and other altcoin projects have sought to fix real-world issues, including cross-border transfer bottlenecks. Yet, only a few have successfully offered solutions to these issues.

One of the few successful ones is Remittix, a new fast-growing PayFi project aiming to lessen fees while enabling rapid transfers and seamless banking services. Its efforts also involve regions where accessibility to solution-based banking infrastructure is negligible or absent.

Previously, cross-border payments involved service users in several communities around the world paying exorbitant fees to transfer money to relatives who live in other countries. Remittix changes this with a cost-effective solution for the average user's needs, with or without crypto knowledge.

Remittix's goal has attracted backing from those who witnessed the XRP takeover of international payment methods and growth in popularity. XRP showed off how crypto assets can replace existing and outdated payment procedures.

Remittix advances this move by solving the technical complications that formerly stalled payment processes. With Remittix's growth in its ongoing mission, digital asset transfers across borders are set to become mainstream for users globally.

Experts tip Remittix as the XRP rival and dark horse set to oust other PayFi projects. This reflects the project's commitment to economical and rapid international payment structures. While XRP succeeded thanks to its expansive reach, Remittix looks good to take that even further.

Remittix focuses on resolving everyday users' problems, including long waiting times and pricey transfer fees. The PayFi service facilitates swift transfers, making it a favorite for its growing community.

Experts point to crypto users' preference for tokens that serve a single, straightforward purpose. For these market experts and observers, this priority enhances their market reach. Remittix is primed to surpass XRP's achievements as it delivers outstanding payment possibilities. For them, this is the best crypto presale this year.

The ongoing Remittix presale has earned the crypto the title of the best crypto presale for how quickly it has raised significant capital. Remittix sold over 529 million RTX tokens at $0.0757 per token. The presale is currently closing in on $15 million in presale funding. Such significant growth demonstrates crypto users' belief in Remittix's crypto vision and use cases.

While it took years for even top projects like Bitcoin and ETH to achieve widespread adoption, recent projects like Remittix are attaining massive growth from their early stages. Analysts say this is thanks to how they tackle specific and integral issues.

Remittix's early investors recognize cross-border remittance as a vast global market that needs a simplified solution. With Remittix's solution, $RTX has a solution-backed momentum to deliver sky-high gains and be the best crypto presale in 2025.

Key Takeaways:

World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform backed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, announced in an official press release its partnership with Pakistan Crypto Council to drive blockchain innovation and stablecoin adoption across Pakistan. WLF representatives – Zachary Folkman, Zachary Witkoff (son of US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff) and Chase Herro – were given access to Pakistan's Prime Minister, Chief of Army Staff, and Deputy Prime Minister among other top-ranking officials during a high-level delegation visit.

The joint venture was established via a Letter of Intent (LOI) which was signed during a high-level seminar attended by the Finance Minister, the CEO of the PCC, the State Bank Governor, the SECP Chairman, and the Federal Secretary for IT. With this collaboration, Pakistan positions itself as a serious contender to lead the new wave of global financial technology. The move is timely as nations across Asia and the Middle East race to position themselves as crypto and blockchain hubs.

The officials stressed that the government is to announce full legalization of cryptos in the near future. Should it succeed, Pakistan could be among the nations at the forefront of crypto adoption and digital finance development.



A Letter of Intent with the committed content was signed. Key focus areas include:

These are not theoretical initiatives: they represent a practical road-map towards the adoption of decentralized technology in the Pakistani financial landscape. With Pakistan's readiness to cooperate with foreign partners in this regard, it is abundantly clear that the country acknowledges the potential that blockchain brings in terms of transparency, efficiency and greater financial inclusion – an aspect that is vital in Pakistan, where traditional banking facilities are not accessible to a significant fraction of its population.

Pakistan's digital economy is an uncommon combination of potential and progress. The country has one of the youngest populations worldwide, with more than 64% under the age of 30. When you add in an average of $300 billion in crypto transactions annually, and 25 million active users, Pakistan is one of the largest adopters of cryptocurrency, globally.

Factors like rising mobile phone penetration, a vibrant freelance economy, and growing government support for blockchain initiatives create a fertile ground for rapid Web3 expansion.

Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb appreciated initiatives and said Pakistan's youth and technology industry are national assets. He added that the World Liberty Financial partnership will open a new era of investment, innovation, and global leadership in the blockchain economy.

Likewise, Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, stressed that the relationship with WLF is not just a partnership, but a strategic path that will harmonize the workforce of the future while bringing Pakistan closer to the future of world-wide finance.

Senior Management at World Liberty Financial was enthusiastic of the prospects Pakistan offers given its dynamism and talent. Per WLF executives, Pakistan's energy, vision and entrepreneurship are what make it one of the most exciting places in the world to build the future of accessible finance.

Recent developments are helping to reinforce these positive indications. Exchanges including Binance and OKX have said Pakistan is one of their top 10 countries by crypto trading volume, despite regulatory ambiguity. What is clear is with the right regulation there is a ready-to-take off ecosystem – startups are already starting to build both blockchain-based solutions for remittance and microfinance.

The WLF-PCC Letter of Intent is not just symbolic;it heralds real-world projects that can revolutionize how millions of Pakistani citizens access the international financial infrastructure.

As Pakistan comes ever closer to the full legalization of crypto, the stakes are high — but so are the potential returns. A forward-looking regulatory framework could turbocharge the economy, wean the population off traditional banking and let Pakistan's young people vault into the heart of the Web3 era.

April has been a month of extreme volatility and tumultuous times for traders.

From conflicting headlines about President Donald Trump's tariffs against other nations to total confusion about which assets to seek shelter in, it has been one for the record books. 

Amid all the confusion, when traditional "haven assets" failed to act as safe places to park money, one bright spot emerged that might have surprised some market participants: bitcoin. 

"Historically, cash (the US dollar), bonds (US Treasuries), the Swiss Franc, and gold have fulfilled that role [safe haven], with bitcoin edging in on some of that territory," said NYDIG Research in a note. 

NYDIG's data showed that while gold and Swiss Franc had been consistent safe-haven winners, since 'Liberation Day'—when President Trump announced sweeping tariff hikes on April 2, kicking off extreme volatility in the market—bitcoin has been added to the list. 

"Bitcoin has acted less like a liquid levered version of levered US equity beta and more like the non-sovereign issued store of value that it is," NYDIG wrote. 

Zooming out, it seems that as the "sell America" trade gains momentum, investors are taking notice of bitcoin and the original promise of the biggest cryptocurrency. 

"Though the connection is still tentative, bitcoin appears to be fulfilling its original promise as a non-sovereign store of value, designed to thrive in times like these," NYDIG added.

 The IMF's non-accumulation agreement may leave room for Bitcoin accumulation through non-governmental entities, industry watchers told Cointelegraph. 

El Salvador, the world's first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is still acquiring Bitcoin despite comments from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) appearing to claim the opposite.

The treasury of El Salvador acquired 7 Bitcoin (BTC) worth over $650,000 in the seven days leading up to April 27, blockchain data from El Salvador's Bitcoin Office shows.

When asked about the country's Bitcoin investments, Rodrigo Valdes, director of the Western Hemisphere Department at the IMF, said that the country continues to comply with its agreement to halt government Bitcoin accumulation.

“In terms of El Salvador, let me say that I can confirm that they continue to comply with their commitment of non-accumulation of Bitcoin by the overall fiscal sector, which is the performance criteria that we have,” said Valdes during an April 26 press briefing.

“But on top of that, I think this is very important for the discussion in El Salvador,” he added. “The program of El Salvador is not about Bitcoin. It's much more, much deeper in structural reforms, in terms of governance, in terms of transparency.”

In December 2024, El Salvador struck a deal with the IMF for a $1.4 billion loan, which required the government to drop Bitcoin's status as a legal tender and stop its BTC accumulation.

The IMF's agreement may still enable room for purchases through non-governmental entities, according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain adviser.

“The IMF's ‘flexible interpretation' suggests purchases may involve non-public sector entities or reclassified assets, maintaining technical compliance,” Lian told Cointelegraph, adding:

Lian added that El Salvador's strategy highlights the growing tension between financial innovation and traditional economic policies.

“El Salvador's experience offers valuable lessons for nations exploring crypto adoption, emphasizing the need for robust regulatory frameworks and state capacity to navigate international financial pressures,” he added.

Nike is under fire after a group of investors filed a class action lawsuit, accusing the sportswear giant of causing massive financial losses by shutting down RTFKT, its Web3-focused subsidiary acquired in 2021. 

The investors claim Nike's actions led to a sharp collapse in the value of Nike-branded NFTs, wiping out millions in investments.

According to court documents, Nike allegedly “rugpulled” the community by closing RTFKT and cutting off demand for the associated digital assets.

The plaintiffs argue that Nike used its brand power and marketing expertise to promote what they describe as unregistered securities before suddenly abandoning the project.

This NFT project made $168MNike bought itElon Musk and Kanye West wore their shoesNow the collection is goneAnd so are the foundersThe rise, fall, rug of RTFKT and Clone-X🧵(1/9) pic.twitter.com/aLnaz4kGAf

The lawsuit claims Nike capitalized on the crypto boom to drive NFT sales. Investors purchased the NFTs hoping they would increase in value, thanks to Nike's promotional efforts. 

However, once RTFKT was dissolved, these incentives vanished. Buyers who once anticipated exclusive rewards and profitable resales saw their investments lose value almost instantly.

“Because The Nike NFTs derived their value from the success of a given promoter and project – here, Nike and its marketing efforts – investors purchased this digital asset with the hope that its value would increase in the future as the project grows in popularity based on the Nike brand,” the lawsuit stated.

The complaint highlights that promises of completing quests, unlocking limited-edition products, and opportunities for secondary sales were key motivations for purchasing the NFTs. 

With the collapse of RTFKT's operations, these incentives evaporated, leaving investors with worthless digital assets.

Adding to their argument, the plaintiffs insist that Nike NFTs qualify as securities under federal law. They claim Nike failed to register the digital assets with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or disclose the associated risks.

The investors argued that they would not have purchased the digital assets at inflated prices if they had known the true risks.

“Plaintiff and others would never have purchased the Nike NFTs at the prices they did, or at all, had they known that the Nike NFTs were unregistered securities or that Nike would cause the rug to be pulled out from under them,” the investors argued.

The plaintiffs seek a jury trial and damages exceeding $5 million for the alleged violations of consumer protection laws in New York, California, Florida, and Oregon.

Meanwhile, this lawsuit comes as investor frustrations were further amplified on April 24 when technical issues prevented the Nike-linked NFT images from displaying.  

RTFKT's head of technology, Samuel Cardillo, explained that the outage resulted from a Cloudflare contract ending earlier than expected.

“Beginning of April, the decision to stay on Cloudflare Free was (finally) approved and I started the work to move the infrastructure. Somehow this morning Cloudflare decided to move to the Free plan few days before the end of the contract which also triggered that bug in which Cloudflare refuses to stream images and videos,” Cardillo explained.

While most images have since been restored, Cardillo is now moving RTFKT's NFT files to Arweave's decentralized storage platform using AR Drive. This step aims to protect NFT holders from similar outages in the future.

ByBilly Bambrough,

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion."

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip.

Now, as Binance's chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock.

“The preconditions are now in place for the beginning of a major dollar downtrend,” Deutsche Bank analysts George Saravelos and Tim Baker wrote seen by MarketWatch in a note, pointing to a huge shift in U.S. trade policy and a global reassessment of U.S. geopolitical leadership and predicting the end of a “higher for longer” dollar.

The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell's relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates.

“Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, "in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high."

The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs' head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar's weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump.

Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades."

"Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks.

"Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. "The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion."

BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year.

In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument.

The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

 According to Back, Strategy and other Bitcoin treasury firms are some of the earliest bettors on Hyperbitcoinization, which may see Bitcoin's market cap soar to above $200 trillion. 

Investment firms with Bitcoin-focused treasuries are front-running global Bitcoin adoption, which may see the world's first cryptocurrency soar to a $200 trillion market capitalization in the coming decade.

Institutions and governments worldwide are starting to recognize the unique monetary properties of Bitcoin (BTC), according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash.

“$MSTR and other treasury companies are an arbitrage of the dislocation between the bitcoin future and todays fiat world,” Back wrote in an April 26 X post.

“A sustainable and scalable $100-$200 trillion trade front-running hyperbitcoinization. scalable enough for most big listed companies to move to btc treasury,” he added.

Hyperbitcoinization refers to the theoretical future where Bitcoin soars to become the largest global currency, replacing fiat money due to its inflationary economics and growing distrust in the legacy financial system.

Bitcoin's price outpacing fiat money inflation remains the main driver of global hyperbitcoinization, Back said, adding:

Back's comments come nearly two months after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin reserve from BTC forfeited in government criminal cases.

Continued Bitcoin investments from the likes of Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, may inspire more global firms to follow suit.

Strategy's approach is proving to be lucrative, with the firm's Bitcoin treasury generating over $5.1 billion worth of profit since the beginning of 2025, according to Strategy's co-founder, Michael Saylor.

Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, also known as “Asia's MicroStrategy,”  adopted a similar strategy, since surpassing 5,000 BTC in total holdings on April 24, Cointelegraph reported.

As Asia's largest corporate Bitcoin holder, Metaplanet plans to acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026.

US financial institutions may also have more confidence in adopting Bitcoin after the US Federal Reserve withdrew its 2022 guidance discouraging banks from engaging with cryptocurrency. “Banks are now free to begin supporting Bitcoin,” Saylor said in response to the guidance withdrawal.

“Banks will now be supervised through normal processes, signaling a more open regulatory environment for digital asset integration,” Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev told Cointelegraph.

Key Points

When a company or cryptocurrency seems like it's finally solving one of its long-standing challenges, it can be a good time to invest. A turnaround narrative can push prices higher for a long time, especially when it's backed by real changes that add value.

On that note, there's some new evidence that Ethereum (ETH -0.18%) is getting closer to tackling one of its most notorious bugbears. But, from a slightly different perspective, that same evidence can also be interpreted as a bearish sign. So which is it, and is this coin worth buying right now?

On April 20, Ethereum had some of the lowest gas (user) fees of the past five years. The average on-chain action requiring spending gas incurred a fee of close to $0.01. Just a few days later, that had risen to about $0.26 on average.

But, as well-informed investors already know, even those slightly higher gas prices are, for Ethereum, close to rock bottom. More importantly, they're the culmination of the chain's numerous attempts so far at scaling up its capacity and spinning off traffic to more efficient Layer-2 (L2) networks to offer faster transaction times and lower transaction costs for users. Compared to the $50 gas fees of yesteryear, the chain looks like it's finally cheap enough to actually use. So, is the chain's biggest and most persistent drawback finally put to rest?

Not exactly. Executing a token swap on Ethereum still costs an average of $0.69, with highs of $4.30 not uncommon, and transferring stablecoins often costs about $0.67. Furthermore, those actions take an average of 30 seconds to complete, which is quite slow.

The larger issue is that this latest gas fee low isn't being driven by any new tech update that wasn't already in place months ago, when costs were a bit higher. Two number illustrate this point. On April 21, Ethereum processed 1.1 million transactions. On the same date three years ago, it also processed 1.1 million transactions.

In light of that information, it's a no-brainer why it's cheaper to use Ethereum today than it was then. The network isn't nearly as congested because its capacity has been upgraded while traffic has remained more or less stable, so gas prices have declined. And that isn't a reason to be bullish. If anything, it's a reason to be bearish.

The investment thesis for buying Ethereum is that its ecosystem of on-chain projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT) markets, artificial intelligence (AI), and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) networks will attract capital to the chain and thereby boost the price of its native token, which is necessary for using all of the applications hosted there. If that thesis were being proven true over time, the network would experience higher transaction volumes, as more users would be making more transactions with more apps, expending more money, and parking more assets on the chain to do so more easily. The chain's stagnant transaction volume over time tells the opposite story: Ethereum is, on average, not seeing more adoption and usage.

This meshes neatly with its declining price and terrible investor sentiment about its future prospects. It's down about 38% during the past three years. There would be an easy case to make for buying the dip if there was a clear trend toward greater adoption, or clear dominance in an emerging growth segment like artificial intelligence infrastructure or agents. Meanwhile, rivals like Solana are giving Ethereum a run for its money in terms of capturing those segments, mainly because it's much cheaper and faster.

It is not inherently a bad thing that Ethereum's gas prices have declined. If they can stay very low even as network usage increases, assuming it ever does, it would be bullish. But until that happens and remains consistent for at least a few months, investors should probably avoid buying Ethereum. It hasn't proven that its scaling problems are a thing of the past, and it hasn't proven to investors that real value is being generated on its chain to the point where it's worth buying and holding.

A collective of upset NFT purchasers has brought a lawsuit against Nike after the company shut down its digital collectibles division, RTFKT.

According to a report by Reuters, the lawsuit, filed Friday in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that the sportswear colossus's sudden shutdown erased hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of digital asset value.

Australia-based lead plaintiff Jagdeep Cheema leads the class of plaintiffs that is demanding at least $5 million in damages. According to court filings, Nike's December 2024 shutdown of RTFKT left investors with worthless digital tokens created and sold on both the Nike and RTFKT brands.

The complaint states Nike breached consumer defense laws in a number of states, including New York, California, Florida, and Oregon. Nike, headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, has yet to respond to the claims.

The court filing contends Nike sold the NFTs without registering them properly with financial authorities. This poses a basic question that US regulators and courts are still grappling to answer: Are NFTs securities subject to regulatory scrutiny?

Purchasers said the company provided no notice before cancelling the initiative. Numerous NFTs ceased to show images properly, contributing to fears the assets would no longer be supported or held their worth.

They wouldn't have bought any of the NFTs if they had known they were unregistered securities, the plaintiffs said in their lawsuit. The group also alleged they would not have invested if they had known Nike could cancel the project so soon after its inception.

After the December shutdown, numerous users complained of severe technical problems with their NFTs. Images of highly prized objects in the Clone X series went missing, being replaced with “holding page” messages from Cloudflare stating that the content was taken down.

This led speculation that Nike stopped paying for servers that were displaying the NFT images. While some digital works have resurfaced online afterward, the incident raised legitimate doubts about the ultimate value of digital art attached to centralized services.

RTFKT (pronounced “artifact”) was bought by Nike in December 2021 at the peak of NFT popularity. The sports company termed the acquisition as a bold step into the future of collectibles and fashion and gaming.

The attorney for the plaintiffs, Phillip Kim, has yet to comment further on the case.

When digital collectibles became trendy, numerous firms jumped in without set regulations or oversight mechanisms. This suit identifies the danger that comes with large corporations testing and then abandoning nascent digital asset segments.

Major central banks are leaping from research to action with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England have collaborated to establish a unified settlement platform that enables their digital currencies to interact across borders.

Digital Security Concerns and Safe Wallet Solutions

As central banks delve further into blockchain technology, security concerns grow, prompting users to seek protection for their digital assets by turning to a safe crypto wallet to safeguard their investments against potential vulnerabilities.

With institutional players entering the space, secure storage solutions become even more critical for both retail and institutional investors navigating this evolving landscape. Security experts note that proper digital asset management will become increasingly important as the lines between traditional and crypto finance continue to blur.

Technical Infrastructure and Private Blockchain Partnerships

What makes this initiative groundbreaking is the unprecedented collaboration with established private blockchain networks. Rather than building entirely new systems from scratch, central banks are leveraging modified versions of existing protocols that have proven their reliability and security at scale.

The multi-CBDC platform implements an innovative interoperability protocol enabling secure cross-chain transactions between different central bank digital currencies. This represents a fundamental shift in how traditional financial institutions view blockchain technology, with potential ripple effects throughout global payment systems.

Institutional Response and Market Implications

The financial establishment isn't sitting on the sidelines. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Bank of America have announced their participation in the pilot program, establishing dedicated digital asset divisions to facilitate future central bank digital currency (CBDC) transactions.

This integration creates fascinating market dynamics, particularly regarding how private cryptocurrencies will position themselves in relation to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Market analysts suggest that these developments could legitimize blockchain technology more broadly while creating new competitive pressures for certain cryptocurrency segments, especially within the stablecoin market, where direct competition may emerge.

Privacy Innovations and Technical Challenges

The platform introduces a tiered privacy model that balances confidentiality with regulatory oversight—a significant technical achievement addressing one of the primary concerns about government-issued digital currencies.

Cryptocurrency brokers are already preparing their infrastructure to accommodate these new CBDC systems while maintaining their existing cryptocurrency offerings.

These established platforms understand the technical complexities involved and are positioning themselves as bridges between traditional finance and the emerging CBDC ecosystem.

Substantial challenges remain around transaction throughput capacity, disaster recovery protocols, and security against quantum computing threats. Developers are working tirelessly to address these issues before full-scale implementation can be realized.

Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Markets

This development creates both opportunities and challenges for the broader crypto ecosystem. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain distinct from these centralized initiatives, central bank adoption could accelerate mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies generally.

For those interested in understanding how to trade crypto in this evolving landscape, it is increasingly important to monitor central bank policies alongside traditional market indicators. Savvy traders are already adjusting their strategies to account for potential CBDC implementations and their effects on private cryptocurrency valuations.

Ethereum Price Struggles Under Major Resistance Levels Amid Bearish Pressure.

Ethereum (ETH) is facing mounting selling pressure as technical indicators suggest continued weakness. Despite brief rebounds earlier this month, ETH remains stuck beneath critical moving averages, dashing hopes for a swift recovery. According to the daily chart, Ethereum has repeatedly failed to break through the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), encountering stiff resistance between $1,850 and $1,900.

Worse, the weekly charts reveal an even bleaker outlook. ETH is currently trading well below key averages, including the 8-week, 20-week, and 50-week simple moving averages (SMAs). At around $1,820, Ethereum lags significantly behind the 50-week SMA at $2,850 and the 20-week SMA at $2,560, historically a bearish signal indicating the risk of further downside.

Adding to the pressure, ETH remains under nine of the ten major tracked moving averages. Without a major bullish catalyst, this technical imbalance creates downward momentum, making any sustained rally increasingly difficult. Further resistance looms from the 200-week and 250-week SMAs at $2,450 and $2,220, respectively.

Unless Ethereum decisively breaks above these critical levels, its bullish momentum is likely to remain fragile. In the short term, ETH may continue trading within the $1,750 to $1,900 range. However, risks remain skewed to the downside, and without a clear breakout above $2,000, Ethereum could struggle to participate in any broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has increased by 12.3% over the past seven days. Interestingly, Ethereum has held its ground firmly, supported by a clean uptrend that began after the sharp recovery from $1,550 that kicked off on Tuesday. 

As it stands, the Ethereum price is at an important technical phase after retesting the $1,799 resistance level and pulling back into its final intraday support zone. A fresh push above $1,800 could open the door to $1,840 and beyond, whereas deeper retracements would test three important zones.

Ethereum Turns Resistance Levels Into Support

Ethereum's recent rally has seen it break past three notable resistance levels that have rejected its price action for most of April. Interestingly, these resistance levels are located at $1,590, $1,654, and $1,703, as indicated by a technical analysis of Ethereum's price action on the hourly candlestick timeframe chart on the TradingView platform. 

Following these breakouts, Ethereum continued to push upward with momentum until it encountered a tougher ceiling near the $1,800 mark. After briefly tapping into this zone, the price experienced a minor rejection, retracing back towards $1,730 before finding support and beginning another gradual climb.

As it stands, the resistance at $1,800 is the next level to beat in the hopes of a close above $2,000 before the end of April. Nonetheless, even if Ethereum does not reach this level, a bullish sentiment will still be in place if it manages to hold above the broken resistances, which have now turned to support on the H1 timeframe. 

Ethereum Could Still Be Bullish Unless $1,654 Breaks

Ethereum's outlook remains bullish as long as the newly reclaimed levels at $1,590, $1,654, and $1,703 continue to act as reliable support zones. The first zone, positioned at $1,703, represents a short-term hourly support level. This area may attract early entries, but it is high-risk and prone to breaking easily. 

Beneath that lies the more structurally significant support at $1,654, which is also evident on the 4-hour chart. This level is a medium-risk zone, characterized by a cleaner and sound area of demand. It has a higher probability of initiating a bounce if tested, and its preservation is important in maintaining a short-term bullish bias for Ethereum. 

The strongest support level is at $1,590 and is somewhat low-risk for reentry. It has the most favorable risk-to-reward ratio, where smart money traders are likely to accumulate.

As long as Ethereum stays above $1,703, the current uptrend remains valid. The bullish bias remains intact unless there's a confirmed break below $1,654. A drop below the $1,654 support would shift the short-term outlook to neutral or bearish. On the other hand, a successful close above $1,800 could cascade toward the next target around $1,840 or even higher.

An altcoin associated with a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) project surged by nearly 44% on Friday after receiving a prominent exchange listing.

On Thursday, the South Korean crypto exchange giant Bithumb announced it was listing XYO, the native token of the XYO Network.

The XYO Network aims to process any type of decentralized data.

Explains the project's website,

“Encompassing both a network and protocol, XYO can be used for aggregating, verifying, organizing, and utilizing decentralized data from any hardware node capable of running XYO-enabled software or firmware.

XYO's defining premise is decentralized verification, allowing network devices to verify the data flowing into the network's databases by acting as witnesses for one another, strengthening the veracity of data received. Simple, accessible organization then allows this data to be put to use quickly and efficiently.”

Earlier this month, the project announced it would be migrating its network to a new layer-1 chain focused on DePIN. To help facilitate that move, the XYO Network is also rolling out a new layer-1 native token, XL1, and will operate with a dual-token model going forward.

The original XYO token will stay on Ethereum (ETH) and act “as an anchor to regulate the flow of XL1 into its native blockchain,” according to the project.

XYO is trading at $0.0154 at time of writing. The 278th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up by more than 71% in the past week.

“It's the entire ecosystem from an age that's gone.”

Most high schoolers only get to study fossils through textbooks and videos. But students at San Pedro High School in Los Angeles got a much more up-close-and-personal experience thanks to the discovery of millions of fossils dated millions of years old underneath their campus.

When a construction project to renovate the school kicked off in 2022, fossils—ranging from a saber-tooth salmon to shorebirds and sea turtles to a prehistoric megalodon—started turning up pretty quickly. “I thought this stuff was something that never happens, especially around here,” student Taya Olson told KABC. “It only happens in textbooks.” 

And those finds have not slowed. Over the next two years, the fossil finds kept coming, with numbers of bones from sea creatures of all sorts growing into the millions. “It represents an entire ecology of the ocean nine million years ago,” said Wayne Bischoff, director of cultural resources at Envicom Corporation.

So far, the project has uncovered out over 200 species, but it could take years before experts know the true extent of the find. “The fact that millions of fossils have been unearthed on this site has led to a new era of concentrative studies that will bring notoriety to this community and this high school,” said Alberto Carvalho, Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent. 

Located west of Long Beach on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the campus was unknowingly sitting atop two different fossil hotspots—a bone bed from the Miocene era (nearly nine million years ago), and a shell bed from the Pleistocene era (roughly 120,000 years old ), according to the Los Angeles Times. 

“There's never been this type of density of fossils ever found at a site like this before in California,” Bischoff told the newspaper, adding that the find confirms the existing scientific idea that ancient Los Angeles was once underwater. 

The oldest of the fossils were trapped within a fossilized algae known as diatomite.The algae concentration points to a nutrient-rich area that could have fed a variety of marine life—even including dolphins and whales. Bischoff said that the wealth of fossils mixed with shore material has given rise to the theory that a whole prehistoric island once washed onto what is now the L.A. shore.

The fossilized finds are now mostly in the hands of researchers—whether from the school district, the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, Cal State Channel Islands, or the natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.

Milad Esfahani, a San Pedro High School student, even got in on the research at the Natural History Museum by sorting fossilized shells. “It was sort of like gold panning,” he told the Times, adding he now hopes to become a marine paleontologist.

Mining the fossilized beds can give researchers an exceptional view into the past. “It's the entire ecosystem from an age that's gone,” Bischoff told LAist. “We have all this evidence to help future researchers put together what an entire ecology looked like nine million years ago. That's really rare.”

Metrics details

Despite the appeal of flawless order, semiconductor technology has demonstrated that implanting inhomogeneities into single-crystalline materials is pivotal for modern electronics. However, the influence of the local arrangement of chemical inhomogeneities on the material's functionalities is underexplored. In this work, we control the distribution of chemical inhomogeneities in La3+-substituted ferroelectric BiFeO3 thin films. By means of a stress- and composition-driven phase transition, we trigger the formation of a lattice of La3+-rich and La3+-poor layers. This ordering correlates with the emergence of an antipolar phase. An electric field restores the original ferroelectric phase and re-randomizes the distribution of the La3+ inhomogeneities. Leveraging these insights, we tune the polar/antipolar phase coexistence to set the net polarization of La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 to any desired value between its saturation limits. Finally, we control the net polarization response in device-compliant capacitor heterostructures to show that inhomogeneity-distribution control is a valuable tool in the design of functional oxide electronics.

Introducing chemical inhomogeneities into crystalline materials has been crucial for technological advancement1,2. This is particularly evident in silicon technology, where the integration of impurity atoms constitutes the very essence of semiconductor functionalities. However, introducing these inhomogeneities with uncontrolled, typically homogeneous distribution is no longer sufficient to sustain the current technological development3,4. The discovery that important functionalities, such as ferroic order5,6, superconductivity7,8, magnetoresistance9, and even CO2 photoreduction10 often depend on the configuration of inhomogeneities in the crystal structure underlines this point. As a result, the focus of materials refinement has been shifting from random toward ordered insertion of inhomogeneities during synthesis. In a complementary development, there is an emerging perspective of reversibly tuning material properties without inserting or removing inhomogeneities, but solely by rearranging them. The potential of this method is far from being exploited, however, since inhomogeneities typically remain localized after material fabrication, which inhibits post-synthesis functionality control11,12,13,14.

A class of functional materials prone to chemical inhomogeneities are ferroelectric perovskite oxides15,16,17,18, materials that are discussed as critical components of next-generation information technologies4,19,20. Recent studies on BaTiO3, Pb[Zr0.2Ti0.8]O3, and SrTiO3 have demonstrated active control over the arrangement of anionic inhomogeneities such as oxygen off-stoichiometry21,22,23. The associated tunability of electrical conduction and polarization kinetics opens up a new degree of freedom in materials engineering. Since cations determine the ferroelectric behavior, establishing control over the distribution of cationic inhomogeneities, a largely unexplored frontier, is of great importance24.

Here, we reversibly create and annihilate ordered arrangements of cationic inhomogeneities in ferroelectric single-layer La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 thin films. Specifically, using a diamond-coated scanning-probe tip, we apply a compressive force to create layer-dependent variations in the La3+ concentration. Strikingly, the local pressure-induced transition from polar to antipolar order correlates with the arrangement of the La3+ inhomogeneities in the lattice. By tuning the magnitude of the mechanical force, we manipulate the polar/antipolar phase coexistence to create quasi-continuous net polarization between zero and the saturation polarization of La0.15Bi0.85FeO3. Finally, we demonstrate the device potential of the reversible polar-to-antipolar transition and of La3+ distribution control in capacitor heterostructures. This outlines how the control of inhomogeneity distribution can be utilized to adapt the properties of functional oxides post-growth in support of the development of novel multifunctional electronics components.

For this study, we chose La3+-substituted multiferroic BiFeO3 as the model system. La3+ inhomogeneities substitute for the Bi3+ ions, which is responsible for the ferroelectric order24,25,26. Their substitution has enabled magnetoelectric operation at voltages close to technological requirements27. The proximity of multiple structural phases in BiFeO3 with respect to the La3+ concentration14,28,29,30 or external stimuli31,32,33,34,35,36 renders La3+-substituted films the ideal platform to study the relation between chemical inhomogeneities, their distribution, and the rich functionalities of oxide thin films. The existence of a morphotropic polar-to-antipolar transition for a La3+ substitution level of 15% in the bulk form37 motivates the study of La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 thin films.

We grew epitaxially strained (001)p.c.-oriented La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 films with a thickness of 100 nm on a 14-nm-thick SrRuO3 buffer layer on top of (110)o-oriented single-crystalline DyScO3 substrates using pulsed laser deposition. Here, we chose the lattice matching DyScO3 substrate motivated by the studies reporting high crystalline quality and excellent properties of the BiFeO3 thin film system20,26,38. The strain state, orientation, and thickness of the films were characterized using X-ray diffraction, see supplementary information, Fig. S1. The subscripts “p.c.” and “o” refer to the pseudocubic and orthorhombic lattices of BiFeO3 and DyScO3, respectively.

We start the investigation by probing the distribution of the La3+ ions in the pristine La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 films with high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The intensity in the HAADF-STEM micrographs scales approximately with the square of the atomic number, Z39,40, thereby allowing us to differentiate between Bi3+ and La3+ ions located at the A-site of the ABO3 perovskite structure. The HAADF-STEM image of our pristine film and the superimposed normalized intensities associated with the A-site (Bi3+ and La3+, noted as Bi3+/La3+) atomic columns are plotted in Fig. 1a. The regular intensity pattern and the uniformity of the averaged vertical and horizontal line profiles confirm the expected homogeneous distribution of the La3+ ions in the pristine La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 films.

A local out-of-plane polarization reversal is induced by the application of −/+ 10 V scanning-probe tip bias. The scanning direction is horizontal in (b–d).

The impact of the homogeneous La3+ distribution on the functionality of the films is investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). The topography of the film, as well as out-of-plane and in-plane polarization-domain configurations, are shown in Fig. 1b–d. The films exhibit a smooth topography with unit-cell-high step terraces. Moreover, the comparison of the contrast in vertical PFM (VPFM) between the pristine, upward- and downward-polarized regions after PFM tip-induced poling indicates a mostly downward-oriented polarization in the out-of-plane direction in the pristine state, and distinct three piezoresponse levels in lateral PFM (LPFM) images, representative of all four in-plane polarization-domain states of BiFeO341. Hence, the PFM investigation confirms the ferroelectric order in the pristine La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 films. The La3+ substitution causes the in-plane polarization domains to arrange randomly, in comparison to the neatly ordered stripe-domain arrangement in BiFeO3 on (110)o-oriented DyScO3 substrates26. Because of this, the net-in-plane polarization of the pristine La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 is substantially attenuated with respect to pure BiFeO326.

In the next step, we tune the distribution of the cationic La3+ inhomogeneities. A way to act on the La3+ arrangement is indicated by the rich phase diagram BiFeO3 exhibits under hydrostatic pressure42. Pure BiFeO3 loses its spontaneous polarization under the influence of mechanical force through a ferroelectric-to-antipolar phase transition. Motivated by the recent reports highlighting correlations between lattice chemistry and polarization in epitaxial systems43,44,45, we thus apply a compressive force and study its influence on the La3+ distribution in the films.

Using diamond-coated AFM tips with a relatively large apex curvature radius (~100 nm), we applied a local mechanical force up to 140 μN to the film surface while raster-scanning a square-shaped region. Strikingly, after exposure to the compressive force, the HAADF-STEM micrograph shows a reduced intensity at the A-site of the ABO3 perovskite in every other Bi3+- and La3+-containing plane, see Fig. 2a. This STEM intensity modulation is evident in the line profile extracted along the vertical of the image in Fig. 2a. The results are depicted in Fig. 2b and show two distinct STEM intensity levels of the (001)p.c.-planes that alternate along the [001]p.c.-direction. They indicate a periodic modulation of the average atomic number when passing from one layer to another. We thus conclude that the applied compressive force triggered an alternating enrichment and depletion of the La3+ distribution in the films. This is further supported by complementary electron energy-loss spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis, see supplementary information Fig. S2a and Table S1.

Superimposed on the HAADF-STEM image are the STEM intensities normalized to the maximum intensity of the A-site (labeled Bi3+/La3+) atomic columns plotted at their fitted coordinates.

The purple- and light blue-shaded regions denote the pristine and stressed areas, respectively. d, e LPFM, and VPFM micrographs of the same region as depicted in (c). The antipolar region is marked with a dashed white square.

In addition to the oscillations of the average atomic weight, the La3+-enriched layers now reveal an alternating up-up–down-down shift of the Bi3+/La3+ ions. The cation shifts are indicated by the blue and red arrows in Fig. 2a. Note that the influence of the cation shifts on the intensity profile in Fig. 2b is subtracted in the analysis shown in the supplementary information Fig. S2b.

The observed structural deformation, i.e., alternating up-up–down-down shift in every other A-site plane in Fig. 2a, is characteristic of an antipolar phase with the space group Pnma46,47, see supplementary information, Fig. S3. Additional HAADF-STEM micrographs taken at the boundary between the ferroelectric and antipolar regions demonstrate a clear spatial separation between layered La3+-arrangements with antipolar electric-dipole orderings and the pristine phase with randomized La3+ distribution, see supplementary information, Fig. S4. Hence, the experimental results show a striking correlation between the lattice chemistry and the polar nature of the La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 unit cell. In ferroelectric BiFeO3, the Bi3+ electronic lone pair drives local polar distortions in the ferroelectric unit cell in BiFeO324,25,26. Hence, the Bi3+ substitution with La3+ influences the net polar state in the La-BiFeO3 films. At the pressure-induced polar-to-antipolar phase transition in highly La3+ substituted BiFeO3 thin films, the reorganization of the atomic displacement within the unit cell may, hence, correlate with a change in lattice chemistry. Here, the identical radii and valence states of Bi3+ and La3+ cations at play most likely facilitate the reversible cationic redistribution across the phase transition, as highlighted in the report of the different polar regions in the phase diagram of BiFeO3/LaFeO3 superlattices48.

In the next step, we investigate the topography and ferroelectric domain configuration of the antipolar region. Using AFM, we observe a transition from an initially flat surface to a corrugated pattern, see Fig. 2c. We attribute this corrugation to the vertical compression and resulting lateral expansion of the La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 lattice in the antipolar Pnma phase, see supplementary information, Fig. S4c, d. In addition, the lack of piezoresponse in both the LPFM and VPFM micrographs validates the transition to the antipolar phase in this region, see Fig. 2d and e, respectively.

We tested whether mechanical-damage-induced artifacts can explain the observed AFM/PFM results by studying the dependence of the topographic corrugation on the raster-scanning direction during force application. The results, depicted in supplementary information Figs. S5 and S6 show that neither surface reconstruction49 nor chemistry changes48 occur in the regions of interest and that the corrugation always aligns with respect to the [1\(\bar{1}\)0]o-axis of the DyScO3 substrate, independent of the diamond-tip scanning direction. The disconnection between scanning direction and topographic features, combined with the HAADF-STEM results, allows us to exclude mechanical-damage-induced artifacts as the cause of the topographic alteration in Fig. 2c and the loss of piezoresponse in Fig. 2d and e.

With the knowledge that a compressive force can rearrange La3+ ions in the La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 films, we now investigate the force-magnitude dependence of this process. We applied forces from 21 μN to 139 μN to six different regions of the sample and assessed the degree of the La3+ ordering by studying the ferroelectric polarization using LPFM. We observe a progressive loss in polarization-domain contrast, indicative of the steady transition from the ferroelectric to the antipolar phase with increasing force. A selection of the respective LPFM micrographs is depicted in Fig. 3a–d.

The exposed regions are outlined with colored dashed boxes. e Piezoresponse histogram width from the treated regions, relative to the histogram width of the surrounding pristine region and associated normalized macroscopic polarization as a function of the applied force. The color of the data points corresponds to that of the dashed boxes in (a–d). The LPFM micrographs corresponding to the black data points are not shown.

We quantify the suppression of the polarization by extracting the width of the LPFM histogram of the stressed-square region and normalizing it to the according value for the pristine region. Note that the LPFM histogram depicts the presence and number of piezoresponse levels associated with in-plane polarization domains, see supplementary information, Fig. S7. The gradual fading of piezoresponse contrast with increasing force can thereby be translated to a quantitative estimate of the extent of the polar-to-antipolar phase transition. The result is depicted in Fig. 3e and corroborates that we have identified a new handle to adjust the macroscopic polarization level of the La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 films quasi-continuously between zero and the saturation value by making use of the pressure-controlled polar-to-antipolar phase transitions. This tunability is an essential feature for multi-level information technology50,51,52,53. Note that, since the antipolar order is accompanied by an alternating La3+ distribution, we conclude that the degree of La3+ ordering scales with the applied force, too.

Next, we investigate whether the force-controlled inhomogeneity distribution and the associated variation in spontaneous polarization can be reversed. Therefore, we applied a local electric field in the form of an 8 V bias to a conducting PFM tip and poled a small square within the antipolar region. Strikingly, a cross-sectional HAADF-STEM micrograph of a region treated in this way reveals the return to the homogeneous La3+ distribution and back-conversion to the ferroelectric R3c phase, see Fig. 4a. This remarkable structural and dielectric reversibility is corroborated by the scanning-probe investigations in Fig. 4b–d. We also observe a return to the flat topography of the pristine film in the poled region, see Fig. 4b, and to the original piezoresponse contrast in the PFM micrographs, see Fig. 4c, d. These observations, therefore, demonstrate full reversibility of the force-induced La3+ and antipolar order under an electric field. In supplementary information, Fig. S8, we show that this cycle can be repeated multiple times. Finally, we tested the impact of the La3+ substitution on the phase conversion, see supplementary Figs. S9 and S10. The polar-to-antipolar phase transition is only achieved for 10 and 15 % La3+ substitution levels. Films with 20% La3+ substitution already exhibit the antipolar phase in the pristine state (Fig. S10), in agreement with reports on highly La3+-substituted BiFeO3 films54. Here, the ferroelectric phase cannot be triggered by an external electric field. Films without La3+ substitution, i.e., pure BiFeO3 films, exhibit ferroelectric order in the pristine state, and the application of local stress does not trigger the emergence of the antipolar phase, as shown in Fig. S9a–c.

Superimposed on the HAADF-STEM image are the STEM intensities normalized to the maximum intensity of the A-site (labeled Bi3+/La3+) atomic columns plotted at their fitted coordinates. The averaged line profiles in vertical and horizontal directions demonstrate the return to the homogeneous distribution of La3+ ions. b–d Topography, VPFM, and LPFM micrographs of a stressed and subsequently poled region. The associated line profiles correspond to the dashed lines in the micrographs. The shaded regions in the line profiles denote the pristine (purple), stressed (light blue), and subsequently poled (light green) regions.

For a quantitative analysis of the voltage needed to restore the original ferroelectric state from the antipolar phase, we performed local PFM switching spectroscopy measurements on pristine ferroelectric regions and stressed antipolar regions. Figure 5a shows the topography within the antipolar region before (left panel) and after (right panel) local poling. The white circles, respectively squares indicate the location of the immobile tip during the electric-field cycling, starting with the negative, respectively positive polarity of the tip bias. The clear topography change at these locations demonstrates the ability to recover the ferroelectric phase at the nanoscale. The PFM switching spectroscopy loops measured in the ferroelectric and antipolar states are shown in Fig. 5b and c, respectively. While the voltage-dependent piezoresponse shows the characteristic hysteretic behavior in the ferroelectric regions, see Fig. 5b, a clear signature of the antipolar phase can be tracked at sub-ferroelectric-coercive field voltage (<2 V) in Fig. 5c. Both the piezoresponse phase and amplitude signals are suppressed in the antipolar phase in the initial poling sequence in Fig. 4c. The transition to the ferroelectric state is not voltage-polarity dependent. Finally, we note that we did not detect any variation of the pressure-induced or poled features over a time period exceeding three months, as documented in supplementary information, Fig. S11.

Upward- and downward-oriented polarization states are noted as P⨀ and P⨂, respectively.

In order to explore the technological potential of our findings, we finally integrate the La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 films into a device-like architecture. Inspired by the application-relevant integration of BiFeO3 in ferromagnetic/multiferroic heterostructures 20,27,38,55,56, we deposited circular Co90Fe10 (2 nm) /Pt (2 nm) top electrodes, hence creating a SrRuO3/La0.15Bi0.85FeO3/Co90Fe10/Pt capacitor.

To probe its ferroelectric polarization non-invasively through the top and bottom electrodes, we used optical second-harmonic generation (SHG). This technique describes the frequency-doubling of electromagnetic waves in materials lacking inversion symmetry57. In our experimental geometry, the SHG intensity scales quadratically with the net-in-plane polarization magnitude26,58. Hence, we can distinguish the antipolar, centrosymmetric from the ferroelectric, non-centrosymmetric phase non-destructively by the absence or presence of an SHG signal, respectively.

Figure 6a shows the spatially resolved SHG emission from the capacitor before force application. Note that 103 bipolar voltage pulses were applied to enhance the net-in-plane polarization by reorganizing the randomized pristine domain configuration into a regular pattern of stripe domains26. The resulting net in-plane polarization within the capacitor gives rise to a strong SHG signal26. (Note that some regions in the outer rim of the capacitor exhibit low SHG intensity. In this area, the in-plane polarization domains remain homogeneously distributed, leading to a weak net in-plane polarization and, thus, negligible SHG emission.) Subsequent application of a compressive force to the top electrode leads to a suppression of the SHG emission, see Fig. 6b. Finally, Fig. 6c shows that application of an electric field to the La0.15Bi0.85FeO3-based capacitor recovers the original SHG intensity.

a–c Optical SHG images of a SrRuO3/La0.15Bi0.85FeO3/Co90Fe10 capacitor after a 104 ferroelectric-switching events, b subsequent application of 140 μN, and c consecutive 104 ferroelectric-switching events. The dashed white circle outlines the electrode region with a diameter of 20 μm. Bright regions correspond to high SHG emission and, therefore, denote the presence of a macroscopic polarization. The regions with low SHG intensity within the capacitor area indicate low net in-plane polarization due to incomplete training. Schematics of the ferroelectric-switching and force-application experiments are depicted below the respective SHG micrograph. The color of the La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 in the sketches denotes its pristine ferroelectric (purple), force-induced antipolar (light blue), and consecutively poled ferroelectric (light green) phases.

We have thus evidenced that the phase transition from ferroelectric to antipolar occurs in a device architecture just like in the original La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 films. In turn, we conclude that the La3+ ions can be redistributed into a layered arrangement even in capacitor structures. Moreover, we have observed the return of the ferroelectric phase and, thus, our ability to complete a polarization-mediated write-and-erase cycle in a prototypical device architecture.

In striking contrast to previous reports, in which the stabilization of the antipolar Pnma phase required elaborate elastic and electrostatic boundary-condition engineering in complex La0.4Bi0.6FeO3/BiFeO346 and TbScO3/BiFeO347 superlattices, we stabilize the antipolar phase in a single La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 layer directly integrated into a capacitor. This situation suggests that rather than electrostatics, strain, or surface chemistry, the force-dependent distribution of cationic La3+ inhomogeneities is originally responsible for the robustness of both the ferroelectric and antipolar phases in the single layers and capacitors. Furthermore, we tested the robustness of the reversible polar-to-antipolar phase conversion on single-crystalline substrates other than DyScO3. The local AFM and PFM images of stressed and subsequently poled regions in films grown on (001)-oriented SrTiO3 demonstrate that the local control on the La3+ inhomogeneities and corresponding polar-to-antipolar phase transition is achieved with similar experimental parameters, see supplementary Fig. S12. Hence, the findings reported in this work are not limited to the use of orthorhombic DyScO3 substrates.

In conclusion, we redistribute cationic inhomogeneities in a magnetoelectric oxide material using compressive force and electric fields. In the model system La0.15Bi0.85FeO3, we demonstrate that the rearrangement between randomized and layered distributions of La3+ ions enables reversible and continuous interconversion between ferroelectric and antipolar phases. In a step toward multi-level computing technology, we transfer this concept to a device-like capacitor environment. This work on the BiFeO3 material family, the only room-temperature multiferroic material to date and the most promising compound toward the realization of ultra-low-energy consuming logic devices27, advances the development of future ferroelectric and magnetoelectric memory technology. Here, the continuous tuning of the fraction of antipolar and ferroelectric phases via phase interconversion may enable memristive behavior as well in the magnetoelectric response. While our investigation focused on 100-nm-thick layers, we report the reversible control on the polar state in 20-nm-thick layers in the supplementary information, Fig. S13. Lastly, the scope of controlling cationic inhomogeneity distributions goes beyond mere polarization engineering, however. We envision multifunctional oxide-based devices whose mechanical, electrical, or optical properties at large can be readily adjusted through cationic inhomogeneity-distribution control.

The La0.15Bi0.85FeO3/SrRuO3 films were grown on single-crystalline (110)o-oriented DyScO3 substrates (CrysTec GmbH) by pulsed laser deposition using a 248 nm KrF excimer laser. The SrRuO3 buffer layer was deposited at 700 °C under 0.15 mbar oxygen partial pressure with a laser fluence of 0.69 J cm−2 and a laser repetition rate of 8 Hz (9600 pulses for the growth of 14-nm-thick film). The La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 films were subsequently grown at 700 °C under 0.15 mbar oxygen partial pressure with a laser fluence of 1.14 J cm−2 keeping the repetition rate at 8 Hz (43,200 pulses for the growth of 100-nm-thick film). Post-growth, the films were cooled down with a cooling rate of 10 °C/min. The heterostructure was transferred to a high-vacuum magnetron sputtering chamber with a base pressure of ~10−7 mbar. The Co90Fe10 and Pt layers were deposited via DC magnetron sputtering with argon pressure ranging from 2 ∙ 10−3 to 7 ∙ 10−3 mbar under a static magnetic field of 200 Oe. The electrodes were patterned by photolithography and argon-ion milling. The samples used were kept in ambient conditions.

Scanning-probe microscopy measurements were conducted using an NTEGRA Prima scanning-probe microscope (NT-MDT Spectrum Instruments) and a Bruker Multimode 8 atomic force microscope. To apply force to the surface of the sample, we used diamond-coated DCP20 tips from NT-MDT. The force was calibrated using a force-distance curve, see supplementary information Fig. S14. Topography and PFM were performed with μmasch HQ:NSC35/Pt tips in contact mode. During raster-scanning, a 3-V peak-to-peak AC voltage modulation was applied to the tip at ~70 kHz. Ferroelectric poling was induced by applying a DC bias of 8 V to the tip. The bottom SrRuO3 electrode was grounded. The same test region for the stress treatment and electric poling is identified and overlaid using the characteristic topography change accompanying the polar-to-antipolar phase transition. In addition, the clear drop of piezoresponse in the antipolar region enables a convenient location of the stressed regions. During the different poling or local pressure application, the sample remains fixed in the AFM. The PFM images in Figs. 1–4 were recorded simultaneously in Cartesian coordinates (using X and Y outputs of the lock-in amplifiers rather than R and θ). This way, instrumental background noise interfering with the measurements was minimized. The PFM switching spectroscopy loops were measured using an Asylum Research AFM system (MFP-3D) with HQ:NSC18/Pt tips (MicroMasch). Voltage pulses of 12.5 ms duration with incrementally increasing amplitude were applied to the tip. The PFM signal was measured in the resonance-enhanced PFM mode at an AC modulation frequency of 350 kHz and amplitude of 0.6 V.

X-ray symmetric θ − 2θ scan and reciprocal space mapping were performed using a Panalytical X'Pert3 MRD four-circle diffractometer at a wavelength of 1.5406 Å. X-ray reflectivity was employed to measure the thickness of the thin films.

Cross-sectional specimens of single-phase films or across different phases were prepared for transmission electron microscopy with an FEI Helios NanoLab 600i focused ion beam (FIB) instrument operated at accelerating voltages of 30 and 5 kV. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging was attained with a probe-corrected FEI Titan Themis microscope operated at 300 kV. Atomic-resolution imaging of the La0.15Bi0.85FeO3 thin films was performed by high-angular dark-field (HAADF) STEM, whose signal is proportional to Zn (n ≈ 1.6–2.0), with Z as the atomic number. A probe convergence semi-angle of 18 mrad and collecting semi-angles of 70–190 mrad for the HAADF-STEM detector were used.

To correct for the scan distortions, time series consisting of 10 frames (2048 × 2048 pixels) were acquired and averaged by rigid and non-rigid registration using the Smart Align software59. The processing of the resulting HAADF-STEM images was performed in MATLAB, using custom-developed scripts as follows. First, the raw data were background-corrected and denoised using the procedure described in ref. 60. Subsequently, the atomic column positions in the corrected images were fitted by means of a center-of-mass peak-finding algorithm and refined by solving a least-squares minimization problem using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. This iterative refinement makes use of seven-parameter two-dimensional Gaussians. The fitting allows quantitative estimation of the atomic column peak intensities and their positions with picometer precision61,62. For comparison, the fitted intensities of the Bi3+/La3+ atomic columns in each image were normalized to the maximum atomic-column intensity. Finally, a quantitative analysis of the lattice parameters was performed by means of a peak-pair analysis62.

130-fs laser pulses with a repetition rate of 1 kHz and a wavelength of 1400 nm were used for all SHG measurements. To achieve maximum intensity, we aligned the polarization of the fundamental laser pulse along [1\(\bar{1}\)0]o using a half-wave plate and probed the frequency-doubled light along the same axis using a Glan-Taylor prism. We detected the frequency-doubled light with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. A spatial resolution of ~3 μm was achieved with a long-working-distance microscope objective. All experiments were conducted in a normal-incidence geometry to minimize optical SHG contributions from the surface or interfaces.

We still need more data on thermals, efficiency, and power.

Earlier this month, reports suggested that Nvidia has added SK hynix as a GDDR7 supplier for its RTX 50 series GPUs, after previously only sourcing from Samsung. On Chiphell, a user recently got their hands on a Gigabyte Gaming OC RTX 5070 Ti with SK hynix memory and found its overclocking potential similar to what we've seen from Samsung, via UNIKO's Hardware. While thermal and efficiency data are missing, this is nonetheless a positive indication.

Each generation, Nvidia casts a wide net to broaden its memory supplier base, ensuring multiple options. This is a common approach with many products, especially SSDs, many of which often ship with revised controllers or NAND flash modules later in their lifecycle. This shouldn't impact the average consumer as Nvidia likely validates all memory chips to run at a minimum of 28 Gbps (or 30 Gbps for the RTX 5080), at defined power, voltage, and temperature settings.

A user at Chiphell secured an RTX 5070 Ti from Gigabyte (SK hynix memory) earlier this week. Several days later, they attempted to increase the power limits by flashing a BIOS that was designated for the Aorus Master RTX 5070 Ti (Samsung memory), resultantly bricking the card. Fortunately, the damage wasn't permanent as their GPU was equipped with a dual BIOS, allowing them to switch to the secondary firmware.

Either way, to test the limits of their GPU's memory, the user achieved a memory clock of 2,125 MHz (34 Gbps) with overclocking, aligning with the majority of Samsung overclocks we've witnessed. This tells us that GDDR7 modules from SK hynix are just as capable as ones from Samsung when it comes to overclocking - with this sample.

hynix g7 oc tested by user michelelee.hynix g7 on 5070ti runs at 28gbps out of the box and it can be overclocked to 34gbps without problems.although bios for Samsung g7 can be flashed on cards that use hynix g7, the card will be bricked.user michelelee on chh shares his… https://t.co/T6Yn7LjL3J pic.twitter.com/77ZLbYJRfnApril 26, 2025

A common theory being put forward is that RTX 50 BIOS versions are memory vendor-dependent, so firmware for Samsung will not work on SK hynix-based cards, and conversely. However, it's difficult to draw a reasonable conclusion as our test data is limited to just one example.

Even though memory offerings from SK hynix, Micron, and Samsung are mostly comparable and rigorously validated by Nvidia, there have been slight inconsistencies in the past. Likewise, the overclocking headroom, voltage requirements for specific speeds, and thermals can differ between memory technologies, making it a bit of a lottery for enthusiasts and overclockers.

MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell's diehard support for Donald Trump's election lies has landed him in multiple legal entanglements, including a case in Denver, where the pillow salesman is currently being sued for defamation by a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems. Eric Coomer, who previously worked for the election vendor, has accused Lindell of having defamed him with his paranoid rantings about the 2020 presidential election having been rigged against Trump. In a situation that is already adequately stupid, there is always room for things to get stupider, as this week it was reported that Lindell's lawyer was in hot water for having filed a legal brief that was written with generative AI.

U.S. District Court Judge Nina Wang is trying to get to the bottom of how and why Lindell's lawyer, Christopher Kachouroff, decided to file a court brief that included a large number of fabricated legal citations. In a filing made this week, Wang sought to clarify why Kachouroff and Lindell's other lawyer, Jennifer DeMaster, had allowed such a disastrously unprofessional thing to happen.

The brief that Kachouroff previously submitted was stuffed full of “nearly thirty” glaring errors, including, among other things, “citation of cases that do not exist,” court papers show. “Despite having every opportunity to do so, Mr. Kachouroff declined to explain to the Court how the Opposition became replete with such fundamental errors,” the filing made by Wang states. “Time and time again, when Mr. Kachouroff was asked for an explanation of why citations to legal authorities were inaccurate, he declined to offer any explanation.”

According to the filing, Kachouroff previously claimed that the errors were the result of his own mistakes, stating: “Your Honor, I may have made a mistake and I may have paraphrased and put quotes by mistake. I wasn't intending to mislead the Court. I don't think the quote is far off from what you read to me.”

Now, however, Kachouroff has admitted that the reason there were so many errors in the brief is that it was generated by a chatbot.

“Not until this Court asked Mr. Kachouroff directly whether the Opposition was the product of generative artificial intelligence did Mr. Kachouroff admit that he did, in fact, use generative artificial intelligence,” the filing states. “After further questioning, Mr. Kachouroff admitted that he failed to cite check the authority in the Opposition after such use before filing it with the Court.”

Wang has now given Kachouroff and DeMaster until May 5th to explain how this moronic bungling of legal practice came about. If they can't explain it sufficiently by then, Wang says the two attorneys will be referred for disciplinary proceedings for having violated the rules of professional conduct to which they're sworn. Gizmodo reached out to Kachouroff and DeMaster for comment.

To add more context, Memgraph Enterprise pricing is explained under https://memgraph.com/pricing: "Starting at $25,000 per year for 16 GB, Memgraph has an all-inclusive, simple pricing model that scales with your workload without restrictions. No charge for compute. No charge for replicas. No charge for algorithms. No Surprises.".In addition, Memgraph Community is free (standard BSL license, which turns into Apache2 4 years after release date, https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/blob/master/licenses/BS...), and it has many features that are usually considered enterprise (users, replication, not a single degradation in performance or scale, etc.).Please elaborate more about why the pricing seems expensive, or put it into the infra-cost perspective :pray:

This is such an overkill for that kind of data. Even if they do plan to "scale up significantly", I doubt that they'll actually experience any benefit of graph db.

Think about how many pirates do piracy because they think copyright is unethical, versus how many of them are data hoarders, or just want shit for free, or are reselling shady IPTV boxes on eBay. The former two groups are FOSS-adjacent, but the latter two do not care. Then keep in mind how basically any free shit tends to be almost immediately abused by children with an Internet connection and no access to payment rails.Homebrew scenes seem like a candidate for doing things "the right way", but culturally they're a lot closer to piracy scenes than anyone wants to admit, at least in front of a court.

I would guess one of three cases:- They didn't want to respect the GPL, because they thought their library would be less popular if it were GPLed. (Many homebrew projects don't want to be fully Open Source because they want to hold back some special sauce, either to slow down efforts by the console vendor to stop them, or to differentiate themselves from other homebrew projects for clout. So someone building a foundational library for homebrew on a platform might want to, legitimately or otherwise, avoid presenting themselves as GPLed.)- They didn't want to respect the GPL because they couldn't, because they were also pulling in proprietary code they weren't supposed to be using anyway.- They didn't care because they were already ripping off the Nintendo SDK so why not rip off an Open Source project too. For instance, they just pointedly didn't care about copyright at all, which is a very different position than just not caring about code being proprietary.(I can respect the position of "we're ignoring the copyright on this old game, so that we can do some awesome modding/romhacking", which is very different than ignoring Open Source licenses and failing to even give credit. I don't see the former as hypocrisy; it's just "we should be able to hack on anything". Console game modders / romhackers / etc tend to have a huge amount of respect for the original game and its authors, and give due credit, even if they're technically violating copyright.)

For context, The Homebrew Channel itself was one of these projects. fail0verflow had put shittons of work into DRM for the Channel and its installer... purely so that you couldn't remove an anti-scam warning screen that they'd put in there to warn people about shady people trying to sell The Homebrew Channel.Thing is, GPL requires you to explicitly allow that behavior[0], so HBC can't use GPL software.[0] It is extraordinarily difficult to write a blanket copyright license that provides most of the terms we care for but prohibits this kind of behavior, without giving the authors the ability to veto anything they don't like. Standard operating procedure in the FOSS space has been to just allow all commercial activity.

Couldn't, not at the time. HBC has been open-sourced some time ago, sans DRM, as the Wii has long lost commercial relevance beyond enthusiast communities. This open-source re-release is what the repository is.

So was it removing license comments from the files?

LibOGC accepts donations via Patreon, which means -- if the allegations are true -- they're profiting off stolen code.

How much they profit off the stolen portion is also questionable, and open source licenses weren't meant to extort money but to grant us rights to the code. What they should do is add attributions and fix their licensing (libogc needs to be GPLv2), or remove the code. Willingly, yesterday.


reply



But I disagree. It's not extorting money to sue someone who stole your code and deliberately removed your copyright notices. The open source license only gives you the right to use the work for commercial purposes AS LONG AS you comply with the terms of the license. If you don't, then you're illegally profiting off stolen work. You can't violate the terms of a contract while still benefiting from it.I don't know how much was stolen here, but if it's foundational enough to the project that HBC had to give up development, then they might have a case, but IANAL. Not doing anything though would mean letting them get away with their ill-gotten gains (again - if true), and I just don't think that's right. Like I said, I've seen similar things happen before and it pisses me off.

One can easily find a bazillion of "github repos" that distribute what is evidently directly decompiled game code with minimal cleanup. Bonus points if they also claim it is OK as long as the game art is not distributed, which in addition to being wrong is disrespectful to developers as a whole.But when the Nintendo copyright czar wakes up, they're the bad guys...

But when the Nintendo copyright czar wakes up, they're the bad guys...


reply



Note that e.g. copyright does not apply to decompiled source code (the original authors did not write the decompiled source, unlikely assets taken verbatim - maybe that's where the arguments you mention stem from - although note that there may be regional regulatory differences). Instead, the things that might cause issues are things like the enforceable parts of the software license, any enforceable patents on the functionality, or enforceable platform license restrictions for applications built based on decompiled source.

In Nintendo console hacking scenes? None at all, there is no point to it, going through the hassle of doing cleanroom as an individual is wasted effort.Though, the spectrum between copy-pasting HexRays output verbatim and rewriting things yourself is fairly large.

There's a wide gradient of how much effort people put into reverse engineering consoles in a legal way vs. just copying code straight from their decompiler and slapping an open source license on it. libogc is very much on the "didn't even try" side of that gradient, it's been known since pretty much forever, and even their documentation is straight up copied from Nintendo's SDKs for part of their libraries.What's new here is discovering that even the parts people thought were developed "fresh" and not just straight-up asm2c'd from Nintendo are actually stolen from other open source projects in a way that tries to conceal the origin of the code.Whether you'll find that "more morally reprehensible" or not will largely depend on your personal morals, but clearly for some people that seems to be the case...

With summer just around the corner, more and more individuals are turning to portable power stations: They're ideal for camping trips, van life, or any outdoor activity where you need electricity. Yet these devices aren't just for summer-they're a lifesaver when winter storms cause the power to go out and you've got a Bluetti.

Currently, the Bluetti AC180 is listed on Amazon at a record-low price: thanks to a $250 coupon, the heavy-duty station goes for only $449-a whopping 60% below its initial summer 2023 launch price of $1,149. This kind of discount makes this a great opportunity to buy an item that can be very handy.

You can also get the Bluetti AC180 and 200W solar panels for 699$, down from the original $1,599 price (our favorite deal, but slightly more expensive).

See Bluetti AC180 + 200W Solar Panels at Amazon

The Bluetti AC180 is one of the best available portable power in the crowded market, and for several reasons: At its core is a robust 1,152Wh battery which known for both its safety and longevity. LiFePO4 technology ensures the battery can withstand over 3,500 full charge cycles before dropping to 80% capacity which makes it far more durable than many competitors that rely on standard lithium-ion cells. This durability is backed by Bluetti's five-year warranty.

With a continuous 1,800W output-and a 2,700W “power lifting” peak mode, the AC180 is capable of powering a wide array of devices (11 outlets) from smartphones and laptops to power tools and kitchen appliances. Four AC sockets allow you to plug in multiple high-demand devices at once while a plethora of USB-A, USB-C, 12V car, and wireless charging points offers compatibility with just about anything you'd need to power.

Charging the Bluetti AC180 is also fast: Through standard AC charging, you can fill it from zero to 80% in just 45 minutes with a full fill-up in about an hour-ideal for those last-minute preparations to depart or in case of an unexpected outage. If you wish to opt for renewable energy, you can go for the bundle (200W solar panel) so that you can recharge the station in an environmentally friendly.

Moreover, it weights in at around 16 kilograms and with a compact design so it is easy to shift around and stow whether you are putting it in the car for a weekend away or keeping it on hand at home in case of unexpected outages. The unit is silent in its operation so it is a far more pleasant companion than noisy gas generators, and it produces no emissions.

Bluetti is one of the most popular brands on the market, and seeing this 60% discount (on both options) is a great opportunity. Make sure you don't miss it, it can run out of stock pretty quickly.

AI chatbots available on Meta's platforms like Facebook and Instagram can engage in sexually explicit conversations with underage users, according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal.

The WSJ says that after learning about internal concerns about whether the company was doing enough to protect minors, it spent months conducting hundreds of conversations with both the official Meta AI chatbot, as well as user-created chatbots available on Meta platforms.

In one reported conversation, a chatbot using actor/wrestler John Cena's voice described a graphic sexual scenario to a user identifying as a 14-year-girl. In another conversation, the chatbot imagined a police officer catching Cena with a 17-year-old fan and telling him, “John Cena, you're under arrest for statutory rape.”

A Meta spokesperson described the WSJ's testing as “so manufactured that it's not just fringe, it's hypothetical.” The company estimated that in a 30-day period, sexual content accounted for 0.02% of responses shared via Meta AI and AI studio with users under 18.

“Nevertheless, we've now taken additional measures to help ensure other individuals who want to spend hours manipulating our products into extreme use cases will have an even more difficult time of it,” the spokesperson said.

This feature warns you of minute changes in your GPU's placement.

Asus's flagship GPU line, the ROG Astral, recently received a new feature called Equipment Installation Check that allowed users to check if their expensive graphics card is still securely attached to their motherboard. Reviewers missed this feature because it wasn't available at launch, but we spotted it being discussed on Reddit earlier in the month, and Uniko's Hardware (machine translation) subsequently looked more closely at the feature - which arrived via the GPU Tweak utility after a recent update.

The ROG Astral uses a Bosch Sensortec BMI323 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) chip, which allows it to detect any changes in its position. Because of this, the GPU Tweak utility can then detect any changes to your graphics card's position, helping you prevent GPU sagging. This is especially important as this premium GPU weighs around 3 kg — heavier than a standard red clay brick.

Many manufacturers have started introducing reinforced PCIe slots to help prevent these heavy add-in boards from damaging their premium motherboards. Despite that, it's still often not enough to support the stresses these lengthy GPUs put on such a small area, leading to long-term mechanical strain. Most hefty GPUs come with a support bracket in the box to address this issue, while a few other companies introduced screw holes on the other side of the graphics card that secures them to compatible VGA holders. You can also get a generic bracket, which are widely available online.

Despite these solutions, there's still a chance that a support bracket might slip or loosen over time. That's why the Equipment Installation Check is crucial, as it warns you if that happens. After all, most users rarely move their desktop PCs, meaning any changes in the GPU's position are likely unwanted. That way, if you get a warning, and you do not remember touching your tower case recently, then it's a sign that you need to physically check your PC (and maybe even dust it while you're at it). It might also tell you if someone tampered with your desktop without your knowledge.

This, alongside other features like Power Detector+, which measures power distribution on the 12V cables, and Thermal Map, which uses temperature sensors strategically placed around the GPU's board to monitor hotspots, is likely one of the reasons why the Asus ROG Astral is such a heavy and expensive GPU. All of these might be too much for some users, but if you dropped around $3,000 or more for an RTX 5090 GPU, you likely want to get every protection for your four-digit investment.

Amazon is shaking up the market this weekend with aggressive price drops on Apple's newest devices, ignoring tariffs and slashing prices to unprecedented levels-even on Black Friday or Prime Day. In the past 24 hours alone, the retailer has dropped massive discounts on Apple's newest products ranging from the AirPods 4 and MacBook Pros to now the brand-new 11-inch iPad which only arrived in stores last month.

If you've been waiting for the perfect moment to upgrade your tablet, this is it: Amazon is offering the new 11-inch iPad (A16 chip, 128GB, Wi-Fi 6) for an incredible $299-a record low price (original price : $349) that beats the previous best deal of $319 by a wide margin.

See at Amazon

What makes this deal so extraordinary is how fresh this iPad is to the market: Available from March 2025, the 11-inch iPad is fueled by Apple's latest A16 chip which delivers a great boost in performance and efficiency. The chip's advanced Neural Engine and machine learning capabilities make quick work of everything, whether editing 4K video or multitasking. This iPad is built to keep pace with your work and entertainment demands, all while offering all-day battery life.

You will also love the latest 11-inch Liquid Retina display which delivers vivid colors and sharp details which is pefect for streaming movies or photo editing. Thanks to True Tone technology, the display adjusts its color temperature to match your environment so you can see it clearly in any light. Starting with 128GB of storage (all 128, 256 and 512GB models are on sale), there's plenty of room for your files.

Apple has also enhanced the user experience with iPadOS which brings multitasking, natural gestures and support for essential accessories like the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and Magic Keyboard Folio. Touch ID is also integrated into the top button for convenience so that you can unlock your device, log in to apps and make secure payments with Apple Pay.

The cameras are also a lot better than in the past and this iPad is featuring a 12MP front camera with Center Stage for dynamic video calls and selfies along with a 12MP wide rear camera with True Tone flash for document scanning or capturing high-quality photos and 4K videos. It also has a speedy Wi-Fi 6 connectivity so that you can enjoy seamless streaming, downloading, and uploading.

Deals on brand-new Apple hardware like this do not appear every day… Such discounts on brand-new Apple products are unheard of even during Amazon's biggest shopping events. That this iPad is already discounted to $299-well under the previous low of $319-just a few weeks after release is almost unfathomable. Apple products are infamous for holding their value and very rarely seeing significant price cuts outside of special events so this sale is a great buying opportunity.

Move seems symbolic, but should help limit re-export of many popular controller models.

The UK Foreign Office has implemented a ban on game controller exports to Russia, reports BBC News. We hope that the ban will at least narrow the options available to Russian drone pilots attacking Ukraine and its people.

The game controller ban isn't a piece of standalone legislation, rather it is part of a package of 150 or so new trade sanctions that the UK announced earlier this week. Among the freshly banned items are other electronic products and components that might also be repurposed by the Russian military, as well as a broad range of chemicals, machinery, and metals. The UK's move comes in the wake of a similar ban imposed on Russia by the nations of the EU.



"Gaming consoles will no longer be repurposed to kill in Ukraine," said Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty. "Putin thought he could use British markets to boost his war effort, buying harmless goods and turning them into tools of war - but the UK is exposing and acting on this sinister trade." Doughty signaled that the new sanctions would “degrade Russia's military machine.”

While the games controller ban might have been singled out, we aren't sure that it will be the most impactful of the new measures from the UK. Look at the inscription or sticker on the reverse of your controller, and it isn't likely you will see any products ‘Made in the UK.' Rather, this move should help minimize the re-export of the best games controllers, many of which might pass through the UK's ports.

Taking a step back, it seems likely that Russia-friendly nations like China will find it easy to fill any latent demand precipitated by the UK's new measures on game controller exports. Some might therefore look at this particular sanction as a symbolic one. Nevertheless, if the change can impact Putin's aggression against Ukraine in any way, and save even one life, we can't criticize the new measure(s).

PC and games console-originated technology has played a surprisingly important role in the war in Ukraine, as have technologies like drones and 3D printing. Probably one of the most interesting re-purposed PC tech stories of the war was the use of a Valve Steam Deck to control and automate Ukraine's Sablya sentry machine guns.

If a Transformers toy existed for grown women, it would be Parallelle's Traveller series of toiletry bags.

Ribbed on the outside like Optimus Prime's boots, the Traveller looks like a typical (albeit stylish) makeup bag on the outside, but peer inside and you'll see a warren of different-sized pockets and loops and adjustable dividers. Unzip the bag all the way around, fold the sides down, and voila—there are all your travel toiletries, standing upright and fully in order, in a makeup organizer just like you'd have at home. When you're done, flip the sides up, pull the zippers back to the top, and it's back to being a travel bag, sturdy and secure enough to toss in a suitcase sideways or even upside down.

The Traveller is the brainchild of Annie Fan, a career designer of private-label bags for other brands. She liked to take a SoulCycle spin class before work, but found herself either forgetting her makeup and toiletries, being unable to find them in her bag, or having to lay out all her items on the communal counter. In 2022, she set out to design her own bag: the ultimate travel cosmetics bag.

“When I started designing the Traveller, structure was key,” Fan says. “It needed to function like a portable vanity—keeping everything visible, secure, and exactly where you need it, without the need to unpack.”

As for the design procedure, it was a matter of constant fine-tuning. She ultimately went through 60 prototypes to ensure she got the design precisely the way she wanted it. "Every detail had to be carefully considered, from the flexibility of the layout to how everything stays organized and accessible,” Fan says.

Today, there are now four sizes of Traveller, all with the same sturdy, vegan leather and water-resistant cotton exterior. There's the Small, with nine pockets, two divided compartments, two mesh pouches, and five loops for brushes or other items; Medium, with 16 pockets, three divided compartments, and four mesh pouches; and Large, with 20 pockets, three divided compartments, and six new pouches. There's also a new “Brush” version, which stands 9.6 inches tall and has 13 wall pockets for brushes and other toiletries, a zippered pouch, and a spacious “floor” for full-size products.

I tested the Medium and Brush Travellers on a recent five-day family trip to both a hotel and Airbnb in Louisiana, and I can confirm both serve as a veritable clown car of skin-care products and makeup. Once I arrived at my destination, I placed a Traveller on the bathroom counter, unzipped and peeled the sides down like a banana, and there were all my products—fully visible, no worse for wear from being tossed around in my suitcase, and easy to grab and replace. Even though I have tested more than 20 toiletry bags in the past year, I was still impressed.

Each of the pockets is the perfect size for anything from travel toiletry bottles and hair elastics to makeup and a travel container of dry shampoo. I was even able to fit a few Cadence Capsules into the divided compartments, regardless of how full the pockets were. The only complaint I have is that the water-resistant twill polyester fabric interior is easily stained. The marks are no more difficult to remove than with any other makeup bag, but I'm often too tired to clean my makeup brushes every single day when I'm traveling, so it would be nicer to have an easier-to-wipe-clean surface.

I also didn't like that the bag doesn't have a handle. When I needed to transport the Traveller when the bag was closed, the only way to carry it was by grabbing the tapered top. This wasn't easy when it was full, especially in the case of the Brush version when it contained full-size products. In fact, with the Brush bag I just gave up and carried it from the bottom, which is gross with a bag that has gotten damp from sitting on a bathroom counter. But this is a pretty small nit to pick.

Still, this is the best makeup bag I have ever used. I love that it can hold different sizes of products, and that small things like bobby pins and small rubber bands won't get lost. It's also a plus that the 4.5-inch-wide (for the Medium) base is narrow enough to fit on most surfaces, whether a cluttered hotel bathroom counter, car's center console, or gym locker room bench.

But most of all, the winning feature for me is being able to see everything I packed lined up neatly and visible at a glance. It's Fan's favorite feature too. “I love how easily the Traveller unzips and folds open,” she says. “For me, it's a bag that keeps me organized, which helps me be less forgetful—and I'm so happy to see it helping others too.”

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

For computer scientists, solving problems is a bit like mountaineering. First they must choose a problem to solve—akin to identifying a peak to climb—and then they must develop a strategy to solve it. Classical and quantum researchers compete using different strategies, with a healthy rivalry between the two. Quantum researchers report a fast way to solve a problem—often by scaling a peak that no one thought worth climbing—then classical teams race to see if they can find a better way.

This contest almost always ends as a virtual tie: When researchers think they've devised a quantum algorithm that works faster or better than anything else, classical researchers usually come up with one that equals it. Just last week, a purported quantum speedup, published in the journal Science, was met with immediate skepticism from two separate groups who showed how to perform similar calculations on classical machines.

But in a paper posted on the scientific preprint site arxiv.org last year, researchers described what looks like a quantum speedup that is both convincing and useful. The researchers described a new quantum algorithm that works faster than all known classical ones at finding good solutions to a wide class of optimization problems (which look for the best possible solution among an enormous number of choices).

So far, no classical algorithm has dethroned the new algorithm, known as decoded quantum interferometry (DQI). It's “a breakthrough in quantum algorithms,” said Gil Kalai, a mathematician at Reichman University and a prominent skeptic of quantum computing. Reports of quantum algorithms get researchers excited, partly because they can illuminate new ideas about difficult problems, and partly because, for all the buzz around quantum machines, it's not clear which problems will actually benefit from them. A quantum algorithm that outperforms all known classical ones on optimization tasks would represent a major step forward in harnessing the potential of quantum computers.

“I'm enthusiastic about it,” said Ronald de Wolf, a theoretical computer scientist at CWI, the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands, who was not involved with the new algorithm. But at the same time, he cautioned that it's still quite possible researchers will eventually find a classical algorithm that does just as well. And due to the lack of quantum hardware, it'll still be a while before they can test the new algorithm empirically.

The algorithm might inspire new work on the classical side, according to Ewin Tang, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who came to prominence as a teenager by creating classical algorithms that match quantum ones. The new claims “are interesting enough that I would tell classical-algorithms people, ‘Hey, you should look at this paper and work on this problem,'” she said.

When classical and quantum algorithms compete, they often do so on the battlefield of optimization, a field focused on finding the best options for solving a thorny problem. Researchers typically focus on problems in which the number of possible solutions explodes as the problem gets bigger. What's the best way for a delivery truck to visit 10 cities in three days? How should you pack the parcels in the back? Classical methods of solving these problems, which often involve churning through possible solutions in clever ways, quickly become untenable.

The specific optimization problem that DQI tackles is roughly this: You're given a collection of points on a sheet of paper. You need to come up with a mathematical function that passes through these points. Specifically, your function has to be a polynomial—a combination of variables raised to whole-number exponents and multiplied by coefficients. But it can't be too complicated, meaning the powers can't get too high. This gives you a curved line that wiggles up and down as it moves across the page. Your job is to find the wiggly line that touches the most points.

Variations of this problem show up in various forms across computer science, especially in error coding and cryptography—fields focused on securely and accurately encoding data as it's transmitted. The DQI researchers recognized, basically, that plotting a better line is akin to shifting a noisy encoded message closer to its accurate meaning.

But all that came later. When the researchers behind DQI started working on their algorithm, they didn't even have this problem in mind.

“It would have been entirely plausible for a goal-oriented researcher to start by stating the problem and then investigating whether quantum algorithms could solve it faster than classical algorithms,” said Stephen Jordan, a physicist at Google Quantum AI and one of the main architects of DQI. “Of course, for us, that's not how it happened. We came upon it by a backward and circuitous route.”

Stephen Jordan helped come up with a quantum approach to certain problems that works better than any classical approach—so far.

Jordan embarked on that route in 2023, when he joined Google and found out he'd be working with Eddie Farhi, a physicist at Google whose work has long focused on quantum algorithms that outperform classical ones. (Farhi was once Jordan's doctoral adviser at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.) Jordan knew that in 2014, Farhi had made a quantum attack on an optimization problem by thinking of energy, with lower energies corresponding to better solutions. For Farhi, energy connected optimization to quantum physics.

But Jordan wanted to do something different. He turned to another concept built into quantum physics—recognizing everything as waves. Using a mathematical tool called a quantum Fourier transform, Jordan found a way to translate all the potential answers to a well-known class of optimization problems into quantum waves. In doing so, he could manipulate the quantum system so that bigger waves (in the form of higher quantum amplitudes) corresponded to better solutions.

But there was still a huge challenge that had to be overcome. In a quantum system, asking “What's the biggest amplitude?” is not as simple as recognizing the biggest wave at the beach. The quantum landscape is incredibly complex, and it was unclear how to identify the quantum amplitudes that would correspond to the best solutions.

After many false starts, Jordan made a breakthrough: The process of selecting the best solutions turned out to be similar to the process of weeding out errors in coded messages, which is known as decoding. This is a well-studied area of computer science, full of techniques that Jordan could explore. By translating an optimization problem into a quantum one, and then applying the decoding lens to it, he had stumbled into a new way to develop quantum algorithms.

Together with Noah Shutty, also at Google, Jordan began testing decoding schemes, seeing how they fared against classical algorithms on various optimization problems. They needed both the right approach and a problem where it worked. “It turns out classical algorithms are hard to beat,” Jordan said. “After a few months of trying, we still had not notched up any wins for quantum.”

But eventually, the pair landed on a decoding algorithm first introduced in the 1960s to find and fix individual errors in an encoded message. Finding that problem was the key. “When we investigated, we seemed to hit success almost immediately,” Jordan said. Finally, they had found a problem and an approach that, together, looked like a quantum speedup.

Of course, that didn't mean it was bulletproof. “Maybe there is some classical method that can efficiently replicate your entire approach,” Jordan said. “Such dequantizations are not always obvious.”

To assuage those fears, they consulted with Mary Wootters, a coding theory expert (and Shutty's former doctoral adviser at Stanford University). She carefully searched for any known classical algorithm that might match their quantum speedup. The advantage held. The team's checks likewise suggest that it will continue to hold. “They did due diligence,” Tang said.

Bolstered by this analysis, they looked more carefully at the optimization problem they were solving. Jordan had worried that it might be too niche, with no wider applications, but Shutty recognized that this decoding problem was a variation of well-known and useful problems in encryption and other fields.

Jordan acknowledges that without a large enough quantum machine, DQI will remain a theoretical breakthrough. “DQI cannot run on present-day quantum computers,” he said. But they're still moving forward. Since the group posted their work last August, they have extended the application of DQI beyond the original problem to a broader class of optimization problems, which includes more cases of these “best path” problems.

So far, Jordan said, he expects that DQI can beat classical algorithms in those problems, too.

For the moment, the quantum community remains elated. “Finding quantum algorithms that show an advantage over classical algorithms is a very exciting endeavor of the last three decades, and the number of definite algorithms that show such an advantage is not large,” Kalai said. “Therefore, every new algorithm is a reason for celebration.”

Liverpool are officially the newly-crowned Premier League champions - a surefire way to argue that they are the best team in England. However, it is not they who will represent the league at this summer's revamped FIFA Club World Cup tournament - that honour instead falls to rivals Chelsea and Manchester City.

For one, FIFA's plans to expand the tournament from the seven-team iteration Jurgen Klopp's team won midway through the 2019/20 season into a grander 32-team summer spectacle was made long before Liverpool came out victorious in the Premier League. It was 2022 when an announcement was made and qualifying teams were finalised between 2023 and November of last year.

And the other factor is that winning the Premier League is not directly tied to the tournament whatsoever. Chelsea and Man City are representatives of UEFA rather than anything else.

Via FIFA, the world governing body allowed 16 of the 32 entrants to enter by winning continental tournaments, e.g. the Champions League. They had to have done this between 2021 and 2024.

So, the Reds' sixth European Cup won in 2019 was too early to be considered, whilst defeat to Real Madrid in the 2022 final in Paris was the closest they ever came to qualifying this time. Chelsea won the Champions League in 2021, as did Man City in 2023, then Los Blancos won it in 2022 and 2024.

UEFA then had nine more places to give away to their highest-ranked teams across the 2021 to 2024 period. They did this based on their coefficient rankings last year.

And again, poor performances in the 2020/21 and 2022/23 versions of the Champions League, plus the fact they were competing in the Europa League last season, meant Liverpool were pegged back and lost out to Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, FC Porto, Atletico Madrid, SL Benfica, Juventus and Red Bull Salzburg.

This revised tournament takes place every four years instead of annually, starting from 2025, so there is always an opportunity for Arne Slot and Co. to make the next one.

Relive Liverpool's incredible 2024/25 title-winning season – the Reds' 20th league crown and the first lifted in front of fans since 1990. From Arne Slot's arrival to unforgettable wins over City, United, and more, follow every step of the journey.

The incentive for Liverpool to perform at their very best in Europe and qualify is the vast wealth FIFA are now putting into the Club World Cup. £775m is available in total prize money to the clubs involved this year in the United States with the winner reportedly set to pocket £97m.

But that said, the trade-off is entering an intense knockout tournament off the back of a season that is relentless, as it is now UEFA have upped the number of matches in the Champions League. The Premier League is 38 matches long and cup competitions are still of great importance.

Should Chelsea or Man City make it all the way to the final this year, scheduled for July 13, they would have only 34 days to rest, recuperate and go again for the start of the 2025/26 campaign.

Ulsan HD are the K-League's sole representative at the Club World Cup - can they make an impact?

Ulsan HD have dubbed themselves the Pride of Asia ahead of their third trip to the Club World Cup, and with good reason. The club is a two-time winner of the Asian Champions League and has won the K-League 1 five times. For a team that was founded more than 40 years ago, it's a strong track record.

While South Korea's top flight doesn't get much visibility outside of Asia, it consistently develops top-notch talent who go on to play for some of Europe's top leagues. And with the South Korea men's national team being No. 23 in FIFA's world ranking, the country's domestic league plays a big role in that. There aren't many household names on Ulsan, but that could very much change in this year's revamped Club World Cup. 

Ulsan HD promise to be formidable and could surprise soccer fans. They could hold their own in a group that features Dortmund, Flamengo and Mamelodi Sundowns.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. cities, from the opener on June 14 until the final on July 13. In the U.S., fans can stream or watch matches on DAZN or TNT. Leading up to kickoff, GOAL will provide scouting reports on each of the 32 participating teams in the expanded field.

Next up is Ulsan HD, with a look at key players to watch, and expectations for the Korea Republic side at the tournament.

Renee Slegers' side overturned a 2-1 deficit from the first leg of their semi-final, stunning the French giants to set up a huge Barcelona clash

Arsenal will play in their first Women's Champions League final since 2007 after shocking eight-time winners Lyon in France, winning 4-1 in their semi-final second leg to overturn a 2-1 deficit from the Emirates Stadium. The hosts had won all of their last 11 ties at this stage of the competition, a run which stretched back 16 years, but they were dominated and picked apart by the Gunners as that streak came to an emphatic end, with the English side set to face reigning champions Barcelona in Lisbon at the end of May for a chance to win this competition for the second time.

It took just five minutes for Arsenal to break the deadlock, as a surprise mistake from goalkeeper Christiane Endler led to Chloe Kelly's corner ricocheting around the box and eventually bouncing in off the Lyon shot-stopper herself. It set the tone for a sloppy and error-strewn display from the team that has won this competition more often than any other, with awful defending capitalised on by Alessia Russo for the Gunners' third and Caitlin Foord pouncing on a slip from Vanessa Gilles to bag the fourth.

But there was also a lot of quality on show from Arsenal, the stand-out moment undoubtedly Mariona Caldentey's sweet strike on the stroke of half-time which doubled their lead. The visitors controlled the midfield, were sharp in their spells of possession and extremely clinical in front of goal as they took down a giant of the European game.

Their reward is a shot at another, with Barcelona to be their opponents in next month's final in Lisbon after their 8-2 aggregate win over Chelsea. It'll be an incredible challenge, but Sunday was too - and Renee Slegers' side overcame that one remarkably.

GOAL rates Arsenal's players from Parc Olympique Lyonnais...

The Denmark international scored just his fourth goal of the Premier League season to earn a last-gasp draw for Ruben Amorim's side

Rasmus Hojlund scored in stoppage time to earn Manchester United a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth on Sunday after a performance that will not have left Europa League semi-final opponents Athletic Club with much to worry about ahead of Thursday's first leg in Bilbao.

After an even first quarter of the game, Bournemouth took the lead when Patrick Dorgu lost the ball deep inside his own half and the Cherries worked the ball into Antoine Semenyo's path to power a shot past Andre Onana. United did come close to going in level, however, as Kepa Arrizabalaga showed strong reactions to tip Alejandro Garnacho's attempted lop wide of the post.

The Red Devils had to endure a spell of pressure early in the second period, during which Dango Ouattara hit the post from a free-kick, but they were given a lifeline with around 20 minutes to go after a VAR review led to Bournemouth striker Evanilson being sent off for a foul on Noussair Mazraoui.

Unsurprisingly, United began to dominate proceedings against 10 men, and Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Chido Obi all wasted opportunities in front of goal before Hojlund found himself in the right place on the edge of the six-yard box to convert from close range.

Goals from Aitana Bonmati, Ewa Pajor, Claudia Pina and Salma Paralluelo sealed the Catalans' place in May's final as they bid to defend their title

Barcelona will head to Lisbon next month hoping to successfully defend their European title for a second season in a row after humbling Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Leading 4-1 from the first leg in Catalunya, the holders wasted no time at all in putting this Champions League semi-final tie well and truly to bed, racing into a 3-0 lead before half-time in an eventual 4-1 win at a ground where they've now won on each of their three visits.

There were chances for Chelsea to get back into this affair before Barca killed it, too. Sandy Baltimore just couldn't connect properly with Mayra Ramirez's cutback and Sjoeke Nusken was denied by Cata Coll when she raced through one-on-one in a hectic sequence at the midway point of the first half, one which came only two minutes before Aitana Bonmati all-but-secured Barcelona's passage to the final. The two-time Ballon d'Or winner was granted far too much space throughout the encounter and she made the Blues pay when her thumping finish broke the deadlock.

Ewa Pajor's close-range finish, after sublime wide play by Caroline Graham Hansen, doubled that lead just before half-time, and then Claudia Pina added a sensational third with a curling strike from range. It was more than enough to win a tie that was well out of Chelsea's reach before it even reached their own patch, in truth, giving Barcelona a shot at a Champions League three-peat next month while leaving the Blues with plenty of food for thought going into next season.

There was at least a late consolation for the home fans to cheer, delivered to them by Wieke Kaptein, but only after Salma Paralluelo was able to profit from a defensive mishap between Niamh Charles and Hannah Hampton that summed up a hugely disappointing tie from the Blues' perspective.

The England midfielder is ready to make the big move to the Etihad after propelling Forest's incredible rise this season

Many pundits and fans have argued that this has been an unmemorable Premier League season. They can point to the fact that Liverpool effectively wrapped up the title in February and that there has barely been any drama in the battle to avoid relegation, with the three promoted teams Southampton, Leicester City and Ipswich heading straight back down. The fact that the race for Champions League qualification is the only thing of intrigue says it all, according to the naysayers.

But one team have provided an antidote to the boredom: Nottingham Forest. Having flirted with relegation in their first two seasons back in the Premier League after a 23-year absence, the Tricky Trees' campaign has been nothing short of remarkable. Back in August bookmaker BetFred predicted they would finish 18th in the table, offering odds of 11/4 of them being relegated. The idea they could challenge for the top-six was laughable, priced at 50/1. Top-four was even more outlandish, priced at 100/1.

But Nuno Espirito's side have defied the bookies and doubters all season and, in January at least, repeating Leicester City's incredible title win of 2016 was genuinely possible. In the end their title hopes proved fanciful but they are still on track to finish fourth and qualify for the Champions League for the first time since they won the competition - then known as the European Cup - in successive seasons in 1979 and 1980.

And on Sunday they are looking forward to their first FA Cup semi-final in 34 years, when they take on Manchester City. Forest's stunning success has been a collective triumph, with the likes of Nikola Milenkovic, Anthony Elanga and Chris Wood coming to the fore and having their best ever seasons. But one man has attracted more attention than anyone else ahead of Sunday's Wembley showdown: Morgan Gibbs-White, who is being tipped to sign for City in the summer as the heir to Kevin De Bruyne...

Sky News found Vivid Seats - which was reported to sell tickets overseas for Chelsea matches at inflated prices - has listings for matches throughout the World Cup despite not yet being officially on sale.

Tickets for the 2026 World Cup are being sold on a third-party ticket exchange - with up to £46,000 for the final - despite FIFA not putting any on the market yet, Sky News has uncovered.

World football's governing body has now issued a warning to fans to be "wary" of unofficial websites purporting to already offer tickets after being asked about one platform, Vivid Seats.

We delved deeper into the website after concerns were raised by Chelsea fans about their chairman, Todd Boehly, being an investor and director in Vivid while it also sells tickets overseas for Stamford Bridge matches at inflated prices.

Vivid has listings for matches throughout the World Cup for matches being played in the United States and Canada.

Even a group stage match on the second day of the tournament has regular tickets - some listed in specific rows - being sold for up to £44,112 at the SoFI stadium in Los Angeles.

The tickets listed for the World Cup final on 19 July 2026 range from £4,936 to £46,412 (row 31, lower level 139) at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Sky News did not buy any tickets.

                  Top FIFA official says it's harder than ever to be a football referee due to abuse
                

Vivid's website promises: "No matter what you're looking to spend, Vivid Seats has World Cup tickets to fit your budget."

But then it says: "Vivid Seats will have World Cup tickets for sale as soon as they are available, usually many months before the actual game."

In response to our discovery, FIFA cautioned supporters.

"FIFA encourages any fan wishing to purchase tickets for the FIFA World Cup 26 to be wary of non-FIFA official ticketing websites that claim to be selling tickets already and only purchase tickets from the official and legitimate source once those are made available," the World Cup organisers told Sky News.

FIFA is planning to put World Cup tickets on sale this summer.

Ronan Evain, executive director of Football Supporters Europe, said the ticket listings were "worrying".

He told Sky News: "It's unlikely that these tickets have been issued and the relation with the competition organisers is unclear.

"Companies like this either exploit the many loopholes that persist in the ticket sales policy or they get privileged access to tickets through competition organisers or associated parties.

"It's the responsibility of the competition organiser to ensure that they put in place a transparent ticket distribution policy and sufficient protections, such as drastic limitations on the number of times a ticket can be transferred to someone else, for example.

"Either they get a safe shortcut to get access to tickets at a later stage. Or they are so confident in exploiting the many loopholes that they take limited risk in selling tickets that don't exist yet."

Vivid Seats did not respond to a request for comment. But when asked about the Chelsea ticketing controversy last week, the American company said: "It is important to note that Vivid Seats does not set the base price for tickets sold on its marketplace or receive any revenue from that base price; only the seller sets and receives the base ticket price."

That comment was issued in response to complaints by Chelsea to the Premier League about Mr Boehly being linked to a website selling tickets beyond Britain for matches.

The Chelsea Supporters' Trust said Vivid and Mr Boehly were undermining efforts to combat ticket touting.

Since our report was published on Monday, Chelsea has revealed plans to introduce digital-only tickets from next season in conjunction with Ticketmaster.

The hope is that eventually makes it harder for people to buy up memberships and sell tickets for hiked-up prices.

In a statement, Chelsea chief revenue officer Casper Stylsvig said the link-up is in part about "continuing to address the issue of ticket touts."

Chelsea has not commented on concerns about Vivid Seats.

In response to our questions about Chelsea tickets, Vivid said: "Vivid Seats respectfully adheres to the laws that are in place in the United Kingdom and is not in violation of any regulations around EPL tickets."

Jules Kounde went from villain to hero in a crazy Copa del Rey final as Barcelona stole away the crown in extra-time, beating Real Madrid 3-2.

Barcelona suffocated Real Madrid from the outset as they outworked and outplayed the men in white in the opening exchanges. The forward line harried the Madrid defence relentlessly which crumbled and submitted to the persistent pressure. Barcelona held the majority of possession and it was only a matter of time, just under half an hour, before they took the lead.

Pedri fed Lamine Yamal, who stood Fran Garcia up before laying back to the midfielder in acres of space to stroke home into the top-left corner from outside the area. Madrid never looked like threatening the Barcelona defence which looked completely assured throughout the first half.

Mbappe was introduced at half-time and Los Blancos threatened immediately. Vinicius robbed Pedri and flashed one past the post, before Mbappe's runs through the middle started to cause problems. The Frenchman, fouled by Frenkie de Jong, swept the resulting free-kick off the left post and in to equalise. The Madrid attacks continued to flow and when Aurelien Tchouameni headed in Madrid's second from a corner, they looked set to become champions. 

But Yamal had other ideas, sending Ferran Torres through, who rounded Courtois and passed into the gaping net. With the score at 2-2 and seeming destined to be heading to extra-time, Raphinha jinked past a lunging Asencio and collapsed to the floor - winning a penalty. However, after a VAR review, the decision was overturned and the game went to extra-time.

If fans were expecting the fireworks of the second-half to continue then they would be disappointed. But with both sets of players looking exhausted and the affair starting to peter out, Kounde stole ahead of Brahim Diaz to intercept and fire low and into the bottom corner. Just when Barcelona thought they had won it, Gavi fouled Mbappe in the box but was saved by an offside in the build-up. The seconds eventually trickled away and Barcelona were the Copa del Rey champions.

Daniil Medvedev wasted little time adjusting to match conditions on Sunday at the Mutua Madrid Open, where he delivered a high-quality first performance of the week.

The 29-year-old was firing in all departments during his 6-2, 6-2 victory over Argentine qualifier Juan Manuel Cerundolo. After receiving a walkover in his second-round match against Laslo Djere, Medvedev picked up pace in his quest to earn a first title since winning the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome in 2023.

“I felt good in practice here, but it's not the same in a match,” said Medvedev after his 62-minute win. “Practice courts are usually a tiny bit different to the centre court. For sure [I was] a bit nervous because we have a small superstition as tennis players that, the worse you play before the tournament, the better you play in it, and the better you play before, the worse you play in the matches…

“But I overcame this superstition four years ago, so I was looking forward to implementing the game I had in practice. I'm happy with my level."

Medvedev, the No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is now into the round of 16 in Madrid for a fourth consecutive year (did not play in 2022). He will next face American Brandon Nakashima, who earlier moved past Bucharest champion Flavio Cobolli 7-5, 6-3.

World No. 126 Cerundolo had notched four wins en route to the third round, and it was the ninth-seeded Medvedev who was fresh and focused throughout their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash. Competing in his first match since the fourth round in Monte-Carlo earlier this month, Medvedev saved the only break point he faced and converted four of the five he created, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Medvedev is this week aiming to complete the set of semi-finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 events, having triumphed at this level on six occasions.

Taylor Fritz advanced to the fourth round after Benjamin Bonzi was forced to retire in the wake of dropping the second set. With his 4-6, 7-5, ret. victory, Fritz notched his 300th tour-level win, becoming the first active American man — 39th in Open Era — to achieve that feat.

Bonzi took an off-court medical timeout at 5-6 in the second set and returned to save four set points in the ensuing game before Fritz converted his fifth opportunity to level the clash. The Frenchman, who was aiming to reach the fourth round at an ATP Masters 1000 event for the first time, then called the match after one hour, 36 minutes.

Day 6 at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Madrid will feature the end of Round 3, with several big names in action and some very juicy matchups on the agenda. It is sure to be another great day of tennis in the Spanish capital.

Head-to-head: first meeting

Dimitrov suffered a humiliating 6-0 6-0 defeat against De Minaur at Monte Carlo but he bounced back nicely here with a first match win over Jarry and now has, at least on paper, a good draw to keep advancing further. Fearnley has been making some progress but so far he has shown no signs of being able to compete with Top 20 players, let alone on clay.
Prediction: Dimitrov in 2

Head-to-head: Paul 1-0 Khachanov

Paul has been struggling ever since his heartbreaking loss to Zverev in Australia, but he notched a nice win over João Fonseca in his first match here. Khachanov, as always, has been quite inconsistent, capable of great performances but also very disappointing ones. All things considered, it should be a very close match, decided by fine margins.
Prediction: Khachanov in 3

Head-to-head: De Minaur 4-0 Shapovalov

This is pretty much a battle of concepts, with Shapovalov's big, powerful, flashy tennis clashing against De Minaur's unwavering consistency. While the Canadian won the Wimbledon Boys' final in 2016, on the pro tour it has been one way traffic on favour of De Minaur so far.

That said, Shapovalov has been having a good season, showing some signs of progress, and on the fast altitude clay of Madrid he might just put together the level required for an upset here.
Prediction: Shapovalov in 3

Head-to-head: Draper 2-0 Berrettini

Draper is in the best moment of his career, having recently won his first Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells and reached his highest ranking so far. Berrettini has been making progress himself as well, though, and these conditions should suit him very well, after all he is a former Madrid finalist.

Like their previous two encounters, both in the last year, this should be a very tight match and it could well go Berrettini's way this time around.
Prediction: Berrettini in 3

Bublik was fresh off dethroning defending champ Andrey Rublev at the Caja Magica.ByDavid KanePublished Apr 27, 2025 copy_link

On his longest winning streak since last February, how will Alexander Bublik prepare for his fourth round at the Mutua Madrid Open?“Video gaming,” quipped the Kazakh, who made a triumphant return to the Tennis Channel Live Desk after dethroning defending champion Andrey Rublev.Though the 27-year-old is no fan of clay courts, Bublik, whose game of choice is Apex Legends has played some of his best tennis at the Caja Magica, reaching the quarterfinals in his 2021 debut and the round of 16 last year.“It's like indoors,” Bublik told Prakash Amritraj on Sunday. “I was lucky enough to be placed on Stadium 3 and Arantxa Court.“Manolo Santana Stadium is like a normal outdoor clay court. I prefer to stay in the ‘indoor' facilities. Fast, indoor, altitude, that's everything I can ask for.”

Playing on Arantxa Sanchez Stadium, he shook off a 6-0 second set to shock Rublev and continue his climb back up the rankings after a disappointing 2024 season.“It's time to get back,” joked Bublik, who has fallen from No. 17 to No. 76 in the last 12 months. “I checked how the Challengers are. They're fine, improving.“I kept my word that I gave here [last year],” he added sardonically. “'Today I'm No. 20, next year maybe No. 70.' You gotta be a man of your word.”He did break one promise to his young son, who expected Bublik to be back home much sooner.“I promised them I'll be back Wednesday, last Wednesday,” said the perpetually self-deprecating Bublik. “I was leaving on Monday and my son was asking when I'd be back, and I told him Wednesday night, maybe early Thursday morning. I wasn't expecting to get a run here!”

For me, the most important thing is to enjoy, because if I don't enjoy, I think about quitting. As long as I'm smiling, you can be convinced that I'll still be coming here. Alexander Bublik

His coach Artem Suprunov is on an impressive run of his own, racking up victories on the FIFA video game series.“My coach is superior in FIFA, so any day Taylor [Fritz] wants to play, it's impossible,” Bublik said, shouting out FIFA fan Taylor Fritz. “My coach averages 14 wins on a weekend league out of 15. Yesterday he did 13 wins out of 15, which is a good number because he plays on a big TV with an unstable connection. He's another league. He's a pro league, my coach.”How does Suprunov find time to game in between coaching Bublik back up the rankings?“Coaching me is like an hour of day's work,” Bublik insists. “It's paradise. You work an hour, listen to some jokes.”His advice for Bublik's next match against No. 22 seed Jakub Mensik (who is fresh off winning his maiden Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open), was simple enough.“Be yourself and don't bother,” quoted Bublik.“For me, the most important thing is to enjoy, because if I don't enjoy, I think about quitting. As long as I'm smiling, you can be convinced that I'll still be coming here.”Smiling, and perhaps a steady internet connection.

Former doubles world No 1 Nicolas Mahut assessed that Novak Djokovic has been struggling emotionally and mentally on court after the Serb's second round Madrid Open defeat.

Djokovic‘s losing streak stretched to three matches as he fell 3-6, 4-6 to Matteo Arnaldi in his opening match at La Caja Magica.

The tennis great hit 32 unforced errors and was well below his best in what was his first meeting with Arnaldi, a talented 24-year-old Italian ranked 44th in the world.

The 37-year-old has lost his first match at four of the seven tournaments he has played in an inconsistent 2025 campaign to date.

His other opening match losses came in Doha, Indian Wells and Monte Carlo to Matteo Berrettini, Botic van de Zandschulp and Alejandro Tabilo respectively.

However, the world No 5 showcased flashes of brilliance at both the Australian Open and the Miami Open.

Djokovic earned a stunning win over Carlos Alcaraz in the Australian Open quarter-finals before a hamstring injury forced him to retire in his semi-final clash with Alexander Zverev.

At the Masters event in Miami, Djokovic claimed five impressive straight-set wins en route to the final, where he was beaten by an inspired Jakub Mensik.

Novak Djokovic's latest comments suggest his retirement may come sooner than even he expected

Mahut, who lost both of the matches he played against Djokovic, backed the 37-year-old to improve in Rome and at the French Open, but also highlighted a concern.

“I think it's also emotionally and mentally that Nole hasn't been able to raise the bar, as he most certainly will at Roland Garros,” the Frenchman was quoted as saying by L'Equipe.

“He'll certainly be even better in Rome, already, in two weeks.

“The problem is that if he's not in the top four seeds in Paris, he risks being very exposed from the quarter-finals, and I don't know if he would then have the resources necessary to string together these last three matches.”

Djokovic sits fifth in the Live ATP Rankings on 4,130 points after adding the 10 points he collected for his early exit in Madrid.

This leaves the 24-time major winner 635 points adrift of world No 4 Taylor Fritz — who is still in action in Madrid.

The Serbian's chances of being seeded fourth at the French Open now appear slim, barring a big result at the Italian Open and a slip up from Fritz.

Eight more men will confirm their spots in the last 16 of the ATP Madrid Open. One of Stefanos Tsitsipas and Lorenzo Musetti, who are considered among the best on clay, will miss out. So, who will advance?

 

Head-to-head: Tiafoe 1-0 Muller

Tiafoe had a rocky start to the season. But everything seemed to fall into place in Houston, where he reached his third successive final (lost to an inspired Jenson Brooksby). He is only a modest 2-2 after that and is coming off a retirement win over Luciano Darderi. Muller, for his part, continues to overachieve in a season that saw him clinch his first ATP title in Hong Kong and a maiden final at the ATP 500 level in Rio. To add to the list of his rapidly improving season is another scalp against countryman Ugo Humbert. This should be an intriguing battle. Tiafoe's flair and athletic ability on any surface are undeniable, but he can quickly become erratic. Muller is a player capable of exploiting the American's lapses in focus.
Prediction: Muller in 3

Head-to-head: first meeting

Arnaldi earned his second career Top 5 win by defeating former champion Novak Djokovic to secure an unlikely berth in the third round. His run is extremely impressive, having defeated an in-form Borna Coric in the opening round. Although not quite of the same magnitude, Dzumhur also pulled off a statement in the second round, toppling clay-court specialist Sebastian Baez in three sets. This might have been a 50-50 match a few weeks back, but Arnaldi's recent resurgence is sure to give him a significant edge.
Prediction: Arnaldi in 2

Head-to-head: first meeting

For much of 2025, results have wavered for Norrie. He tallied just seven main draw wins before Madrid. A pair of comeback wins this week have rekindled his belief, and he's still hanging around in the draw. He'll be the favorite against Diallo. The Canadian is making the most of his lucky loser entry with a couple of solid main draw wins against Zizou Bergs and Kamil Majchrzak. Form is only temporary, and Norrie's experience on this surface will be a valuable asset for him to navigate a potentially tricky opponent.
Prediction: Norrie in 3

Head-to-head: Tsitsipas 5-1 Musetti

Tsitsipas lost his perfect record against Musetti at the Monte Carlo Masters. Although his dominance in this matchup cannot be understated, the Italian ran him close in each of the previous four meetings on clay. And for the first time, Musetti will be the higher-ranked player in this encounter after closing in on the Top 10 in recent weeks. Tsitsipas is always expected to rise to the occasion at this stage of the season. However, an inconsistent start to the European clay swing and a back injury he sustained in Barcelona could halt his progress in Madrid.
Prediction: Musetti in 3

Novak Djokovic has continued his relatively poor form after losing his opening match at the Madrid Open to Matteo Arnaldi.

Djokovic lost his only match in Monte Carlo as well, with the Serbian being beaten in his opening match at four of his last five tournaments.

The latest of those came against Arnaldi, but Djokovic claimed Madrid was different to Monte Carlo and some other recent tournaments.

There is now becoming increased concern for Djokovic, who has cast doubt over his future and left question marks over whether he will ever play at the Madrid Open again.

Grand Slam titles are Djokovic's priority, which is something that the 37-year-old has been very clear about over recent years.

The upcoming major is Roland Garros, where Djokovic is a three-time champion, and he spoke in his post-match press conference about where he sees himself in the pecking order.

While admitting he still feels the same every time he steps out on court, Djokovic claimed that he is not one of the main favorites to win Roland Garros this year.

“Well, I mean, look, pressure is part of the sport and part of what we do on this highest level, so it's never going to go away, you know, it's just different kind of pressure,” explained Djokovic. But every time I step on the court I feel the nerves, I feel stress, I feel everything that I guess all the other players feel, and excitement as well. 

“So, still like to compete, it became a bit more challenging for me, to be honest. But of course, as I said, I'll do my best for the future. Grand Slam, I'm not going into Roland Garros as one of the main favorites. Maybe that can help, I don't know, we'll see.”

Last year, Djokovic withdrew from his Roland Garros quarter-final due to a meniscus tear in his right knee that he later underwent surgery on.

There is not long until the second major tournament of 2025, where Djokovic will be bidding for a 25th Grand Slam title.

Before then Djokovic is expected to head to Rome, where he is a six-time former champion, with only the now retired Rafael Nadal winning more titles in the Italian capital.

Despite his previous achievements in Rome, Djokovic was stunned at the Italian Open last year, losing in the third round to Alejandro Tabilo, who recently beat him again at the Monte Carlo Masters. 

After Djokovic suffered a disappointing result at the Italian Open last year, he made a last-minute decision to play the ATP tournament in Geneva in an attempt to get some more clay court match practise in.

That appeared to somewhat pay off, as he reached the semi-finals in Geneva, before progressing to the quarter-finals of Roland Garros until injury got in the way.

Djokovic and coach Andy Murray will now head to the Italian Open, with main draw action beginning on Wednesday May 7.

Staying hydrated is always important, Muguruza tells me as she pauses to drink with a nod to her own water bottle. But when you're being hurled across continents at 600 mph, the type of water can be just as important as how much.“Even though they give you water, I don't know, the plane's water always tastes different,” she says.“I bring my own bottles, just buy them in the airport before boarding. I make sure I have one or two bottles in my bag, and that I drink them.“😴 “I need an eye mask to sleep during a long flight.”Getting any sleep on an airplane is always a challenge, especially when you're not flying in business class or on a private jet like some pros. But with a few everyday essentials, including the humble eye mask, you can help your cause.“Imagine we're going to Asia and I need to sleep a little bit. This really helps you to fight jet lag,” Muguruza explains. “The eye mask makes you feel like you're in your own little bubble, no one sees you, you can fall asleep relaxed.”👉 Read more: Game, Set, Recharge: Globe-trotting tennis pros fight jet lag by staying one step ahead

Wearing noise cancelling headphones or earplugs is another tried and true tip, while other ways to sleep better on a plane include making sure your travel outfit is comfortable and includes breathable layers and skipping the caffeinated beverages during in-flight service.Another essential for Muguruza is a hoodie or light jacket to help her stay incognito.“I don't like when people see me sleeping!

Novak Djokovic has suffered another shock defeat, having lost his opening match at the Madrid Open.

Djokovic may have played his last Madrid Open match, in which he was beaten 6-3, 6-4 by Matteo Arnaldi.

Handed a bye in round one of the 2025 Madrid Open, Djokovic fell in the second round of the ATP Masters 1000 event.

The defeat comes immediately after the 24-time Grand Slam champion lost his opening match at the Monte Carlo Masters.

Speaking after his latest result, Djokovic said: “I was hoping I can play one more match than I played in Monte-Carlo. [It's] kind of a new reality for me, I have to say.”

And the loss, coupled with the admission, has led to many tennis fans claiming that the veteran should call time on his glittering career.

“Age and lack of motivation,” one fan wrote on X. “He should retire at the top, as he has nothing else to prove.”

A second commented: “The end is closer than we think enjoy watching him,” with a third saying: “Father Time calling.”

A fourth wrote: “As a long time Nole fan, supporter and believer I have to be honest. This is becoming painful to watch.”

Or, may be, the time to retire has just come.Sadly, age doesn't work in favor of athletes in sports like tennis.I wish him to win his latest title, to accomplish his goal.But will be really hard with all the young blood rising.

Another tennis fan agreed: “Time to think about a dignified retirement,” with another noting: “The end is near.”

Another concurred: “Go out when you're on top….,  gotta know when to hold and know when to fold… and sadly, you passed the point of folding.”

It remains to be seen when Djokovic will call time on his stunning career, which would bring an end to the Big Three once and for all.

The Serbian is the last man standing of the iconic trio, with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal having retired in 2022 and 2024 respectively.

It is certainly a worrying period for the 37-year-old, who fell in his Monte Carlo Masters opener to Alejandro Tabilo earlier this month.

The back-to-back defeats mean he has now lost consecutive opening matches at ATP Masters 1000 events for the second time in his career, as per OptaAce.

That had only ever previously happened to the Serbian superstar in 2018 at Indian Wells and the Miami Open, with his wait for an elusive 100th ATP title now going on.

One certainty, however, is that Djokovic will gain a phenomenal amount of plaudits and recognition when he does finally retire from tennis, and rightfully so.

Arnaldi beat fourth seed Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 to reach the third round. The result condemned the 37-year-old, who received a bye in the opening round, to his third consecutive defeat.

Djokovic, who has been chasing a 100th tour-level title, was handed a shock defeat in the Miami Open final in late March before his second-round Monte Carlo exit earlier this month.

All three defeats came in straight sets.

"Obviously, after you lose a match, you don't feel good, but I've had a few of these this year where I lose in the first round, unfortunately," Djokovic told a press conference.

"I think the positive thing is that I really enjoyed myself more than I have in the Monte-Carlo or some other tournament, so that's a good thing.

"But obviously, still level of tennis is not where I would like it to be. But it is what it is. I lost to a better player."

Djokovic, who made his Madrid debut in 2006 and won the tournament in 2011, 2016 and 2019, was looking for his first win on clay since defeating Carlos Alcaraz to win gold at the Paris Olympics.

Asked whether he just played his last match in Madrid, Djokovic said: "It could be. It could be. I'm not sure if I will come back. So, I don't know, I don't know what to say.

"I mean, I'll come back, maybe not as a player. I hope it's not, but it could be."

Djokovic won three out of the four major titles in 2023 but has not been able to reproduce that kind of form since, being shut out of the game's biggest tournaments last year as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz claimed majors apiece.

"(It's) kind of a new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament," Djokovic added.

"It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kinds of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments.

"But that's, I guess, the circle of life and the career, eventually it was going to happen."

The former world number one owns ATP Masters 1000 records for most wins (414), semi-finals (79), finals (60) and titles (40).

Novak Djokovic has made it no secret that his main focus is on the Grand Slam tournaments as he enters the latter years of his career. After a “horrible” opening-round exit in Monte-Carlo, he admitted his sole focus for the clay season was the French Open. He doubled down on his comments after arriving in Madrid for the Masters 1000 event.

However, Djokovic has already been handed a brutal reality check with the French Open still a few weeks away. The world No. 5 has 24 Major titles to his name, but it's been more than 18 months since his last victory. And fans believe the drought will continue at Roland Garros.

Djokovic has remained clear about his goals on the clay. “Roland Garros. That's it,” he said with a smile after losing his opening match at the Monte-Carlo Masters earlier this month.

The 37-year-old kept his eyes on the prize at the Madrid Open. Ahead of the tournament, he told Sky Sports he wanted to “peak at the French Open.”

But Express Sport readers aren't convinced, as a staggering 82 per cent claimed Djokovic would not achieve his goal of winning the French Open this year.

While Djokovic has made it clear that the French Open is his goal, he also agrees that he won't be one of the title favourites this year, though he hopes it can work in his favour.

After losing his opening match in Madrid on Saturday, he said: “I'm not going into Roland Garros as one of the main favourites. Maybe that can help, I don't know, we'll see.”

The world No. 5 has three Roland Garros trophies under his belt, coming out on top in 2016, 2021 and 2023. His title defence ended abruptly last year when he picked up a knee injury and pulled out ahead of the quarter-final to undergo surgery.

Djokovic is also hunting two huge milestones - his 25th Major and his 100th career title - and could kill two birds with one stone in Paris.

“If you tell me I'll win a 100th title in any of the Slams this year, I'll sign right away, no problem,” he said earlier this month. “But it's a big mountain to climb, so I've got to be a bit more humble about it and hope for the best.”

There's also the question of Djokovic's age. He will turn 38 next month, before the French Open begins, and it will be a big ask for his body to hold up over seven best-of-five-set matches.

He already had trouble at the Australian Open earlier this year, injuring his thigh during his quarter-final victory against Carlos Alcaraz. After winning in four sets, he admitted he considered retiring during the match.

Djokovic did everything possible to be ready for the semis against Alexander Zverev but had to retire after losing the first set in a tiebreak. He subsequently pulled out of Serbia's Davis Cup tie.

But the Serb will be full of confidence when he returns to Stade Roland Garros next month, as he is on a six-match winning streak at the venue.

After a sad end to the French Open, Djokovic returned to the Parisian clay for the 2024 Olympic Games and won a gold medal for the first time in his career, and he will hope to pick up where he left off.

Carlos Alcaraz is just a few days shy of his 22nd birthday but already has a career many players would envy. The Spaniard has lifted four Grand Slam titles and is a former world No. 1, becoming the only teenager ever to reach the top of the ATP rankings. But he still lives in his humble family home in Murcia, Spain.

While other players may showcase their silverware in museums or facilities, Alcaraz prefers to keep his Major trophies under his nose in their two-storey flat. The world No. 3 has given an insight into his life in a new Netflix docuseries, revealing that his cups are proudly displayed across his bedroom and living room.

Alcaraz was just 19 when he won his first Grand Slam title at the US Open, also becoming the world No. 1 as a result. And he still sleeps underneath the handcrafted Tiffany & Co. trophy, which sits atop a shelf in his small bedroom.

“This is where I sleep, this is my bedroom,” Alcaraz says in his new Netflix series, walking into a modest room with a bed, shelves full of trainers, a stack of tennis accreditations, and an assortment of trophies.

“After each tournament, this is my place. This is my calm place. Here I have my hobby, something I love, which is sneakers, as you can see. I need more space! It's pretty small, but I manage.

“And for people that ask, ‘Where do you keep your trophies?' Well, here. I have some important trophies here. This one is from the 2022 US Open. The rest are in the living room.”

Alcaraz won his second Major title at Wimbledon in 2023, beating seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in a thrilling five-set final. And the gold cup has pride of place in the family room.

“Wimbledon, of course. This one is awesome,” he smiled, showing off his hardware before reading out the list of champions who came before him.

Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray had a 20-year stronghold on the title before Alcaraz ended their reign in 2023.

He added: “And suddenly here I am, you know? It's like, what the hell is going on.”

The world No. 3 has since added to his haul at home. He became the youngest man to complete the ‘Channel Slam' in 2024, winning the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back.

Alcaraz came from two sets to one down to beat Alexander Zverev in the Roland Garros final. A few weeks later, he faced Djokovic in a Wimbledon final rematch. It was a much easier path to the title for Alcaraz, who defeated the Serb in straight sets.

The 21-year-old has already successfully defended his Wimbledon crown, and he will attempt to do the same at the French Open next month when he rocks up as the reigning champion.

But Alcaraz's preparations have taken a hit as he was forced to withdraw from this week's Madrid Open with adductor and hamstring issues.

The Spaniard had a strong start to the clay season, winning the Monte-Carlo Masters and finishing runner-up in Barcelona, but he injured himself in the final against Holger Rune.

Plus: Doechii scores her first top 10 album as Alligator Bites Never Heal snaps 24-10 after a wider physical release.

SZA's SOS scores a 13th nonconsecutive week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart (dated May 3), as the set rises 3-1 with 52,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States in the week ending April 24 (down 1%), according to Luminate. The album continues to profit from its expansive deluxe reissue on Dec. 20, 2024 (dubbed SOS Deluxe: LANA), with 15 additional tracks, in addition to a Feb. 9 reissue with four more bonus cuts.

SOS was originally released on Dec. 9, 2022, as a 23-track album and spent 10 weeks at No. 1 in late 2022 and early 2023. It then returned to No. 1 for two more weeks, following the LANA expansion — on the Jan. 4 and 11, 2025-dated charts, and now on the latest tally. All versions of the album, old and new, are combined for tracking and charting under the title SOS.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	With SOS earning 52,000 units in the latest tracking week, that marks the smallest weekly sum for a No. 1 album in over three years, since the April 23, 2022-dated chart, when Lil Durk's 7220 returned to No. 1, for a second week at the top, with just a little more than 47,000 units.


	For the first time in a little over two months, no albums debut in the top 10 on the Billboard 200. We last had a top 10 absent of a debut on the Feb. 22-dated list, when the highest arrival was outside the top 40 (Dream Theater's Parasomnia at No. 41).


	While there are no debuts in the top 10 on the latest chart, there is a title reaching the region for the first time, as Doechii's Alligator Bites Never Heal flies 24-10 following its wider availability on vinyl, as well as its first release on CD.


	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new May 3, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on April 29. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

	











	Of SOS' 52,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending April 24, SEA units comprise 49,500 (down 1%, equaling 68.29 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs; it rises 2-1 on the Top Streaming Albums chart, for a third nonconsecutive week on top of the year-and-a-half old ranking), traditional album sales comprise 2,500 (down 5%) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum (up 2%).


	With a 13th total week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, SOS has the most weeks atop the chart for an R&B/hip-hop album by a woman, or an R&B album by a woman, since Whitney Houston's self-titled set tallied 14 weeks at No. 1 in 1986. (Honorable mention to the Houston-led soundtrack to The Bodyguard, which logged 20 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 in 1992-93. The 12-track album has six songs by Houston and six songs by other artists.)


	The last R&B/hip-hop album with at least 13 weeks atop the Billboard 200 was Drake's Views, which notched 13 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 in 2016 (May 21-Oct. 8). The last R&B album with at least 13 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 was The Bodyguard, with its 20-week reign. (R&B/hip-hop and R&B albums are defined as those that have hit or are eligible for Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Top R&B Albums charts, respectively.)


	SZA launched her co-headlining Grand National Tour on April 19 in Minneapolis at U.S. Bank Stadium with Kendrick Lamar, who sees his chart-topping GNX hold steady at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with nearly 51,000 equivalent album units earned (down 7%).


	The titles at Nos. 3-9 are all former No. 1s. Morgan Wallen's One Thing at a Time climbs 6-3 (48,000 equivalent album units earned, up 4%); Sabrina Carpenter's Short n' Sweet is steady at No. 4 (47,000; down 9%); PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake's $ome $exy $ongs 4 U is a non-mover at No. 5 (46,000; down 11%); Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos falls 6-8 (39,000; down 7%); Playboi Carti's MUSIC is stationary at No. 7 (38,000; down 15%); Lady Gaga's MAYHEM is up 10-8 (37,000; down 6%); and Wallen's Dangerous: The Double Album jumps 14-9 (34,500; up 6%).

	











	Doechii earns her first top 10-charting effort on the Billboard 200 albums chart as the 2025 Billboard Woman of the Year's Grammy Award-winning Alligator Bites Never Heal flies 24-10 following a wider availability on vinyl and its first release on CD. The set earned 33,000 equivalent album units in the tracking week (up 43%). Of that figure, SEA units comprise 18,500 (down 3%, equaling 25.9 million on-demand official streams of the songs on the streaming edition of the set, it moves 28-27 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 14,000 (up 325% — the best sales week for both the album and the artist; it reenters at No. 1 on Top Album Sales, the set's first week atop the list) and TEA units comprise 500 (down 12%).


Alligator Bites Never Heal was released in 2024 as a 19-song album. It was reissued in March with one bonus track — the gone-viral breakout hit “Anxiety” — on “extended” digital download and streaming editions. All physical versions contain the original 19-song tracklist. Until April 18, the set was only available to purchase as a download and in two vinyl variants. On April 19, it garnered a wider availability on vinyl, including two new vinyl editions (both color variants) exclusively available via Target and Urban Oufitters, along with a widely available CD.


	“Anxiety” reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart dated March 29 (rising 13-10), marking Doechii's first top 10. The album yielded an earlier top 40-charting hit with “Denial Is a River” (hitting No. 21 in February).

			By Glenn Garner, Anthony D'Alessandro 


	Although Robert De Niro was passed over for The Godfather, his starring role in the sequel turned out to be the offer he couldn't refuse.


	While paying tribute to director Francis Ford Coppola with the AFI Life Achievement Award, he and co-star Al Pacino reminisced about their time with the filmmaker on his seminal mafia film franchise.


	“Francis, thank you for not casting me in The Godfather,” said De Niro during Saturday's gala at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. “It was the best job I ever, never got. And it meant I was available for The Godfather Part II. Francis, you changed my career, you changed my life. We're all here tonight because of you. We love you.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Following Pacino's breakout performance as Michael Corleone in 1972's adaptation of Mario Puzo's book, the 1974 sequel followed the parallel paths of father and son with De Niro as a young immigrant Vito Corleone (portrayed in the first film by Marlon Brando).


	Pacino prefaced his tribute with a quote from Coppola himself. “‘The things you do when you're young that you get fired for, are the same things that years later, they give you lifetime achievement awards for,'” he said.

	“You know, none of us were fired from The Godfather, but some of us got pretty close,” added Pacino as the audience laughed at his self-deprecating nod. “I got the closest. And Francis just fought for us all the time. He fought for his film and his vision, which he always does. Yet, it could have gotten him fired. Everything was a firing threat. It could have had all of us fired, but it didn't. Now, years later, here we all are to celebrate him for it. So, thank you Francis. Thank for believing in me even more than I believed in myself. I am eternally grateful in kind to be part of your Godfather family.”


	Filmmaking peers like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Spike Lee and more were also on hand to celebrate Coppola, as well as collaborators like Adam Driver, Elle Fanning and Diane Lane.


	The Life Achievement Award is AFI‘s highest esteem for a career in film. Coppola's predecessors include Nicole Kidman, Julie Andrews, Denzel Washington, George Clooney, Diane Keaton and John Williams.


	Coppola's The Godfather, The Godfather Part II and Apocalypse Now are ranked among history's greatest films in AFI's 100 Years…100 Movies list. A six-time Academy Award winner, his other iconic feature credits, as writer, director and/or producer, include Patton, American Graffiti, The Conversation, The Outsiders and Bram Stoker's Dracula, to name just a few.

	











	The AFI Life Achievement Award Tribute returns this year to TNT, with encore presentations to follow on Turner Classic Movies.

	President Trump bragged that he had made “200 deals” on trade and tariffs in a recent interview, but when pressed for details, two members of his cabinet could not name a single country that has agreed to one of Trump's alleged deals. 


	Two weeks after he announced a 90-day pause on his punishing import tariffs, Trump claimed he has made many deals while refusing to say which countries agreed to those deals. The pause, he said, was to allow time for negotiations with other countries with the exception of China, which was exempted from the pause.


	“I've made 200 deals,” Trump told Time magazine in an interview published Friday, adding, “100 percent.”


	If that were true and every deal is with a different nation, it would mean Trump has already finalized deals with nearly every country in the world.


	When asked to say which countries agreed to these supposed deals, Trump said, “Because the deal is a deal that I choose,” before going on a rant about how the U.S. is “a department store.”

	











	“And on behalf of the American people, I own the store, and I set prices, and I'll say, if you want to shop here, this is what you have to pay,” the president said.


	CNN's Dana Bash confronted Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins during Sunday's State of the Union, asking her to name one of the deals the administration has reached. 


	“The president told Time magazine, quote, ‘I have made 200 deals,” Bash said. “He didn't give us any details about what those could be, what countries he's talking about. Has he actually inked any trade deals, and with whom?”

	“On the deals, we have 100 countries that are knocking on the door,” Rollins said. “I believe — I'm not in the room, I'm not negotiating the trade deals. But my understanding is, we should have several this week that are coming forward that are very, very close. China is a very important one. Every day, we are in conversation with China, along with those other 99, 100 countries that have come to the table.”

	Of course, having some deals that are “very, very close” is not the same thing as having made “200 deals,” as Trump has explicitly claimed.


	Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China has already led to an increase in canceled shipments between Asia and North America after Trump jacked up tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent. China, meanwhile, has implemented retaliatory tariffs in addition to economic restrictions of exports of rare earth mineral to the United States and restrictions on 18 major U.S. manufacturers and defense companies. 

	











	While Trump and his administration have claimed they are in ongoing negotiations with China, Chinese officials have said that those talks have not happened. The Chinese ministry of commerce said that the administration's claims they are in daily contact “are groundless and have no factual basis.”


	“China and the United States have not held consultations or negotiations on the tariff issue, let alone reached an agreement,” the ministry said Thursday.


	When confronted with that statement, Trump insisted a journalist had his “reporting wrong.”

	Another Trump cabinet member, Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent, tried to justify Trump's claim of “200 deals” by saying he actually meant “sub deals.”

	“Let's talk about the Time interview with President Trump,” host Martha Raddatz asked Bessent Sunday on ABC's This Week. “He said he has made 200 deals on tariffs. Two hundred deals? Who has he made deals with? Is there actually any deal at this point?”

	“I believe that he is referring to sub deals within the negotiations we're doing,” Bessent said. 


	“But those aren't actual deals?” Raddatz said.


	“Martha, if there are 180 countries, there are 18 important trading partners — let's put China to the side, because that's a special negotiation — there's 17 important trading partners, and we have a process in place, over the next 90 days, to negotiate with them,” Bessent responded, refusing to name any deals or sub deals. “Some of those are moving along very well, especially with the Asian countries.”

	Bessent then justified Trump's chaotic approach to tariffs — announcing and then almost immediately postponing them — by calling it “strategic uncertainty.”


	But what Bessent calls strategic uncertainty looks much more like unorganized chaos and lying by Trump as the 90-day pause deadline approaches, and the administration can't point to a single trade agreement it has successfully negotiated — even though the president claims he has 200 to choose from.

A decade after attending high school together, HGTV stars Brian and Mika Kleinschmidt reconnected and fell in love. By that time, Brian was divorced and Mika was a single mom to her daughter Jade — but they quickly became a family of three.

On April 24, 2025, the “100 Day Dream Home” stars opened up about their co-parenting journey on WFLA's “Maggie & The Moms” show, with Brian revealing that becoming a “bonus dad” to Jade has been “one of the best things to ever happen to me.” 

Brian has been vocal about his crush on Mika when they attended the same Florida high school. But they didn't find a love connection until years later, when she accidentally included him in an email to other classmates, they told Tampa Bay Parenting in 2024. That led to a date, and then quickly falling in love, Mika told “Maggie & the Moms” host Maggie Rodriguez. 

“I'm very independent, I wasn't looking to jump into a relationship,” Mika said. “(But) there's just a trust and comfort there (with Brian) and I think that really is from planting the seed in high school and just knowing what a great guy he was then.” 

“It was just crazy how things, they felt right,” she continued. “I mean, we kind of moved quickly, because once we went on that first date, within a few months it was like, we're running a business together. It just went really, really fast, right?” 

“Yeah, it was love at first sight when I first met Mika in high school,” Brian gushed, “but it was almost more love at first sight when I met Jade. She was 18-months-old and it's crazy that she just turned 16 years old. So I've been in Jade's life pretty much her entire life and (it's) one of the best things to ever happen to me.” 

“I don't like the word stepdad, so I say ‘bonus dad,'” he continued. “She calls me Brian. I mean, she's my best friend.” 

Tapping Mika on the shoulder, Brian sweetly clarified, “One of my best friends. But Jade is fantastic and I'm so glad that both of you are in my life.” 

On Jade's 16th birthday in February, Brian posted a series of videos with Jade on Instagram and wrote, “These past 16 years have been the SWEETEST of my entire life! 💕 Happy Birthday to my favorite daughter. 🥳 I love to love you Jade. 🤟”

A post shared by Brian Kleinschmidt (@mrbreakinground)

Mika and Brian are both outgoing, extroverted personalities, but told Rodriguez that it's been interesting learning the best ways to co-parent Jade, who is “so different” than they are. 

“Jade's a little more introverted, unlike both of us,” Mika laughed. “We've had to really learn to hone in to that.”

The Kleinschmidts said Jade is a “great kid” who rarely needs disciplining as a teen, but Mika told Rodriguez that in their early years of parenting her together, Brian played more of a “friend” role. 

“I feel like in the beginning I was definitely the disciplinary person and Brian was like, ‘Oh, it's okay,” — you know, more of the friend,” she explained, adding that it was a challenge to feel like he was siding with Jade or downplaying her rules. “But I do think that now, we're probably 50/50 on, like, the discipline and just making sure we have open conversations with her about life and things that are happening in her life.” 

“But I really feel like she's been blessed to have him in her life,” she said. “He brings so much to the table.” 

One of those benefits is Brian's ability to keep Mika calm or take over during stressful situations, the couple revealed, including teaching Jade how to drive. The Kleinschmidts both went for Jade's first time behind the wheel recently, with Mika in the backseat — and it did not go well, they laughed.  

“I think I made her nervous because I'm freaking out,” Mika admitted, noting that she was making noises and flinching in the backseat until Jade announced she couldn't handle having both of them in the car. Mika then got out, and Brian calmly took over. 

“I would not want to parent with anybody else,” Mika later said, “because I really do feel like we have different styles. Brian can stay calm in times where I'm frantic, so it's like he grounds me a little bit.”

“I remember the first day I met Jade, I was so nervous to meet her,” Brian told Rodriguez. “She came down the stairs, Mika was holding her, and she was a little shy.” 

After giving her a stuffed animal he brought, Brian said, “Barriers broke down, we became friends right away, and nothing's been the same (since) in all of our lives, really.” 

New episodes of “100 Day Dream Home” air Tuesday nights at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

	Sen. Cory Booker and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are holding a livestreamed sit-in on the Capitol steps in protest of a forthcoming Republican budget they say will gut Medicaid — a federal and state program that helps to cover medical costs for people with limited income as well as disabled children and adults. 


	The sit-in began at sunrise, shortly after 6 a.m., and Booker and Jeffries promised to stay for “a good number of hours.”


	“We are here on a Sunday morning… to have a conversation grounded in our faith traditions — and not just ours but the nation's as a whole — to talk about what we think is a moment of moral urgency that we are in this moment,” Booker said at the beginning of the event. 


	The sit-in is a protest of a Republican budget bill that will likely seek to cut spending on public health insurance programs to compensate for the cost of President Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy since the GOP plans to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Committees in Congress are expected to start working on the budget this week after a budget resolution was adopted by both houses. The resolution instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion over the next decade. The biggest targets for those cuts are Medicare and Medicaid.

	











	Republicans plan to move the budget forward through budget reconciliation, which will let them pass it without any Democratic support. GOP leadership has said they hope to have Trump sign the bill by Memorial Day. Among their ideas to cut federal spending is a plan to add work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries, something Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has endorsed. 


	“It's common sense,” Johnson said. “Little things like that make a big difference not only in the budgeting process but in the morale of the people. You know, work is good for you. You find dignity in work.”


	One study by the Urban Institute found that adding work requirements could cut some 5 million people from the program. The vast majority of Medicaid recipients — 92 percent — are already either working, going to school, or caretaking for others, an analysis by health policy research firm KFF found.

	Earlier this month, twelve House Republicans signed a letter to their leadership expressing their opposition to Medicaid cuts. They wrote that they “will not support a final reconciliation bill that includes any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.”


	“As we prepare to come back into session tomorrow, this is a time to choose,” Jeffries said. “We're either going to choose the side of the American people, or we're going to choose this cruel budget that Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people.”


	“That bill, we believe, presents one of the greatest moral threats to our country that we've seen in terms of what it will do to providing food for the hungry, care for the elderly, services for the disabled, healthcare for the sick, and more,” Booker said.


	“Martin Luther King said budgets are moral documents, and that's the spirit we come here this morning, hoping to have a larger conversation,” he added.


	Booker and Jeffries invited everyday Americans to sit with them at the Capitol to share their stories. Over the five hours the live stream has been running, they have been joined by lawmakers — including Democratic Sens. Chris Coons and Angela Alsobrooks and Reps. Gil Cisneros and Gabe Amo — as well as Americans, including families who receive and rely on Medicaid benefits and tourists visiting the Capitol.

	Other leaders spoke at the sit-in, including Maya Wiley, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who spoke about the civil rights movement's dedication to ending poverty, and National Education Association President Becky Pringle who spoke about the Trump administration perpetuating “the greatest assault on public education that we've ever seen in this country.” 


	“One of the reasons we wanted to be here on the Capitol steps was to give the American people an opportunity to tell their stories,” Jeffries said. “A budget is not cold numbers on a piece of paper. It represents our values, and it has deep implications for the American people. This particular budget — it will hurt children, it will hurt families, it will hurt veterans. Some of our colleagues who serve in this Capitol talk a lot about family values, but that's rhetoric if at the same time you're talking about family values, you're undermining American families. We're not going to stand for it.”

	“We're here to get into some good trouble on behalf of the American people,” Jeffries said later in the broadcast.

	











	“Necessary trouble,” Booker added.

	The American Music Honors, an annual event organized by the Bruce Springsteen Archives & Center, took place Saturday at Monmouth University in West Long Branch, New Jersey, this year honoring Smokey Robinson, John Fogerty, Emmylou Harris, Tom Morello, and Joe Ely.


	Every honoree with the exception of Joe Ely was on site to receive the award, as well as perform their classic songs with help from Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul, Bruce Springsteen, and surprise guests Jackson Browne, Nils Lofgren, Nora Guthrie, and Darlene Love. In other words, an all-star event on par with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony was staged in front a mere 714 people on a college campus, and there's no plans to air it on television. Fortunately, phones were allowed, and there's lots of fan footage. (Let's give a special shoutout to Dr. Marty Jablow for his great camera work.)


	Former NBC News anchor Brian Williams was the host for the evening, and Springsteen personally delivered the induction speeches for Ely and Fogerty. In a revival of some of the best moments from the 2004 Vote For Change tour, Springsteen performed the Creedence classics “Bad Moon Rising,” “Proud Mary,” and “Fortunate Son” with Fogerty.

	Springsteen also covered Joe Ely's 1995 song “All Just to Get to You,” and teamed up with Smokey Robinson for “Going to a Go-Go,” Jackson Browne for “Take It Easy,” and Tom Morello for “The Ghost of Tom Joad” and “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.”

	At the end of the night, everyone from the show came back onstage along with Darlene Love and Nora Guthrie for “This Land Is Your Land.” The Woody Guthrie classic was a regular part of Springsteen's live show in the Eighties, but it's become a rarity these days. He last performed it in 2013.


	Next month, Springsteen and the E Street Band head over to Europe for a run of 16 stadium shows. And on June 27, Tracks II: The Lost Albums – a collection of seven complete records Springsteen recorded between 1983 and 2018 – is finally coming out after years of feverish anticipation. The Springsteen biopic Deliver Me From Nowhere, staring Jeremy Allen White, is also due out before the end of the year. It focuses on the creation of 1982's Nebraska, and also stars Jeremy Strong, Paul Walter Hauser, Gaby Hoffmann, Marc Maron, and Stephen Graham.

	Certain artists are notorious for criss-crossing the world in their private jet, but according to new research, fans' collective carbon footprint traveling to concerts exceeds that of the performers. Billie Eilish is one musician who is trying to help change the way her fans get to her shows. 


	Before stops on her Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour, she sends an email to concertgoers about how to get to her shows by public transit, biking, or walking. For her Phoenix and Los Angeles performances, her team organized shuttle buses from designated spots, which allowed fans to reduce their carbon footprint by traveling together. She even worked with Google Maps to help fans know about more fuel-efficient ways to get to her shows. 


	Eilish is a supporting partner in a recent study from the nonprofit REVERB that found the vast majority of fans — 94 percent — think it is important for fans, venues, promoters, and artists to take “significant action” to lower their carbon footprints. 

	











	“Artists, venues, and fans all need to work together to improve our environment,” Eilish tells Rolling Stone in a statement. “From solar-powered live shows to more sustainable touring, my team is always looking for ways to help the planet. I have the greatest fans in the world, and I hope this study will be a helpful resource for those looking to learn more about transportation options that cut down on pollution and build a better future for live music.”


	“What we're hoping to do is use [the study] as a tool for action,” Adam Gardner, frontman of the band Guster and the co-founder and co-executive director of REVERB, tells Rolling Stone. 


	“We've always been an action-oriented organization. We don't feel like knowing is enough. You need to do something with that knowledge and change what you can to solve the issues that this study clearly shows,” he adds.


	REVERB, founded in 2004, has worked with Dave Matthews Band, Dead & Company, Tyler Childers, My Morning Jacket, Odesza, the Lumineers, Paramore, Fleetwood Mac, and other artists to make their concerts more sustainable. They focus on engaging fans to take action and waste reduction. For example, they donate excess food to local food banks and try to compost or recycle where it's possible. They also create water stations and have eliminated more than 4 million single-use plastic water bottles.

	In 2023, Eilish worked with REVERB's Music Decarbonization Project to make her Lollapalooza set partially solar powered.


	“The music industry relative to other industries isn't a super polluter, but … because it's so high-profile and because it touches so many other industries, like transportation, like hotels, like food systems, it has an incredible opportunity to be a catalyst for change,” Gardner says.


	The REVERB study surveyed 35,000 fans at more than 400 concerts. It found that carbon emissions of fan travel to an average show equals 110 homes' energy usage for a year, or 527 metric tons of carbon emissions. Fan travel exceeds band and crew travel, hotel stays, and gear transport by 38 times. But the good news is that almost 90 percent of fans would potentially be interested in more climate-friendly travel options if better infrastructure, incentives, and information were available.


	“This isn't just like, oh well, yeah, it's a problem, but nobody's gonna do anything about it,” Gardner says. “Our survey says that's not true, that the vast majority of people will take advantage of solutions if we put them in place, message about them, and incentivize them.”


	Possible changes would include carpooling, taking public transportation, biking, and walking. Eighty percent of fans who participated in the survey traveled to concerts by personal vehicle, but only 65 percent preferred to. Half of fans would be in favor of priority carpool parking as an incentive. Nearly half wanted expanded public transportation. Bike-friendly infrastructure, priority parking for electric vehicles, and more electric vehicle charging stations were other changes that survey respondents supported.

	“It's one of these things where before this study, people always kind of knew that fan travel was the most emissions intensive, or the biggest opportunity for emissions reduction… but we haven't ever put data to it, so this is the first time that we're actually doing that as an industry,” Madeline Weir, REVERB's director of impact, tells Rolling Stone. “And so I think the reception has been really positive, [the music industry is] very excited to work with us and to kind of dive in and figure out what solutions work.”


	Gardner says the challenges are to inform fans, give them an incentive, and work on infrastructure. REVERB wants to make people aware of their transportation options, make sure venues and promoters are working with local transit authorities, and make people want to change. For example, he called incentives for carpooling, like preferred parking, the “low-hanging fruit.” 

	











	“If you can have less cars, and if you're incentivized by [carpooling], you're able to get in and out faster because the parking lot infrastructure is set up that way for carpoolers, that would be a massive incentive,” he says. 


	REVERB is also working with artists to share the results of the study with fans in emails before shows to “make it feel like there's a real reason why they're changing their behavior, not even just because it's for the climate, but literally because their artist is excited about it or it's going to be a better fan experience,” Weir says.


	Odesza, the electronic artist and a partner of the study, worked with hotels to have shuttles running to concert venues.

	“The fan experience can be so much better,” Gardner says, “because all of a sudden the concert experience can start on the bus, and you can have the music cranking, and… community is being built around some of these efforts.”


	“A big part of all of this is the community of fans and artists and even industry leaders coming together around these issues,” he adds. “I've seen this firsthand as a musician who's been touring for 34 years now, asking fans to do these things. Originally, I was like, ‘Oh, gosh, just a distraction, or maybe this is gonna be a buzzkill,' but if you approach it in the right way, which is, here's what we're trying to do, we're trying to have a lighter footprint, and here's how you can help be a part of it, and this is what we care about… it only enhances their concert experience.”

Amy Sherman-Palladino has always wanted to make television about dance.

The “Gilmore Girls” and “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” creator's latest, “Étoile,” follows two prestigious dance companies in New York and Paris who decide to swap their top talent in an attempt to shake things up and bring more eyes to the arts. Back in 2012, just a few years off “Gilmore Girls,” Sherman-Palladino helmed a season of “Bunheads,” starring Sutton Foster as a former Vegas showgirl who ends up working at a small-town ballet school.

But neither series clicks like the creator's other work — and the answer may be in the subject matter.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The performing arts — music, dance, theatre — have always been linked to television and film, but challenging to put on screen and make accessible to Hollywood viewers. This often manifests with middling movie musicals, and on the TV side with shows like “Smash,” (a cult favorite now on Broadway) “Mozart in the Jungle,” (notorious for winning a Golden Globe and prompting Google searches for “What is ‘Mozart in the Jungle'”), “Fosse/Verdon” (critically acclaimed but not widely watched), and “Bunheads” itself (poorly received by critics though it had its own fan following).

None of these titles struggles with love for the source material. Sherman-Palladino danced professionally before she quit to write for television, “Smash” was created by playwright Theresa Rebeck, and “Mozart” follows a philharmonic orchestra and is based on oboist Blair Tindall's experiences and memoir.

There's something deeply human in watching artists face adversity and pursue their passion — or at least there should be. The same themes ultimately manifest on a show like “Friday Night Lights,” where the discipline of high school football isn't inherently relatable but resonated mightily with viewers for the show's lovable characters and tight-knit community. Yet for performing arts, that connection usually only translates through reality competitions instead of narrative fiction.

It doesn't help that “Mozart” and “Étoile” are set in the siloed world of the arts elite, a space of privilege that is accessible to few (even as an audience member trying to find affordable tickets). “Bunheads” is weighed down by the obvious executive note to essentially recreate “Gilmore Girls,” to the point that the ballet is all but incidental. (“Smash” just descended into chaos, but I personally cannot fault it for that.)

 










“Friday Night Lights” might be set in the more widely beloved world of sports rather than the arts, but it offers a strong template for what could bring the performing arts to life on screen. Like any good show, the project has to be character-driven; in his review of “Étoile,” IndieWire's Ben Travers noted that the characters were “enormously, fruitlessly difficult — difficult to each other, difficult to invest in, and difficult to see clearly until it's far too late to care.” This is a risk when telling the story of egomaniacs and divas, but dare I say it worked for an enormously successful series called “Glee.”

To that end, the stakes have to matter. This might feel like Screenwriting 101, so how can it be applied here? Two prestigious ballet companies need money — probably not the sweeping audience hook that it could be. An underdog dreams of being a Broadway star? Now that might resonate with anyone who sings in the shower. An inexperienced oboe player ends up under the wing of her eccentric conductor? Not a situation we've all been in, but an intriguing dynamic. 

And lastly, also noted in IndieWire's review of “Étoile” — the show or film has to explore performing arts in a manner distinct from the real-life experience. Putting a camera in the audience POV of a dance show is only a reminder that the real thing is probably way better. Putting a camera in the wings, on stage, up close and personal — using a mix of static and tracking shots and difference angles in a way that no one can experience in an auditorium — now that's worth watching. Why be restricted by laws of physics when you've got movie magic on your side? Change the costumes or setting if it feels right, or use the medium of music, dance, or theatre to add a surreal element. “Smash” Season 1 often jumped between the rehearsal room and a staged version of the same song, a great and simple way to make each number more engaging. That and “Glee” indulged in their fair share of dream sequences, with mixed results but points for effort. 

 










There's no need to get too far in the weeds with any of it — if “Friday Night Lights” had spent more scenes on the details of every play or depicting games in real-time, I might not have made it to the end. Sherman-Palladino knows this from “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” which treats comedy the way that “Étoile” could have treated dance. The series always made time for Midge's (Rachel Brosnahan) inner life and personal relationships, illustrating how those factors affected her stage performance and overall life trajectory. No one on “Étoile” has a life outside of the ballet, which could itself be a compelling thread to pull at but remains unexplored like the rest.

So while “Étoile” may not be what was promised or hoped for, it can always be a lesson. All art is intertwined and viewers aren't necessarily opposed to discovering it on screen — they just need to be welcomed in, and TV has the power to do that.

“Étoile” is now streaming on Prime Video.

T
he man at the West Burnside Street bus stop looks stone dead, sprawled out on the sidewalk with his eyes rolled back. Lucky for him, he overdosed on a weekday, just five blocks from the downtown Portland fire station where the quick-response unit is on duty, and they're on the scene in minutes. With the sangfroid of someone who has performed this ritual too many times to count, paramedic Justin de Jesus jabs the man's shoulder with a shot of naloxone to reverse the effects of fentanyl, the hyper-potent synthetic opioid that is driving the U.S. overdose epidemic. His partner applies an oxygen mask and, slowly, the man's breathing picks up. After a quick knuckle rub to the sternum, he stirs back to life.But this brush with death is no wake-up call.


	Hostage to his addiction, the man shows no gratitude. He won't give his name and bristles when asked if he'd like more help. Before the first responders have packed up their kit, he disappears around a corner, presumably to score again. If someone overdoses to the point where they have to be revived, de Jesus later explains, “they tend to seek out that dealer because, in their words, ‘that's the good stuff.' They'll just do a little less, so they won't die. But since there's no standardization, you could be getting a fentanyl pill that has nothing in it — or ten thousand times the standard therapeutic dose, so you just drop dead.”


	Drug overdoses killed some 87,000 Americans over a 12-month period ending in September 2024 — more lives lost than the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq combined. Although the death toll is down significantly from a peak of almost 114,000 the year before, Oregon and other western states have lagged behind the downward national trend, making them ground zero of the decade-long fentanyl crisis. Nowhere has the social and economic impact been more acutely felt than in Portland, a proudly progressive, mid-sized city of more than 600,000 that not long ago was one the most desirable places to live in the country, despite stubbornly high rates of unsheltered homelessness and substance abuse.

	











	In late 2020, Oregon voters overwhelmingly passed the most liberal drug law in the country, decriminalizing possession of small amounts of hard drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine. Instead of jail time, Ballot Measure 110 aimed to expand addiction treatment services in a state that ranked last in such offerings nationwide, through hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue redirected from a cannabis tax and savings resulting from reductions in arrests and incarceration. Additional funding went to harm reduction services — naloxone distribution, needle exchanges, testing kits — that make drugs “safer” to use. Advocates hoped to follow in the footsteps of trailblazing countries like Portugal and France, where nuanced approaches that prioritize health care over punishment have reduced overdoses and public drug use. In some respects, it was the closest any place in the U.S. had yet come to The Wire's “Hamsterdam”: a drug zone where police permit dealers to operate as long as they don't fight over territory and confine sales to a limited number of blocks, enabling addiction service providers to focus their efforts.

	The timing could not have been worse. Months into legalization, Mexican drug cartels ratcheted up the flow of fentanyl across the border and up the Interstate 5 corridor, where it flooded onto city streets, plunging prices to less than a dollar a pill. As lockdown despair from the Covid-19 pandemic deepened, the killing of George Floyd sparked months-long racial justice protests that turned violent and engulfed parts of downtown. With police turning a blind eye, Portland became a honeypot for local and out-of-state addicts to score cheap dope and use it freely. “It was like a perfect storm that brought us from this really vibrant, amazing downtown to a tourist destination [for drug users],” says Rick Graves, a spokesman for Portland Fire and Rescue. Overdose deaths, retail theft, and homicides surged to record levels, running law enforcement and first responders ragged. “We'd revive the same people, and revive them again and again,” says Dave Friedericks, a veteran paramedic and firefighter whose downtown station responded to 36 overdose calls in a 48-hour period in the summer of 2023.

	A highly addictive painkiller, fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin (two milligrams — or the equivalent of five to seven grains of table salt — is considered a lethal dose), with black-market analogues that are thousands of times stronger. Dealers mix fentanyl with other drugs to increase profits, and fentanyl's effects on users are exacerbated by an evolving array of cuts, notably xylazine (a.k.a. “tranq”), an animal tranquilizer that, when injected, can rot flesh and lead to amputation. Complicating matters, many addicts in Oregon use fentanyl and psychosis-inducing forms of methamphetamine in tandem, raising the likelihood of a fatal overdose and making it even harder to get them to seek treatment.


	In January 2024, Portland made national headlines when governor Tina Kotek declared a 90-day state of emergency to tackle the fentanyl crisis. Within months, state lawmakers voted to repeal Measure 110, ending a nearly four-year experiment with decriminalization. Then the reform-minded district attorney of Multnomah County, where Portland is located, was ousted by one of his own prosecutors, in a ballot seen as a referendum for greater accountability. Now, anyone caught with illicit drugs who doesn't have outstanding warrants is given a choice: be charged with possession and go to jail; or be “deflected” to community-based addiction treatment. Anti-drug laws, in other words, are back in force, albeit with a brand of “tough love” that reflects the Rose City's liberal ethos.


	I made two trips to Portland last year to see how the transition is working out. In a live-and-let-live city that likes to signal its virtues, can empathy and stricter law enforcement go hand-in-hand? When does hands-off harm reduction become enablement? And with a drug as deadly addictive as fentanyl, is compulsory detox and treatment a viable option? How Portland manages this next chapter could be a bellwether for larger American cities grappling with the tangle of addiction, rampant homelessness, and deteriorating public safety.

	











	“The challenge here in the U.S. is massive,” says Dr. Andy Mendenhall, CEO of Central City Concern, a nonprofit that provides housing and addiction services to nearly 16,000 people each year. The unrelenting flow of fentanyl combined with a dearth of shelter beds, affordable housing, and behavioral health resources has resulted in an addicted population that's chronically homeless and harder to get into treatment, he explains. “On a more esoteric level, people feel stressed out and isolated from each other. There's a lack of connection, and we've become this soundbite culture where feelings are to be avoided or turned off. And there are so many different distractions that folks are going to turn to something to help them feel different.”


	ON A WIND-BLOWN CORNER near the old Greyhound bus station in Chinatown, homeless addicts muster in front of a white van serving free cups of coffee. The van is operated by the Mental Health and Addiction Association of Oregon, a Measure 110-boosted nonprofit that employs former drug users who apply their lived experience to guide peers into recovery. They offer tickets to a nearby resource center where people can get free showers, do laundry, and eat  hot food, no strings attached. Should anyone request detox or a housing referral, staff assess their mental health and other criteria to determine the best fit. “It's why I call Portland ‘Supportland,'” says Ricco Mejia, a charismatic ex-heroin addict raised by “whores and bank robbers” who serves as outreach manager. “I was struggling and asked for help, I received help, and I became the help.”


	Word is that 35-year-old Bruce Ferguson is ready to come in for detox, and Mejia is waiting with a smile and handshake when he turns up. A husky skater with a shock of terracotta hair and a soulful aspect, Bruce says he started taking Adderall and later pot to deal with teenage anxiety. He fell in with a troubled crowd. A Percocet prescription after a dental operation segued to heroin addiction that got him kicked out of the family home. Then came fentanyl. “It's not how it used to be,” he says. “It controls every decision you make.” With a powerful high that wears off in less than an hour, some addicts are compelled to use upwards of 20 to 30 times a day, leaving fleeting windows of self-possession. “People that you would never even guess become users and now, within a couple of days, months, they're homeless out here,” Bruce says. “They've lost everything: families, cars, houses, careers.”


	Bruce lost a steady job landscaping, his apartment, and the girlfriend he shared it with. He's had almost no contact with his parents over the past few years. “I just want to be a decent human being and be accountable, be trustworthy, and I want to be a good son to my mom and my dad and make them proud,” he says, “because I've done the complete opposite of that.” He steals constantly to slake his addiction, which compounds the gnawing sense of shame and the urge to numb out — aware he's one false move from another long stint in jail, or an early grave. “If I don't get my shit together, I'm going to lose everything for good.” 

	











	As Mejia and Bruce set a time to meet at the downtown center, Bruce's ex-girlfriend appears. She's recently relapsed, and looks worse for wear. Bruce later confides that he introduced her to fentanyl, a fact that still haunts him. After they catch up, he tells Mejia that his ex's presence is “stirring the pot a little.” 


	“That's that friendly fire we talk about,” replies Mejia, launching into pep-talk mode. “The lifestyle firing back at us. Most people get taken out on the battlefield by people on our own side. Could be friends and family. They want what's best for us. But we need a time-out from them to work on ourselves first. So just maybe setting a boundary with her, right?”


	Much to Mejia's relief, Bruce shows up at the resource center a few hours later. He showers, cuts his hair, and organizes his art supplies for a weeklong stay at Recovery Works Northwest, a 16-bed inpatient detox facility that opened with Measure 110 funding. Nervous but upbeat, Bruce says he wants to sober up and reconnect with his father, a schoolteacher now living in Italy. Past experience has also taught him that feeling normal again can be the hardest part of all. “I have energy and get complacent, like, ‘I can handle that [drug] and it's not going to hurt me,' and it does. Every time.”


	When it's time to head over, Bruce tells Mejia that he needs to run a few more errands and will come back in the afternoon. But he never does. 


	Mejia is unfazed. Having been in and out of detox 15 times himself, he knows better than anyone that the path to recovery is seldom a straight line. “It's the lifestyle and the disease of addiction, making choices for them.” After so many relapses, he credits getting into supportive housing with outpatient treatment for helping him finally turn the corner from being “a community hazard to an asset. People were here to help me when I was ready, and we'll be here to help him.”


	According to the Multnomah County Health Department, individuals who are homeless and addicted like Bruce are at 51 times greater risk for overdose death. Of an estimated 7,000 homeless people in Portland, at least 456 died on the street in 2023, the deadliest year on record. And despite the infusion of more than $1.7 billion since 2015, homelessness in the Portland area continues to climb faster than authorities can house people. Decades of underbuilding have led to a dire housing shortage that has spiked rents and home prices, while some addicts find it easier to service their addictions on the street. In a bid to ease the deficit and draw more people into care, Multnomah County is opening temporary housing sites with low barriers to entry. In Portland's Clinton Triangle area, a fenced-off “village” between train tracks hosts 140 housing pods and another 20 tent platforms that are free of charge, part of a network of some 750 pods across the city. No one is turned away for substance abuse; the site is staffed primarily by people in recovery, with on-site mental health counselors to connect residents with drug treatment should they seek it.

	











	I find 39-year-old Sean Smeeden holed up in one of the tiny homes in a cold sweat, raw out of detox. “Fentanyl and opioids ruined my life even before I started doing them,” he says, explaining that the drugs killed his mother, uncle, and grandmother within a year-and-a-half period. Although the premises are rife with active fentanyl smokers, Smeeden, a self-described “nomad” from Alaska, is grateful for a space to call his own. After four sleepless nights, his withdrawal pangs are fading enough to look for work as a dishwasher. If he can stay sober, he'd like to get certified as a computer programmer and secure more permanent housing. “I'm going through it right now,” he says, “but that's OK, because I feel alive. Suffering or not, it feels good to feel.” 


	IN DOWNTOWN PORTLAND, the proliferation of low-barrier housing, treatment centers, and harm reduction services are in tension with struggling business owners who invested back when the local economy was booming. More than 2,600 downtown businesses, already hobbled by the pandemic and street riots, have shut down, citing customer loss due to homelessness and crime. The city's office vacancy rate stands at 30 percent, the highest in the nation, and job loss is the largest of any major metropolitan area. From San Francisco to Seattle, a similar decline has stoked fears of an “urban doom loop”: an ever-downward spiral where lower occupancy and property valuation leads to a withering tax base from which to fund policing, first responders, and other critical services.

“I've learned that the disease of addiction has a hit on my life. … The hit man is me.”


	The city's reputation for drugs, crime, and homelessness “has really crushed us,” says Jessie Burke, a community organizer and co-owner of The Society Hotel in Old Town Chinatown, a neighborhood that's a perennial hub for the homeless and drug addicted. Burke, of mixed Chinese American descent, bought the rundown 19th-century building for $700,000 in 2013 and invested more than $4 million in renovations, hoping to be a part of the historic neighborhood's renaissance. Business was “going gangbusters” in the early years, she says — but since 2019 has plunged by about 40 percent, at a loss of $30,000 a month. “I remember thinking this is hard, but I don't think I ever thought I would witness the things that I've witnessed now.”

	











	During legalization, overdoses became so common that the city asked Burke to install a naloxone dispenser in the lobby (she refused), and drive-by shootings between rival drug gangs punctured the night. Although the violence has tapered off, the hotel's front doors remain locked. Sidewalks outside are lined with tents and addicts nodding off next to pipes and burnt tinfoil. Some are missing limbs. When I visited last May, a half-naked man streaked by in a fit of psychosis. The week before, another man high on meth armed with a machete threatened to chop the head off an employee's three-year-old daughter. “You have to be tough as nails to work here,” says Burke. “Most days it's like you're entering a war zone, and you don't realize it until you leave.”


	A former competitive fencer with a no-nonsense attitude reflecting her East Coast roots, Burke insists that people high on hard drugs should not be allowed free rein. “It doesn't need to be jail, but we used to have something called the Cheers van where the drug of choice was alcohol, and if you were passed out or drunk, they would pick you up and you would go to the drunk tank and sober up,” she says. “It has to be built a little differently, because the drugs are different. But the fact that people get to walk the streets and be aggressive on meth and have a machete is unacceptable. People deserve predictability — it's the baseline safety that people expect.”


	Burke also decries the lack of oversight on public funds earmarked for homelessness and treatment services, claiming that there are no hard deliverables for any contract that goes out the door for Multnomah County's $4 billion annual budget. (Her concerns were echoed in a December 2023 state audit of $264 million in Measure 110 funds allocated to treatment service groups, which cited “insufficient data” to assess their effectiveness.) One low-hanging measure she calls long overdue is a centralized server, much like the kind hotels rely on, that tracks the availability of beds in public-funded shelters. On any given night, hundreds of beds lie empty. Comparing the poor performance to standards in the private sector, she says, “Small businesses don't have the luxury of failing year after year, not delivering the thing that they promised.”


	In May, Burke lost her bid for a seat on the Multnomah County board of commissioners. But on the side, she served as campaign manager for her friend Nathan Vasquez, the insurgent county prosecutor who defeated his boss for the district attorney job on a campaign pledge to more aggressively prosecute criminals. At his victory party at a swank hotel on the edge of Chinatown, Vasquez affirmed that he would end open-air drug markets and get more users into treatment, “restoring the idea that it is OK to hold people accountable, and do it in a compassionate manner.”  


	I RETURNED TO PORTLAND in early November, after Donald Trump won re-election. Scores of downtown storefronts were boarded up in anticipation of clashes between cops and anarchists that, for a change, never materialized. Just as the U.S. electorate shifted right, Portland reasserted its progressive bona fides by using a ranked-vote system to elect the most diverse city council in its history. The law-and-order mayoral candidate was rejected for Keith Wilson, a moderate businessman with no political experience who promised to end homelessness within a year. Contrary to what some might have heard, “Portland remains a very liberal city,” says Richard Clucas, a politics professor at Portland State University.

	











	Two months into re-criminalization, it was hard to discern any visible change in the downtown drug market. People smoked fentanyl in plain sight and clustered at the usual spots: around the public library, the Burnside St. McDonald's, along Alder St., in the parking lot beneath the closed Montessori school. And after dark, the dealers were impossible to miss: short young men in hoodies and women in pajama pants, slinking around corners with side packs. 


	Overdoses were down slightly across the city, in large part thanks to weaker drugs. Since last May, the fentanyl supply experienced a dramatic shift in potency, locally dubbed “the drought.” Nearly half the samples tested by the harm reduction group Outside In contained BTMPS, an industrial chemical nicknamed “bug spray dope” for its acrid taste when smoked. Though toxic, it's not known to cause overdose or immediate death, fueling a theory that it may be part of a deliberate effort by Mexican cartels to kill less of their customer base while ensuring profits by requiring users to smoke more to get high.


	For years, fentanyl production in northwestern Mexico was close to a free-for-all: If you had the recipe, you could cook the drug, which yielded wildly varying degrees of potency. In October 2023, the Chapitos faction of the Sinaloa cartel imposed a ban on fentanyl production and killed dozens of violators, purportedly in response to intensified pressure from U.S. law enforcement. According to Victoria Dittmar of Insight Crime, a think tank that studies organized crime in the Americas, production continues by other Sinaloa cartel factions, and has since moved into neighboring states like Sonora and Baja California, where cooks operate under the oversight of the cartel. Weaker fentanyl cuts could be a calculated decision, “as by doing this, they reduce law enforcement pressure on them while still maintaining profits,” Dittmar says. “But at this stage, this is just a hypothesis.” Additionally, when certain precursor chemicals are in short supply, fentanyl may be cut with xylazine and other ingredients to increase the volume of the final product at any stage of the chain, from cook to U.S. distributor, “so even if production in Sinaloa appears to be more centralized, the end product can still vary.”


	One factor behind the decline in deaths that's not in question is more widespread availability of naloxone. While some residents contend that harm reduction measures like the free handouts of drug paraphernalia and tarps have exacerbated a sense of decay around Portland and left addicts more vulnerable to abuse, the impact of the opioid reversal drug on streets where it was once scarce to nonexistent is “a major success story,” says Dr. Todd Korthuis, the head of Oregon Health & Science University's addiction medicine section. He singled out the work of Save Lives Oregon, a network of organizations that has distributed more than 675,000 naloxone doses, resulting in almost 20,000 overdose reversals.

	











	Reid Elder, an UberEats driver who obsessively tracks Portland's drug scene and collects free naloxone, says he's administered “hundreds” of life-saving doses over the past two years. Seven nights a week, he and his partner, Elena Perez, work the graveyard shift downtown in their Toyota Prius while monitoring emergency dispatch on a smartphone app. Anytime an overdose call comes through that's in range, they detour to the scene equipped with naloxone, often arriving ahead of first responders. When things are slow, the couple distribute snacks and hand warmers, along with nudges to seek help. In general, social service workers in Portland are “too passive,” Elder laments. “Getting people off the street is gonna take a lot more assertive helping.”


	On a drizzly Friday night, we check in with “Squints,” a 34-year-old Black man who Elder says has been on the same corner in Chinatown for four nights. It's 42 degrees out, and Squints is shivering under a thin blanket and a soaked sheet of cardboard. Elder offers a ride to a nearby shelter but he politely declines and asks for a lighter instead. When Squints finally agreed to be taken into the hospital five days later, Elder found fentanyl foil under his blanket. Following surgery to remove a blood clot in his leg, he returned to the street. “It's mind-boggling,” says Elder. “People get into this state and they're not even trying to meet their survival needs.”


	Just after 10 p.m., we pull up to the corner of 13th and Taylor St. as a busted dealer is loaded into an ambulance. He'd tried to make a run for it and was tackled by a member of the Central Bike Squad, a 10-person police unit tasked with disrupting the downtown drug trade (and whose run-and-gun exploits are featured on a COPS-style Instagram account). In his side pack, officers found 50 grams of compressed fentanyl, $1,126 in cash, and a revolver.

	











	Though police don't make a point of asking, Officer Cristina Serrano, a native Spanish speaker, tells me “more than 90 percent” of the street-level dealers they arrest are undocumented Hondurans who belong to networks on Mexican cartels' payrolls — a fact that squares with Drug Enforcement Administration investigations from Oakland to Salt Lake City. “Some of them don't even know it's a misdemeanor now,” she says, “so they just keep doing it in the street.” (Indeed, a month earlier, when Serrano arrested a woman who'd been weighing out fentanyl powder with a scale at this exact same spot, she says the woman was less concerned about going to jail than feeding her infant child.) Typically, dealers give an alias when arrested and skip their court date; if the heat becomes too great, they move on to another western state where their warrant won't be extraditable, in a distribution merry-go-round.


	Under Measure 110, the man caught with fentanyl weight and a gun might have walked away with a ticket — or nothing at all. Today, it's hardly any worse; Serrano says he could normally expect to be released “within hours.” Only because it was a weekend and there was no judge on duty, the man would have to spend a couple nights in jail. The remainder of Serrano's shift would be spent doing paperwork at the precinct, leaving no bike patrol on duty downtown until Monday morning. 


	Like water probing for gaps, the Hondurans were back on the same block before midnight.

“You can push people further away by forcing them [into treatment], and those people will just recede into the shadows.”


	THE NEXT MORNING, I ask the central precinct commander, Brian Hughes, if there's any disincentive to dealing fentanyl in his city. “There's none — and they know that; it's part of the business model,” he says. “There needs to be more risk [for dealers].” While re-criminalization under the new law, HB 4002, has enabled police to make arrests and carry out investigations that have led to up-the-chain arrests and larger drug seizures, he says authorities are still hamstrung by capacity shortages in the jails and on the street. (Following the George Floyd protests, police hiring was put on a freeze that was later lifted.) He says a city the size of Portland should have at least 1,100 officers. Today, there are just 785 on staff, with some entering retirement; another 150 officers are in training but it will take months before they are in service. “We are way too low now,” says Hughes.

	











	Hughes was more upbeat about the deflection option available to drug users to avoid the criminal justice system. Provided they have no outstanding warrants and are not a threat, they could choose to be dropped off at a new center across the Willamette River, where they are screened by health workers and referred to additional treatment services. Operated by Baltimore nonprofit Tuerk House, the center offers 13 sobering stations that are open 24-hours, with plans to open a permanent sobering center in 2027 that can accommodate 50 people for longer stays and involuntary holds, including withdrawal management services and medication-assisted treatment.


	It's still too early to assess the efficacy of the program. As of late February, only 267 have entered deflection (the majority of people arrested with drugs are brought to jail on other charges or an outstanding warrant). Moreover, once they are delivered and officers remove the handcuffs, nothing can stop them from walking away — as most appear to be doing, much to the ire of neighbors and business owners. “They haven't even finished the booking process and they're out,” says Serrano, noting that after 30 days, offenders become eligible for deflection again if arrested. Deflection is a “good idea,” she adds, “but when is enough, enough?” 


	Incoming district attorney Nathan Vasquez says he's aware of these loopholes and has a plan to fix them. “Being progressive is wonderful, but there's still a social contract,” he says. “When it comes to [small possession] drug crimes, the goal should never be to lock people up. At the same time, you have to have a motivational piece to push people toward treatment, and sometimes it's OK to put someone in jail for a few days.”


	To make his point, he shares the story of a key witness in a triple homicide case who was addicted to fentanyl and had overdosed multiple times. As the trial neared and it was obvious she would not show up, he arranged a warrant to have her held for 10 days with an ankle monitor — enforcing a de facto detox stint. Since the trial ended, Vasquez says the woman texts him every three months to thank him for helping her get sober, something she told him she “never would have done” without him. There are “many paths to recovery,” Vasquez says, “and it's never wise to take any threat of being held accountable off the table.”


	One component of Vasquez's plan will be involuntary detox in treatment dorms built on county jail grounds. Along with traditional guards, they will be staffed by medical nurses working to use the detox period to get them “in the right zone” before they are released to an inpatient or outpatient treatment program, with a supervised plan that could include Suboxone, a medication used to alleviate opioid cravings, and a dedicated case manager. He wants to start with 100 to 120 beds and, if enough funding can be raised from the county, federal grants, and private investors, be staffed up and running by the end of 2026. Because he has no plans to seek higher office, Vasquez says he can put “results ahead of politics” and, hopefully, create a model that other mid-sized American cities can replicate.


	Enforced treatment is not a new concept in the U.S. State and local governments have used drug courts and other systems since the 1970s to compel people to get sober, and the approach is gaining bipartisan momentum owing to the lethality of fentanyl. California lawmakers, for instance, have passed legislation that makes it easier to detain people and force them into medical treatment for addiction. A half-dozen recovering heroin and fentanyl addicts told me, unequivocally, that they never would have broken free without a “nudge from the judge.” “I got rescued, not arrested,” says one, who now works for a recovery nonprofit. 

	











	Other former addicts counter that involuntary treatment is unethical and dehumanizing, and does more harm than good. “Most people already couldn't quit using drugs when they were facing a bunch of consequences, so when you come in and say there's gonna be one more consequence it's not like, ‘Oh, the fucking light switch flipped,'” says Morgan Godvin, a drug policy researcher and former heroin user who spent four years behind bars as a result of her addiction. “You can push people further away by forcing them, and those people will just recede into the shadows.” Most empirical data affirms that involuntary treatment is less effective, particularly the “cold turkey” approaches used in some prisons. A 2024 study in Massachusetts dealing with fentanyl addiction found that civic commitment, whereby family members seek court-mandated treatment for a loved one, increased the risk of overdose after forced abstinence.


	“The goal is to have as many people as possible make the choice between prosecution and treatment consciously, and have a sense of accountability for that,” says Central City Concern's Mendenhall, noting that recovery outcomes are better when self-directed. However, when individuals have lost the ability to help themselves due to acute mental illness and addiction, and pose a danger to themselves and others, “involuntary treatment is absolutely necessary.” Oregon still faces a severe shortage of psychiatric care facilities, and people with dual diagnoses are generally excluded from civil commitment. These people are “falling through the cracks,” he adds, resulting “in the greatest inequities and preventable death” from overdose and exposure.  


	Once again, Portland will be a test case as authorities try to strike a balance between care and coercion. “Measure 110 was, ‘We're going to let you exist out in the street, and good luck — we hope somehow you're gonna decide to make the leap to treatment,' not taking into account the nature of the beast [fentanyl and meth],” says Vasquez. “What if we tried this other path, where there is a medical component, and a criminal justice component, and not shy away from that but embrace it in a way that says, ‘How can we help get these individuals connected to treatment in a long-term way?'”


	LATE ONE NIGHT, making the rounds with Elder and Perez, we speed to an overdose call in Chinatown, right across the street from The Society Hotel. An unconscious man named Gilbert is receiving emergency breathing from a woman, and three discarded shots of naloxone litter the ground. “His heart's working but he's not breathing,” the woman shouts. The man's lips are turning blue and Perez, unsure of how long he's been out, jumps in to give him another shot of naloxone. The woman pushes her against the wall: “Goddamit, you're gonna kill him if you give him another shot!” Perez pleads, “We're on the same team, mama!” The scene is harrowing and poignant, two strangers trying their damndest to save a dying man on a cold, wet sidewalk. And they succeed: Gilbert wakes up just as an ambulance and fire truck arrive.

	











	While I was in Portland, the Centers for Disease Control released preliminary figures indicating that U.S. overdose deaths had experienced their first significant decline in years. There are many theories as to why — and no definitive consensus. Some drug policy analysts touted greater international pressure on Chinese companies that make fentanyl precursor chemicals and larger seizures on the U.S. southern border for the drop in fentanyl supply and strength, with some asserting that intensified law enforcement has changed cartels' behavior. Just days ago in Portland, a multiagency operation combining the efforts of the DEA, FBI, and local law enforcement led to the arrest of 46 traffickers — including Honduran nationals allegedly working with the Sinaloa cartel — and the seizure of 44 pounds of fentanyl powder as well as more than 2,500 pills. Since taking office, President Trump has escalated the War on Drugs, designating the cartels as global terrorist organizations and threatening to target them inside Mexico with air strikes and Special Forces. But like other heavy-handed campaigns of the past, such tactics are unlikely to be effective given the cartels' diffuse operations, fentanyl's low cost and ease of transport, and the insatiable U.S. market for cheap opioids. “Even if all fentanyl producers in Mexico are taken out, production would still take place,” says Insight Crime's Dittmar, noting that it costs about $60,000 to set up a lab and buy materials. “We already see it happening in Canada, and there is some indication that it could be happening in the United States.”


	Devastating as Oregon's overdose crisis remains, health officials contend that vigilance on the home front is the best long-term strategy, however slow and messy. Dr. Korthuis emphasizes that fentanyl hit Oregon and other western states later than eastern states that are now seeing a sharp drop in overdose deaths due to changes in the drug supply, naloxone availability, and expanded treatment services. “There seems to be a natural evolution: The decline in overdose deaths maps out almost perfectly with when fentanyl appears in a state,” he says. “I'm confident that by doubling down on prevention and treatment we can demonstrate the success of innovative public health models in Oregon.”


	Supporters of decriminalization maintain it was not given enough time to have an impact. Indeed, a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that “decriminalization of drug possession was not associated with an increase in fatal drug overdose rates” in Oregon, attributing the surge to the deluge of fentanyl instead. But in the wake of Measure 110, more people are getting access to naloxone and medically assisted treatment with proven drugs like methadone and buprenorphine. Community-based nonprofits offer a broadening spectrum of addiction services — from inpatient treatment and low-barrier housing to long-term counseling — that give fentanyl users a fighting chance of slipping its grip. And, critically, they are staffed by legions of emerging survivors who know the pain and isolation that lie at the root of addiction, and are ready to meet people where they are. “It's all hands on deck here,” says Mejia, the outreach manager. “We're keeping the momentum going.”


	Back at the coffee van in Old Town, a gaunt addict named Travis walks up and asks for detox. “I'm just done,” says the 43-year-old, “I can't live like this anymore.” Tommy Richmond, a volunteer who credits a jail term with helping him get clean, starts making calls. The first two places are booked, but Recovery Works Northwest has a single bed available, and Mejia comes to drive them over. On the way, Richmond stays on the phone trying to arrange housing for the day Travis exits detox, so he doesn't slip through the cracks. If he commits to outpatient treatment, he could be eligible for county funds that would cover his rent while he gets back on his feet. “There's going to be a bunch of guys living there, and they're going to help you stay accountable,” Richmond says. 

	











	Travis worries aloud that he'll be kicked back onto the street if he relapses. “Even at 13 years clean, I still wanna get high, but I share my thoughts and feelings like you're doing, so I don't put that into action,” says Mejia. He adds a parting shot: “I've learned that the disease of addiction has a hit on my life. What's colder than that? The hit man is me. So, how I get militant and combat that is by doing what you're doing today and asking for help.”


	Set back in a residential area and flanked by towering pine trees, Recovery Works looks more like a cozy family home than a detox clinic. Sean Smeeden had spent a week here in the spring. (Five weeks after we met at the tiny home complex, I learned he was shot dead on a MAX train platform in north Portland.) It turns out Bruce Ferguson had also come through.


	BY CHANCE I RUN into Bruce on a downtown corner and invite him to lunch. Over a bowl of Thai curry he tells me that he skipped his detox appointment that day in May to get high with his ex-girlfriend. But he made it to the clinic a week later and toughed it out, moving on to supportive housing with a group of men. He was building momentum, but having only a month to find a job and place of his own made him feel “discouraged and looking for ways to cope.” Before relapsing, he left the home to avoid putting anyone else at risk. Over the summer, he did another month-long stint at a sober house, and relapsed again. By his count, it was the 10th time.

	











	Since then, he'd been sleeping rough and using, too ashamed to reach out to his family. “It hurts to even think about it; they care so much, and I don't like to be the bearer of bad news.” He recedes into himself for a moment and lets out a groan, the ache of longing taking on a physical dimension. “It's all so exhausting,” he goes on. “Sometimes I wanna curl up in a ball and cry, but out here you gotta keep a certain demeanor so people don't walk all over you, target you.”


	Bruce was going on three days without sleep. As the heavy meal settles, he can barely finish sentences and then finally drifts off, head slumping on his chest. For the next hour I let him rest, until the cafe closes down and it's time to head back out into the darkening street.

	J.D. Vance's best friend has no comment.


	In truth, J.D. Vance's best friend really doesn't want anyone to know he's J.D. Vance's best friend — not now that he's running for Canadian parliament in an industrial city on the shores of Lake Ontario. For three consecutive days in late April, I arrive at J.D. Vance's best friend's campaign headquarters, on Division Street in the hardscrabble Ontario village of Bowmanville, and I'm told that J.D. Vance's best friend is most definitely aware of my two prior visits. From behind a locked door, a polite older volunteer informs me that if J.D. Vance's best friend has any comments to offer he will be sure to contact me. 


	Such is the plight of a Canadian politician named Jamil Jivani. A Yale law classmate of Vance and his wife Usha, the son of a Kenyan father and white Canadian mother and the product of underprivileged circumstances, Jivani had been parachuted into the safe district east of Toronto in good measure because of his connections to the vice president. Like Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, Jivani has written a memoir of childhood hardship, one filled with uncheckable tales of youthful illiteracy and near brushes with violence, only his book purporting to portray young male rage disappeared without a trace; both tales read like special-need pleas for preferential treatment from an Ivy League school.

	











	A few months before my arrival, Jivani's Canada First, MAGA-adjacent Conservative party had been heading for a landslide victory, offering tax cuts and anti-woke policies, along with juvenile name calling. But then Donald Trump threatened to annex Canada and derisively referred to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a “governor,” offending the entire nation. In short order, Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian automobiles and steel and aluminum, in blatant breach of the treaty Trump himself had negotiated in his first term. Casting wolfish eyes on Canada as America's “51st state,” Trump became the most despised figure in the country — along with his bearded sidekick Vice President J.D. Vance.

	For reasons that seem to careen from grandiose designs on being a Mount Rushmore-worthy historical figure to schoolyard bullying, Trump thus transformed Canadian politics — and society. Trump's degrading and ridiculous attacks instantly incited a 25-point swing to the center-left Liberal party, obliterating the huge polling advantage of a Conservative leader with an uncanny resemblance to a young Richard Nixon — the slicked back hair, sly smile, bottomless grievance. By contrast, the new Liberal leader Mark Carney was a former head of the Banks of Canada and England, an economist with degrees from Harvard and Oxford and a history of dealing with the catastrophe of Brexit. His quiet demeanor and no-bullshit approach seemed to match the rising sense of outrage and defiance in Canada — or at least that is what the polls show.

	











	Incredibly, no major American political figure came to the defense of Canada, to the dismay of my homeland, nor did business or union leaders, as American institutions cowered and curled into submission. For decades Canada has been America's closest ally and friend, but in a matter of days the country embarked on a new and astounding anti-American trajectory, one that is likely have global implications, as the image of Trump and the United States morph into a singular authoritarian, untrustworthy, impulsive, belligerent, and uniquely unappealing brand.


	THE STRETCH OF EXURBIA east of Toronto that Jivani is running to represent is much like Springfield, USA, the anywhere fictional city from The Simpsons, not the unfortunate real Springfield in Ohio that Vance falsely claimed was populated by pet-eating migrants — a transparently racist statement that Vance's best friend overlooked, despite his mixed-race heritage.


	The smokestack from a nuclear reactor looms over the landscape of this section of Lake Ontario, and the strip malls and row after row of new tract housing could be the outskirts of many American cities — but with an epic and telling difference. In Canada, diversity isn't a dirty word or dog-whistle slogan, at least not for the vast majority, no matter how controversial the terms DEI and “woke” might be. The population in the city of Oshawa and nearby Bowmanville is as diverse as can be imagined, the old-school Ontario red-brick farmhouses flanked by Syrian Christian basilicas and Muslim Welfare Centers and mega-churches. Millions of immigrants have arrived in Canada in the last decade, causing an acute affordable housing shortage, but the closest a political party comes to race signaling is the unctuous Conservative leader's constant references to the “rampant crime wave” that supposedly envelopes Canadians — fear that I failed to detect once in my fellow Canadians.

	With J.D. Vance acting as Trump's attack dog, conjuring the world's lone super power as somehow a victim of scheming countries like Canada, Jivani obviously needed to downplay his close association with his best buddy. Normally an eager cultural warrior on social media, Jivani ducked the press to avoid questions about Vance, although for years the connection had been his sole claim to fame. 


	Along the new four-lane highways lacing the countryside, with countless plots pegged for imminent development, there are Asian supermarkets and fast-food joints and young immigrant families strolling in the new tract housing — some wearing turbans, some burqas, some Canadian flag T-shirts saying “Elbows Up.” In Dam Foods, a Jamaican store selling goat meat and oxtail around the corner from Jivani's headquarters, the workers haven't heard of the candidate, nor has he visited the store, at least to their knowledge — but the shop is a visible minority presence in a down-on-its-luck community in the midst of a cultural transformation. 

	











	Closer to the city of Toronto, the iconic General Motors facility has been reduced to a single operating plant, a few thousand employees turning out 600 pickups every day, but Trump's tariffs threaten to destroy what remains of the Canadian automobile industry — and thereby decimate the city of Oshawa. Once, union auto workers on both sides of the border shared a brotherhood, fighting for better conditions with a common cause, but Trump has managed to turn working-class brother against brother — while billionaires receive tax cuts.


	In Oshawa, the leader of the local outpost of the United Auto Workers laments the “absolutely bizarre” tariffs imposed on the industry and notes Jivani's connection to Vance. But what most distresses the auto workers is the sense of helplessness. They have no way to catch the ear of the American government, to plead their case: Canadian auto workers are highly paid, with excellent benefits, not the low-wage workers that the car companies have migrated to as they abandoned the rust belt on both sides of the border; Canadian workers are not destroying American auto jobs, as Trump continually asserts, but part of a highly functional, integrated system — like the two nations. If only the union in Oshawa had a way of getting word of their plight to the powers that be in Washington, I'm told.


	But there is someone who could make that call — their local Conservative candidate Jamil Jivani could easily pick up the telephone and call his best friend, the vice president, on their behalf, if he wanted to. But he hasn't, it would seem. Perhaps Jivani asking Vance to intervene would be pointless; perhaps he's afraid of riling up his best friend; perhaps advocating for the auto workers in Oshawa doesn't serve his personal political ambition; perhaps Oshawa is just a stepping stone for a politician with his eyes on bigger prizes as a Christian nationalist; perhaps the good people of Oshawa are on their own. Vance may well consider himself above the concerns of a few sad-sack Canadians.


	The only thing that can be said with certainty is this: J.D. Vance's best friend has no comment.


	“I hear he's a slippery bastard,” one worker emerging from the afternoon shift at the General Motors plant tells me when I ask what he knows about Jamil Jivani.


	FRIENDSHIPS AND FAMILIES by the millions criss-cross the border, Canadian and American relationships built up over centuries of coexistence and co-prosperity and adversity. For most every American I know, Trump's incessant attacks on Canada are a kind of joke — he can't be serious, of course, they say: No one actually thinks that the United States should annex Canada. Except Trump, as the friendless president repeats over and over again. But the funny thing about dismissing a serious threat is that when no one else is laughing, it slowly becomes clear that the joke isn't really funny. It follows that laughing at your own jokes, over time, turns you into the joke.

	











	The friendship between Jivani and Vance appears to be sincere, as does the Canadian's connection with Usha Vance, as Jivani offered a Bible reading at their wedding. When Jivani fell ill with cancer, he went to live with the Vances in Ohio, and when he was well enough to work again, his pal J.D. hired him to run his failed nonprofit that was supposed to save Appalachia. Vance also introduced Jivani to his book agent, securing a deal for his acolyte's truly unreadable and unread memoir. 

A post shared by Jamil Jivani (@jamiljivani)


	When Jivani was nominated to run for parliament, the Conservative party appeared giddy at the prospect of having a member so closely connected with an American power player. But all that was long before Trump declared unilateral economic war on Canada — precisely the kind of unprovoked unilateral conflict he'd promised to avoid during the campaign, this one straining the credulity of even the most maniacal MAGA zealot.


	Like J.D. and Usha Vance, Jivani is the product of a small law school circle revolving around Yale law professor Amy Chua, author of Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother — a book that advocates authoritarian parenting in pursuit of ruthless ambition. Yale's charmed trio from the benighted class of 2013 — all ravenously hungry for power, no matter what prior beliefs they might have held, like their supremely arrogant classmate Vivek Ramaswamy — appear unburdened by personal connections or loyalty to anything other than their own aspirations. Friendship with their transgender Yale law classmate Sofia Nelson, for example, was abandoned as inconvenient by Vance.


	In this way, Jivani's silence about his best friend makes sense. But now that friendship is reaching the true pressure point — for Jivani and for Vance, as it is for Canada and America. History is littered with former friendships undone by the lust for power — most particularly in Europe during the gangster 1930s, as preposterous as the analogy might sound — and so it might be for Jivani as he is forced to confront the reality that his best friend has sworn fealty to a president bent on the destruction of Canada. 


	FOR EXPAT DUAL NATIONALS like me, one of millions of Canadians living mostly invisibly in the United States, Trump's assault on Canada has presented a new and unwanted set of dilemmas. If America's policy is to actively harm my homeland, then what does that say about American society? There are many personal analogies for the U.S.-Canada relationship — a marriage, a friendship, differently sized siblings — but geography is destiny and there is no way to reconfigure that reality. If America First means America Only, then how is it possible to ignore the assault on my history and beliefs and basic sense of decency? Unless it is all Trump's passing fancy, as so many Americans seem to believe, like a narrative in a professional wrestling fantasy — in which case, who are the fools?

	











	For many Canadians, Trump's mystifying admiration for Vladimir Putin takes on sinister dimensions when it is applied to Canada, as Canadian politicians confront the implications of the president's ongoing and seemingly very serious assault on the existence of the nation's sovereignty. The questions multiply: How to strike a deal with a man who breaks his word so easily? How much damage can be done in four years? What are Canadians to make of the appalling lack of allies advocating for Canada inside the American political system? Horror stories of a newly politicized border run rife in Canada, with rumors of the perils of crossing into the United States as tourists raising an unthinkable question: What if America is becoming a permanent menace?


	Or, as we say in Canada, in reply to the admonition to not take Trump literally: seriously?


	THE TERM OF ART in economics is this: Beggar thy neighbor. It is used to describe a predatory approach to global trade: impoverish your neighbor, the theory goes, and thus enrich yourself. The strategy was all the rage during the trade wars of the Great Depression, so that provides a sense of how it has worked historically — including the world war that followed. A variation of the zero-sum game usually ascribed to Trump, the difference is that beggaring thy neighbor requires an active and malicious campaign to harm your otherwise potentially cooperative next-door neighbor — risking the chance of retaliation, but also hazarding lasting disgust and estrangement.


	For Trump, the amorality of this kind of ruthlessness is second nature. Beggaring thy neighbor is standard operating procedure in New York City real estate, with landlords getting rid of rent-control tenants or rival developers by way of relentless wars of attrition: Make your neighbor's life impossible. Don't collect the garbage. Create street noise, hire corrupt lawyers to send harassing letters, make the expense and stress seem not worth the fight — and so force surrender.


	If this deliberately obnoxious thinking is applied geopolitically, Trump's belligerence adds up — and that is precisely what Liberal leader Carney describes as Trump's long-term aim with Canada, a fact that seems to be entirely ignored in the American press, even as it unfolds on a daily basis only a few miles to the north. Attacking Canada's car industry, deriding its high-quality lumber, and devaluing the entire idea of the country as a pointless charade has the cumulative effect of demeaning a nation and a society — supposedly leading to weakness and the fantasy of capitulation.

	











	But in Canada, a nation is at stake, not a prized lot on Fifth Avenue or a casino in Atlantic City. In the last days of April, after a few weeks of blessed silence from Trump — with the Conservative party trying desperately to change the subject to a program of change — the president again casually taunted Canada only days before the vote. Once again, Trump spoke about the country becoming the 51st state — like an old mob boss shrugging and explaining the logic of extortion — assuring Time magazine that he isn't trolling Canada, a fact that Americans seem to find impossible to acknowledge, despite the obvious truth in front of their faces


	The new increasingly contemptible threats issued by Trump are still covered in the press in Canada, now with more of a sense of exhaustion and resignation than fear, but underneath the eye rolls there is the unmistakable sinew of defiance. The shock is gone, replaced by disbelief that a president, now openly described in the Canadian media as a madman, would try to impose his will, despite the obvious lack of any democratic interest in Canada in being annexed. Then there is the inescapable lesson of history, one that apparently will have to be learned again, the hard way: Beggaring thy neighbor, only beggars thyself.


	THE SIGNS OF economic vulnerability are evident in the older, mainly white sections of Oshawa and Bowmanville: the boarded-up storefronts, the mostly idle car plants, the political arguments of pale-faced talking heads on TV about the coming recession. But so are the signs of real vitality, in the acres of new townhouses, rising from apple orchards where I worked as a teenager, populated by people from the world over, the bored young Indian and Filipino kids, trailing behind their parents in the ethnic grocery stores, forming their own memories inside the new reality that is emerging in Canada. For those kids, the reactionary politics and the fears of the disappearing generations behind Trump's America are background noise, like the piped-in Bhangra Muzak.


	“You can feel the transition everywhere,” a kid in Bowmanville's Jamaican Dam Foods store tells me, with evident relief.


	As America retreats into the past — the 1950s, the 1890s, the age of the Founding Fathers, take your pick — what is emerging in Canada has the unmistakable look of the future: Demography will inevitably bring the multifaceted world to North America, like it or not, and the new nation that is emerging north of the border is developing the understanding and tolerance and appreciation of complexity that will be a foundation of the 21st century.

	This week, two of America's closest allies are holding national elections centered largely on Trump's version of aggressive nationalist populism, with both Canada and Australia swinging wildly against far-right reactionaries after experiencing a few months of the president's dystopian chaos. Now, amazingly, decent, tolerant, unassuming but unafraid and unbending Canada — the friend the world never knew it had — stands on the frontline of a threat that confronts humankind. Globalism has become a pejorative term for many in America and around the world, a synonym for godless mind control or the specter of global governance or the horror of being overrun by of hordes of migrants, but in the exurbs east of Toronto, it is emerging in a society quietly but persistently redefining what it means to be a nation — a new identity that transcends nationality.


	After Canada's election on Monday, J.D. Vance's best friend will almost certainly once again have no comment about Donald Trump and J.D. Vance's vision for the future — which might explain why Jivani's chances of victory have decreased rapidly. But Canada will. No matter who wins the election, the vote will have consequences that echo for generations to come. For Canada, there is no turning back. In Canada, Trump's America has never looked so small and sad — a truth that America's best friend sees with clear eyes.

Tom Cruise may often be tagged “the last great movie star” and “the man who saved the film industry” during lockdown but, according to his co-star and friend Kenneth Branagh, he remains “underestimated” in his acting.


Cruise's contribution to filmmaking in the UK is being recognised with a BFI Fellowship – the British Film Institute's highest award for an actor and producer who has brought millions of pounds into the UK with his catalogue of movies made there over the past four decades – from fantasy Legend through Eyes Wide Shut to the recent Mission: Impossible blockbusters.

Branagh, who co-starred with Cruise in the 2008 Valkyrie, told The Times of London newspaper:

	“If he ever tires of wowing the world with action, he's going to surprise those who view him as only a movie star. What he's done with Mission and Top Gun is unique — cinematic entertainment with a serious intent to give you a wonderful time at the movies. But he's an underestimated actor — for whom a golden age of performance beckons.”


	Branagh added that Cruise has enjoyed many an evening in a traditionally British pub, where he enjoys respect from locals but a lack of fuss. Branagh described:


	“He finds a quiet corner, enjoys the atmosphere and is always gracious when he gets spotted. He's a natural giggler and just enjoys what he does so much and that's infectious.”


	On news of receiving the Award from the BFI, which will be accompanied by a month-long showcase of his films, Cruise said:


	“I'm truly honoured. I've been making films in the UK for over 40 years and have no plans to stop.”

David Tennant says he wishes Harry Potter author J.K.Rowling “no ill will”, but there has been “demonization” of the trans community and that he hopes that we “can all as a society just let people be.”


The Guardian newspaper reports that the former Doctor Who star – who appeared in the 2005 film adaptation of Rowling's book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire – gave his opinion of Rowling in answer to questions posed by a group of neurodivergent young adults in ITV's show The Assembly.Tennant said:


	“JK Rowling is a wonderful author who's created brilliant stories, and I wish her no ill will, but I hope that we can all as a society, just let people be. Just get out of people's way.”

	His remarks come after the UK's Supreme Court decreed last week that the terms “woman” and “sex” refer only to biological woman and to biological sex. Rowling reportedly donated £70,000 to Women Scotland who brought the legal case before the court.


	Tennant and Rowling have become two of the highest profile figures in the ongoing debate in the UK over trans rights, with their opposing views often creating headlines. In June 2024, after politician Kemi Badenoch called for a bar on transgender people in single sex spaces, Tennant said publicly she should “shut up;” when Badenoch was later voted leader of her political party, Rowling wrote on X that her “thoughts and prayers” were with Tennant at this difficult time.


	Tennant likened the treatment of transgender people to a policy by the UK government to introduce section 28 – a law introduced in 1988 to prohibit local authorities from promoting homosexuality.


	He said: ““We look back on that now as a medieval, absurd thing to try and say, and I think the way the trans community is being demonised and othered is exactly the same. It's become this kind of political football.”

The 'Saturday Night Live' alum, who's returned to the sketch show to play Elon Musk, has used his time on the air to also support his native country and starred in an ad for Canada's Liberal Party.

	As Mike Myers has returned to Saturday Night Live in recent weeks to play Elon Musk, the Canadian comedian has also used his time on the NBC sketch comedy show to support his native country, particularly as President Trump has imposed tariffs and expressed a desire to make Canada America's 51st state.


	At the end of the March 1 episode, Myers proudly showed off his “Canada Is Not for Sale” T-shirt and mouthed “Elbows up” into the camera, twice. In a subsequent appearance, he sported a “Canadian Tire” shirt during the “goodnights” segment at the end of the episode.

	The initial act of sartorial diplomacy, Myers said, came as he “got angrier and angrier” thinking about Trump's comments and tariffs and acted from his heart.


	“What happened came from my ankles and from my brain and from my heart, and it was not about me — it was about my country,” Myers told The New York Times in a recent interview. “I wanted to send a message home to say that I'm with you, you know.”


	Myers, who's now a U.S. citizen and splits his time between New York and Vermont, said of Trump's moves against Canada, “What's happened has really hurt our feelings. We love America. We love you guys. We don't understand what this madness is. … Americans are the last people you would think would ever be a threat to us.”


	After his SNL advocacy, Myers appeared alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in an ad for Canada's Liberal Party, where the comedian wears a jersey that reads “Never 51.”


	In the hockey rink-set video, Carney notes that Myers lives in the U.S., but the Wayne's World star says he'll “always be Canadian.” The PM then quizzes the comedian on Canadian culture.


	“I wanted it to be like, ‘I know I don't live there anymore, and let's talk about that,'” Myers said of his approach to the ad. “I thought it would be funny if the prime minister of Canada ran an identity test on me.”


	Of Carney, Myers said, “I think he's very reasonable. He's taken a calm, resolute, articulate stance in defense of our sovereignty.”


	As for Musk, Myers said his involvement in the Trump administration, “goes against how I feel as a Canadian.”


	“We don't have a distrust of the government,” he added. “We have a belief in good government.”

	











	And Myers stressed the value of comedy against political extremism.


	“Fascism doesn't like to be ridiculed; it likes to be feared,” he said. “Satire is an important tool in the toolbox to say that this is not normal — that the cuts he's making are not normal.”


	Myers' interview comes ahead of Monday's parliamentary election in which Canadians vote for a new government.

“The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Dorit Kemsley's estranged husband, Paul (PK) Kemsley, was spotted kissing “Amazing Race” season 12 contestant, Shana Wall, outside a restaurant in Beverly Hills on April 25, E! News reported. 

According to her IMDb, Wall is a native Californian who was born on July 27, 1974. As an actress and model, she had bit parts in shows such as “Married… with Children,” “Walker, Texas Ranger,” and “Entourage.”

During her time on “Amazing Race,” she teamed up with her friend Jennifer McCall, and they ended up finishing in 7th place after arguing about using the U-Turn.

Wall told Reality TV World in 2007, “I was approached by one of the casting directors and asked if I wanted to audition for the show. So that was the original way it came about, and then from there we went on and made a tape and did all the auditioning process that everybody else did.”

When asked how her ex-boyfriend Ryan Seacrest felt about her “Amazing Race” stint, Wall said, “His reaction was he was beyond impressed. He said, ‘You did that!? I can't believe you could actually do that! I could never do that! That's unbelievable.' He was really, really, really, really impressed.”

She added, “We're very close. We're close friends. We've known each other for six years. You know we love each other and we're very supportive of each other. We talk probably every day. He's great. He's been very supportive.”

Wall and Seacrest began dating in 2003 and broke up two years later, Us Weekly reported. They were seen together again in 2016.

Although Wall used to be in the entertainment industry, she now works as a professional sommelier. Her LinkedIn profile states that she's certified with the Court of Master Sommeliers and has a culinary degree from the Epicurean School of Culinary Arts in Los Angeles.

Wall regularly posts about food and wine on her Instagram page, which has over 12,000 followers. In August 2024, she shared some cheaper options for champagne and told fans, “If you're like me and you love champagne but you don't love the price tag, I have a little insider tip for you — Crémants.”

“Crémants are French sparkling wines made in the same traditional method as champagne from neighboring regions in France at a fraction of the cost,” she said.

The food and wine expert also used to host a now-defunct YouTube channel called “The Hot Dish: With Shana,” where she posted quick and easy recipes, such as deviled eggs and pesto.

“I paired my pesto with E. Prove, a Vermentino from Corsica. It has a great acidity to lift the pesto, plus a lemon peel note, which lends itself perfectly to the basil, garlic, and cheese. It has a beautiful salinity to it, as well. And the best part? It's under $20!” Wall shared with BestLife.

As each remaining “American Idol” contestant graces the stage on April 27, 2025, hoping to earn enough votes to advance to the top 12, they won't be singing alone. Many fans have noticed the three wildly gifted backup singers who've been supporting the contestants during season 23, even discussing on social media if they could win the show (spoiler alert: they're all too old). 

Judge Carrie Underwood, who won “Idol” in 2005, sang the backup singers' praises during the April 24 episode of her “Idol to Icon” web series, noting, “The musicians, the (background) singers have always been incredible throughout the history of the show (and) still today. Top-notch. None of this could happen without them.” 

So, who's the trio providing harmony and vocal power to so many contestants' performances in 2025? Here's the scoop on the two “Idol” veterans and one newcomer whose voices accentuate every tune. 

A post shared by Felicia Barton (@feliciabarton)

Like Underwood, Felicia Barton knows how it feels to be an “Idol” contestant. According to She made it to the top 36 during season 8, when Kris Allen won the title and Adam Lambert was runner-up. Barton went on to become a songwriter, penning tunes for artists including Demi Lovato, Lea Michelle, and Lauren Alaina, but never stopped finding ways to showcase her own voice. 

When “Dancing With The Stars” asked her to become one of its “principal singers,” she was all in, telling Voyage LA Magazine, “This was something I had dreamed about. All of the sudden, I was singing for millions of people every Monday night. It may not have been the arenas that I imagined, but it was better… because I was home.”

Then, when ABC relaunched “Idol” in 2018, a year after FOX ended its run there, music director Kris Pooley asked Barton to join the show 10 years after she'd been a contestant. She told Voyage LA it was “the ultimate full-circle moment for me.”

In between appearing on her two ABC shows, Barton is busy being a proud “momager” (with a new podcast of the same name!) to her and husband Loren Barton's 18-year-old son Malachi Barton, a Disney Channel star who appeared in the series “Stuck in the Middle and “The Villains of Valley View.” Next up, he co-stars in July's “Zombies 4: Dawn of the Vampires.” 

A post shared by Brandon Winbush (@brandonwinz)

Brandon Winbush is the male voice among the “American Idol” trio of backup singers, and joined the show alongside Barton in 2018. He has repeatedly shared on Instagram how grateful he is to be part of the “Idol” crew, writing in 2023, “I love them with all my heart and they are my family.” 

When Winbush isn't singing his way through “Idol” episodes, he's often serving as backup singer for “Idol” alum Lauren Daigle. He spent much of 2023 and 2024 on tour across Europe and the U.S. with Daigle. 

According to Winbush's X profile, he has served as the Background Vocal Leader for artists including Justin Bieber, Patti LaBelle, and “American Idol” alums Jordin Sparks and Tori Kelly.

A post shared by NORELLE SIMPSON (@norelleiam)

While Barton and Winbush are now in their eighth years as “American Idol” backup singers, Norelle Simpson is in the midst of her first. On April 14, as the Hawaii episodes were airing, she posted a photo with the musicians onstage and expressed her thanks on Instagram.

She wrote, “So happy to be with the American Idol Family for season 8!!!!!!! So much gratitude and love to @krispooley & @feliciabarton for having me with you guys!!!!!! It's a true honor to be under your leadership!!! Thanks for the warm welcome!!! Here's to an amazing season!!!”

Simpson, mom to a 15-year-old son, is no stranger to big stages. In February, the Cleveland native appeared on the Super Bowl twice, singing backup for Cheryl Lee Ralph and Rihanna, according to Fox8 News. She also frequently works with “Idol” artist-in-residence Jelly Roll, including at Stagecoach this weekend, she shared in her Stories. 

The next episodes of “American Idol” air on back-to-back nights — April 27 and 28 at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

Police released excerpts of body camera recordings, surveillance video and audio of 911 dispatch conversations from the incident.


													By
												

	Associated Press



	Los Angeles police have released video from the shooting of author Jillian Lauren, the wife of a Weezer band member, during a chaotic backyard confrontation that culminated in a volley of gunfire.


	Lauren's wounds were not life-threatening in the April 8 shooting in the northeast Los Angeles neighborhood of Eagle Rock, where the 51-year-old wife of Weezer bass player Scott Shriner emerged from her home with a gun as city police and the California Highway Patrol searched the area for three people who fled a car wreck.

	











	Lauren — listed by police as Jillian Lauren Shriner — was released on a $1 million bond on suspicion of attempted murder pending further investigation. She is scheduled to appear in court April 30.


	Police released the excerpts from body camera recordings, surveillance video and audio of 911 dispatch conversations on Friday (April 25). The video clips show officers peering over a high wooden fence into a yard and shouting over the noise of a surveillance helicopter at a woman to put down her gun or risk getting shot. The fence obscures from the cameras what is on the other side.


	“Ma'am, we're trying to help you. Put the gun down,” a voice says. “You're going to get shot. It's the police.”


	An officer indicates that the woman has cocked a gun — “Oh, she racked it” — immediately before the sound of at least six shots rings out. 


	In a separate segment of silent surveillance video from Lauren's backyard, she can be seen exiting the home barefoot and carrying a pistol in her right hand. Another segment shows Lauren from behind, apparently raising a gun that is briefly visible. Dirt kicks up near her feet, and she turns and walks toward a doorway to the house. 


	Further body camera video shows Lauren lying prone in the middle of a residential road as police place handcuffs behind her back, while noting that she has a wound on her arm.


	Lauren's published works include two bestselling memoirs, 2010's Some Girls: My Life in a Harem and 2015's Everything You Ever Wanted.


	Weezer is a Los Angeles-based band, beloved especially for their 1994 record unofficially known as the “Blue Album,” with songs including “Say It Ain't So.” Shriner joined the band in the early 2000s.

Weekend Editor


	With a hometown victory against Charlton Athletic FC at Racecourse Ground, the Wales-hailing Wrexham AFC has cemented its second-tier status — a hopeful stop leading to the coveted Premier League.


	Co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, who star in and executive produce FX's docuseries on the football club's underdog journey, were in attendance at the April 26 game, seen celebrating alongside fellow actor and Reynolds' wife Blake Lively. The 3-0 triumph by the once-fifth-rank Red Dragons is now the team's third such promotion in as many seasons, meaning the club is now in the Sky Bet Championship League. The feat marks the first such entry by Wrexham AFC since the 1981-82 season.

	In a video shared by the Welsh soccer team's X account, the Welcome to Wrexham actors were captured having stormed the pitch alongside fans (despite police warning ahead of kickoff), dumping gallons of Gatorade in celebration. Per the Associated Press,   the raucous audience responded in tandem, lighting flares and proudly waving flags.

	“It just seemed like an impossible dream,” Reynolds told the AP afterward. “We said five years ago our goal was to make it to the Premier League. There were understandably a lot of laughs, but it feels like a thing that could make it to fruition right now.”


	Friends, business partners and fellow actors Reynolds and McElhenney bought Wrexham AFC for $2.5 million back in 2020, with the (then-unlikely) aim of taking the oldest Welsh soccer team (and third-oldest overall) from the National League to the top rank of English soccer. Though the Ted Lasso jokes continue to be apropos, the FX docuseries tracks the real-life dreams and worries of Wrexham, a working class city in North Wales, U.K., as the two Hollywood stars guide the future of its historic club.


	Season 4 of Welcome to Wrexham will premiere May 15 at 9 p.m. ET/PT with two episodes and repeats available via Hulu the next day.

	A chorus line of past presidents from past years showed up via old video to give an edited mash-up speech, but there was no current POTUS, no VP, no roast by a comedian and few Hollywood power players at the White House Correspondents' Dinner tonight in Washington DC.


	Yet, with Donald Trump still yet to make his WHCD debut as president, White House Correspondents' Association president Eugene Daniels had no intention of burying the lede Saturday of the barricades up between the current White House and institutional media in America. “We journalists are a lot of things,“ Daniels exclaimed to a standing ovation in his First Amendment celebrating closing remarks on this 96th day of Trump 2.0. “What we are not is the opposition. What we are not is the enemy of the people, and what we are not is the enemy of the state.”

	Ending the WHCD earlier than in past years, Daniels opened his comments by addressing the elephant not in the Washington Hilton ballroom: “Every year we invite the president to this dinner. For decades, presidents on both sides of the political spectrum get gussied up and join us. I want to be clear about something, we don't invite presidents of the United States to this because it's for them. We don't invite them because we want to cozy up to them or curry favor. We don't only extend invites to the presidents who say they love journalists or who say they are defenders of the First Amendment in a free press. We invite them to remind them that they should be. We invite them to demonstrate that those of us who have chosen the public service of journalism aren't doing it because we love flights on Air Force One or walking into the Oval Office. It is to remind them why a strong Fourth Estate is essential for democracy.”

	Still, while CAA and UTA had parties this weekend as the WHCD hit its 104th anniversary, the so-called Nerd Prom 2025 did lack the usual cadre of Oscar winners, Emmy winners and legion of the deep pocketed Beverly Hills donor class.


	Yes, White Lotus Season 3's Jason Issacs was at the WHCD, as was the OG Wonder Woman Lynda Carter, Emmy winner Alex Borstein and Breaking Bad alum Dean Norris. And yes, the cable, network print and online media elite (including Deadline's DC Bureau chief Ted Johnson) were in the house, along with besieged NYC Mayor Eric Adams.  

	











	Even with short lived ex-White House press secretary Sean Spicer and CNN vet Frank Sesno holding down the fort on the occasionally technically challenged C-SPAN, and MSNBC broadcasting the gathering entrée to dessert with commentary from Molly Jong-Fast and others, the vibe was very low-key. Low-key, but perhaps no less poignant compared to past years, with or without Trump in attendance


	“I know this has been an extremely difficult year for all,” a distinctly understated WHCA boss and MSNBC host Daniels told the well-heeled crowd at the outset of the 2025's WHCD. “It's been difficult for this association. We've been tested, attacked.”


	Certainly Trump 2.0 has seen the WHCA stripped of its pool rotation power, the Associated Press cast out from covering White House events, and the briefing room hierarchy overturned. With the free press and the rule of law under threat from Trump now, the WHCA did itself no favors hiring Amber Ruffin to provide comic relief and then unceremoniously dumping the Have I Got News For You regular. The lack of a muscular public reaction to the AP being under fire from the Trump team has also exposed divisions in the WHCA.


	Still, even with cameras going to Yamiche Alcindor thinking the NBC News reporter was The Grio's April Ryan, tonight was, as Daniels said onstage “just us.” In that excellence and honestly in journalism over the past year was centerstage.


	The award and scholarship portions of the evening began with ABC News' Rachel Scott recognized for her coverage of the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, PA with the Award for Excellence in Presidential News Coverage Under Deadline Pressure. (See the full list of WHCD Award winners here)

👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 https://t.co/PJEv20sLQE


	Looking at the big story standing in front of the media during the last administration, there was a rebuke of journalists covering the Executive Mansion tonight from Axios' Alex Thompson.


	While praising the work of the WHCA, the Constitution and plugging his upcoming book co-written with CNN's Jake Tapper, Aldo Beckman Award for Overall Excellence in White House Coverage winner Thompson noted the declining trust in the media. More specific to the ballroom crowd, Thompson also addressed the failure of many in the room to be honest with themselves and the public about the extent of the “deception” of Joe Biden's cognitive decline and the “cover-up” of the octogenarian 46th POTUS's health by his aides and supporters up until that disastrous debate last year.

.@AlexThomp: "President Biden's decline and its coverup by the people around him is a reminder that every White House regardless of party is capable of deception…We, myself included, missed a lot of this story and some people trust us less because of it." #whcd #nerdprom pic.twitter.com/L9CtbB3HIZ


	Then still a candidate for reelection, President Biden attended and glowingly spoke of the power of a free press in 2024 at the WHCD. Offering kudos to Biden for being a “good man,” SNL Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost was the after-POTUS comedian.


	At the same time, with POTUS just back from Pope Francis' funeral and up at his New Jersey estate, the MAGA crowd this year were holding their own shindig across town at the Willard Hotel. The meet-up was the debut of the Donald Trump Jr. co-founded Executive Branch private club. Unlike the WHCD, Executive Branch's $100,000 membership fee is intended to keep its goings-on far from the eyes of the press.


	In that context, an immediately acclaimed speech by outgoing WHCA leader Daniels summed up the state of the media in America by evoking the months the Wall Street Journal‘s Evan Gershkovich spent behind bars in Russia and added that “attacks on journalists don't stop at our borders.” 

	











	“Every single day, journalists in this country face threats of intimidation, lawsuits and violence,” Daniels said, showing up in many ways as the surprise guest the WHCA had hinted at for the WHCD. “Those attacks are meant to do one thing, stop us from sharing the truth with the people. To our friends at the Associated Press. You have taken on more than you should have to but what you have held firm to from the very beginning is that your fight is not about you. It's about the ability of every single person in this room to make free and independent editorial decisions without government interference.”


	A very public club and proof the WHCD doesn't need a POTUS to own the night in DC.

"It's weird," co-star Jodie Sweetin said of inquiries into this cast dynamic, agreeing with her castmate and co-host on the 'How Rude, Tanneritos!' podcast.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast, THR.com


	A number of Full House viewers likely had crushes on John Stamos, who played Uncle Jesse on the ABC sitcom, but his young co-stars didn't see him that way.


	Speaking on the How Rude, Tanneritos! podcast alongside co-star Jodie Sweetin, Andrea Barber, who played next door neighbor and D.J. Tanner's (Candace Cameron Bure) best friend Kimmy Gibbler, recalled being asked in interviews if she “ever” had “a crush” on Stamos, calling it “a gross question.”




	“No,” she added, going on to say of Stamos and fellow co-star Dave Coulier, who played family friend Joey Gladstone, who also helped raise the Tanner girls alongside widowed dad Danny (Bob Saget), “they're like our older brothers, and we do not think of them that way.”

	Sweetin agreed, adding, “Not even older brothers. They're like my uncles.”


	The moment came up during a game of “Would You Rather” on a recent minisode of Barber and Sweetin's rewatch podcast, as they look back at the two-parter where Jesse and Becky (Lori Loughlin) get married. During the wedding-themed quiz, the co-hosts were asked if they'd rather marry Joey or Jesse, but they found the question to be “weird.”


	“They're like family, and it's weird,” Sweetin said.


	The pair did, however, pick Joey, with Sweetin saying the choice was based on “temperament alone.”


	“There's nothing remotely attractive about this,” Barber added later. “They are just our buddies and, yeah, this is kind of a weird question.”


	After Full House ended in 1995, Sweetin, Barber, Bure and more of the Full House cast reprised their roles in the Netflix reboot Fuller House, which ran from 2016-2020.

	A federal judge filed a preliminary injunction late on Friday that temporarily blocked the Trump administration from removing the bargaining rights of two-thirds of the federal workforce, which was widely considered retaliation against unions for challenging his power. 


	Senior U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman in Washington, D.C. wrote in his order that President Donald Trump's March executive order — where Trump claimed that these labor protections could threaten national security — is “unlawful.” Friedman also wrote that an opinion explaining his reasoning will be issued in a few days. 


	Trump's executive order, which AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler called “the most significant attack on workers' rights in history,” applied to workers at a wide swath of agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Treasury Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services. 

	











	“Certain federal unions have declared war on President Trump's agenda,” the White House said in a statement when it announced the executive order, adding: “The largest federal union describes itself as ‘fighting back' against Trump. It is widely filing grievances to block Trump policies.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In a hearing Wednesday, Friedman read the White House fact sheet on the executive order. “He's willing to be kind to those that work with him, but those that have sued him … he's not going to bargain with,” Friedman said to a Justice Department lawyer. “How else can you read what he's done?”


	Shuler applauded Friedman's injunction. 


	“We commend the court for recognizing the Trump administration's executive order stripping collective bargaining rights for what it was: illegal, retaliatory union-busting,” Shuler said in a statement. “This was the most significant attack on workers' rights in history, and if Trump was allowed to do it to federal workers, he would be able to do it to every worker in America, in every workplace and every industry.”

	Multiple unions filed lawsuits against the executive order. The preliminary injunction filed on Friday is in response to the suit from the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 160,000 federal government employees at 37 federal agencies. The union asked for “emergency relief to protect itself and the workers it represents from this unlawful attempt to eliminate collective bargaining for some two-thirds of the federal workforce.” 

	











	“Today's court order is a victory for federal employees, their union rights, and the American people they serve,” NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in a statement. 


	“The preliminary injunction granted at NTEU's request means the collective bargaining rights of federal employees will remain intact and the administration's illegal agenda to sideline the voices of federal employees and dismantle unions is blocked. NTEU will continue to use every tool available to protect federal employees and the valuable services they provide from these hostile attacks on their jobs, their agencies and their legally protected rights to organize,” she added.


	Another lawsuit, filed in early April by a group of unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees and National Nurses United, claims that Trump is retaliating against the workers for standing up against his widespread firings of the federal workforce and restructuring of the federal government more broadly. 


	The AFGE announced Friday that Trump's executive orders had weakened it to the extent that it is planning on laying off more than half its staff.

	A bipartisan bill, Protect America's Workforce Act, also aims to stop the executive order. 


	“We support efforts to improve government efficiency, but applying sweeping national security exemptions to agencies risks doing more harm than good,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a co-sponsor of the bill, told Federal News Network. “These agencies are vital to public service. Undermining collective bargaining in these spaces weakens morale, accountability and performance.”

The ‘You' star also commended the late actor's “really pure heart” following her death.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Penn Badgley is remembering his late Gossip Girl co-star Michelle Trachtenberg. 


	At the season 5 premiere of You, Badgley told E! News that her death was “really surreal” and “really saddening” while recalling her lively personality. 




	“What I remember of her is she was incredibly quick to laugh,” he said. “She was really joyous. We all have our ups and downs, our lights and shadows, but she had this — I mean, she was mature, but she had this childlike, joyous laugh.”

	The You star admitted that he hadn't crossed paths with Trachtenberg “in over a decade” and didn't want “to claim to have known her well,” but that he'd continue to remember her as a “really pure heart.”

	The Buffy the Vampire Slayer actor died in late February following complications of diabetes mellitus. She was 39.


	Many of Trachtenberg's Gossip Girl co-stars reacted to her death, with Blake Lively recalling the late star as “electricity” in an Instagram Story. Lively wrote, “You knew when she entered a room because the vibration changed. Everything she did, she did 200 percent. She laughed the fullest at someone's joke, she faced authority head on when she felt something was wrong, she cared deeply about her work, she was proud to be a part of this community and industry as painful as it could be sometimes, she was fiercely loyal to her friends and brave for those she loved, she was big and bold and distinctly herself.” 


	Chace Crawford, who played Nate Archibald in the beloved high school drama, also posted an Instagram tribute post where he remembered Trachtenberg as “a force of nature and just so, so unapologetically funny and magnetic.”

 “When he finally settled down and really did a reading, it was just obvious,” Chase recalled in an excerpt via Jason Bailey's new book.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



David Chase wasn't initially sold on James Gandolfini playing Tony Soprano in The Sopranos because he thought he wasn't “threatening enough.” 


	In an excerpt from Jason Bailey's new book Gandolfini: Jim, Tony, and the Life of a Legend, Bailey recounted the casting process for the coveted part. After reading the script for the HBO pilot, Nancy Sanders, one of his Gandolfini's managers, knew he was perfect for the role. 




	“I went, ‘Oh my God, I think I have Tony Soprano,'” she remembered in the excerpt published by Vulture. While the show's creator thought Gandolfini was “brilliant,” he told Sanders he had one doubt in casting him for the part: “I have one concern, and that is, is he threatening enough?”

	The manager was taken aback by his concern and assured him that Gandolfini was surely “threatening enough” to play the mafia mobster. 


	“David, if your only concern is is he threatening enough,” she began. “If you said to me, ‘He's a little chubby,' or ‘He's losing his hair,' I could understand. But he's threatening enough. This is your guy.”


The Hollywood Reporter reached out to reps for Chase and HBO for comment.


	However, Gandolfini also wasn't sure he would land the role and thought that Chase was “going to be a pain in the ass” to work with. “I think my exact words were, ‘I could kick this guy right in the ass, but I'll never get cast,'” he recalled via the novel's excerpt. “‘They'll hire some fucking pretty boy.' I thought they'd hire, you know, one of these Irish-looking guys who are all over TV now.” 


	Chase knew Gandolfini was the perfect choice “when he finally settled down and really did a reading, it was just obvious.” Chase recalled, “There was just not any question about it. He was the guy.”


	Still, they continued to cycle through actors to ensure they had the right Tony Soprano picked out. Ultimately, three people were up for the role — Gandolfini, The Alto Knights star Mike Rispoli and Steven Van Zandt, who later took on the part of Silvio Dante in The Sopranos.

	Like his dual citizenship, Mike Myers is doubling down on his Saturday Night Live “Canada is not for sale” protest.


	In a new interview with the New York Times, the veteran comic and actor — who hails from Toronto, though largely resides in the U.S. — opened up about the reasoning for his political statement, saying it was a message of solidarity for folks back home.


	Myers, who first appeared on SNL to spoof Elon Musk at the beginning of March (since reprising the role twice), did not originally intend to make any sort of remark. However, “I got angrier and angrier,” he recalled, throughout the night while thinking of Musk's quip that “Canada is not a real county” and President Donald Trump‘s “51st state” rhetoric. Thus, during the sketch show's goodnights, Myers' slogan tee — unveiled after he unzipped his vest — was accompanied by the actor mouthing “elbows up,” a reference to Canadian hockey icon Gordie Howe's slogan toward aggressive opponents on the ice.

	“What happened came from my ankles and from my brain and from my heart, and it was not about me — it was about my country,” he told the Gray Lady. “I wanted to send a message home to say that I'm with you, you know.”


	The Austin Powers star added, “What's happened has really hurt our feelings. We love America. We love you guys. We don't understand what this madness is.”


	Since then, Myers appeared in a political spot opposite newly minted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, in which the latter quizzes him on his national identity. At the conclusion of the one-minute advert, Myers is seen with a hockey jersey that reads “Never 51.”


	Speaking more broadly to his parody of Musk, the six-season SNL alum added that the tech CEO's involvement in democratic government “goes against how I feel as a Canadian … [and] belief in good government.”


	“Fascism doesn't like to be ridiculed; it likes to be feared,” he concluded. “Satire is an important tool in the toolbox to say that this is not normal — that the cuts he's making are not normal.”

Content creator and actress Sahiba Bali, who starred in Imtiaz Ali's Chamkila alongside Diljit Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra, recently opened up on Instagram about a chilling paranormal experience in Egypt that left her 'shook' after her gifts mysteriously disappeared overnight.  In the video, the actress showed a table where she had placed souvenirs brought back from Egypt — including dates, pieces of jewellery, a small tomb figurine, and a crystal fragment — and explained how they suddenly went missing.

Sharing the 'freaky' incident, Sahiba took to her Instagram story and was heard saying, "I am not someone who necessarily believes in paranormal activities or ghosts but I do believe in energies and it's so weird. I don't know why I am sharing this but on top of this table (pointing at the table), I kept some gifts that I got from Egypt. There were some dates, jewellery, a tomb and a crystal."

Check out the video:

Further, Bali explained that the tomb symbolised death, and the crystal, which was part of a pyramid also representing death, was placed on the table that night. However, when she woke up the next morning, the items were gone, despite no one entering her room and her never leaving it.

"I kept everything here and the dates and random jewellery is there but the two things that are not there are the tomb and the crystal," added the actress.

A post shared by Sahiba Bali (@sahibabali)

"That is extremely freaky," concluded Sahiba.

On the work front, Sahiba was last seen in the second season of Sudhir Mishra's Tanaav.

Is your knowledge of Pompeii strong enough to withstand our flow of questions?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The ancient Romans were unaware of the massive danger posed by a volcano in their midst, so when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79, thousands of people scrambled to escape several small seaside towns.

As the largest town closest to the volcano, Pompeii suffered the most damage and was essentially wiped off the map. It was rediscovered in the late 16th century, but it wasn't until 1763 that the city was conclusively identified as Pompeii, when the Latin inscription rei publicae Pompeianorum — the state of Pompeii — was discovered at the site. Archaeological excavations at Pompeii continue to this day, with experts finding groundbreaking new information about the people who lived there in the first century and their tragic ends.

THE Vatican should finally reveal the truth about alleged links between UFOs and the church, a top UFO lobbyist has urged.

Steve Bassett, executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, said the "truth is coming" - but it might not be the next Pope who releases any bombshell files. 

Bassett says he believes it is clear the Catholic Church knows about UFOs - and likely has documented evidence hidden in their archives.

He insists "extraordinary" information sits locked away in the Vatican Library - collected from millions of confessions reporting strange sightings or close encounters.

It comes after Pentagon whistleblower David Grusch claimed Italy had uncovered a UFO during Mussolini's reign in 1933.

Following the death of Pope Francis, Bassett revealed whether the next Cardinal could finally fling open the doors to the Vatican's UFO files.

He told The Sun: "Is the Catholic Church going to open the doors to the library so we can start seeing cool stuff? No, they're not gonna do that.

"This is a political matter to be resolved through political action.

“I do not think that the next pope is going to be selected on the fact that he's a pro ET.

"It's got to be the heads of state - and we are very close to that happening."

The remarks come ahead of Pope Francis's funeral, which took place on Saturday following his death at the age of 88.

Cardinals from across the world will soon gather in Rome to elect a successor.

But whoever wears the white cassock next, Bassett believes UFO truth-seekers shouldn't hold their breath for a Vatican revelation.

He claims the church has quietly gathered UFO-related information over centuries.

Bassett said: "Millions of Catholics over the last 800 years bringing every rather unusual encounter they had to the priests... where do you think that information is gonna go? 

"It's going to go straight up to the Vatican.”

But the reason the Vatican won't spill? Because the stakes are too high.

Bassett said: "It is a matter of national security... this is not the Pope's job to come out and say, ‘I can confirm today this is in fact advanced technology non-humans.' That is not a religious-based role."

Instead, Bassett believes President Trump is best positioned to make the move that would rock the world.

"That's why it has to begin with a single head of state, which I believe is going to be Donald Trump,” he said.

"He may be the president that ends this truth embargo, and it will be one of the greatest political legacies of all time for anyone. 

"And if you don't like that, I don't care. This issue is bigger than your political dislikes."

Bassett points to Trump's declassification of JFK files as proof that UFO documents could be next.

“They built a task force," he said.

"The task force said it's going after secrets, and it did. 

"It started getting JFK papers... which means that their commitment to get the other things, such as the UAP stuff, is being well established.”

Last year, whistleblower Grusch told a Congressional hearing that the US possesses fully intact and pieces of "craft" of "non-human origin".

And the former Air Force intelligence officer claimed to NewsNation that Italy had uncovered one of those UFOs in the 1930s. 

He claimed that the then-Pope Pius XII had "backchannelled" it to US president Franklin Roosevelt who "ended up scooping" up the craft.

Bassett said investigation was going to be needed into the claims. 

But it would prove the US government knew about extraterrestrial life long before the famous Roswell incident in 1947, he said.

And he doesn't doubt that Grusch claim could be true.

Basset said years of political groundwork, whistleblower testimony, and growing public interest have created a perfect storm for disclosure – a formal acknowledgement that aliens are real.

"I have never seen a president more likely to act in a much more independent way than President Trump," Bassett said. 

After disclosure, Bassett says the Vatican's role will be to support – not lead – the world through the paradigm shift.

“The Catholic Church can step in and say, ‘God's universe is far greater than we thought. Isn't that wonderful?'" he said. 

"And of course, if you're troubled by any of this, feel free to come to your priest and talk about it."

As preparations get underway to choose the next Pope, Bassett's message is clear: don't look to the balcony at the Vatican for UFO truth – look to Washington.

“The truth is coming,” he said. “We've got to get ready.”

Is Anthony Albanese charismatic? Peter Dutton? Charisma has been linked to electoral victory (just ask Bob Hawke), but defining it can be difficult

For all the gen Z slang that has been thrown around by politicians in recent months, one term has been largely absent from the election campaign: “rizz”. Oxford University Press's 2023 word of the year is defined as “style, charm or attractiveness”; in gen Z parlance it refers specifically to romantic appeal.

On the campaign trail, neither major party leader, thankfully, has deployed the term to cringeworthy effect. But a trait to which rizz is inextricably linked – charisma – has historically been linked to electoral victory.

As a quality, charisma can be difficult to pin down: you know it when you see it, but articulating why someone possesses it is a more difficult endeavour. Bob Hawke, Australia's longest-serving Labor prime minister, had it in spades. As does – depending on who you ask – Barack Obama, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump.

The German sociologist Max Weber is credited for the term charisma in its modern usage, which he defined as an individual “treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers. These as such are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary.”

In the past, Weber's definition has been taken to mean that leaders intrinsically possess a preternatural je ne sais quoi – an interpretation that Alex Haslam, a professor of social and organisational psychology at the University of Queensland, takes issue with. “Actually what he says is: it's about being regarded as having those things,” Haslam says.

Charisma, Haslam argues, is in the eye of the beholder, rather than an innate trait. “Is Anthony Albanese charismatic? Is Peter Dutton charismatic? It depends on who you ask. We treat charisma as if it's a property or a thing that they possess, but it's clearly based on our relationship with them,” he says.

“We perceive people as charismatic to the extent that they represent us, we see them as one of us, we see ourselves in them.”

Michael Platow, a professor of psychology at the Australian National University, agrees. “It's not something that you are born with,” he says. “The idea that there's something about you that was always predestined to get other people to engage with you and follow you is just wrong,” Platow says, referring to the “great man” theory that was popularised by historians in the 19th century, which assumed that leaders innately possessed traits that set them apart from the masses.

In Haslam and Platow's book, The New Psychology of Leadership, co-authored with Prof Stephen Reicher, they characterise charismatic leaders as those who are most successful in creating a sense of shared social identity – a sense of “us-ness”. Leaders must articulate not only their policies to voters, Platow says, but also “a vision of us collectively. Politicians try to place themselves at the centre of that ‘us'.”

Platow cites Trump as an example of charisma being conferred by followers rather than an inherent quality of a leader. “There are a lot of people who think he's their saviour, and … there are millions who don't,” he says. “He's trying to define what America is in particular terms … and he is succeeding in many ways in doing that for a subset of the population.”

One way researchers measure charisma is simply to ask people what they think of someone. “It's subjective,” Platow concedes. “But in the end, voting is subjective.”

Ample evidence supports the idea that charisma is not a fixed, innate trait. Studies show that success contributes to perceptions of charisma. Research has found that for a given description, a business executive is perceived as more charismatic if people are told the performance of their company improved. “If Anthony Albanese were to win this election, then his supporters would perceive him to be much more charismatic,” Haslam says.

A linked phenomenon in politics is the incumbency effect: “If the economy is doing well or if other macroeconomic factors are good, then people like who is currently in office, because they basically attribute the success to that person,” says Lisa Lu, a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales, whose dissertation focuses on leadership and charisma.

Success is only one ingredient in the secret sauce, however. One analysis of five Australian prime ministers from Gough Whitlam to John Howard, based on monthly public opinion polling, found that “Bob Hawke was the only one of the five to exhibit significant charisma; his approval rating was over 10 percentage points higher during his period of office than would otherwise have been expected by his economic or political performance.” Keating, it found, “was the least charismatic, by about the same margin”.

Central to Hawke's public image was that of a quintessentially Australian beer-skolling, sports-loving larrikin. Charismatic leadership has been characterised by some researchers as being grounded in values, “beliefs and symbolism”, as well as emotive and expressive communication. It is unsurprising, then, that a 2020 survey of political scientists and historians ranked Hawke first among Australian prime ministers for “communication effectiveness”, as well as his “relationship with the electorate”. His overall performance as prime minister rated second overall after John Curtin.

“As we move into the election, watch how each candidate defines ‘us', how they position themselves as being the ‘prototypical' Australian,” Platow says. “It's not just kissing babies, it's working at Bunnings selling sausages … it's having a beer at the pub.”

Perceptions of charisma are also bound up in factors an individual cannot change. How tall one is, for example: height is associated with greater charisma in male leaders, and US presidents have been much taller than the average American man. Some studies have found that followers attribute greater charisma to women than men, but Assoc Prof Jessica Flanigan has pointed out that these tracked perceived emotional intelligence rather than overall likability.

The historical dearth of female heads of state is “a product of the fact that we live in a sexist world”, Haslam believes. “When I was growing up, you were presented with almost no plausible female candidates that we were encouraged to perceive as charismatic … I think that's different now.”

Given charisma isn't innate, what should a leader desperate to increase their appeal do? One sure-fire but drastic way is to die. Research co-authored by Haslam studied 48 heads of state who died in office between 2000 and 2013. The study found that the leaders were twice as likely to be described as charismatic in death.

Haslam attributes the effect to a posthumous focus on the leader's social contributions over personal shortcomings. “You can think of all the things they did for us,” he says. “In a way, you get this very pure, undistilled image of them as a group member.”

In life, charisma can be taught, other research suggests. Associate Prof Philippe Jacquart of EM Lyon Business School and Prof John Antonakis of the University of Lausanne have identified nine rhetorical and three non-verbal strategies commonly used by leaders considered charismatic.

Looking at nomination speeches of US Democratic and Republican presidential candidates between 1916 and 2008, they measured use of the verbal strategies – including metaphors, stories and anecdotes, demonstrating moral conviction and sharing sentiments of the collective – as a marker of charisma. The more charismatic candidate, as defined by their model, won 23 out of 24 US presidential elections they studied.

Even a cursory survey of history's autocrats – Hitler and Mussolini among them – and cult leaders like Jim Jones reveals the dark side of charisma. “It's pretty obvious that in toxic groups, where they have those kinds of leaders, that's going to be a problem,” Haslam says.

As Lu says, charisma is “a tool that can be used for good or for bad … even if you can develop it in people, that doesn't necessarily mean everybody should.”
