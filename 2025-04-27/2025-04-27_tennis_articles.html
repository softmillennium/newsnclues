                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daniil Medvedev wasted little time adjusting to match conditions on Sunday at the Mutua Madrid Open, where he delivered a high-quality first performance of the week. The 29-year-old was firing in all departments during his 6-2, 6-2 victory over Argentine qualifier Juan Manuel Cerundolo. “I felt good in practice here, but it's not the same in a match,” said Medvedev after his 62-minute win. “Practice courts are usually a tiny bit different to the centre court. 😲@DaniilMedwed races into the Last 16 in just 62 minutes@MutuaMadridOpen | #MMOpen pic.twitter.com/HM8acmmXSl He will next face American Brandon Nakashima, who earlier moved past Bucharest champion Flavio Cobolli 7-5, 6-3. 126 Cerundolo had notched four wins en route to the third round, and it was the ninth-seeded Medvedev who was fresh and focused throughout their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash. Competing in his first match since the fourth round in Monte-Carlo earlier this month, Medvedev saved the only break point he faced and converted four of the five he created, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Medvedev is this week aiming to complete the set of semi-finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 events, having triumphed at this level on six occasions. victory, Fritz notched his 300th tour-level win, becoming the first active American man — 39th in Open Era — to achieve that feat. Bonzi took an off-court medical timeout at 5-6 in the second set and returned to save four set points in the ensuing game before Fritz converted his fifth opportunity to level the clash. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is sure to be another great day of tennis in the Spanish capital. Paul has been struggling ever since his heartbreaking loss to Zverev in Australia, but he notched a nice win over João Fonseca in his first match here. Khachanov, as always, has been quite inconsistent, capable of great performances but also very disappointing ones. All things considered, it should be a very close match, decided by fine margins. This is pretty much a battle of concepts, with Shapovalov's big, powerful, flashy tennis clashing against De Minaur's unwavering consistency. That said, Shapovalov has been having a good season, showing some signs of progress, and on the fast altitude clay of Madrid he might just put together the level required for an upset here. Like their previous two encounters, both in the last year, this should be a very tight match and it could well go Berrettini's way this time around. All eight WTA Madrid Round of 16 contests are scheduled on what promises to be a thrilling seventh day in the Spanish capital. The remaining WTA Madrid round-of-32 matches will be completed on day six. Eight fantastic third-round matches are scheduled on day five at the ATP Madrid Open. As always, we here at LWOT will predict every match on</p>

Yesterday he did 13 wins out of 15, which is a good number because he plays on a big TV with an unstable connection. He's a pro league, my coach.”How does Suprunov find time to game in between coaching Bublik back up the rankings?“Coaching me is like an hour of day's work,” Bublik insists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former doubles world No 1 Nicolas Mahut assessed that Novak Djokovic has been struggling emotionally and mentally on court after the Serb's second round Madrid Open defeat. The tennis great hit 32 unforced errors and was well below his best in what was his first meeting with Arnaldi, a talented 24-year-old Italian ranked 44th in the world. His other opening match losses came in Doha, Indian Wells and Monte Carlo to Matteo Berrettini, Botic van de Zandschulp and Alejandro Tabilo respectively. Djokovic earned a stunning win over Carlos Alcaraz in the Australian Open quarter-finals before a hamstring injury forced him to retire in his semi-final clash with Alexander Zverev. At the Masters event in Miami, Djokovic claimed five impressive straight-set wins en route to the final, where he was beaten by an inspired Jakub Mensik. Brad Gilbert and Rick Macci share honest takes on Novak Djokovic – ‘Father Time undefeated' Novak Djokovic's latest comments suggest his retirement may come sooner than even he expected “I think it's also emotionally and mentally that Nole hasn't been able to raise the bar, as he most certainly will at Roland Garros,” the Frenchman was quoted as saying by L'Equipe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of Stefanos Tsitsipas and Lorenzo Musetti, who are considered among the best on clay, will miss out. Tiafoe had a rocky start to the season. But everything seemed to fall into place in Houston, where he reached his third successive final (lost to an inspired Jenson Brooksby). Muller, for his part, continues to overachieve in a season that saw him clinch his first ATP title in Hong Kong and a maiden final at the ATP 500 level in Rio. Tiafoe's flair and athletic ability on any surface are undeniable, but he can quickly become erratic. Muller is a player capable of exploiting the American's lapses in focus. Arnaldi earned his second career Top 5 win by defeating former champion Novak Djokovic to secure an unlikely berth in the third round. His run is extremely impressive, having defeated an in-form Borna Coric in the opening round. Although not quite of the same magnitude, Dzumhur also pulled off a statement in the second round, toppling clay-court specialist Sebastian Baez in three sets. He tallied just seven main draw wins before Madrid. A pair of comeback wins this week have rekindled his belief, and he's still hanging around in the draw. The Canadian is making the most of his lucky loser entry with a couple of solid main draw wins against Zizou Bergs and Kamil Majchrzak. Form is only temporary, and Norrie's experience on this surface will be a valuable asset for him to navigate a potentially tricky opponent. Tsitsipas lost his perfect record against Musetti at the Monte Carlo Masters. Although his dominance in this matchup cannot be understated, the Italian ran him close in each of the previous four meetings on clay. However, an inconsistent start to the European clay swing and a back injury he sustained in Barcelona could halt his progress in Madrid. The remaining WTA Madrid round-of-32 matches will be completed on day six. Eight fantastic third-round matches are scheduled on day five at the ATP Madrid Open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest of those came against Arnaldi, but Djokovic claimed Madrid was different to Monte Carlo and some other recent tournaments. There is now becoming increased concern for Djokovic, who has cast doubt over his future and left question marks over whether he will ever play at the Madrid Open again. Grand Slam titles are Djokovic's priority, which is something that the 37-year-old has been very clear about over recent years. The upcoming major is Roland Garros, where Djokovic is a three-time champion, and he spoke in his post-match press conference about where he sees himself in the pecking order. “Well, I mean, look, pressure is part of the sport and part of what we do on this highest level, so it's never going to go away, you know, it's just different kind of pressure,” explained Djokovic. Grand Slam, I'm not going into Roland Garros as one of the main favorites. Maybe that can help, I don't know, we'll see.” Last year, Djokovic withdrew from his Roland Garros quarter-final due to a meniscus tear in his right knee that he later underwent surgery on. There is not long until the second major tournament of 2025, where Djokovic will be bidding for a 25th Grand Slam title. Before then Djokovic is expected to head to Rome, where he is a six-time former champion, with only the now retired Rafael Nadal winning more titles in the Italian capital. Djokovic and coach Andy Murray will now head to the Italian Open, with main draw action beginning on Wednesday May 7.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arnaldi beat fourth seed Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 to reach the third round. Djokovic, who has been chasing a 100th tour-level title, was handed a shock defeat in the Miami Open final in late March before his second-round Monte Carlo exit earlier this month. All three defeats came in straight sets. "Obviously, after you lose a match, you don't feel good, but I've had a few of these this year where I lose in the first round, unfortunately," Djokovic told a press conference. "I think the positive thing is that I really enjoyed myself more than I have in the Monte-Carlo or some other tournament, so that's a good thing. "But obviously, still level of tennis is not where I would like it to be. Djokovic, who made his Madrid debut in 2006 and won the tournament in 2011, 2016 and 2019, was looking for his first win on clay since defeating Carlos Alcaraz to win gold at the Paris Olympics. Asked whether he just played his last match in Madrid, Djokovic said: "It could be. Djokovic won three out of the four major titles in 2023 but has not been able to reproduce that kind of form since, being shut out of the game's biggest tournaments last year as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz claimed majors apiece. "(It's) kind of a new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament," Djokovic added. "It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it's kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kinds of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments. The former world number one owns ATP Masters 1000 records for most wins (414), semi-finals (79), finals (60) and titles (40).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic has made it no secret that his main focus is on the Grand Slam tournaments as he enters the latter years of his career. He doubled down on his comments after arriving in Madrid for the Masters 1000 event. And fans believe the drought will continue at Roland Garros. Djokovic has remained clear about his goals on the clay. That's it,” he said with a smile after losing his opening match at the Monte-Carlo Masters earlier this month. But Express Sport readers aren't convinced, as a staggering 82 per cent claimed Djokovic would not achieve his goal of winning the French Open this year. While Djokovic has made it clear that the French Open is his goal, he also agrees that he won't be one of the title favourites this year, though he hopes it can work in his favour. After losing his opening match in Madrid on Saturday, he said: “I'm not going into Roland Garros as one of the main favourites. Maybe that can help, I don't know, we'll see.” 5 has three Roland Garros trophies under his belt, coming out on top in 2016, 2021 and 2023. His title defence ended abruptly last year when he picked up a knee injury and pulled out ahead of the quarter-final to undergo surgery. Djokovic is also hunting two huge milestones - his 25th Major and his 100th career title - and could kill two birds with one stone in Paris. “If you tell me I'll win a 100th title in any of the Slams this year, I'll sign right away, no problem,” he said earlier this month. “But it's a big mountain to climb, so I've got to be a bit more humble about it and hope for the best.” He will turn 38 next month, before the French Open begins, and it will be a big ask for his body to hold up over seven best-of-five-set matches. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Djokovic did everything possible to be ready for the semis against Alexander Zverev but had to retire after losing the first set in a tiebreak. But the Serb will be full of confidence when he returns to Stade Roland Garros next month, as he is on a six-match winning streak at the venue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz is just a few days shy of his 22nd birthday but already has a career many players would envy. The Spaniard has lifted four Grand Slam titles and is a former world No. While other players may showcase their silverware in museums or facilities, Alcaraz prefers to keep his Major trophies under his nose in their two-storey flat. 3 has given an insight into his life in a new Netflix docuseries, revealing that his cups are proudly displayed across his bedroom and living room. Alcaraz was just 19 when he won his first Grand Slam title at the US Open, also becoming the world No. And he still sleeps underneath the handcrafted Tiffany & Co. trophy, which sits atop a shelf in his small bedroom. “This is where I sleep, this is my bedroom,” Alcaraz says in his new Netflix series, walking into a modest room with a bed, shelves full of trainers, a stack of tennis accreditations, and an assortment of trophies. “After each tournament, this is my place. Here I have my hobby, something I love, which is sneakers, as you can see. “And for people that ask, ‘Where do you keep your trophies?' This one is from the 2022 US Open. Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. Alcaraz won his second Major title at Wimbledon in 2023, beating seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in a thrilling five-set final. This one is awesome,” he smiled, showing off his hardware before reading out the list of champions who came before him. Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray had a 20-year stronghold on the title before Alcaraz ended their reign in 2023. He added: “And suddenly here I am, you know? It's like, what the hell is going on.” This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. 3 has since added to his haul at home. Alcaraz came from two sets to one down to beat Alexander Zverev in the Roland Garros final. It was a much easier path to the title for Alcaraz, who defeated the Serb in straight sets. But Alcaraz's preparations have taken a hit as he was forced to withdraw from this week's Madrid Open with adductor and hamstring issues.
