                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia has continued its assault on Ukraine with a series of drone attacks and airstrikes, hours after Donald Trump cast doubt on Vladimir Putin's readiness to end the conflict. Three people were killed and four wounded on Sunday morning in airstrikes on Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region, according to the regional prosecutor's office. He was speaking after what was described in diplomatic circles as a potentially historic meeting between Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the US president, albeit only a 15-minute conversation, on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday. In a social media post sent during his flight back to the US afterwards, Trump suggested Russia was not committed to negotiating a ceasefire. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” he wrote. Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Russia would not stop targeting sites used by the Ukrainian military, including those involving European contributions to aid Kyiv or connected to foreign fighting forces. He claimed in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation that a residential building in Kyiv last week, which was hit by a Russian missile killing at least 12 people, had not been an “absolutely civilian” target. Zelenskyy denied Moscow's claims made on Saturday that Ukraine's army had been forced out of Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine's army has dismissed as “propaganda tricks” Russia's claims to have carried out the “full liberation” of the Kursk region, where Ukraine made considerable gains during a surprise offensive in August 2024. He said increased pressure on Moscow could bring more opportunities for “real diplomacy”. In Moscow, a man suspected of killing a Russian general in a car bomb explosion on Friday has said he was paid by the Ukrainian security service to carry out the deed, according to Russian authorities who said he had pleaded guilty to terrorism charges. Ignat Kuzin said he had received payment from Ukraine for killing Lt Gen Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the general staff of the Russian armed forces, who died just outside Moscow on Friday after a car bomb exploded as he was walking past. Asked in his Sunday appearance on NBC's Meet the Press about possible concessions to Russia, Rubio stressed the need to be “grownups and realistic”. “There is no military solution to this war.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iranian authorities have not said what caused the massive explosion at the port of Bandar Abbas on Saturday, killing at least 40 people, amid unconfirmed reports of the possible presence of a chemical used to make missile propellant. Eyewitness accounts and video indicate chemicals in an area of shipping containers caught fire, setting off a much larger explosion. One surveillance video distributed by the Fars news agency shows a small fire beginning among containers, with a number of workers moving away from the scene, before a huge explosion ends the video feed. About 80% of the fires had been contained, Iranian state media reported earlier. CNN has previously reported that hundreds of tons of a critical chemical for fueling Iran's ballistic missile program arrived at the port in February. Another shipment is reported to have arrived in March. Iranian officials have denied that any military material was held at the port. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian arrived in Bandar Abbas on Sunday afternoon to investigate the situation and oversee relief efforts, according to state media. The president also met with those injured in yesterday's blast. “We have to find out why it happened,” Pezeshkian said at a meeting with officials aired by Iranian state television. The region's governor, Mohammad Ashouri, declared three days of mourning. Videos and images from the scene, some of which have been geolocated by CNN, show orange-brown smoke rising from part of the port where containers were stacked. The New York Times reported Sunday that a person “with ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said that what exploded was sodium perchlorate, a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters.” Other experts suggested more mundane chemicals might explain the huge blast. “This bears the hallmarks of an ammonium nitrate explosion. Ammonium nitrate is a commodity chemical that is widely used as a fertilizer and as an industrial explosive, but it is well known that poor storage can significantly raise the risk of an explosion in the event of a fire.” said Andrea Sella, a professor of chemistry at University College London. In February CNN reported that the first of two vessels carrying 1,000 tons of a Chinese-made chemical that could be a key component in fuel for Iran's military missile program had anchored outside Bandar Abbas. Sodium perchlorate could allow for the production of sufficient propellant for some 260 solid rocket motors for Iran's Kheibar Shekan missiles or 200 of the Haj Qasem ballistic missiles, according to the intelligence sources. The Chinese Foreign Ministry told CNN in February that “China has consistently abided by export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations,” adding that “sodium perchlorate is not a controlled item by China, and its export would be considered normal trade.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the victims of the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, on Sunday, condemning the loss of lives and reiterating New Delhi's commitment to punish the perpetrators. Speaking on the radio show Mann Ki Baat, the country's leader started by expressing deep anguish over the slaughter, in which 26 tourists were gunned down while visiting a popular picnic spot on April 22. Speaking in English – somewhat rare for him – he vowed that India would identify, trace, and punish every terrorist and their supporters. “Today, as I talk my heart out with you, there is a deep agony in my heart. The Pahalgam terrorist attack of 22 April has left every citizen of the country heartbroken. No matter which state one belongs to, no matter which language one speaks, I understand every citizen is seething with anger after seeing the images of the terrorist attack,” Modi said. The prime minister said the attack occurred at a time when peace, economic revival, and democracy were returning to Kashmir, and that the terrorists and their masterminds wanted to destroy the region once again. It has experienced relative stability in recent years, with the local economy improving due to increased tourist inflow. Once again, I assure the victims' families that they will get justice. India has linked Pakistan to the fatal attack, accusing its neighbor of “support for cross-border terrorism” – a long-standing claim New Delhi has made in various international forums. In response to the attack, India suspended the significant Indus Waters Treaty, expelled Pakistani diplomats, closed its land border, and suspended visas for Pakistani citizens, effectively ordering them to leave Indian soil within a few days. Meanwhile, Indian security analysts suggested the government could be weighing various military options in retaliation. Islamabad has denied involvement and announced tit-for-tat countermeasures. It also warned that if India follows through on its threat to block rivers, it would take this as “an act of war.” The Indus Waters Treaty governs the shared waters of one of the world's biggest river systems, which affects millions of lives in both countries. India has never suspended the treaty before, even in times of open conflict. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘The Chinese will see this high tariff level is unsustainable for their business,' says Scott Bessent The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said “there is a path” to an agreement with China over tariffs after he had interactions with his Chinese counterparts last week in Washington. “I had interaction with my Chinese counterparts, but it was more on the traditional things like financial stability, global economic early warnings,” Bessent told ABC News's This Week on Sunday, explaining that he spoke to the Chinese during International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington. On Friday, Donald Trump asserted in an interview that tariff negotiations were under way with China, comments he repeated on his way to Rome to attend the funeral of Pope Francis, but were later denied by China's foreign ministry, which said the US “should stop creating confusion”. A day later, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, said Beijing abides by international rules on US-imposed tariffs and would seek solidarity with other countries. “Certain countries adhere to their own priorities, engage in bullying pressure and coercive transactions, and provoke trade wars for no reason, exposing their extreme egoism,” Wang said on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Kazakhstan. “The Chinese will see this high tariff level is unsustainable for their business,” he said. “We have a process in place, and, again, I just believe these Chinese tariffs are unsustainable. Then I think there can be an agreement in principle, these 17 or 18 important trade deals that we're negotiating.” But Bessent warned that “a trade deal can take months” and said negotiations with other significant US trading partners were progressing. And nobody's better at creating this leverage than President Trump.” The treasury secretary's comments come as top US retailers have reportedly warned the White House that tariffs will cause empty store shelves and price hikes within weeks. Bloomberg reported that Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein raised US prices of its products from dresses to kitchenware on Friday ahead of imminent tariffs on small parcels. “Every day we are in conversation with China, along with those other 99, 100 countries that have come to the table,” Rollins said on CNN's State of the Union. Rollins said the president was prepared to bail out American farmers if the trade war continues squeezing commodity exports, particularly soybean and pork sales to China.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global finance leaders came to Washington this past week seeking clarity on what it would take to get some relief from US President Donald Trump's multi-layered tariff assault and on just how much pain it will bring to the world economy. Many participants in the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings had a sense that Trump's administration was still conflicted in its demands from trading partners hit with his sweeping tariffs. During the whirlwind week, many finance and trade ministers sought to meet with US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent and other key Trump administration officials, to no avail. We are just presenting, discussing the economy," said Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski. Warnings that the tariffs — 25 percent on all US imports of vehicles, steel and aluminum and currently 10 percent for most everything else — would cause painful damage to the US and other major economies went largely unheeded by US officials. Specific currency targets for the Japanese yen were not discussed, but both countries' currency policies are expected to be part of future talks as the US sees currency weakness against the US dollar as a nontariff barrier to American exports. The IMF took a slightly more optimistic view of the economic fallout from the highest US tariffs in more than a century, slashing growth forecasts for most countries in its World Economic Outlook but stopping far short of predicting recessions — even for the US and export-dependent China, which now faces US tariffs of 145 percent on many goods. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva acknowledged that member countries were anxious about the uncertainty shock to a global economy buffeted by pandemic, inflation and wars but held out hope that trade negotiations would ease the tariff strains. "We recognize that there is work under way to resolve trade disputes and reduce uncertainty," Georgieva told reporters. Several finance officials told Reuters that odds of recession were higher than the IMF's 37 percent chance, citing private sector forecasts. Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, a faith-based nonprofit group advocating debt relief, said that the IMF's forecasts were clearly aimed at preventing market panic, even as officials in private meetings expressed concerns about new debt crises emerging. "It was a do-nothing kind of week," LeCompte said, adding that debt discussions were inconclusive and overshadowed by tariff talks. Policymakers did breathe a sigh of relief when Bessent expressed US support for the IMF and the World Bank, declaring that they have "enduring value" but criticizing their "mission creep" into climate, gender and equality issues. Rather than withdrawing from the institutions as prescribed by the Project 2025 Republican policy manifesto, Bessent said he wanted to refocus them on their core missions of economic stability and development, with expanded World Bank energy financing options and an end to China loans. Participants at the meetings, along with financial markets, were encouraged by Bessent's comments early last week that triple-digit US tariffs on Chinese goods and vice versa were unsustainable, suggesting that a deal to ease them could be reached soon. But China denied Trump's assertions that tariff negotiations were under way with Beijing, adding to the week's confusion over his tariffs and offering little reassurance to country delegations. "I think most people left here bracing for things to get worse from an economic perspective," said Josh Lipsky, a former IMF adviser who is now senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center. "The broad picture, when you step back, is very concerning." While the US economy is too big to ignore the US dollar for now, trading partners will try to seek alternatives unless that trust is repaired, he added. Intel Corp chief executive officer Lip-Bu Tan (陳立武) is expected to meet with Taiwanese suppliers next month in conjunction with the opening of the Computex Taipei trade show, supply chain sources said on Monday. Application-specific integrated circuit designer Faraday Technology Corp (智原) yesterday said that although revenue this quarter would decline 30 percent from last quarter, it retained its full-year forecast of revenue growth of 100 percent. The company is still confident about its revenue growth this year, given its strong “design-win” — or the projects it won to help customers design their chips, Faraday president Steve Wang (王國雍) told an online earnings conference. Quanta Computer Inc (廣達) chairman Barry Lam (林百里) is expected to share his views about the artificial intelligence (AI) industry's prospects during his speech at the company's 37th anniversary ceremony, as AI servers have become a new growth engine for the equipment manufacturing service provider. The company reported a 30 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated revenue to NT$1.41 trillion (US$43.35 billion) last year, thanks to fast-growing demand for servers, especially those with AI capabilities. The company told investors in November last year that Power supply and electronic components maker Delta Electronics Inc (台達電) yesterday said it plans to ship its new 1 megawatt charging systems for electric trucks and buses in the first half of next year at the earliest. “If everything goes smoothly, we could begin shipping those new charging systems as early as in the first half of next year,” a company official said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>

DOHA, April 27. /TASS/. Qatar and Saudi Arabia have undertaken to repay Syria's debts to the World Bank Group amounting to $15 million, according to their joint statement cited by the Saudi Press Agency.

"In continuation of the ongoing efforts by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Qatar to support and accelerate the recovery of the Syrian Arab Republic's economy, and in light of recent discussions held during the High-level Roundtable on Syria on the margin of the 2025 WBG/IMF Spring Meetings, the ministries of finance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Qatar jointly announce their commitment to settle Syria's outstanding arrears to the World Bank Group, totaling around $15 million," the agency said.

According to the statement, this commitment "will pave the way for the World Bank Group to resume support and operations in Syria after a suspension of more than 14 years."

Apart from that, Riyadh and Doha called on international and regional financial institution to "promptly resume and expand their development engagement in Syria."

World Bank officials visited Damascus on April 14 to discuss the potential resumption of financing to ensure the restoration of the energy infrastructure and payments in the public sector. Syrian Finance Minister Mohammad Yusr Barnieh‘s meeting with the WB delegation was the first public contact between the sides in recent years. On the same day, Reuters said, citing its sources, that Saudi Arabia may settle Syria's arrears to the World Bank Group, opening the way for international assistance to the country's restoration efforts.</p>

Videos and images from the scene, some of which have been geolocated by CNN, show orange-brown smoke rising from part of the port where containers were stacked. The New York Times reported Sunday that a person “with ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said that what exploded was sodium perchlorate, a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters.” Other experts suggested more mundane chemicals might explain the huge blast. “This bears the hallmarks of an ammonium nitrate explosion. Ammonium nitrate is a commodity chemical that is widely used as a fertilizer and as an industrial explosive, but it is well known that poor storage can significantly raise the risk of an explosion in the event of a fire.” said Andrea Sella, a professor of chemistry at University College London. In February CNN reported that the first of two vessels carrying 1,000 tons of a Chinese-made chemical that could be a key component in fuel for Iran's military missile program had anchored outside Bandar Abbas. Sodium perchlorate could allow for the production of sufficient propellant for some 260 solid rocket motors for Iran's Kheibar Shekan missiles or 200 of the Haj Qasem ballistic missiles, according to the intelligence sources. The Chinese Foreign Ministry told CNN in February that “China has consistently abided by export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations,” adding that “sodium perchlorate is not a controlled item by China, and its export would be considered normal trade.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be among the first to get it. Acting commander of Russia's 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin that "scattered groups and individual soldiers" of the Ukrainian Armed Forces fighting in the Kursk region "will soon be destroyed," Russian government-controlled RIA Novosti reported on April 27. The statement, contradicts an earlier report by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov that Russian forces have fully recaptured the territory of Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region partially held by Ukraine since last August. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, fighting in Kursk Oblast continues. "Our troops continue active defensive operations in designated areas of the Kursk and Belgorod regions," Zelensky reported on April 27, acknowledging that the heaviest fighting is taking place in Kursk and Donetsk oblasts. "Ukrainian defensive operations in certain areas of Kursk Oblast continue," Ukraine's General Staff said on April 26, adding that Kyiv's forces repelled five Russian ground assaults in the area on April 26. "The situation is difficult, but our units continue to hold certain positions and carry out tasks as assigned," the statement read, noting that there is no threat of encirclement. Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. Russia launched a push to recapture the region in early March, with Ukraine being forced to pull back from much of the initially taken territory, including the town of Sudzha. Kyiv and Seoul have previously said that North Korea has dispatched around 11,000 troops to Kursk Oblast, though Moscow has not openly confirmed this until now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Health care workers know from experience that only organizing will lead to enforceable standards and better conditions. Health care workers know from experience that only organizing will lead to enforceable standards and better conditions. “It's scary,” says Tatiana Mukhtar, a nurse in New Orleans. The exposure during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic “was horrific, for patients and for health care workers” she says, “and having been there and having experienced that, I feel like we have learned nothing because [health care systems] are still not doing what we need to do.” This has also been the most dangerous flu season in 15 years, with up to 92,000 people dying of the flu between October 1, 2024 and mid-February this year. Meanwhile, with the threat of a bird flu outbreak among humans also looming on the horizon, the Trump administration is eliminating what Mary Bowman, a nursing assistant professor, refers to as our “already meager public health infrastructure.” “We had to fight for everything, you know, every bit of PPE [personal protective equipment] and precautions,” echoes Nick Shillingford, a nurse and former union steward who is unaffiliated with NNU. Mukhtar, a member of NNU, told Truthout that despite nurses' successful fights for access to adequate PPE in 2020, there are no N95 masks available in her unit now. Finding an N95 in the hospital “is like pulling teeth,” she says. Mukhtar's experiences are echoed by NNU's national survey from Fall 2024, which shows that almost 20 percent of nurses surveyed are still forced to reuse N95s designed for single use, even now that there is no legitimate excuse for hospitals not to stockpile adequate PPE. In the same survey, only 37.1 percent of registered nurses said that patients are screened for COVID, TB, respiratory syncytial virus or flu when they arrive. Without screening, it's likely that contagious patients are spending significant time around both workers and other patients without being isolated or asked to mask. Nurses repeatedly mentioned to Truthout that in the places they work, even the insufficient infectious disease protocol is generally not practiced until after a test comes back positive, meaning that workers may have already interacted closely with someone in a room for several days before any precautions are instituted. Mukhtar said that in her hospital, patients on such protocols, like those with TB and COVID, are allowed to leave their rooms unmasked and move throughout the hospital. Nurses have not forgotten the trauma of the early pandemic, and many health care workers are frustrated at having to continue to fight for basics. Part of the lack of precautions around COVID and other contagious diseases goes back to a decades-old distinction between “droplet” and “airborne” pathogens. This standard, which most working professionals today have been drilled on, holds that most contagious illness is spread via droplets that are too large and heavy to spend much time in the air. Several health care workers who spoke with Truthout expressed frustration that their workplaces enforced “handwashing audits” that monitored how consistently staff washed their hands before and after contact with patients while simultaneously not enforcing any kind of masking standard. In reality, there is no such clear binary between “droplet spread” and “aerosols.” Pathogens are better thought of as on a continuum between the two, Thomason says, with many more viruses than previously thought spreading via small particles in the air rather than in droplets. Getting hospital administrators to implement policies based on this shift in understanding, however, has been difficult. Masking is unpopular across the U.S., with only 4 percent of people masking regularly and many people expressing “pandemic fatigue.” Health care workers who do mask all the time at work have disclosed some frustration with their colleagues' indifference regarding the need for universal respirator usage. Letting workers argue with each other about masks rather than implementing a policy, though, is part of a tried-and-true tactic of employers everywhere, says Thomason: Let bad conditions drive stress and conflict between workers in ways that divide them so it's harder for workers to collectively organize against management. “Care workers are already balancing on the blade of a knife in terms of wanting to be there and having what they need to do their jobs well,” Bowman says. “So asking them to do one more thing while still not providing the actual resources or staffing that they need to do their job well and prevent infection would be a problem.” In other words, the health care system should not assume new diseases or new strains are not very contagious or only spread in large droplets until proven otherwise, but rather the opposite: Until more is known, the highest level of precautions should be taken. Several nurses that spoke to Truthout described being told not to wear masks in March 2020 as COVID ripped through the United States because masks would supposedly “scare the patients.” Still, many nurses are continuing to wear high-quality masks and doing their best to protect themselves and their patients even as they describe a near total lack of COVID or airborne infection protocols where they work. These workers continue to advocate for more robust masking and control of infectious diseases, including COVID. Alex wears a respirator at work every day and keeps extra masks to share with patients or colleagues. Measures beyond that, he says, are “just such a hard push and pull, you know, like what battles to fight.” And I'm willing to be inconvenienced or made slightly physically uncomfortable,” Bowman says. Mukhtar is organizing with other nurses at her New Orleans hospital for their first collective bargaining contract. Alongside safe staffing, she hopes for easy access to N95 masks on her unit and stronger isolation protocols. … We are trying to have a seat at the table so that way we can make the best decisions possible for us and for our patients.” Nationally, NNU has been pushing for a permanent OSHA standard to improve infectious disease controls, as well as fighting back against the Trump administration's cuts to public health agencies and withdrawal from the World Health Organization. We saw fit testing, saw access to respirators, things that actually saved people's lives.” Thomason says that standard was supposed to be a temporary fix while a permanent one was developed, but it was allowed to expire while work on the permanent standard dragged on. Nurses say they wish their bosses would just “do the right thing,” but they know from experience that only organizing will result in enforceable standards and better conditions. The health care system is where many people end up in some of their most vulnerable moments — meaning that whatever nurses and other health care workers do to increase their own safety at work is a win for everyone. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ultimate Fighting Championship, the world's leading mixed martial arts organization, never stopped working with Russian fighters despite international tensions, UFC president Dana White has said. At the post-fight press conference following UFC on ESPN 66 in Kansas City, a reporter asked White about comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin's aide, Kirill Dmitriev, that talks were ongoing to bring UFC events back to Russia. White stressed that Russian athletes have always remained active in the UFC throughout periods of political tension and international sanctions. Earlier in April, Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's special representative for investment and economic cooperation, said efforts were underway to bring UFC tournaments back to Russia. Dmitriev, who is also CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has emerged as a key figure in recent Russia-US diplomatic engagements, particularly concerning the conflict in Ukraine. His announcement regarding the UFC came after a meeting with Steve Witkoff, special envoy for US President Donald Trump, in St. Petersburg. Since 2018, RDIF has partnered with UFC Russia to promote mixed martial arts in the country. Earlier this year, Dmitriev urged Russian fans to stay optimistic about the UFC's return following Magomed Ankalaev's victory at UFC 313, where he became the first Russian fighter to win the UFC light heavyweight title. White had previously indicated that a full UFC return to Russia could depend on improved diplomatic relations. In 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from global competitions, but leading promotions such as UFC, Bellator, and One FC did not enforce the recommendation. Despite international sanctions imposed on Moscow after the escalation of Ukraine conflict, Russian fighters have continued to compete in major mixed martial arts (MMA) organizations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces operating NASAMS air defense systems downed 11 Russian cruise missiles in less than two minutes during a mass aerial attack, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Kyrylo Peretyatko said in a video published on April 27. "We probably broke all records of other countries for reload speed, and we are ready to keep doing it constantly to defend our country, as long as we have the missiles," he said. "In one air defense battle, we shot down 11 cruise missiles. The operation lasted no more than two minutes," Peretyatko said. The NASAMS system, which has a maximum range of 50 kilometers depending on the model used, is particularly valuable for Ukraine as it uses the AIM-120 AMRAAM interceptor missile, which is the same missile used in air-to-air function in Western fighter jets. Kyiv has consistently urged Western allies to expand air defense assistance, with President Volodymyr Zelensky even offering to buy Patriot air defense systems from the U.S., warning that existing systems are insufficient. While Ukraine presses for an unconditional ceasefire, in line with proposals from the U.S., Russia continues to reject the terms. It has reportedly intensified its aerial campaign and offensive operations across the front line. Over the past week, the Ukrainian air force downed 442 Russian Shahed kamikaze drones and over 230 other attack drones, as well as 31 Kh-101/Kh-55SM cruise missiles, seven Iskander ballistic missiles, six Kalibr cruise missiles, and four Kh-59/Kh-69 guided air-launched missiles, the Air Force reported on April 27. Apart from the front-line areas, Russian attacks targeted cities all over Ukraine, with a mass drone and missile attack on Kyiv overnight on April 24 killing 12 people and injuring 90, including children.</p>

Here's a look at what we know so far. At a Sunday morning press conference, the Vancouver Police Department said it has confirmed 11 people were killed. “We believe dozens more are injured, some seriously, and the number of dead could rise in the coming days or weeks,” said Interim Vancouver Police Chief Steve Rai. Two nearby hospitals declared a “Code Orange” late Saturday night, signifying mass casualty protocols were undertaken. The chief said the driver has “a significant history of interactions with police and healthcare professionals related to mental health.” He said the man is not yet being identified, as charges have not been laid. Police said early Sunday morning they are “confident that this incident was not an act of terrorism.” Some witnesses said the barriers had at times during the day not been in place to allow vendors and performers to pass through. Further details about the victims and the conditions of those who were injured will be released once all have been identified and their families contacted, Interim Chief Rai said.

MOSCOW, April 27. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian over the aftermath of the explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port.

"Please accept my deepest condolences over the loss of life and the massive destruction caused by the explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port. Please convey my sincere sympathy and support to the families and friends of the victims, as well as wishes for a speedy recovery to all those injured," the telegram published on the Kremlin website reads.

The President also expressed Russia's readiness to assist in eliminating the aftermath of the tragedy.

On Saturday, April 26, a powerful explosion occurred in the port of Shahid Rajaee, located in the city of Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf. According to the latest data, 25 people were killed and almost 1,400 were injured. The cause of the explosion was not officially announced. According to The New York Times, sodium perchlorate, which is used in solid rocket fuel, may have detonated in the port.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eleven people are dead after an SUV barreled through a large Filipino street festival in Vancouver Saturday evening, in what Vancouver Police Department Interim Chief Steve Rai has called “the darkest day in our city's history.” “We believe dozens more are injured, some seriously, and the number of dead could rise in the coming days or weeks,” Mr. Rai said at a press conference in Vancouver on Sunday morning. He said investigators are still working to determine the motive for the attack, but police don't believe it was an act of terrorism. Mr. Rai described the 30-year-old driver as having “a significant history of interactions with police and police and health care professionals related to mental health.” “It is impossible to overstate how many lives have been impacted forever by this lone individual. There are many unanswered questions about this horrific crime, the motive of the person who did it, and whether anything could have been done to prevent it,” Mr. Rai said. “There are many things we still don't know. We are working hard to get all of the answers.” The attack happened shortly after 8 p.m. on Saturday night, when a man driving a black Audi SUV drove into a large crowd of people at the Lapu Lapu street festival, which was happening near John Oliver Secondary School at 41st Street and Fraser Street. A black SUV could be seen on the road, with its hood and bumper crushed. “It is hard to make sense of something so senseless, and I know there are questions about whether this tragedy could have been prevented,” Mr. Rai said. “We review over 3,200 events every year, and assess the risks with City partners. “We determined through consultations with the City of Vancouver and festival organizers that dedicated police officers and heavy vehicle barricades would not be deployed at the festival site.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As C's recent debut paves the way for robot baristas to appear in coffee shops across Silicon Valley, some see innovation and novelty. But in San Jose's deeply rooted local coffee scene, where shops like Roy's Station, Nirvana Soul, and Chromatic Coffee Co. take pride in creating a sense of community, some are wondering what's lost when the human touch disappears. For shops like Roy's Station in San Jose's Japantown, community is part of their identity. Longtime customer Alicia Arranaga, who visits with her daughter two to three times a week, says she thrives off of the experience of meeting new people and making connections. Owner Jasmine Rast recognizes that the sense of community is what sets Roy's apart. For Rast, interaction with servers is the gem of local businesses. “Being a barista is more than just making drinks,” says Dap Ashaolu, owner of Nirvana Soul in downtown San Jose. He thinks that providing good customer service by treating people kindly and creating genuine connections is something that people will be better at than robots for a long time. While robot baristas may not provide the same experience as humans, regulars at NCM may be surprised to find that C recognizes repeat customers through facial recognition technology. However, he recognizes that customers in the United States may not be as comfortable. “Would people want their data being used like that, without them knowing?” Arranaga mentioned that she would not feel comfortable with a robot barista recognizing her face. As a self-professed coffee geek, he values the shared experience of pushing further into coffee with others who also love the craft, something a robot cannot recreate.</p>

VATICAN CITY, April 26 (Reuters) – Presidents, royalty and simple mourners bade farewell to Pope Francis on Saturday at a solemn funeral ceremony, where a cardinal appealed for the pontiff's legacy of caring for migrants, the downtrodden and the environment to be kept alive. U.S. President Donald Trump, who had clashed with the pope on those issues, sat with the rows of foreign dignitaries on one side of Francis' coffin in the vast St. Peter's Square. On the other side sat cardinals who will pick Francis' successor at a conclave next month, deciding if the new pope should continue with the late pontiff's push for a more open Church or cede to conservatives who want to return to a more traditional papacy. The Argentine pope, who reigned for 12 years, died at the age of 88 on Monday after suffering a stroke. “Rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today's challenges, Pope Francis truly shared the anxieties, sufferings and hopes of this time,” said Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who presided over the funeral Mass. In spiritual language, the 91-year-old Re gave a simple message: there was no going back. Francis repeatedly called for an end to conflict during his papacy. His funeral provided an opportunity for Trump, who is pushing for a deal to end Russia's war with Ukraine, to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy inside St. Peter's Basilica. Francis, who shunned much of the pomp and privilege of the papacy, had asked to be buried there rather than in St. Peter's — the first time a pope had been laid to rest outside the Vatican in more than a century. The burial itself was conducted in private. Crowds estimated by police as numbering some 150,000 lined the 5.5-km (3.4-mile) route to St. Mary Major. The last time Trump had met Zelenskiy was in the White House in late February, when he gave him a public dressing down, but Saturday's encounter appeared more cordial. In one photograph released by Zelenskiy's office, the two men were sitting close together on red-backed chairs, leaning towards each other as they talked in the marble-floored church. Francis' death ushered in a meticulously planned period of transition, marked by ancient ritual, pomp and mourning. Choirs at the funeral sang Latin hymns and prayers were recited in various languages, including Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese and Arabic, reflecting the global reach of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church. “When I arrived at the square, tears of sadness and also joy came over me. I think I truly realised that Pope Francis had left us, and at the same time, there is joy for all he has done for the Church,” said a French pilgrim, Aurelie Andre. Francis, the first non-European pope for almost 13 centuries, battled to reshape the Church, siding with the poor and marginalised, while challenging wealthy nations to help migrants and reverse climate change. Traditionalists pushed back at his efforts to make the Church more transparent, while his pleas for an end to conflict, divisions and rampant capitalism often fell on deaf ears. The pope carried his desire for greater simplicity into his funeral, having rewritten the elaborate, book-long funeral rites used previously. He also opted to forego a papal tradition of three interlocking caskets made of cypress, lead and oak. Instead, he was placed in a single, zinc-lined wooden coffin. A reproduction of the simple, iron-plated cross he used to wear around his neck hangs above the marble slab. Attention will now switch to who might succeed him. The secretive conclave is unlikely to begin before May 6, and might not start for several days after that, giving cardinals time to hold regular meetings beforehand to sum each other up and assess the state of the Church, beset by financial problems and ideological divisions.
