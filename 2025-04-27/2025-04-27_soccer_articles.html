However, it is not they who will represent the league at this summer's revamped FIFA Club World Cup tournament - that honour instead falls to rivals Chelsea and Manchester City. It was 2022 when an announcement was made and qualifying teams were finalised between 2023 and November of last year. Chelsea and Man City are representatives of UEFA rather than anything else. They had to have done this between 2021 and 2024. So, the Reds' sixth European Cup won in 2019 was too early to be considered, whilst defeat to Real Madrid in the 2022 final in Paris was the closest they ever came to qualifying this time. They did this based on their coefficient rankings last year. And again, poor performances in the 2020/21 and 2022/23 versions of the Champions League, plus the fact they were competing in the Europa League last season, meant Liverpool were pegged back and lost out to Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, FC Porto, Atletico Madrid, SL Benfica, Juventus and Red Bull Salzburg. This revised tournament takes place every four years instead of annually, starting from 2025, so there is always an opportunity for Arne Slot and Co. to make the next one. Relive Liverpool's incredible 2024/25 title-winning season – the Reds' 20th league crown and the first lifted in front of fans since 1990. From Arne Slot's arrival to unforgettable wins over City, United, and more, follow every step of the journey. Featuring match reports, player spotlights, behind-the-scenes stories and iconic moments from a campaign to remember. Celebrate Liverpool's Premier League title win with the perfect souvenir by ordering a copy online today, just click here! The incentive for Liverpool to perform at their very best in Europe and qualify is the vast wealth FIFA are now putting into the Club World Cup. The Premier League is 38 matches long and cup competitions are still of great importance.</p>

Renee Slegers' side overturned a 2-1 deficit from the first leg of their semi-final, stunning the French giants to set up a huge Barcelona clash

Arsenal will play in their first Women's Champions League final since 2007 after shocking eight-time winners Lyon in France, winning 4-1 in their semi-final second leg to overturn a 2-1 deficit from the Emirates Stadium. The hosts had won all of their last 11 ties at this stage of the competition, a run which stretched back 16 years, but they were dominated and picked apart by the Gunners as that streak came to an emphatic end, with the English side set to face reigning champions Barcelona in Lisbon at the end of May for a chance to win this competition for the second time.

It took just five minutes for Arsenal to break the deadlock, as a surprise mistake from goalkeeper Christiane Endler led to Chloe Kelly's corner ricocheting around the box and eventually bouncing in off the Lyon shot-stopper herself. It set the tone for a sloppy and error-strewn display from the team that has won this competition more often than any other, with awful defending capitalised on by Alessia Russo for the Gunners' third and Caitlin Foord pouncing on a slip from Vanessa Gilles to bag the fourth.

But there was also a lot of quality on show from Arsenal, the stand-out moment undoubtedly Mariona Caldentey's sweet strike on the stroke of half-time which doubled their lead. The visitors controlled the midfield, were sharp in their spells of possession and extremely clinical in front of goal as they took down a giant of the European game.

Their reward is a shot at another, with Barcelona to be their opponents in next month's final in Lisbon after their 8-2 aggregate win over Chelsea. It'll be an incredible challenge, but Sunday was too - and Renee Slegers' side overcame that one remarkably.

GOAL rates Arsenal's players from Parc Olympique Lyonnais...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sky News found Vivid Seats - which was reported to sell tickets overseas for Chelsea matches at inflated prices - has listings for matches throughout the World Cup despite not yet being officially on sale. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player We delved deeper into the website after concerns were raised by Chelsea fans about their chairman, Todd Boehly, being an investor and director in Vivid while it also sells tickets overseas for Stamford Bridge matches at inflated prices. Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini cleared of fraud charges in Switzerland But then it says: "Vivid Seats will have World Cup tickets for sale as soon as they are available, usually many months before the actual game." "FIFA encourages any fan wishing to purchase tickets for the FIFA World Cup 26 to be wary of non-FIFA official ticketing websites that claim to be selling tickets already and only purchase tickets from the official and legitimate source once those are made available," the World Cup organisers told Sky News. FIFA is planning to put World Cup tickets on sale this summer. Ronan Evain, executive director of Football Supporters Europe, said the ticket listings were "worrying". "Companies like this either exploit the many loopholes that persist in the ticket sales policy or they get privileged access to tickets through competition organisers or associated parties. "It's the responsibility of the competition organiser to ensure that they put in place a transparent ticket distribution policy and sufficient protections, such as drastic limitations on the number of times a ticket can be transferred to someone else, for example. Or they are so confident in exploiting the many loopholes that they take limited risk in selling tickets that don't exist yet." Vivid Seats did not respond to a request for comment. The Chelsea Supporters' Trust said Vivid and Mr Boehly were undermining efforts to combat ticket touting. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Since our report was published on Monday, Chelsea has revealed plans to introduce digital-only tickets from next season in conjunction with Ticketmaster. In a statement, Chelsea chief revenue officer Casper Stylsvig said the link-up is in part about "continuing to address the issue of ticket touts." Chelsea has not commented on concerns about Vivid Seats.</p>
