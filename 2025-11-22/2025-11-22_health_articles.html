                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. The emerging application of artificial intelligence (AI) in pediatric ultrasound has shown significant potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in addressing the challenges of conventional ultrasound in operator dependence, inconsistent image quality, and limited quantitative analysis capabilities. These limitations arise from the inherent complexity of pediatric ultrasound image interpretation, such as organ immaturity, motion artifacts, and intestinal gas interference. AI can enhance structural recognition, offering automated, standardized measurements. AI applications can also assist non-expert physicians in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. This review summarizes recent advances in AI applications for pediatric ultrasound across different systems, including preliminary diagnosis, screening, detailed analysis, and decision support, while providing a detailed discussion of technical advances, unmet challenges, and future directions. Future research can focus on intelligent cross-system feature analysis frameworks, translational application of AI-driven pediatric ultrasound in multi-disease diagnosis, and fine-tuned models for personalized treatment based on large-scale randomized controlled trials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite recommendations for posttreatment surveillance in lung cancer patients, there is wide variability in the follow-up care that lung cancer patients receive. A recent study, led by senior author Leah Backhus, MD, MPH, Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery (Thoracic Surgery) in the Stanford Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, offers new insights on patient care and lung cancer surveillance rates. The study, titled, Adherence to Posttreatment Surveillance Guidelines in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): Retrospective Cohort Study, was published October 2025 in the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) Cancer. Its objective was to examine posttreatment surveillance to estimate the true surveillance rates and predictors of guideline-concordant care in patients with early-stage NSCLC. The retrospective study examined 1,888 Veterans with stage I to III non-small cell lung cancer who survived for ≥ 6 months following curative treatment. As Chief of Thoracic Surgery at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Dr. Backhus utilized robust data sources at the VA to inform her studies. Radiology reports were examined using a novel hybrid approach for clinical abstraction which combines both computerized search methods and manual review for strict clinical validation. In the study, we estimated the cumulative probability of receiving guideline-concordant surveillance, defined as chest computed tomography imaging within 4 to 9 months after treatment, accounting for competing risks and censoring." This approach allowed researchers to use a multivariable cause-specific Cox regression to estimate associations between patient factors and guideline-concordant surveillance and to distinguish between imaging ordered for surveillance versus imaging ordered for symptoms of recurrence. "By applying this unique use of a competing risk framework, we discovered the rate of guideline concordant surveillance in this national cohort was lower than what has been reported in many previous studies," said Dr. Backhus. These findings reveal a potentially substantial gap in surveillance among asymptomatic lung cancer survivors. While more research is needed, it could help future generations of NSCLC patients receive better surveillance after cancer treatment. Dr. Backhus is the Thelma and Henry Doelger Professor of Cardiovascular Surgery at Stanford. She co-directs the Stanford Thoracic Surgery Clinical Research Program, which uses a variety of health services research methodologies geared towards assessing the quality and effectiveness of thoracic surgical interventions for individual patients as well as population-based research. The paper features several authors affiliated with the department, including first author Ryan Randle, MD, and co-author Nicole Lin, MD, who are both previous fellows in the division's Thoracic Surgery Clinical Research Program.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new clinical trial soon will begin enrolling patients at the University of Cincinnati to study extended postoperative use of the drug tranexamic acid (TXA), which helps reduce bleeding after surgery and may improve recovery outcomes. More than 200,000 ACL reconstructions are performed in the United States each year, many in young athletes eager to return to play. The recovery process often takes nine to 12 months, and complications such as swelling, stiffness and loss of muscle strength can delay rehabilitation. TXA is typically given intravenously during an ACL surgery to minimize blood loss. It will be prescribed orally for seven days after surgery." David Bernholt, MD, principal investigator of the study Bernholt noted that extended TXA dosing is now being used in joint replacement procedures due to recent studies showing improved results. This clinical trial will test whether similar benefits occur in ACL reconstructions. "Anything we can do to reduce pain, decrease swelling and promote earlier movement in patients is critical." Eligible participants include high school and college athletes, recreational athletes, and others with ACL injuries caused by injuries or trauma. One physician per year in the United States is selected for this award. "We are optimistic that quicker improvements in pain and range of motion can lead to earlier progress in physical therapy, which may in turn lead to an overall quicker recovery," said Bernholt. "Patients' muscle strength may not be impacted as much." Bernholt explained that extended TXA use could help prevent arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI), a physiological response that limits muscle activation after joint injury or surgery. AMI protects the joint but can also delay recovery. "If patients can regain mobility more quickly, they may be cleared by a physician to return to their sport sooner," he said. "With ACL injuries already requiring extended recovery, many student-athletes are eager to limit their rehabilitation time and return to competition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and collaborators have created the most comprehensive map to date showing how antibodies attach to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and how viral mutations weaken that attachment. The findings, published in the November 21 online issue of Cell Systems, a Cell Press journal, explain why variants like Omicron can evade immune defenses and suggest new strategies for building longer-lasting antibody therapies and vaccines. The team analyzed more than a thousand three-dimensional structures of antibodies bound to the virus's spike protein, the main target for immune recognition, and compiled them into a structural atlas of COVID-19 antibodies. Scientists around the world have solved thousands of individual antibody-virus structures, but until now, no one had looked at them together. By uniting all these data, we were able to see the bigger picture-how fully antibodies cover the virus's surface and how mutations in newer variants like Omicron can undermine that protection. The researchers found that antibodies, including many used in clinical treatments, recognize nearly every exposed region of the spike protein's receptor-binding domain, a critical region of the virus. Despite this broad coverage, mutations in newer variants have weakened the binding of almost all antibodies to some degree. Many antibodies, though different in sequence, bind to the virus in strikingly similar ways, suggesting that there are only a few effective structural ways to neutralize it. Because they can recognize deeply buried regions of the spike protein that tend to remain unchanged as the virus evolves, nanobodies could serve as powerful starting points for developing next-generation antiviral drugs. "While these antibodies have been remarkably effective, the virus keeps finding ways to escape them." "To stay ahead, we'll need to design next-generation antibodies that can recognize and latch onto multiple regions of the virus at once, making it much harder for the virus to evade our defenses as it continues to evolve," adds Frank (Zirui) Feng, the study's first author and a master's student in the Biomedical Data Science and AI program at Mount Sinai. Although the study focused on one key part of the spike-the receptor-binding domain-the researchers note that similar patterns of immune escape are likely occurring elsewhere in the virus. Vaccination and natural immunity still provide vital protection through a wide range of immune responses, even when certain antibodies lose potency. Ultimately, they hope these insights will guide the development of durable antibody treatments capable of withstanding viral evolution and improving preparedness for future pandemics. "The immune system is remarkably adaptable, but the virus is clever," says co-author Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, PhD, Irene and Dr. Arthur M. Fishberg Professor of Medicine, and Director of the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine. "By analyzing how antibodies attach to the virus and where they fall short, we gain a detailed map of the virus's vulnerabilities. This insight not only helps us understand why some antibodies stop working as the virus evolves but also guides the design of next-generation therapies that can stay one step ahead, potentially improving how we prevent and treat COVID-19 and other viral infections." As a part of this research, the team has created an open-access data set and interactive web tool that allows scientists to explore antibody structures in detail, providing a powerful resource to collectively accelerate research on COVID-19 and other viruses. One thousand SARS-CoV-2 antibody structures reveal convergent binding and near-universal immune escape.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The team hopes its work will help protect people against multiple viruses by helping open up a new front in the fight to stop viral pathogens. Rather than focusing on how to attack a specific virus directly - as antiviral drugs today work - researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory want to protect the body against many viruses. “A virus thrives by taking over the cellular machinery of its host, hijacking normal processes to churn out copies of itself,” said John Melchior, a biochemist and a corresponding author of a Sept. 12 paper in the Journal of Proteome Research. Virologist Amy Sims, the co-corresponding author of the study, said the approach is a new way to fight many kinds of coronaviruses, from those that cause usually minor symptoms like a cold to those that cause severe diseases like COVID-19 and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). “This approach offers a pathway for using a single drug to stop multiple types of viruses,” said Sims. “When you target only the virus, it can produce strains that readily escape antiviral medications. But by targeting key functions in the host cell that the virus needs to replicate, and by turning off those host functions, we hope to eliminate the escape route most viruses use to cause disease.” Melchior, Sims and colleagues have adapted a newer technique that pinpoints proteins whose conformation, or shape, has changed. In the current study, they looked at human cells infected by HCoV-229E, a virus that causes the common cold. The technique, called limited proteolysis-based mass spectrometry or LiP-MS, determines not just the changes in abundance of thousands of different proteins present in a sample but also which proteins have changed shape. For a protein, shape is everything, determining its function and regulating which molecular partners it can interact with and when. The PNNL team identified eight targets of the virus, including two molecular assemblies that are key control points involved in RNA processing. One molecular target is Nop-56, which gives a chemical stamp of approval to let the body know that a given strand of RNA is legitimate. With that chemical approval in hand, a cellular unit known as the ribosome makes the strand's protein product. When the cold virus hijacks Nop-56, human RNA is destroyed, normal proteins are not made - and rogue viral proteins are approved instead. The spliceosome C-complex is another important target. Imagine that a foreign invader takes over the factory, halts production and then uses the factory to turn out its own drones that are used to attack the home country. “We hope our work provides a list of common molecular targets that sets the foundation for the development of drugs that could block not just one but many viruses that cause disease,” said Snigdha Sarkar, a postdoctoral fellow and first author of the paper. Now, the PNNL team is exploring existing compounds that have been shown by scientists at Oregon Health & Science University to have antiviral potential. The team is also using artificial intelligence to rapidly identify compounds that could affect the molecular targets that its technology identified. The work was funded by PNNL's Predictive Phenomics Initiative, an effort to understand how factors beyond the genetic code determine the traits of people, plants and all living things. In addition to Melchior, Sarkar and Sims, authors include Song Feng, Hugh Mitchell, Madelyn Berger, Tong Zhang, Isaac Attah, Chelsea Hutchinson-Bunch, Victoria Prozapas, Kristin Engbrecht and Stephanie King.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Improving diet and increasing physical activity levels together may be more effective at preventing weight gain – particularly harmful fat inside the abdomen – than just changing one of these behaviours, new research from the University of Cambridge suggests. An analysis of changes in physical activity and diet quality in UK adults found that while improved diet quality and increased physical activity were each independently associated with lower increases in body fat, the greatest benefits were achieved by combining both. Body fat is stored in different locations, some of which are more harmful than others. Subcutaneous fat is stored under the skin and can be considered relatively healthy. In contrast, visceral fat stored around the organs in the abdomen is linked to a higher risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and heart disease. At baseline, and again after an average of around seven years, the researchers measured Fenland study participants' physical activity energy expenditure for at least 72 hours using wearable heart rate and movement sensors. On both occasions, the researchers also measured the quantity and distribution of body fat using DEXA, a low-intensity X-ray scan that can distinguish body fat, bone composition, muscle and lean mass across the whole body, and used ultrasound to identify the occurrence of fatty liver disease. For example, Fenland Study participants who improved both their diet and activity gained on average about 1.9 kg less total body fat and 150g less visceral fat over the follow-up period compared with those who did not improve their behaviors. The researchers found that after adjusting for body mass index, the association of changes in diet and physical activity with changes in visceral fat remained significant, while the association with subcutaneous fat did not, indicating that visceral fat was particularly responsive to the changes in health behaviours. When people talk about changes in body weight, they often refer to a single number on the scale. But not all weight loss or gain is the same. First of all, we need to focus on fat mass when considering the risk of metabolic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Second, body fat is stored in different places, and some types are more harmful than others. So, when we gain or lose weight, it matters where these changes happen. We found that combining a better diet with more physical activity is an effective way to improve not just weight, but how much and where fat is stored in the body. It's particularly effective at reducing the build-up of harmful fat around organs." Dr. Shayan Aryannezhad, first author from the MRC Epidemiology Unit Senior author Professor Nita Forouhi, also from the MRC Epidemiology, said: "Our research shows that improvements in diet with more physical activity in middle-age don't just result in weight loss, but can potentially help prevent disease and support healthier ageing. "Despite the challenges of living in environments that promote unhealthy eating and inactivity, there is benefit from making small, sustained changes that lead to both healthier diets and increased energy expenditure. "To address the epidemic of obesity and its huge social, psychological and health service costs, policy makers should seek to alter the food and physical activity environments to make healthier choices more accessible for all."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Targeting and treating diseases first requires being able to find specific cells-which is challenging because they travel within the body and can "hide." Now, a new round of funding will support advancing technology invented at Case Western Reserve University that enhances the ability to locate therapeutic cells or diseased cells like cancer. Right now, we don't know where all the cells go when tracking cancer cells or cell-based therapies, so we are not sure what type of processes to target or how therapies might be improved." Toward that goal, the National Institutes of Health awarded a $2.5 million Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant jointly to Brady-Kalnay and BioInVision Inc. Madhu Gargesha, BioInVision's principal investigator for this research grant, is a former post-doc from the CWRU biomedical engineering department. The technology is intended to serve various applications, such as testing cancer therapeutics, cell-based therapies including immunotherapy and drug delivery. The technology can also be used to evaluate imaging agents and gene expression, Brady-Kalnay said. SBIR grants support small businesses that collaborate with universities for continued research and commercialization, bringing revenue to both the company and university while boosting regional economic development. The CryoViz cryo-imaging device is a highly automated system that uses a microscope, robotics, imaging and advanced software to create high-resolution, three-dimensional images of biological samples with single-cell sensitivity. "If you wanted to do this with traditional methods, it might take millions of tissue sections," Brady-Kalnay said. The new techniques allow them to track individual cells-like migrating and metastatic cancer cells or T-cells-to evaluate cell-based treatments like immunotherapy. "It will automatically save tissue sections in that region so I can go back and study the tissue in detail at the cellular and molecular level." David Wald, co-investigator on the grant and professor of pathology at CWRU, is studying where T-cells end up in various organs during novel treatments like immunotherapy. Doing so would improve the ability to target diseased cells. Companies started by Case Western Reserve students, postdocs and faculty members are often run by former university postdocs and graduate students. BioInVision has been selling its CryoViz technology as an instrument and service to academic institutions, hospitals, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies globally for over a decade, raising Ohio's visibility internationally.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Medical reports written in technical terminology can pose challenges for patients. A team at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has investigated how artificial intelligence can make CT findings easier to understand. In the study, reading time decreased, and patients rated the automatically simplified texts as more comprehensible and more helpful. An example: "The cardiomediastinal silhouette is midline. [...] A small pericardial effusion is noted" was simplified by the AI as follows: "Heart: The report notes a small amount of fluid around your heart. This is a common finding, and your doctor will determine if it needs any attention." From the researchers' perspective, making medical terminology accessible is more than a minor aid. "Ensuring that patients understand their reports, examinations, and treatments is a central pillar of modern medicine. This is the only way to guarantee informed consent and strengthen health literacy," says Felix Busch, assistant physician at the Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and co-last author of the study, which was published in the journal "Radiology". While previous research has shown that AI models can make specialist medical texts more comprehensible, little was known about their impact on actual patients. Therefore, the team included 200 patients who underwent CT imaging at the TUM University Hospital due to a cancer diagnosis. The results were unambiguous: reading time fell from an average of seven minutes for the original reports to two minutes. Patients who received the simplified findings reported that they were much easier to read (81% compared with 17%) and easier to understand (80% compared with 9%). Felix Busch, assistant physician, Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Future studies are needed to determine whether these advantages translate into measurable improvements in patient health outcomes. From the researchers' perspective, however, the study clearly shows that patients can benefit from AI-supported simplification of medical reports by improving their understanding. "Providing automatically simplified reports as an additional service alongside the specialist report is conceivable. "Aside from data protection concerns, language models always carry the risk of factual errors," says Dr. Philipp Prucker, first author of the study. Without trained specialists verifying the findings, patients may, in the worst case, receive incorrect information about their illness," Prucker concludes. Prucker, P., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aston University's Dr Jonathan Cox and New Zealand Mānuka honey company Comvita have announced a significant milestone in their three-year research collaboration, with the filing of a new patent for a formulation to fight bacterial infections. Early results are very promising, showing it is effective against many highly drug-resistant bacterial species, including MRSA, and others that are major causes of serious hospital infections and deaths worldwide. This announcement comes during World Antimicrobial Resistance Awareness Week, highlighting the power of international science partnerships, and the shared commitment of New Zealand and the UK to develop novel, effective, and globally relevant solutions. In New Zealand, Māori and Pacific people are more likely to be hospitalised with infection illnesses, and are therefore at greater risk from antibiotic-resistant infections. Our work shows that Mānuka honey has remarkable potential, both on its own, as novel formulations, and in combination with existing antibiotics to tackle AMR. Filing this patent is an exciting step toward translating our laboratory discoveries into real-world treatments that could make a meaningful difference for patients globally." This patent marks a major milestone in our mission to advance the science of Mānuka honey and unlock its full potential in supporting global health. Our collaboration with Dr Cox reflects the best of science and nature working together and a model for how industry and academia from all corners of the world can work together to solve big problems. As AMR continues to rise worldwide, the need for safe, natural, and effective alternatives has never been greater. Her Excellency Iona Thomas, British High Commissioner to New Zealand, said: AMR is one of the most serious health challenges of our time, and it will take innovative, cross-border thinking to solve it. Seeing world-class researchers and industry leaders come together to advance a nature-based solution is exactly the kind of impact our countries can deliver when we work side by side."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a lowered mood and loss of interest, contributing not only to difficulties in academic and professional life but also as a major cause of suicide in South Korea. However, there are currently no objective biological markers that can be used for diagnosis or treatment. Amidst this, a research team from KAIST has revealed that depression is not merely a problem of the mind or brain, but is deeply connected to abnormalities in the body's overall immune response. KAIST announced on the November 20th that Professor Jinju Han's research team from the Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering (GSMSE) at KAIST, in collaboration with Professor Yangsik Kim's research team (Ph.D., KAIST GSMSE) from Inha University School of Medicine, performed a multi-omics analysis combining blood analysis, single-cell analysis, and patient-derived brain organoids (mini-brains). ■ "Immune Cells and Brain Function are Altered Together" A New Biological Clue for Depression MDD, especially in young women, often presents with atypical symptoms (hypersomnia, overeating, mood reactivity, etc. Furthermore, about 40% of patients are classified as treatment-resistant depression, showing no response to various antidepressants. ■ World's First Integration of "Leukocyte Single-Cell Analysis + Brain Organoid" A New Paradigm for Psychiatric Research The research team presented the world's first precision medicine approach by integrating plasma proteomics, leukocyte single-cell transcriptome analysis, and analysis of brain organoids created from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Furthermore, proteins crucial for inter-neuronal signaling (DCLK3 and CALY) were significantly elevated compared to normal levels, and Complement Protein C5, which strongly enhances the body's immune response, was also increased. This finding confirms a clue that depression is not merely a mood issue but is connected to biological changes occurring throughout the entire body. Upon examining the immune cells of depression patients, genetic changes were found that make inflammatory responses in the body occur more easily and strongly than usual. This implies that the entire bodily immune system is in a state of excessive activation, and this immune/inflammatory abnormality may influence the development of depression. ■ "Immune-Neural Axis Imbalance is the Core Mechanism of Atypical Depression" This achievement presents a new precision medicine model for psychiatric research," adding, "We anticipate that this will actively lead to biomarker discovery and new drug development." This accomplishment was published online in the world-renowned international scientific journal, Advanced Science, on October 31st.
