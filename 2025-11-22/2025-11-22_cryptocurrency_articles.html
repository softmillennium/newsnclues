                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has extended its downward trend and is now trading inside a critical multi-month demand block. With liquidity being aggressively flushed above and below the price, ETH is approaching a major decision point where either a relief rebound or a deeper capitulation into the lower demand zones may unfold. ETH has continued its sharp corrective leg, sliding from the $3.5K–$3.6K supply zone and breaking decisively below both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. A clean loss of this area would expose the next major decision level at $2.45K–$2.55K, where long-term bids previously stepped in. Short-term liquidity sweeps have been occurring on both sides of the range, indicating increasing volatility and the potential formation of a local bottom. Without a clear breakout above the trendline, however, any rebound is more likely to remain corrective rather than structural. The two-week liquidation heatmap reveals that ETH is surrounded by dense liquidation clusters above the current price, particularly between $3.1K and $3.6K. Historically, when price enters a deep liquidity vacuum below major clusters, markets often overshoot to the downside before staging a volatile rebound as liquidity above price becomes the next target. Currently, clear liquidity voids sit above $3.2K, matching the major daily fair value gap. These areas tend to act as magnets during rapid corrections. With liquidity compressed below and large unfilled pockets above, ETH is approaching a pivotal zone. A temporary capitulation into the lower demand region cannot be ruled out, but this same motion has historically preceded strong recovery phases once exhausted sellers are cleared.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy (MSTR) has become the go-to tool for crypto investors trying to manage risk, according to Tom Lee, chairman and CEO of Bitmine, partly explaining its 43% drop over the past month. “It seems to me that in the crypto world when they're trying to hedge their loss in bitcoin and ethereum they can't find any other way to hedge it except shorting the liquid stocks that it proxies and that's the MicroStrategys,” Lee said. He added that crypto-native hedging tools, like derivatives on bitcoin and ether ETH$2,751.92, aren't liquid or deep enough for major players. “Anyone who has a sizable bitcoin long position … they have very limited ability to hedge it in crypto derivatives,” he said. “Somebody can use [Strategy's] option chain which is so liquid to hedge all of their crypto.” “It really crippled market makers,” he said, describing them as the “central bank” of crypto. Since then, cracks in the system have remained, with liquidity still thin across altcoins, miner stocks and bitcoin proxies like Strategy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European investors will soon be able to take bigger, leveraged bets on Ethereum and Bitcoin via new exchange traded products from Leverage Shares, which will offer 3x leveraged short and long options for both assets on the SIX Swiss stock exchange. “Leverage Shares is launching the world's first ever 3x and -3x Bitcoin and [Ethereum] ETFs in Europe next week,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posted Friday on X. Balchunas expects the products to start trading next week, but a representative for Leverage Shares did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. The latest leveraged products join a variety of global offerings that provide amplified, and therefore riskier investment opportunities to investors. And they're coming for more than the major crypto assets. On Thursday, 21Shares unveiled a 2x leveraged Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF—TXDD—which essentially allows investors to take a long position on the leading meme coin and potentially reap two times the token's daily performance, less fees and expenses. Are Perps and Leverage Creating Systemic Risk in Crypto Markets? Industry veterans like Fundstrat CIO and BitMine Immersion Technologies Chairman Tom Lee continue to suggest that the market's recent chaos is still part of a broader recalibration from the events of October 10. Bitcoin is down nearly 13% in the last week, recently trading at $84,065. Bitcoin dove to nearly $81,000 on Friday, marking a fresh seven-month low for the leading cryptocurrency and prompting a market plunge that led to over $2.2 billion worth of crypto liquidations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India's central bank is taking a “very cautious” stance on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, arguing that their volatility and potential to bypass safeguards could threaten financial stability, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra said. He said new financial products such as stablecoins, cryptoassets and buy-now-pay-later schemes are testing the boundaries of what should fall within regulation, requiring authorities to constantly reassess the regulatory perimeter. Against that backdrop, Malhotra reiterated that safeguarding financial stability is the RBI's “north star”, with other objectives including prudential rules for liquidity and capital, conduct standards to protect consumers, anti-money-laundering controls and support for priority-sector credit. He pointed to the RBI's proposed expected credit loss (ECL) provisioning framework as an example, combining principles with quantitative floors. The governor also stressed proportionality, tailoring rules by size and risk, along with public consultation, evidence-led policymaking and mandatory reviews every five to seven years to prevent a build-up of outdated rules after crises.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum ETFs see $55.7M inflows as price tests danger zone, with oversold charts mapping key support near 2,100 dollars. Ethereum faces a sharp split between strong ETF demand and a spot chart sliding through major support levels. Fresh inflows clash with a deep technical danger zone and oversold signals, setting up a tense next phase for the market. Ethereum spot ETFs pulled in about 55.7 million dollars in net inflows yesterday, according to the latest Farside Investors data. The green total came even as BlackRock's ETHA fund recorded roughly 53.7 million dollars in outflows on the day. At the same time, rival issuers such as Fidelity and Bitwise absorbed fresh demand that more than offset BlackRock's selling. Ethereum has slipped into a key danger zone after losing its main daily uptrend line and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, according to analyst DrBullZeus. If ETH stabilizes there, bulls could attempt a recovery toward higher levels, but failure to hold that area would confirm deeper technical damage. Now, Ethereum is showing one of its sharpest weekly oversold readings in years, according to a new chart from CryptoCaesar. The indicator highlights multiple past moments when ETH hit similar lows on the stochastic oscillator before staging strong recoveries. The latest dip places ETH inside that same historical zone, suggesting momentum has reached exhaustion. Each circled oversold point aligns with periods where sellers lost steam and price bounced from major support regions. The current setup mirrors those patterns, with ETH now approaching a broad demand zone beneath the 2,300 level. At the same time, broader market structure shows ETH pulling back from its recent local peak, leaving a clear downward candle on the weekly timeframe. CryptoCaesar notes that conditions remain technically oversold rather than structurally broken, and the coming weeks will show whether Ethereum can repeat its prior rebound behavior or slide deeper into the lower support block.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global banks have completed the migration to ISO 20022. Credit: Expect Best via Pexels. With global banks and payment networks now unified around ISO 20022, the stage is set for the widespread integration of blockchains into mainstream finance. When SWIFT went live in 1977, it revolutionized cross-border payments by giving banks a globally standardized way to talk to each other. Moreover, as a universal language, the MT format transcended differences between national banking systems, enabling unprecedented interoperability. This standardization was instrumental in SWIFT's rapid growth, allowing it to connect thousands of financial institutions around the world and facilitate the explosion of global trade and finance in the late twentieth century. By the early 2000s, fragmented supplementary messaging systems threatened to undermine SWIFT's mission of global interoperability. Unlike the rigid MT format, ISO 20022 is designed to be more flexible, allowing for the creation of new fields and message types. For instance, national bank networks can define their own parameters according to domestic requirements. Crucially, because the new format utilizes XML, messages are both human- and machine-readable, making it ideal for blockchain integration. Platforms like Ripple, Stellar, and Hedera were explicitly designed with ISO 20022 in mind, making it easier to map financial messages onto smart contract calls or on-chain token transfers. Post-migration, the blockchain developers and central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects building tomorrow's payment rails look to ISO 20022 as the canonical data model enabling interoperability. Instead of each platform inventing its own fields, the standard provides a shared vocabulary that makes translation possible. They're also experimenting with new blockchain-based rails that use ISO 20022 to bridge financial ecosystems. From JPMorgan to UBS, financial institutions worldwide are bringing commercial bank money on-chain at a rapidly accelerating pace. According to Citi's latest projection, tokenized deposits could support up to $140 trillion in annual transaction volume by 2030, surpassing stablecoins as the most popular medium of on-chain currency exchange. Other players using blockchain technology to upgrade the global banking system include Ripple, Partior, Fnality, and various multi-CBDC architectures being explored by central banks. This allows banks to keep their core payment engines and compliance tools consistent, even as settlement hops between different rails. Whether firms move tokenized deposits, stablecoins, CBDCs, or old-school fiat via SWIFT, a blockchain network, or some alternative platform, ISO 20022 helps ease data conversion and minimize friction.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the Fed reduces interest rates, it generally enhances market liquidity, making riskier investments, including cryptocurrencies, more attractive. A recent 10% drop in Bitcoin can lead to cascading effects on altcoins. However, this decline can also open doors for altcoins to emerge. If Bitcoin's market dominance decreases, altcoins may claim a larger segment, prompting potential rallies. Historically, during Bitcoin's downturns, altcoins have sometimes outperformed due to investors diversifying their portfolios. Current market sentiment indicates that if Bitcoin keeps declining, altcoins could benefit greatly, drawing trader interest toward alternatives. Investors looking to manage Bitcoin's volatility while leveraging altcoin opportunities have various strategies at their disposal: Diversification: A broad spread of investments across numerous cryptocurrencies, including altcoins and stablecoins, can mitigate risk. Timely Conversion: Converting Bitcoin payments to fiat or stablecoins swiftly protects cash flow from price volatility. Using stablecoins for operational transactions can stabilize exchange rates, ensuring consistent costs. Hedging: Using derivatives such as options or futures can hedge against adverse price movements in Bitcoin. Smart contracts with stop-loss orders can also ensure automated risk management. Operational Optimization: Integrating cryptocurrencies into payment systems can lower transaction fees and speed up settlements. Data-Driven Tools: Employing AI and data analytics to track market trends can guide investment decisions. The current scenario suggests that altcoins may be primed for a rally, albeit cautiously. Recent data showcases that altcoins have recorded positive returns and increased trading volumes, occasionally outpacing Bitcoin. This trend is partly fueled by stablecoin adoption and growing institutional investor interest. Nevertheless, altcoins' performance remains closely linked to Bitcoin's price dynamics. Analysts suggest a decline in Bitcoin's dominance could herald an "altcoin season", where investors shift focus towards alternative cryptocurrencies. However, this anticipated rally is expected to be selective, favoring established altcoins with solid fundamentals rather than an all-encompassing surge. Several critical indicators and events could shape market dynamics in the coming weeks: Federal Reserve Announcements: Investors must keep a close watch on the Fed's interest rate decisions, which will greatly influence market sentiment and liquidity. If its downward trend continues, altcoins could rally, whereas recovery in Bitcoin's price might redirect attention to it. In summary, the interaction between Federal Reserve rate cuts, Bitcoin's trajectory, and altcoin potential creates a multifaceted yet potentially lucrative environment for investors.

LivLive introduces a fresh approach to crypto utility by turning everyday physical activity into verifiable digital value. For users, this creates an entirely new earning layer woven into daily life. For brands, it finally provides measurable human presence through on-chain verification, eliminating bots, fake check-ins, and inflated metrics. This dual benefit gives LivLive a real-world use case that positions it well beyond typical speculation-driven presales. At the current $0.02 presale rate, a standard purchase would secure 125,000 $LIVE tokens. However, BLACK300 adds a 300% token bonus, unlocking an additional 375,000 tokens, bringing the total to: This kind of asymmetry explains why early-stage bonuses often produce the strongest upside in presales. Tensor began as a niche trading interface for experienced NFT players. Its execution speed, liquidity aggregation, and advanced market tools quietly positioned it as a superior alternative to slower, less efficient platforms on Solana. Early adopters noticed, long before social media picked up on its potential. When the broader NFT market surged, Tensor was perfectly positioned to take advantage. Its user-friendly tools and high-performance backend turned it into the preferred marketplace for professional traders. Tensor's climb is a reminder of how utility-rich projects can skyrocket once real demand arrives, rewarding those who recognized them early. Its AR-powered mission system and on-chain verification model place it in a category of high-utility projects with long-term growth potential. For investors who missed major early-stage opportunities like Tensor's rise, LivLive represents a fresh chance to secure meaningful upside before broader attention arrives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto is no longer a fringe technology – it's becoming part of the financial mainstream. Traditional institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan now offer crypto investment products. In countries like Argentina and Venezuela, crypto is being used to fight hyperinflation. Bitcoin is now legal tender in countries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic. Poker players have always been early adopters in this space. Crypto poker sites have existed since 2011, when Black Friday forced PokerStars and Full Tilt out of the US market. Its player pool is limited, but it has a cult following among crypto-poker diehards. Crypto poker is also making its way into the mainstream. CoinPoker was founded in 2017 by well-known poker pro Tony G, who said in an interview with Cardplayer Lifestyle, “I believe that blockchain is the future.” CoinPoker uses its own native token (CHP), built on Ethereum, and offers blockchain-based RNG verification. Tony G has since moved away from CoinPoker to concentrate on more fundamental crypto businesses, and the site now boasts Patrick Leonard among its ambassadors. Brian Rast, Viktor Blom, Dan ‘Jungleman' Cates, Huck Seed and Alec Torelli are among the names in one of the most impressive pro teams in online poker. Crypto might scream anonymity and illegality to some, but that isn't the case with more mainstream sites. In a recent interview with PokerOrg, Phenom Poker founder Matt Valeo explained why: “We do the KYC process upfront, which might not seem like a good thing on the surface… But you can't be serious about security if you don't know who's playing. If (players are) acting maliciously … we just don't want you here.” A crypto poker site is an online poker site that provides deposits and withdrawals, and runs games with cryptocurrency instead of fiat. Phenom Poker accepts deposits in USDT (Tether) on the Polygon network or a number of other tokens like Ethereum (for a small conversion or bridging fee). Transactions on Polygon aren't always instant and depend on where you're sending funds from (your own wallet or an exchange), but they're fast – both for deposits and withdrawals. But a true crypto poker site isn't just about using crypto for payments – it should be built on Web3 principles like decentralization, user ownership, transparency, and on-chain verification. You can verify your funds at any time on the blockchain using tools like PolygonScan. This setup reduces the risk of internal fraud or site insolvency — players retain control over their funds at all times. This brings a new level of transparency to online poker. Unlike other speculative crypto tokens, the Phenom Token exists to facilitate a shared ownership model. You can't buy it – instead it's a form of rakeback or loyalty system that allows players to collectively accrue up to a 50% stake in the business by playing on the site. While crypto sites often operate without traditional oversight, many now hold gaming licenses in jurisdictions like Anjouan or Curaçao. However, it's true that they're not under the same regulatory scrutiny as more traditional online poker sites. What they would argue is that their blockchain-based approach delivers more transparency than traditional sites – a new kind of trust model. For a lot of players, it comes down to speed, control, and access. Crypto poker flips that model — offering rapid payouts, borderless play, and a sense of ownership over funds. In Part 2 of this series, we'll take a closer look at how wallets, tokens, and blockchain mechanics work, and what that means for you.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the past month, the crypto market has wiped out over $1 trillion in market capitalization due to a series of large-scale liquidations and strong selling pressure since the October 10 pullback, which has sunk investors' sentiment to its lowest levels in months. Carter explained that crypto is “boring” now because most of the uncertainties that drove much of the historical volatility have been resolved, adding that the industry has also largely derisked as a technological substrate. Under this new regime, the market experiences short-term uptrends followed by mid-term downtrends, similar to the price action of altcoins like BONK since late 2023, Altcoin Sherpa added: There is no more euphoria where things go berserk for an entire year. Look how many cycles BONK had in a year or 2. The analyst suggested that investors should not expect 2021 conditions for most altcoins or a traditional “Alt Season,” where most tokens experience massive gains at once. He advised to capitalize when the “good times” arrive and be aware that “price can still die in 3 months.” Coins will still downtrend, just not in a slow bleed. More [of] an accelerated destruction + carnage, Altcoin Sherpa detailed. He also noted that, unlike previous cycles, altcoins will also recover “a bit quicker than before,” and won't take over a year to bottom and accumulate before a new leg up begins again. However, Sherpa affirmed that the lack of an accumulation phase will mean that “the overall coins will NOT have as strong of pumps like they used to,” as that period is what makes the rallies strong. “We aren't seeing anything close to that anymore,” he concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a high-velocity ecosystem, accurate analytics are the backbone of decision-making. Be it analyzing emerging artists, evaluating blue-chip collections, or finding suspicious activities around wash trading, data from the NFT marketplace forms the backbone of meaningful insights. This article breaks down the relevance, uses, and importance of NFT marketplace data in today's digital economy and points out that data-driven decisions are most likely to increase the chances of better crypto gains. Every big NFT marketplace, such as OpenSea, Blur, Magic Eden, and LooksRare, generates a huge quantity of live data. A collection that might be trending on social media will count for nothing if there is not enough real buying volume to give it weight. The opposite may be a quiet collection showing strong accumulation coming from smart money wallets. Sudden jumps generally indicate either hype or strong fundamental interest. The volatility of prices is monitored for manipulation or actual growth. Put these factors together, and the prospects for long-term stability—and therefore crypto gains—significantly improve. Whale movements Marketplace comparisons Price predictions These tools make complex blockchain data simple to digest and help users-from beginner to professional-make smarter, more profitable decisions. Here's how that may shape future opportunities for crypto gains. Valuations better informed by more transparent historical data Improved risk assessment as fraud detection tools evolve Improved liquidity as more marketplaces integrate cross-chain trading. Going forward, the NFT ecosystem will be more in tune with a data-first digital economy where every insight matters. Quick Highlights NFT marketplace data provides actionable insights for market health assessment. Traders analyze data to estimate collections, follow whales, and identify scams. Data-driven decisions are superior to investing based upon emotions or hype. The future of NFTs will require standardized and transparent data systems. This includes sales volume, floor price trends, activity of the wallets, listing information, and more. The data allows traders to make more informed decisions in terms of watching market fluctuations, considering demand, and avoiding scams. Popular choices include Nansen, CryptoSlam, DappRadar, NFTScan, and Blur Analytics. Though no data can predict prices with certainty for the future, it does reveal patterns, helps block guesswork, and provides a much clearer overview of how the market behaves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interest in Maradona memorabilia has soared to unprecedented heights, with NFT sales featuring the legendary footballer experiencing a remarkable 1,000% increase. In Switzerland, the regulatory framework around NFTs remains fluid, with ongoing debates about classification. Under current Swiss law, NFTs are often considered assets, but clarity around taxation and intellectual property rights is still evolving. This ongoing regulatory development ensures that traders must stay informed to manage potential risks. The NFT market overall has witnessed rapid growth, with estimates showing a global transaction volume reaching CHF 1.2 billion. This growth is fueled by celebrity involvement, increased digital engagement, and the broader crypto investment trend. This growth aligns with the burgeoning digital collectibles market, where art, music, and now sports memorabilia are fetching high prices. Investing in NFTs like Maradona's collectibles presents both opportunities and challenges. For investors, NFTs offer a chance to diversify portfolios beyond traditional assets. Their value, however, can be volatile, influenced by market trends and cultural relevance. Thus, investors need to conduct thorough research and remain vigilant about market updates, especially as interest in high-profile NFTs grows. The Maradona NFT boom exemplifies how digital collectibles are rapidly becoming a major asset class. As interest in digital assets skyrockets, particularly NFTs featuring iconic figures like Maradona, the market presents enticing opportunities for both collectors and investors. The surge is driven by heightened global interest in owning digital memorabilia of iconic figures like Maradona. NFTs offer certified ownership of digital assets, making them attractive for collectors. The regulatory environment is evolving, with ongoing discussions about their classification, taxation, and intellectual property implications. NFT investments are volatile, subject to market trends and regulatory shifts. Investors should perform due diligence and keep abreast of industry updates to navigate risks effectively.

A blockchain platform completed a radical shift in September 2022 that dropped its electricity usage to nearly zero, Outlook India reported. Ethereum's upgrade, named The Merge, ditched its energy-hungry mining system for a leaner verification process. The network previously burned through 23 million megawatt-hours each year. After the transition, yearly consumption fell to 2,600 megawatt-hours, shrinking from a small country's draw to what a handful of office towers might use. Thousands of machines worldwide competed to crack mathematical equations, with only one winner receiving payment while the rest wasted electricity on failed attempts. Individual transactions now generate less than one-hundredth of a kilogram of CO2, compared to over a hundred kilograms previously. Bitcoin and other mining-dependent networks consume a ton of electricity, drawn from fossil fuel facilities in many cases. This has turned crypto into a lightning rod for climate criticism. With T-Mobile, getting a brand-new phone is finally simple — and it only takes 15 minutes per line to switch over. Plus, once you make the switch, your new phone is eligible for same-day delivery. Many crypto mining facilities now operate using renewable sources such as sun, wind, and hydropower. Some miners help fund green energy projects by buying electricity that grids cannot use. Ethereum's shift shows the sector can shrink its carbon footprint when motivated. Whether competing blockchain networks will make similar moves or cling to electricity-intensive designs remains an open question. The transition expanded who can help secure the network outside of people who are wealthy enough to buy mining gear. App developers working on Ethereum can now call their products climate-friendly, a claim that wasn't available before. This change shows what digital networks can accomplish when they put efficiency first. 💡Dirty Labs makes it easy and affordable to clean your stuff without harsh chemicals What do you think the future of cryptocurrency is? 💰Get TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.
