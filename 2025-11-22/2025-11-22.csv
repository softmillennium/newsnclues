            The US Federal Aviation Administration warned major airlines on Friday of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela and urged them to exercise caution.
    


            The FAA notice cited the “worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela” and said threats could pose risks for aircraft at all altitudes.
    


            There has been a massive American military buildup in the region in recent months, including the US Navy's largest aircraft carrier, at least eight other warships, and F-35 aircraft.
    


            The administration of US President Donald Trump has bombed boats allegedly carrying drugs that have departed from the shoreline of Venezuela and other Latin American countries.
    


            Direct flights by US passenger or cargo carriers to Venezuela have been suspended since 2019, but some US airlines fly over the country for some South American flights.

            American Airlines said on Friday it had stopped overflying Venezuela in October. Delta Air Lines said it had stopped flying over Venezuela “a while ago.” United Airlines did not immediately comment.
    


            The order requires US airlines to provide the FAA with at least 72 hours advance notice of planned flights but stopped short of prohibiting flights over the country.
    


            The FAA said since September there has been an increase in Global Navigation Satellite System interference in Venezuela, which in some cases caused lingering effects throughout a flight, as well as “activity associated with increasing Venezuela military readiness.”
    


            “Venezuela has conducted multiple military exercises and directed the mass mobilization of thousands of military and reserve forces,” the FAA said, adding that at no point had Venezuela expressed an intent to target civil aviation.
    


            The agency said the Venezuelan military possessed advanced fighter aircraft and multiple weapons systems capable of reaching or exceeding civil aircraft operating altitudes, and there was potential low-altitude risk from air defense systems and anti-aircraft artillery.
    


            The FAA said it will continue to monitor the risk environment for US civil aviation operating in the region.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Sheikh Hasina: Bangladesh plans to execute its former leader. There's one big thing in the way: India","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/asia/bangladesh-india-sheikh-hasina-death-sentence-intl-hnk-dst","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 01:01:00 GMT","


            She was once cast as a secular heroine, the daughter of a revolutionary leader, whose brutal assassination in the 1970s defined her political ascent.
    


            But Sheikh Hasina's rise to the top of Bangladesh's politics preceded a stunning fall from power to self-exile in India.
    


            A death sentence delivered in absentia could now see her executed – if New Delhi decides to send her back.
    


            The ousted leader was found guilty of crimes against humanity for the violent suppression of student protests that toppled her regime in 2024.
    


            She fled to India last August after 15 years of increasingly authoritarian rule, seeking refuge in the capital of one of her closest allies.
    


            Now she's become a pawn in a tense standoff between the two countries as Dhaka demands her extradition to face justice for crimes that she insists she did not commit.
    


            “She had to flee the country to flee the rage of the people,” said Bangladeshi political scientist Mubashar Hasan. “Hiding in India and handed down a death penalty. It's quite an extraordinary story.”
    


            Hasina's political journey is a story of Shakespearean proportions – a saga of tragedy, exile and power inextricably linked to the history of her home country.
    


            The eldest daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the charismatic “Father of the Nation,” she was thrust into politics early in life as she witnessed Bangladesh's struggle for autonomy from Pakistan. But it was a single, bloody night in August 1975 that truly forged her path.
    


            In a brutal military coup, army officers assassinated her father, her mother, and three of her brothers in their Dhaka home. Hasina and her sister survived as they were visiting West Germany at the time.
    


            In the chaotic aftermath, Gen. Ziaur Rahman – the husband of her future arch-nemesis, Khaleda Zia – rose to power, his regime passing a law that would protect Mujibur's assassins for decades.
    


            Overnight, Hasina's life was transformed, and she was forced into six years of exile in India, which imprinted a deep respect for the Indian state on the future leader.
    


            When she finally returned to Bangladesh in 1981, it was to a nation clamoring for its founding ideals of secularism. But she also entered a political arena about to be defined by another woman pushed into tragedy: Zia, whose husband had himself been assassinated.
    


            Recalling the day of her return from forced exile, Hasina said: “When I landed at the airport, I didn't get anyone of my (relatives) but received love of millions of people, and that was my only strength.”
    


            Thus began the era of the “Battling Begums” – a deeply personal, yet destructive duel between two women that would grip Bangladesh for the next 30 years.
    


            Taking the helm of her father's Awami League, Hasina embarked on a long journey through the political wilderness, navigating house arrests and crackdowns amid a growing rivalry with Zia. In 1996, Hasina led her party to electoral victory, becoming Prime Minister for the first time.
    


            Her first act in office was to announce the prosecution of those involved in the 1975 coup and murders of her family, finally beginning a quest for justice.
    


            A secular Muslim, Hasina served for one term, losing the next election to Zia. But when she returned to power in 2008, she was seen as a changed leader – someone more resolute, less trusting and determined to permanently secure her position.
    


            For the next 15 years, she ruled Bangladesh with an increasingly iron fist, ushering an era of strong economic growth. At the same time, she gave India crucial support, bolstering New Delhi through economic and security deals in a neighborhood that includes adversaries Pakistan and China.
    


            But Bangladesh's developmental success came at a steep price: human rights organizations warned that she and her government were headed toward a one-party system. Critics expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, voter intimidation, and harassment of the media and opposition figures.
    


            As the pressure mounted, Hasina “could bank on India for full-fledged, no questions asked support,” The Indian Express newspaper reflected in a recent editorial.
    


            At home, however, her image became associated with an aggressive crackdown.
    


            “She committed so much bloodshed to be in power,” the political scientist Hasan said.
    


            Hasina's grip on power was seemingly unbreakable. She had proven adept at surviving storms of popular protest, arrests and assassination attempts, but the youth-led uprising that erupted last year was different.
    


            What began as student demonstrations over civil service job quotas quickly swelled into a nationwide roar for her resignation. The regime's response was a brutal crackdown that, according to the UN human rights office, left as many as 1,400 people dead.
    


            But the bloodshed did not crush the movement – it galvanized it, turning public anger into an unstoppable force that ultimately toppled her government.
    


            “She had to flee,” Hasan said. “That act itself is an acknowledgement of guilt. The people, the forces, everyone turned against her because she pushed the boundaries. She killed, her order was to kill so many.”
    


            Hasina's life as a political refugee in New Delhi brings her story full circle, returning her to the same state of exile she endured nearly half a century ago.
    


            Hasina was tried in absentia and sentenced to death by the International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh's domestic war crimes court – a judicial body that she helped set up. There, Hasina faced charges primarily related to inciting the murder of protesters, ordering demonstrators be hanged, and ordering the use of lethal weapons, drones and helicopters to suppress the unrest.
    


            The court found it “crystal clear” that she had ordered the killing of student demonstrators. The death sentence was met with applause and tears in the courtroom.
    


            “It pacified us a bit,” Abdur Rab, the father of one victim, told Reuters. “But we will be fully content when we see the hangman's rope around her neck.”
    


            India, which also has the death penalty, adopted a neutral stance, noting the verdict and vowing to “engage constructively with all stakeholders.”
    


            Hasina's family has praised New Delhi for giving her refuge. “India has always been a good friend,” Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, told local news agency ANI. “In the crisis, India has essentially saved my mother's life.”
    


            For more than a decade, Hasina was one of India's most steadfast regional allies. Her government was instrumental in cracking down on anti-India insurgent groups that used Bangladeshi territory as a safe haven.
    


            Prime Minister Narendra Modi had previously lauded Hasina for keeping their countries' extensive border secure. Now her government's downfall has raised significant security concerns in New Delhi that radical Islamist groups could re-emerge.
    


            Anil Trigunayat, an Indian diplomat who has served in Bangladesh, said he “doubts very much” that New Delhi will send Hasina home to face prison or death.
    


            The former leader has rejected the allegations against her as a political witch hunt, allowing India to make a potential case that the charges against her were politically motivated.
    


            India's extradition law, as well as its extradition treaty with Bangladesh, contains a “political offense” exception, designed for situations like this, allowing a state to refuse extradition if the crime is political in nature.
    


            “India will have to look at it (as a) political crime, not the crimes against humanity for which she has been charged there,” he said.
    


            But Trigunayat noted that Hasina hasn't exhausted all legal remedies. She can appeal the verdict in Bangladesh's Supreme Court, then potentially the International Criminal Court in The Hague, he said.
    


            “Since not all the remedies are exhausted, India would not be in a rush to send her,” Trigunayat said.
    


            The day Hasina was sentenced, Bangladesh's foreign ministry called on India to hand her over “without delay.”
    


            “This is India's responsibility in keeping with the existing bilateral extradition treaty between both countries,” the ministry said.
    


            Hasina's death sentence sets a tense stage for Bangladesh's elections planned for next February.
    


            With her Awami League now banned and its leadership scattered, the interim government led by former Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus faces the monumental task of steering the nation out of its deeply polarized political culture.
    


            The Awami League's absence leaves the political field open for its chief rival, Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and dozens of other smaller parties, to contest any future election, though experts warn the deep-seated divisions may not be easily resolved.
    


            “Bangladesh is far from reconciliation at this stage,” said the political scientist Hasan.
    


            He says the Awami League may attempt to stage a political comeback, albeit not under Hasina's leadership.
    


            The question now is whether Hasina's demise marks the end of a toxic era, or simply the beginning of a new chapter of uncertainty.

            Hot Stocks 





            Concerns about an AI bubble have been simmering for at least a year and a half. Nvidia's incredibly strong earnings this past week tried to put those fears to bed. It may not have been enough.
    


            Nvidia on Wednesday posted sales and profits up more than 60% year-on-year, stronger than Wall Street had projected. CEO Jensen Huang said “sales are off the charts.” And the company expects fourth quarter revenue of around $65 billion, once again ahead of Wall Street's projections.
    


            Nvidia executives said these results, along with growth from other major AI players and the billions being poured into AI infrastructure, indicate that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.
    


            “There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” Huang said on a call with analysts Wednesday. “From our vantage point, we see something very different.”
    


Nvidia beats earnings expectations, even as bubble concerns mount



            Some Wall Street analysts agree. But the wider market is not yet convinced: After briefly ticking up on Thursday morning following Nvidia's report, the chipmaker's shares (NVDA) dipped back into the red. They closed Friday down 1%, although the stock remains up 29% from the start of this year.
    


            In other words, Nvidia answered a lot of questions about where the industry stands right now, but it may take more to shift the overall AI narrative.
    


            Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company anticipates $3 trillion to $4 trillion in annual AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade, adding that demand “continues to exceed our expectations.” Already, tech giants are expected to pour $400 billion into AI-related capital expenditures this year, to meet what they say is growing demand for AI and cloud services but also to avoid falling behind industry rivals.
    


            Nvidia has every reason to try to reassure investors — expectations for the company are sky-high after nearly two years of astronomical growth. And many look to the chipmaker as a bellwether for the overall tech industry.
    


            Even as Silicon Valley tries to figure out the business model for generative AI, Nvidia has a big role to fill in the existing tech services people use every day, Huang said. That could help insulate Nvidia even if returns from new AI applications are smaller than expected or take longer to arrive than planned.
    


            “The world has a massive investment in non-AI software, from data processing to science and engineering simulations, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in cloud computing spend each year.” Much of the infrastructure powering that software has transitioned from running on older CPU chips to Nvidia's GPUs, the chips known for running AI tools, Huang said.
    


            Kress also took the unusual step of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker's partner's recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads.” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year. And Salesforce's engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it's using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.
    


            Nvidia isn't the only one arguing that AI bubble concerns may be exaggerated.
    


            “The pure Nvidia numbers/guidance and strategic vision shows the AI Revolution is NOT a Bubble…instead its Year 3 of a 10-year build out of this 4th Industrial Revolution in our view,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in emailed commentary.
    


            Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at investment research company Morningstar, said he doesn't “see many signs to suggest that 2026 will be a weak year for Nvidia in any way” and sees the bubble fears weighing on the company's stock as a “buying opportunity.”
    


            But despite those strong results, it appears the stock market may not be ready to relax just yet.
    


            Questions remain about whether tech firms will maintain their massive spending on AI infrastructure, especially as Nvidia has invested in key, unprofitable customers such as OpenAI and Anthropic. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar also raised alarms earlier this month when she suggested that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are incurring to build AI infrastructure. Some took her comments as a sign OpenAI may struggle to afford its commitments, although the company later tried to walk back the statement.
    


            And while Nvidia likely has enough customers even if a bubble burst causes some casualties among AI firms, investors may still be worried about what a downturn or even a slowdown could mean for the larger market.
    


            Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, said questions about the sustainability of Big Tech's infrastructure spending spree and Nvidia's circular funding deals were not “put to rest” with its latest report. Instead, they may just be “punted” to the next quarter.
    


            That means Nvidia almost certainly has more work ahead to convince the world that we're in for an AI boom and not bust.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky will have to agree to a Washington-drafted peace plan otherwise his country will have to keep fighting Russia through the “cold winter,” US President Donald Trump has said.

Zelensky said on Friday that Ukraine was facing “one of the most difficult moments in our history,” being forced to choose between “28 difficult points” in the American proposal or risk losing its key backer, the US. According to Financial Times, Washington has issued an ultimatum to Kiev to accept the plan by Thursday.

Asked by journalists about the Ukrainian leader's stance later in the day, Trump asked: “You mean, he does not like it?”

“He will have to like it and if he does not like it then, you know, they should just keep fighting, I guess,” he said.

Reuters reported earlier that Washington has threatened to cut Ukraine off from intelligence and military aid if it rejects its proposal.

“Well, at some point he [Zelensky] is going to have to accept something,” the US president insisted.

Trump explained that Ukraine faces “a cold winter... but a lot of the big energy producing plants have been under attack, to put it mildly.”

“You remember, right, in the Oval Office not so long ago, I said: ‘You don't have the cards',” he recalled.

The US president was referring to his meeting with Zelensky in February, also attended by Vice President J.D. Vance, which escalated in front of the cameras. It resulted in the Ukrainian leader's visit being cut short, with Trump and Vance accusing him of ingratitude for American aid and not wanting peace.

The US push to persuade Ukraine to agree to its road-map comes amid a corruption scandal in Kiev that according to analysts has significantly weakened Zelensky's political position.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has confirmed that Moscow received the American plan, but added that it has not yet been discussed “in detail.” According to Putin, the proposal could “form the basis of a final peace settlement.”

As many as 250 federal agents are expected to descend on the city imminently – despite falling crime

New Orleanians are bracing for a major deployment of US border patrol officers to the city, as Donald Trump forges on with his mass deportation agenda and sweeping federal immigration crackdown in Democrat-led cities.

Despite falling crime, as many as 250 federal agents are expected to descend on New Orleans imminently to begin laying the groundwork for “Operation Swamp Sweep”, which the Associated Press reported is due to launch in south-east Louisiana and Mississippi on 1 December with the stated aim of arresting 5,000 people.

Trump floated sending in federal troops in September, when he declared New Orleans had “a crime problem”, adding: “We'll straighten that out in two weeks.” The city's violent crime rate is actually 20% lower than last year, including a historic drop in the number of murders.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operation will be led by Gregory Bovino, a senior border patrol commander. Bovino has already overseen aggressive campaigns in Los Angeles, Chicago and, now, Charlotte and other cities in North Carolina, where the crackdowns have triggered large-scale protests and sometimes volatile interactions between federal agents and protesters amid aggressive arrest tactics.

In Chicago, activists organized demonstrations and filed lawsuits over arrests and the use of excessive force, including deployment of teargas and pepper spray.

Activists in Charlotte have already looked to their actions as a blueprint and now, following weeks of reports of raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) circulating across the greater metro area, New Orleans residents are preparing to resist also. Both border patrol officers from the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency and ICE agents come under the umbrella of DHS.

Residents are sharing plans to report ICE sightings, alert landscapers and other manual workers to the threat of enforcement and help escort children to and from school when ICE is in the area. They are also rallying around neighbors believed to be under threat – often because they are undocumented or the Trump administration no longer recognizes a temporary status granted under the Biden administration – using community text threads, social media and whistleblowing – literally blowing whistles in the street if officers are believed to be approaching.

There were reports of construction workers being instructed to stay home on Friday, in case border patrol arrived that early, and businesses such as restaurants and gas stations are being urged not to serve ICE agents.

New Orleans' Mexican-American mayor-elect, Helena Moreno, told the AP there is “a lot of fear” in the city and that she's working to ensure those who could be targeted by federal agents know their legal rights. “I'm very concerned about due process being violated, I'm very concerned about racial profiling,” she said.

Local immigrant advocacy group Unión Migrante already posts about ICE sightings and shares resources in English and Spanish on its social media pages. It also holds regular “Know Your Rights” workshops where people learn what protections they have during a immigration investigation, what to do if they get pulled over in the car by an agent, how to legally film ICE agents and police, and hear legal advice from immigration lawyers.

With enforcement ramping up across the region, volunteer Alfredo Salazar said the workshops are crucial. “I look Latino and I worry I could be arrested for it,” he told local TV channel Fox 8. “It's not just me, but thousands of us here that look Latino. So we have to educate people that we have rights to defend ourselves and freedom of speech.”

The city is known for its rich blend of French, Spanish, African, Native American and Asian cultures, and 14% of its foreign-born metro population are Latino. In Kenner, a suburb of New Orleans, where 13 people were arrested earlier this month in a raid at a boat launch, it's 30%, the highest in the state.

Rachel Taber, also an advocate and organizer with Unión Migrante, told the news site NOLA.com that immigrants and their family members have been contacting lawyers, giving people power-of-attorney in case they are detained, and locating passports in the event they need to travel to reunite with relatives.

The mission has the enthusiastic backing of Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry, a staunch Trump ally, who has made a vigorous push to align state policy with sweeping federal immigration efforts and has targeted New Orleans' immigration policies to make enforcement a priority.

The GOP-dominated state legislature passed a law threatening prison time for law enforcement officials who delay or ignore federal enforcement efforts. Another measure directs state agencies to verify, track and report anyone in the country illegally who is receiving state services. Another more bans city policies that prohibit cooperation with federal immigration agencies.

In September, Landry had also requested a national guard deployment to New Orleans even though violent crime is down and the city's elected leaders maintained that violent crime is down and federal troops are unnecessary. Landry's office has been approached by the Guardian for comment.

Meanwhile, the New Orleans police department (NOPD) was released from a federal reform pact on Wednesday that has long shielded its officers from having to participate in immigration enforcement. Anne Kirkpatrick, NOPD's superintendent, told WBOK radio earlier this week that officers would collaborate with federal agents, but not on raids or deportations.

“We will not be participating in the removal, but we will always be there,” she said. “They're coming, so I am going to be a collaborator. But I also want to emphasize something to our community: To be in our country undocumented is illegal. To be illegal is not criminal.”

DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Temporary hold on lower court ruling will remain in place while supreme court considers whether to allow new map

The US supreme court on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that found Texas's 2026 congressional redistricting plan pushed by Donald Trump likely discriminated on the basis of race.

The order, signed by Justice Samuel Alito, will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map, which is favorable to Republicans, to be used in the midterm elections.

The court's conservative majority has blocked similar lower court rulings because they have come too close to elections.

The order came about an hour after the state called on the high court to intervene to avoid confusion as congressional primary elections approach in March. The justices have blocked past lower-court rulings in congressional redistricting cases, most recently in Alabama and Louisiana, that came several months before elections.

The order was signed by Alito because he is the justice who handles emergency appeals from Texas.

Texas redrew its congressional map in the summer as part of Trump's efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year's elections, touching off a nationwide redistricting battle. The new redistricting map was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats, but a panel of federal judges in El Paso ruled 2-1 on Tuesday that the civil rights groups that challenged the map on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters were likely to win their case.

If that ruling eventually holds, Texas could be forced to hold elections next year using the map drawn by the GOP-controlled legislature in 2021 based on the 2020 census.

Texas was the first state to meet Trump's demands in what has become an expanding national battle over redistricting. Republicans drew the state's new map to give the GOP five additional seats, and Missouri and North Carolina followed with new maps adding an additional Republican seat each. To counter those moves, California voters approved a ballot initiative to give Democrats an additional five seats there.

The redrawn maps are facing court challenges in California, Missouri and North Carolina.

The supreme court is separately considering a case from Louisiana which could further limit race-based districts under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It's not entirely clear how the current round of redistricting would be affected by the outcome in the Louisiana case.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President claims he is ‘immediately' terminating temporary protected status in US state with largest Somali community

Donald Trump said on Friday night he was “immediately” terminating temporary legal protections for Somali migrants living in Minnesota, further targeting a program seeking to limit deportations that his administration has already repeatedly sought to weaken.

Minnesota has the nation's largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs.

But how many migrants would be affected by Trump's announcement that he wants to end temporary protected status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Congress created the program granting temporary protective status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.

The designation can be granted by the homeland security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.

The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.

“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote. “It's OVER!”

Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.

That included ending TPS for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection under President Joe Biden. The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The first G20 summit to be held in Africa opened yesterday with an ambitious agenda to make progress on solving some of the long-standing problems that have afflicted the world's poorest nations.

Leaders and top government officials from the richest and leading emerging economies came together at an exhibition center near Soweto in South Africa — once home to Nelson Mandela — to try and find some consensus on the priorities set out by the host country.

They include more help for poor countries to recover from climate-related disasters, reduce their foreign debt burdens, transition to green energy sources and harness their own critical mineral wealth — all in an attempt to counter widening global inequality.

“We'll see,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on if the G20 could prioritize developing world countries and make meaningful reforms. “But I think South Africa has done its part in putting those things clearly upon the table.”

The two-day summit takes place without the world's biggest economy after US President Donald Trump ordered a US boycott of the summit over his claims that South Africa is pursuing racist anti-white policies and persecuting its white Afrikaner minority.

A months-long diplomatic rift between the US and South Africa deepened in the buildup, but while Trump's boycott dominated the pre-talks talk in Johannesburg and threatened to undercut the agenda, some of the leaders were eager to move on.

“I do regret it,” French President Emmanuel Macron said of Trump's absence. “But it should not block us. Our duty is to be present, engage and work all together because we have so many challenges.”

The G20 is a group of 21 members that includes 19 nations, the EU and the African Union.

The bloc was formed in 1999 as a bridge between rich and poor nations to confront global financial crises. 

While it often operates in the shadow of the G7 made up of the richest democracies, G20 members together represent about 85 percent of the world's economy, 75 percent of international trade and more than half the global population.

However, it works on consensus rather than any binding resolutions, and that is often hard to come by with the different interests of its members.

Guterres cautioned that rich nations have often failed to make the concessions required to strike effective climate or global financial reform agreements.

G20 summits traditionally end with a leaders' declaration — which details any broad agreement reached by the members — but even that was proving hard to come by in Johannesburg.

South Africa said the US was exerting pressure on it not to issue any leaders' declaration in the absence of the US and instead tone down the final document to a unilateral statement from the host country.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa responded to that by saying “we will not be bullied” and has promised a declaration from all members present at the close of the summit today.

Even so, the direction of the G20 bloc is likely to change sharply, as the US takes over the rotating presidency from South Africa at the end of this summit and the Trump administration has derided the focus on climate change and inequality.

The only role the US would play at this summit would be when a representative from the US embassy in South Africa attends the formal handover ceremony at the end to accept the G20 presidency, the White House said.

South Africa said it is an insult for Ramaphosa to hand over to what it considers to be a junior diplomatic official.

US President Donald Trump's bid to rekindle the kind of economic supremacy that saw the 1900s dubbed “America's Century” risks isolating it from the region that is laying claim to the 2000s — Asia.

Trade ties forged over decades are running up against the steepest US tariff wall since the 1940s. People-to-people interactions are fraying as Chinese students are turned off by visa roadblocks and Singaporean tourists prefer Asian getaways.

Where Trump has notched wins — including US$900 billion in investment pledges from Tokyo and Seoul — incidents such as a shock immigration raid that led to the detention of more than 300 South Korean workers in September have shaken trust.

From the corridors of the sandstone Secretariat Building in New Delhi to the halls of Beijing's Zhongnanhai (中南海) compound, leaders across a region that remains the world's main growth engine are rewiring their economies to work around Trump's “America First” policies.

India and China are seeking to put aside a decades-long border dispute to deepen cooperation. North Asia's biggest economies are pledging to boost trade ties, although rivalries such as the latest China-Japan spat make it a bumpy process. Southeast Asian countries are trying to chart a neutral course, even as they are increasingly entwined economically with China.

Ten months into his second term, it is too early to make a definitive judgment on Trump's efforts to realign the global economy in the US' favor, bringing shuttered factories — and the jobs they create — humming back to life.

Investment pledges from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co into new chip fabrication plants and HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Co into long-neglected ship yards may yet revitalize strategic industries on US shores. The tariff shock to US inflation, growth and markets that economists warned of has yet to materialize. 

The risk is clear: The US is cutting itself off from a region set to comprise about 60 percent of the global economy by 2050 versus just 11 percent for the US, Bloomberg Economics said. 

For China, Trump's tariffs and retaliation from Beijing threaten to slash trade by half, even after the two sides hit pause on some export restrictions late last month.

China remains the world's manufacturing powerhouse, even if a property slump means growth is running slower than the pre-COVID-19 years. Its leaders have just mapped out an ambitious plan to keep closing the gap on strategic technologies such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI), and support future industries including quantum computing and nuclear fusion. 

China's high-tech sector now accounts for more than 15 percent of GDP, up from less than 11 percent in 2017, Bloomberg Economics estimated. When it comes to AI, China is rapidly closing the gap with the US thanks to lower cost models such as DeepSeek, whose R1 stunned Silicon Valley with its sophistication this year.

Trump during his meeting on Oct. 30 with Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) in Busan, South Korea, secured the resumption of soybean sales and rare earths flows, while the US agreed to suspend a rule expanding restrictions on blacklisted Chinese firms. 

The US president also announced his 20 percent fentanyl tariff would be halved, shaving the average rate on Chinese goods to 31 percent, Bloomberg Economics said. However, that is still too high for China's factories — operating on razor thin profit margins — to turn a profit on US sales. And on semiconductors, progress continues to be measured in nanometers, with a rumored shift to allow Nvidia Corp to sell its advanced Blackwell chips to China failing to materialize.

Washington's Quad partner New Delhi has been shocked by the punitive 50 percent tariffs and bellicose rhetoric directed its way for oil purchases that Trump said is helping fuel Russia's war in Ukraine. In his quest for lower levies, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to describe Trump as a “friend.” However, the political mood has swung against the US, with Modi's main political rival Rahul Gandhi describing Trump as a “bully” and his tariffs as “economic blackmail.”

Trump's approach to India helped accelerate a rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing. The two sides are now trying to put a deadly 2020 border clash in the past and deepen commercial links — a dance that Xi has dubbed the “Dragon-Elephant Tango.”

Behind closed doors, Indian officials are realizing they need Chinese investment to further their plans to boost manufacturing. For China, which is facing an aging population and battling industrial overcapacity, improved relations with India offer access to a rapidly growing market.

Indeed, by the end of this decade, India would have picked up the global growth baton with its contribution swelling in following decades, Bloomberg Economics forecasts showed.

As Trump throws up the trade barriers, intra-Asian trade is becoming freer. Just a day after Trump wrapped up a trip to Malaysia, Chinese Premier Li Qiang (李強) and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim oversaw the signing of an agreement in Kuala Lumpur to expand the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area. During a speech, Li sought to project his nation as a champion of free trade and called for unity with the 11-nation grouping.

“Interference by external forces in our region is rising, and many countries are being unreasonably subjected to high tariffs,” Li said. “Faced with strong political and economic bullying, disunity and confrontation will not only bring no benefits, but will lead to division and rule by external forces.” 

The expanding BRICS group — which now includes Indonesia — is an additional avenue for China to build ties, as capitals across the region fret about unraveling relations with Washington.

And it is not just fewer goods headed to the US. Student arrivals to the US dropped 19 percent in August year-on-year to just more than 313,000 — the fifth consecutive month of declines, International Trade Administration data showed. That is the lowest number of students entering the US for August — a peak month ahead of the start of the academic semester — since 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Indian academics decreased by 45 percent, while those from China dropped 12 percent.

Trump's move to slap a US$100,000 fee on new H-1B applications for skilled workers would disproportionately hurt Indians, who account for two-thirds of the visas. Indian outsourcers led by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd had been heavy users of the program to deploy tens of thousands of engineers across US clients, from Citigroup Inc to Walmart Inc.

Trump's US has also become less appealing to tourists from places such as Singapore, whose high-spending travelers are instead vacationing within Asia. 

About 80 percent of travelers in Southeast Asia said the US is losing appeal as a destination due to concerns over discrimination, Trump's policies and gun violence, a CNBC Travel survey showed. 

In a noodle bowl of trade, investment and people-to-people interactions, not all ties have been severed — or even frayed — and some new connections are evolving. At the business-to-business level, companies such as Apple Inc have secured carve outs from Trump's sweeping tariff campaign, and Chinese firms have leveraged their market dominance to maintain sales worth about US$1 billion a day to US importers. 

Investment pledges from Asian nations and companies now run into the hundreds of billions of US dollars. Even if much of that is smoke and mirrors, there could be a lot of Asian money — and manufacturing — heading toward the US.

For US power in the Asia-Pacific region, there is also a kind of automatic stabilizer built in: The more China's might rises, the more its neighbors would seek US support as a counter balance.

For one of the world's most China-dependent developed economies, Australia, that means locking into a multi-decade nuclear submarine agreement with Washington to counter any expansionist moves from Beijing. South Korea and the US are in private negotiations to jointly build nuclear-powered subs, too. For China's historic rival Japan, it means increasing defense spending, and committing to a vast and vague US$550 billion US investment pledge to win Trump's favor. 

For Trump and his supporters, the benefits of breaking ties might be worth the cost of doing so. Why carry on free trade with China when it is using the proceeds to accelerate its challenge to US economic and geopolitical supremacy? Why allow hundreds of thousands of Indian engineers into the country when investing in US workers would pay higher dividends?

Free trade or national security? Comparative advantage or America First? Offshoring to boost profits or onshoring to boost wages? The argument from Trump and his team is that past administrations paid too much attention to the first half of those pairings, and that their job is to restore balance by paying more attention to the second. 

It is an argument that finds some support in the data: China's rise as an export powerhouse coincides with an accelerated decline in US factory jobs and stagnant incomes for the US' middle class. More importantly, it is an argument that has won support at the ballot box, catapulting Trump into two terms as president. 

However, as a policy package, it is hardly cost free. The US has already transitioned from friend and ally to something some capitals regard as a rival and others as a bully. In the years ahead, if tariffs sever trade ties, people-to-people connections cool and investments fail to materialize, the US might end up as little more than a bystander in the Asian 21st century.



                                                                                “Si ambulat loquitur tetrissitatque sicut anas, anas est” is, in customary international law, the three-part test of anatine ambulation, articulation and tetrissitation. And it is essential to Taiwan's existence. Apocryphally, it can be traced as far back as Suetonius (蘇埃托尼烏斯) in late first-century Rome. Alas, Suetonius was only talking about ducks (anas).
But this self-evident principle was codified as a four-part test at the Montevideo Convention in 1934, to which the United States is a party. Article One: “The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: a) a permanent population; b) a defined territory; c) government;                                    



                                                                                The central bank and the US Department of the Treasury on Friday issued a joint statement that both sides agreed to avoid currency manipulation and the use of exchange rates to gain a competitive advantage, and would only intervene in foreign-exchange markets to combat excess volatility and disorderly movements. The central bank also agreed to disclose its foreign-exchange intervention amounts quarterly rather than every six months, starting from next month. It emphasized that the joint statement is unrelated to tariff negotiations between Taipei and Washington, and that the US never requested the appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar during the                                    



                                                                                Since leaving office last year, former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) has been journeying across continents. Her ability to connect with international audiences and foster goodwill toward her country continues to enhance understanding of Taiwan. It is possible because she can now walk through doors in Europe that are closed to President William Lai (賴清德).
Tsai last week gave a speech at the Berlin Freedom Conference, where, standing in front of civil society leaders, human rights advocates and political and business figures, she highlighted Taiwan's indispensable global role and shared its experience as a model for democratic resilience against cognitive warfare and                                    



                                                                                The diplomatic spat between China and Japan over comments Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi made on Nov. 7 continues to worsen. Beijing is angry about Takaichi's remarks that military force used against Taiwan by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) could constitute a “survival-threatening situation” necessitating the involvement of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. Rather than trying to reduce tensions, Beijing is looking to leverage the situation to its advantage in action and rhetoric. 
On Saturday last week, four armed China Coast Guard vessels sailed around the Japanese-controlled Diaoyutai Islands (釣魚台), known to Japan as the Senkakus.

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

U.S. politicians have sent a sharp warning that U.S. President Donald Trump's new peace proposal rewards ""Russian butchery"" and undermines international security. 

""Rewarding Russian butchery would be disastrous to America's interests,"" U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell said in an X post. 

""And a capitulation like Biden's abandonment of Afghanistan would be catastrophic to a legacy of peace through strength.""

In the latest push to end the war in Ukraine at any cost, Trump is pressing Kyiv to accept a peace proposal built around sweeping Russian demands, such as surrendering the entire Donbas region and capping the size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, in return for a Western security guarantee. 

Trump set Kyiv a Nov. 27 deadline to decide whether to accept the demands or lose the support of its most powerful ally.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine faces ""an extremely difficult choice,"" which would lead to either losing its dignity or risking the loss of a key ally. Many in Ukraine, from politicians to soldiers risking their lives for their country's independence, view the proposal as ""capitulation."" 

Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick said on Nov. 21 that he and his allies have launched a discharge petition ""to force a vote on crushing Russian sanctions immediately upon our return."" A discharge petition can bypass the committee leadership if at least 218 of the 435 representatives sign it. 

""Today, we have officially notified both the Clerk of the House and House leadership,"" Fitzpatrick said on X, stressing that ""Russian-drafted propaganda must be rejected."" 

Republican representative Don Bacon said on Nov. 21 that he would be signing the petition, adding that ""Congress needs to inject itself into this appeasement by the Administration towards Russia."" 

Republican Senator Roger Wicker also criticized Trump's proposal on Nov. 21, saying that it has ""real problems"" and that he is ""highly skeptical"" that it would achieve peace. 

""Ukraine should not be forced to give up its lands to one of the world's most flagrant war criminals in Vladimir Putin,"" Wicker said, adding that ""the size and disposition of Ukraine's armed forces is a sovereign choice for its government and people.""

""In particular, any suggestion that we can pursue arms control with a serial liar and killer like Putin should be treated with great skepticism.""

Democrat Senator Jeanne Shaheen also said in an interview with CNN that the U.S. should be putting more pressure on Moscow, such as by putting secondary sanctions on companies helping Russia's war efforts, and providing Ukraine's long-awaited long-range weapons to Kyiv. 

Stressing that the U.S. should not be ""representing Russia"" in the peace deal, Shaheen called on Washington to ""bring Putin to the (negotiating) table."" 

""This is a Putin plan for Ukraine,"" Shaheen, the most senior Democrat at the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said on Nov. 21.

She was also featured in the Media Development Foundation's “25 under 25: Young and Bold” 2023 list of emerging media makers in Ukraine. 

If President Volodymyr Zelensky refuses to accept the terms of the 28-point-plan, ""then he can continue to fight his little heart out,"" Trump added. 

Nine Ukrainian officials, including Andriy Yermak, Head of the President's Office, and Kyrylo Budanov, the country's military intelligence chief, are set to attend the meeting, according to a presidential decree published on November 22. 

Search and rescue operations in the western Ukrainian city continue into their fourth day, officials reported on Nov. 22.





""We welcome the continued US efforts to bring peace to Ukraine,"" the leaders of the European Union, the U.K., France, Germany, Canada, Japan, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Norway, and Finland said in a statement after meeting on the sidelines of a G20 summit. 

The decision was made following an agreement reached by Lukashenko with U.S. President Donald Trump, at Ukraine's request.

U.S. President Donald Trump is pressing Ukraine to accept a new peace proposal built around sweeping Russian demands, giving Kyiv until Nov. 27 to decide whether it will accept the demands or lose American support.

The push marks Trump's latest attempt to end Russia's all-out war, now approaching its fourth year, and as President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 21, ""Ukraine may soon face an extremely difficult choice. Either the loss of dignity or the risk of losing a key partner.""

The Kyiv Independent unpacks why this new U.S. push is different in substance, timing, and the people driving it.

At the center of Trump's proposal is a sweeping territorial concession: Ukraine would surrender the entire eastern Donbas region — both Russian-occupied areas and the parts still controlled by Ukrainian troops.

While Russia has occupied all but a few villages in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine continues to hold significant parts of Donetsk Oblast, including key cities Pokrovsk, Sloviansk, and Kramatorsk.

Under the plan, Ukrainian forces would withdraw from these remaining areas, which would then be designated a demilitarized zone.

The territory would be internationally recognized as belonging to Russia, though Russian troops would be prohibited from entering the zone.

The framework also envisions de facto recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk — not by Ukraine, but by the United States.

Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts would be frozen along the current front line, locking in Moscow's advances.

Ukraine's Armed Forces would be capped at 600,000. Kyiv would pause its NATO aspirations and agree not to host foreign troops, remaining a non-nuclear state.

In return, the Kremlin would pledge not to attack Ukraine or other European countries and codify that commitment in Russian law.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin has a history of bending Russia's legal framework — first to extend presidential terms, then to nullify them — raising doubts that such a pledge would endure.

The economic component of the plan is ambiguous.

It calls for Russia's reintegration into the global economy, lifting sanctions in stages while launching U.S.-Russia cooperation on energy, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and rare-earth projects. Russia would eventually return to what is now the G7.

Frozen Russian assets would be partially redirected to rebuild Ukraine — matched by European contributions — while the rest would finance joint U.S.-Russian ventures.

Western governments froze around $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Kyiv has repeatedly urged the G7 and EU to move from freezing to confiscating those funds and using them to finance Ukraine's defense.

At the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, currently under Russian occupation, the plan proposes restarting operations under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) oversight. Electricity would be split equally between Russia and Ukraine.

Before Russia seized the nuclear power plant in 2022, the plant generated around 20% of Ukraine's electricity.

The plan also includes a U.S. security commitment: Any future Russian attack would trigger a ""decisive coordinated military response,"" alongside the immediate reinstatement of sanctions.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Kyiv Independent that the proposal aims to provide ""full security guarantees and deterrence"" while creating financial opportunities for Ukraine's reconstruction and Russia's reentry into the global economy.

""This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation... to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,"" she added.

Putin said that the proposal had been under discussion during the Alaska meeting, claiming Washington had asked Moscow to ""show flexibility"" — and that Russia agreed.

He described the 28-point document as a ""modernized"" version of those earlier talks.

Putin added that the U.S. has not discussed the plan publicly beyond broad outlines, but argued it could serve as a basis for negotiations with Ukraine.

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has been shaping the plan in direct coordination with Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's top economic negotiator and one of the Kremlin's main backchannel operators, according to a source in Ukraine's President's Office.

A senior U.S. official told the Kyiv Independent that Witkoff spent the past month collecting feedback from both Kyiv and Moscow.

But his involvement runs deeper.

The Kyiv Independent has learned from a source familiar with the matter that he is operating a shadow channel inside the White House with Dmitriev, undermining pro-Ukraine figures.

A real estate mogul before entering government, Witkoff has no diplomatic background, yet has become one of the central architects of a proposal that closely resembles the Kremlin's terms.

This proposal arrives at a moment of acute pressure for Ukraine — militarily, politically, and economically.

On the battlefield, Russian forces continue advancing toward Pokrovsk, the main target of Moscow's offensive. The city has become the center of a 10–15 kilometer (5–10 mile) ""killzone,"" where Russian strikes have cut off Ukrainian supply routes, forcing troops to travel on foot.

Prominent activist Serhii Sternenko warned on Nov. 17 that Ukraine faces a ""disaster of strategic magnitude,"" citing repeated failures to build fortifications and prepare new defensive lines.

""Our defense is falling apart,"" Sternenko, who works closely with various military units to supply their immediate needs, such as drones, said. ""Under a stunning silence about it.""

Russian forces have even opened sudden fronts this year in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy oblasts.

The Kyiv Independent also learned from a senior U.S. official that Washington views Ukraine's worsening energy situation as urgent. Russia continues to strike the power grid ahead of winter.

But the political pressure may be even heavier.

Ukraine is reeling from a corruption scandal — the largest of Zelensky's tenure.

The scandal stems from an investigation alleging that Timur Mindich, a close Zelensky ally, ran a scheme skimming kickbacks from energy construction and procurement — including projects to fortify Ukraine's energy infrastructure — and laundering the profits.

Eight suspects have been charged, including figures tied to presidential associates and several ministers. National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov is under investigation, though he has not been charged.

A Kyiv Independent source familiar with the U.S. proposal said the Kremlin has hardened its maximalist conditions, sensing Ukraine's worsening position on the front lines and exploiting the fallout from the corruption scandal.

Against this backdrop, Trump appears unusually impatient.

""I've had a lot of deadlines,"" Trump told Fox News. ""But Thursday is it.""

Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (AntAC), told the Kyiv Independent that Umerov has been representing Ukraine in the ongoing peace talks.

The plan's rollout has already caused turbulence in Kyiv. A senior U.S. official contradicted Umerov's earlier claim that he had not modified any clauses in the peace plan.

The issue centers on a point that originally proposed an audit of all international aid to Ukraine.

In a later version, the clause was altered to offer ""full amnesty for actions during the war"" for all parties, including Russia, despite its widespread, well-documented war crimes.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Ukraine changed the clause, with its correspondent Yaroslav Trofimov saying Umerov was responsible.

Umerov, who earlier served as defense minister, dismissed the reports as ""unverified information,"" saying he only organized meetings and did not approve or change any points.

But the senior U.S. official told the Kyiv Independent this was false.

""This plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of Zelensky's administration, Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to Zelensky,"" the official said.

When asked why Umerov would push for such a change, a pro-government Ukrainian lawmaker told the Kyiv Independent that ""maybe it's related to the investigation.""

A source in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that reports about Umerov signing on the plan ""are fake.""

Ukraine's President's Office confirmed on Nov. 21 that Zelensky has received ""a draft plan which, according to the American side, could revitalize diplomacy.""

The Ukrainian president avoided rejecting the plan outright.

After his meeting with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, who was visiting Kyiv, Zelensky said teams from Ukraine and the U.S. will work on points of the plan to end the war.


""Ukraine may soon face an extremely difficult choice.""
    

""We are ready for constructive, honest, and efficient work,"" he added.

In a national address on Nov. 21, he said Ukraine is facing ""one of the most difficult moments,"" describing the diplomatic environment as ""complicated"" and acknowledging the risk of damaging key alliances.

""Ukraine may soon face an extremely difficult choice,"" he said.

""Either 28 complicated points or the hardest winter yet — and the risks that follow.""

He said Ukraine's position will be based on national priorities.

""We will pursue a calm dialogue with America and all of our partners,"" he added. ""There will be a constructive search for solutions with our main partner.""

The Kyiv Independent learned from multiple sources that European partners were not included in drafting the U.S. plan — nor was Ukraine.

Zelensky held a phone call with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Nov. 21, discussing both the U.S. plan and the broader European security picture.

""We are working on a document prepared by the American side. It should be a plan that will ensure a real and dignified peace,"" Zelensky said after the call.

EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, warned that any peace plan must include Ukraine and Europe.

""We have not heard of any concessions on the Russian side. If Russia really wanted peace, it could have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire already some time ago,"" she said.

In his address, Zelensky warned Ukrainians that the coming week ""will be very difficult and eventful,"" with political and information pressure intensifying.

Kyiv plans to ""work"" with the U.S. and search for ""constructive solutions,"" he added.

With Trump's deadline to sign the peace deal by Thanksgiving looming, the next steps are uncertain — and closely watched in Kyiv, Washington, and Moscow.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

The Yany Kapu electric substation in northern Crimea was targeted by drones overnight on Nov. 22, Telegram channel Astra reported.

Residents reported explosions and strikes, which the outlet determined to have targeted the crucial substation.

The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the details, and Ukraine's military has not commented on the attack.

Ukraine regularly strikes military and energy infrastructure in its occupied territories and deep within Russia in an attempt to diminish Russian fighting power as Moscow continues to wage its war.

Russia's oil and gas production has come under attack as Kyiv attempts to cripple Moscow's primary source of funding for its war in Ukraine.

An oil refinery was hit in Ryazan Oblast overnight on Nov. 20, Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi, commander of Ukraine's Drone Systems Forces confirmed on Nov. 20.

According to Brovdi, 1st Separate Center for Unmanned Systems ""Magyar's Birds"" hit the Ryazan oil refinery overnight. It sold 13 million tons of fuel last year.

""Gasoline is now gradually becoming a scarce commodity in Russia, while gas and oil are quickly running out,"" he said.

The decision was made following an agreement reached by Lukashenko with U.S. President Donald Trump, at Ukraine's request.

The crop-to-connoisseur approach of Black Fox Farm and Distillery impressed judges at the International Wine and Spirits Competition who named the family-owned Saskatoon operation Worldwide Whisky Producer of the Year. The global producer trophy from the U.K.-based competition recognizes a distillery's portfolio, innovation and commitment to quality.

Co-owners John Cote and Barb Stefanyshyn-Cote are fifth-generation farmers who expanded their focus from grain farming to distilling in 2015, growing 95 per cent of their own grains and producing a range of small-batch whisky, gins and liqueurs with ingredients harvested on the property. Flavours derived from the site are amplified by aging whisky and select gin barrels outdoors throughout the year exposing the spirits to the elements, including temperature extremes that can swing from 40 degrees C in summer to -40 degrees in winter.

“Canadian whisky has traditionally been led by massive brands, so it's nice to see a craft element coming through,” Judge Joel Harrison explains in a release from the London-based competition. The awards committee was impressed by Black Fox's commitment to craft distilling and an extreme soil to still embrace of its location.

Black Fox's recognition in the whisky category was merited by gold medal awards granted to a limited release Blended Canadian Whisky from 2024 and Single Grain Canadian Whisky, produced from triticosecale, a hybrid of wheat and rye propagated in the 19th century. The distillery also received a near-perfect 99-point score for its Haskap Gin, a result achieved by only three other gins since the competition was founded in 1970.

The founders credit their success achieved over the past decade to patience, purpose and pride in where they come from.

Canadian whisky is good, actually

“It's nice to have this spotlight on the interesting things happening in this country and our distillery in particular,” says John Cote, who promotes the authenticity of each bottle produced with an individual serial number that can be used online to receive a certificate of provenance outlining production dates and details. The information sheet for Black Fox whisky outlines specifics about grain type as well as fun facts stating minimum and maximum temperatures experienced during barrel aging and the number of days with 20-degree temperature swings.

“It's important to share that degree of traceability,” he explains.

Cote light-heartedly says the win in London offers his enterprise “a week in the spotlight,” but it's clear how the couple keys on international and domestic competitions to benchmark their quality against other distilleries. “It is a good news story, but you also get a sense of where Canada fits in on the world stage and what we specifically bring to the table.”

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation follows a public fallout with the U.S. President Donald Trump, as the congresswoman criticized him for his stance on the Epstein files, along with foreign policy and health care.Rod Lamkey/The Associated Press

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a once-loyal supporter of President Donald Trump who has become a critic, said Friday she is resigning from Congress in January.

Greene, in a more than 10-minute video posted online, explained her decision and said she's “always been despised in Washington, D.C., and just never fit in.”

Greene's resignation followed a public fallout with Trump in recent months, as the congresswoman criticized him for his stance on files related to Jeffrey Epstein, along with foreign policy and health care.

Trump branded her a “traitor” and “wacky” and said he would endorse a challenger against her when she ran for re-election next year.

She said her last day would be Jan. 5, 2026.

The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Friday night.

Greene was one of the most vocal and visible supporters of Trump's Make America Great Again politics, and she embraced some of his unapologetic political style.

Her break with him was a notable fissure in his grip over conservatives, particularly his most ardent base. But her decision to step down in the face of his opposition put her on the same track as many of the more moderate establishment Republicans before her who went crosswise with Trump.

Greene had been closely tied to the Republican president since she launched her political career five years ago.

In her video Friday, she underscored her long-time loyalty to Trump except on a few issues, and said it was “unfair and wrong” that he attacked her for disagreeing.

“Loyalty should be a two-way street and we should be able to vote our conscience and represent our district's interest, because our job title is literally ‘representative,'” she said.

Greene swept to office at the forefront of Trump's MAGA movement and swiftly became a lightning rod on Capitol Hill for her often beyond-mainstream views.

As she embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory and appeared with white supremacists, Greene was opposed by party leaders but welcomed by Trump. He called her “a real WINNER!”

Trump breaks with Marjorie Taylor Greene as feud between former allies escalates

Yet over time she proved a deft legislator, having aligned herself with then-GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who would go on to become House speaker. She was a trusted voice on the right flank, until McCarthy was ousted in 2023.

While there has been an onslaught of lawmakers from both parties heading for the exits ahead of next fall's midterm elections, as the House struggles through an often chaotic session, Greene's announced retirement will ripple throughout the ranks — and raise questions about her next moves.

Greene was first elected to the House in 2020. She initially planned to run in a competitive district in northern Atlanta's suburbs, but relocated to the much more conservative 14th District in Georgia's northwest corner.

She showed a penchant for harsh rhetoric and conspiracy theories even before her election, suggesting a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was a co-ordinated attack to spur support for new gun restrictions. In 2018, she endorsed the idea that the U.S. government perpetrated the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and mused that a “so-called” plane had hit the Pentagon.

Greene argued in 2019 that Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., both Muslim women, weren't “official” members of Congress because they used Qurans rather than Bibles in their swearing-in ceremonies.

Greene was once a sympathizer with QAnon, an online network that believes a global cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals, including U.S. government leaders, operates a child sex trafficking ring. She eventually distanced herself, saying she got “sucked into some of the things I had seen on the internet.”

Refusing to bow to pressure from the Trump administration, G20 leaders have approved a declaration on climate change, debt relief and other priorities that the United States has rejected.

The agreement was announced in the opening minutes of the summit of Group of 20 leaders on Saturday morning in Johannesburg, despite strong objections from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which is boycotting the summit.

South African officials on Saturday shared a video showing dozens of negotiators applauding loudly and cheering in celebration after they reached the agreement in closed-door talks a day earlier. The deal was then announced by the host leader, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, at the start of the opening session.

“There has been overwhelming consensus and agreement that one of the tasks we should undertake, right at the beginning, is to execute the task we have come here for principally -- which is, by overwhelming consensus, to adopt our declaration,” Mr. Ramaphosa told the G20 leaders.

The reaction from the summit leaders was not included in official broadcasts, but South African foreign ministry spokesperson Clayson Monyela said in a social media post: “The plenary room just erupted with applause.”

G20 summit in South Africa overshadowed by eleventh-hour dispute over U.S. participation

Argentina, a strong ally of Mr. Trump, later questioned the announcement. An Argentinian official, speaking at the opening session, said there was no consensus on some points of the declaration, including the wording of a sentence on seeking peace in Palestinian territories. The declaration lists “the Occupied Palestinian Territory” as one of several conflicts where the G20 leaders are seeking a just and lasting peace.

Mr. Ramaphosa, however, said Argentina was given a chance to voice its misgivings and had still agreed to adopt the declaration.

The final declaration, released to journalists on Saturday, does not describe its text as a formal G20 commitment. Instead, it says the declaration was an agreement among “leaders of the G20, who gathered in Johannesburg.”

The declaration includes several paragraphs on fighting climate change, promoting a transition to renewable energy and providing debt relief to low-income countries – issues that the Trump administration has largely rejected.

The United States was the only G20 country that refused to attend the summit, the first G20 summit to be held on African soil. Eighteen of the G20 countries, along with the European Union and the African Union, both of which are official members of the group, were represented at the summit by their top leaders or senior officials.

When it became clear that the G20 negotiators were still working on a final declaration despite the U.S. boycott, the White House issued its objections and said it was “shameful” to announce a declaration without U.S. agreement. It said the G20 should merely issue a closing statement by its host country, which would carry no official weight. But South Africa rejected those demands.

G20 envoys agree on draft leaders' declaration despite U.S. boycott, sources say

“There is overwhelming support for every paragraph in the final declaration, which was reached by consensus,” said Zane Dangor, director-general of South Africa's foreign ministry and one of the negotiators who struck the deal.

Mr. Trump announced the U.S. boycott earlier this month after falsely accusing South Africa of “slaughtering” its white minority and illegally seizing the farmland of white farmers. No other country boycotted the summit, although several, including Argentina, sent only a foreign minister or other senior official.

Less than two days before the summit began, the United States requested permission to send a delegation of eight diplomats to attend the G20's closing session to receive a formal handover from South Africa, since the group's next summit will be held in Miami next year. South Africa rejected the proposal. By Saturday, there was still no agreement on U.S. participation.

Prime Minister Mark Carney and Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand, who attended the summit, did not comment publicly on the G20 declaration on Saturday, but Ms. Anand said the federal government agreed with South Africa's official summit themes of solidarity, equality and sustainability.

“The bottom line is, yes, it's a great day for multilateralism,” Ms. Anand told journalists on Saturday afternoon after the G20's opening session.

“Canada looks forward to ensuring that we are fulfilling the work that this G20 multilateral conference aims to achieve.”

Three children were among those injured when a grizzly emerged from the forest in a remote part of Canada and charged a group of 20 kids and their teachers.

Four people, including three children, were injured after a grizzly bear attacked a school group in a remote part of Canada.

Two of the injured were in critical condition and two in serious condition, the Health Services Authority said Friday. All four remain hospitalized.

The attack occurred on Thursday in the Bella Coola area of British Columbia (BC), when a bear charged a group of 20 children and their teachers.

""In my 34 years of experience, I have not seen a [bear] attack like this with such a large group of people,"" Inspector Kevin Van Damme of the BC Conservation Officer Service told reporters.

Authorities have urged people to stay out of the area while they search for the bear.

The students and teachers had stopped on the trail when the bear emerged from the forest and attacked the group.

According to conservation officials, teachers intervened, using bear spray and a bear banger to repel the attack and ""put themselves in harm's way to protect the children.""

""I want to thank the teachers for their heroism,"" provincial Premier David Eby said.

The group was from the Acwsalcta School, run by the Indigenous Nuxalk Nation.

Conflicts with humans often increase as winter approaches, when grizzlies seek fat reserves for hibernation.

Reports of bear encounters have risen in Bella Coola, which has a large grizzly population. But officials warn this doesn't mean bears are becoming more aggressive overall.

""One individual bear could increase conflicts,"" Inspector Van Damme said. ""It's not necessarily generic across the population.""

The deceased is believe to be the first recorded human case of the H5N5 variant globally. Local health officials say risk to the public remains low despite the death.

A person believed to be the first confirmed case of H5N5 avian influenza in humans has died, health authorities in US state of Washington said Friday.

The deceased was a Grays Harbor County resident, according to the Washington State Department of Health. 

The department said it would not be releasing specific details relating to the deceased's name, gender or age out of respect for the family's privacy.

They did confirm that the person was an older adult with pre-existing health conditions.

""The risk to the public remains low. No other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza,"" state health authorities said.

""Public health officials will continue to monitor anyone who was in close contact with the patient for symptoms to ensure that human-to-human spread has not occurred,"" the department said and added: ""There is no evidence of transmission of this virus between people.""

According to the health department statement, the person had a backyard flock of domestic birds which they said was the likely source of infection.

H5N5 is a sub-type of avian flu that is not believed to be a greater threat to human health than the H5N1 virus that has been behind a wave of 70 reported human infections in the US in 2024 and 2025.

Most of those have been mild illnesses in workers on dairy and poultry farms.

The distinction between H5N5 and H5N1 lies in a protein involved in releasing the virus from an infected cell and promoting spread to surrounding cells.

According to the Washington State Department of Health website the first human cases of H5 avian influenza were reported in Washington state in October 2024.

The department says that to date, there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of avian influenza in Washington state.

Health authorities say birds and other animals infected with avian influenza shed the virus in their saliva, mucous and feces.

Kyiv's allies in Europe have said the US draft proposal that seems to favor Moscow is a ""basis"" that needs more work. Donald Trump has set a Thursday deadline for Ukraine to accept the deal. DW has the latest.

Kyiv authorities and European officials alike are scrambling to find responses to a 28-point peace plan put forward by the US Trump administration.

While Washington has touted the plan as a ""win-win"" resolution of the Ukraine conflict, critics have said it is heavily skewed to meet key demands from Moscow.

Western leaders meeting at the G20 summit in South Africa have welcomed some parts of the US proposal but say more work is required.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country is forced to choose  Kyiv into choosing between a loss of dignity or risk losing the US as a key partner.

European, US and Ukrainian officials are expected to meet for talks on Sunday in Geneva.

Meanwhile, Russia claims to have taken more villages in eastern Ukraine.

You can read more here about the latest developments amid Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on November 22, 2025:

US President Donald Trump has said his administration's plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine is not final.

""The war needs to end one way or another,"" he told reporters on Saturday.

Trump has given Kyiv until Thursday, Thanksgiving Day in the US, to accept the proposal.

However, when asked if the 28-point peace planwas his final offer, Trump replied ""no.""

Trump's comments come as Ukraine and its European allies call the proposal a ""basis"" for talks that needs ""additional work.""

French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday warned that Russia would ""come back and break their promises"" if Ukraine if forced to cut the size of its armed forces, as stipulated in the current US peace plan.

""We know that if there are no elements of deterrence, the Russians will come back and break their promises,"" Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Africa.

Macron added that the US proposal to end the war in Ukraine ""needs to be revisited"" with Europeans included in the negotiations.

""It's good in that it proposes peace and recognizes important elements on issues of sovereignty, security guarantees,"" the French president said. ""But it's a basis for work that needs to be revisited, as we did last summer, because this plan, first of all, wasn't negotiated with the Europeans.""

""There are many things that can't simply be an American proposal, that require broader consultation,"" said Macron.

The French president also said that the 30 countries in the ""coalition of the willing"" supporting Kyiv will have a video call on Tuesday, after talks in Geneva on the White House's proposed peace plan.

""We will hold a meeting on Tuesday afternoon to coordinate on this point, and to see what progress will be made in the Geneva negotiations in the coming days, and to be able to take new initiatives,"" he said.

Security officials from Germany, France and Britain are due to meet European Union, US and Ukrainian counterparts in Geneva on Sunday to discuss the US plan to end the war in Ukraine, sources at a G20 summit in Johannesburg said.

AFP quoted one of the sources speaking on condition of anonymity that ""the adviser to the French president will go to Geneva tomorrow (Sunday) with colleagues from the E3"" — referring to an informal security alliance between Britain, France and Germany.

""The talks will be between the United States, the E3 and the Ukrainians,"" said another source.

Trump gave Ukraine less than a week to respond to the 28-point plan the US had put forwardto end the nearly four-year war.

A German government source told Reuters that a European draft peace plan, which is based on the US proposal, had been sent to Ukraine and to the US administration.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Saturday said that the war in Ukraine cannot end without Kyiv's ""unconditional consent.""

""Wars cannot be ended by great powers over the heads of the countries involved,"" Merz said in response to US President Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine after the G20 summit in Johannesburg.

""If Ukraine loses this war and possibly collapses, it will have an impact on European politics as a whole, on the entire European continent. And that is why we are so committed to this issue,"" he added.

Merz also stated that he had made clear to Trump in a long phone call on Friday evening that Europe needs to be part of any process to end the war in Ukraine.

Merz said he had reminded Trump of the Budapest Memorandum, a landmark agreement in 1994 in which Kyiv gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security assurances that ultimately failed to deter Russia.

""That is why other security guarantees must now be given, other more reliable agreements must be made,"" Merz said.

The leaders of Ukraine's European allies have issued a joint statement on the US plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying that additional work is still needed.

""We welcome the continued US efforts to bring peace to Ukraine,"" the leaders said, adding that the initial draft of the 28-point plan ""includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace.""

""We believe therefore that the draft is a basis which will require additional work,"" the statement said.

The statement was signed by the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland, Norway, and of the European Union, as well as the Canadian and Japanese prime ministers.

The leaders emphasized that borders must not be changed by force and also expressed concern about ""proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces"" which they said could leave Ukraine vulnerable to any future attack.

The statement concluded by saying that there would be continued close coordination with both Ukraine and the US in the coming days.

Ukraine said it had received 31 of its citizens after they were freed from jail in Belarus.

""Women and men detained in Belarus and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment ranging from two to 11 years are returning to Ukraine,"" Kyiv's prisoner exchange coordination committee said on the Telegram messaging app.

""We express our gratitude to the United States of America and President Donald Trump for their fruitful work in returning Ukrainian civilians and military personnel from Belarus and Russia,"" it added.
 

Ukraine will hold consultations in the coming days on steps toward ending Russia's invasion,  the Ukrainian president's office said on Saturday.

""Ukraine never wanted this war and will make every effort to end it with a dignified peace,"" the office said in a statement on X.

""Ukraine will never be an obstacle for peace, and the representatives of the Ukrainian state will defend legitimate interests of the Ukrainian people and the foundations of European security,"" it added.

It said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had approved the composition of a delegation for the consulations, as well as directives for conducting negotiations.

The statement came as a top Ukrainian security official said Kyiv would hold consultations in Switzerland with the US on ending Russia's war on Ukraine.

""In the coming days in Switzerland we are launching consultations between senior officials of Ukraine and the United States on the possible parameters of a future peace agreement,"" the secretary of Ukraine's Security Council, Rustem Umerov, wrote on social media. 

The statement for the president's office made no explicit mention of the 28-point peace plan put forward by US President Donald Trump, who has given a Thursday deadline for its acceptance by Kyiv.

It did, however, express gratitude to Kyiv's European allies for their ""willingness to help.""

Russia's Defense Ministry has said that four settlements in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region are now in the hands of its forces.

They include the village of Yampil, which is located east of the Ukraine-held city of Sloviansk.

The ministry statement said that the villages of Stavky, Novoselivka and Maslyakivka were also now under Moscow's control, as well as a village in neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region.

The reports have not been confirmed by Kyiv, and Ukrainian officials said on Thursday that Yampil remained under Ukrainian control.

Russian forces are advancing slowly through the Donetsk region as they seek to capture all of the Donbas, which also includes the region of Luhansk.
 

Moscow's close ally Belarus has pardoned 31 Ukrainian citizens convicted of criminal offenses within the framework of deals struck between President Alexander Lukashenko and his US counterpart Donald Trump, a presidential spokeswoman said.

""The president has pardoned 31 Ukrainian citizens who committed criminal offences on the territory of our country,"" Natalia Eismont told state TV.

She said, referring to Ukraine, that the pardons were given ""with a view to creating conditions for the settlement of the armed conflict in the neighboring state.""

""Right now, at this very moment, they are being handed over to the Ukrainian side,"" she added.

A Ukrainian drone attack on energy infrastructure in Russia's Volga region of Samara has fatally injured two people and hurt two others, the region's governor has said.

The deaths and injuries, caused by falling debris from downed drones, occurred in the southern city of Syzran.

The governor, Vyacheslav Feorishchev wrote on the state-backed Max messaging service that the drones were repelled.

The city is the site of an oil refinery, media reports said.

Numerous Ukrainian drone attacks were also reported in other regions of Russia, as Kyiv's forces target energy infrastructure in a bid to reduce funding for Moscow's invasion.

Several airports temporarily suspended operations due to air raid alerts, including in Samara, Tambov, Penza, Saratov and Ulyanovsk. 

Although the Ukrainian attacks do claim civilian casualties, they are on a much lower scale than the deaths and injuries caused among civilians in Ukraine through the aerial bombardments by Russian forces.

The US has set a deadline of next Thursday for Ukraine to accept a 28-point plan drafted with Russia to end the war. Analysts say the plan's heavy concessions to Moscow would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on the platform X he had ""outlined the logic of our further steps"" in a call with European counterparts.

He described his discussion with the foreign ministers of France, Britain, Poland, Finland, the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, as well as representatives of Italy and Germany, as ""timely and meaningful"".

Sybiha said he had shared the results of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's ""recent contacts and outlined the logic of our further steps.""

""We discussed in detail the elements of peace proposals presented by the United States and our joint work to pave a doable path to a just peace,"" he added.

He said he had also thanked Ukraine's partners ""for their willingness to increase support for Ukraine during this decisive time.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had held emergency talks with the leaders of Germany, France and Britain.

He has also spoken with US Vice President JD Vance, while his office says he plans to speak soon directly with US President Donald Trump, who has given him until Thursday to accept the plan

US Vice President JD Vance has said that any plan to end the conflict in Ukraine must ""stop the killing while preserving Ukrainian sovereignty.""

Writing on X, he said that it should also ""[m]aximize the chances the war doesn't restart.""  

Vance also dismissed criticism of the plan recently put forward by Washington amid accusations, particularly from Kyiv and European allies, that it heavily favors Moscow.

""Every criticism of the peace framework the administration is working on either misunderstands the framework or misstates some critical reality on the ground,"" Vance wrote.

""There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand. Peace won't be made by failed diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy land. It might be made by smart people living in the real world,"" Vance added.

US President Donald Trump has given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy until Thursday, Thanksgiving Day in the US, to accept the plan.

""He'll have to like it, and if he doesn't like it, then you know, they should just keep fighting, I guess,"" the US president told reporters on Thursday.

 

The US peace plan that has been presented to Ukraine, which is backed by President Donald Trump, appears to be tilted in Moscow's favor, notable requiring Kyiv to cede large parts of its territory to Russia.

One central demand is that Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk, including areas Russian President Vladimir Putin's military have failed to seize, would be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States. Russia has illegally occupied Crimea since 2014.

Other key features that would seem to favor Russia is that Ukraine would have to limit its military to 600,000 troops and would be prevented from joining NATO.

In return, Ukraine is to ""receive robust security guarantees"" that it might view with some suspicion after the assurances given within the so-called Budapest Memorandum of 1994, which saw Kyiv give up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons, failed to protect it against Russian aggression.

Another demand in the proposal that is likely to be contested by Ukraine is that ""all Nazi ideology and activities must be rejected and prohibitied."" 

That demand would seem to lend credibility to Putin's claim that Ukraine is in the hand of Nazis and that his invasion aims in part to ""de-Nazify"" the country.

In fact, far-right-candidates received just 2% support at Ukraine's last parliamentary elections — a considerably lower proportion of the vote than in many other European countries.

While the plan has received a largely favorable reception in Moscow, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed some dismay at the dilemma now confronting his country.

""Now Ukraine may find itself facing a very difficult choice: either loss of dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address on Friday, referring to Kyiv's relationship with Washington.

Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced her resignation from Congress after a bitter falling out with Donald Trump.

In a fiery statement published days after the US president called her a “traitor”, the 51-year-old Republican congresswoman said she was quitting after Mr Trump had “tried to destroy” her.

“I refuse to be a battered wife, hoping it all goes away and gets better,” Ms Greene said in a lengthy video posted to her X account on Friday evening.

A self-professed outsider who never believed she “fit in” to the Washington establishment, Ms Greene claimed she had been “cast aside by the president and the Maga political machine” along with the “common Americans” in her constituency.

Ms Greene said her last day in office would be Jan 5 next year.

Mr Trump suggested Ms Greene had quit because she didn't want to face a primary election “she would have no chance of winning” because whoever challenged her would have had the US president's backing.

Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social network: “For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went bad. Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our country.”

A source told CNN that Ms Greene, who represents Georgia's 14th district in the US House of Representatives, had considered resigning for the past week after the former allies fell out in a public spat over the Epstein files.

Ms Greene and Mr Trump fought after she sided with the Democrats to push for the release of more files relating to Jeffrey Epstein, the paedophile financier. She also vowed to read a list of Epstein's powerful clients on the House floor, should his victims compile one.

Mr Trump said Ms Greene's association with Thomas Massie, the Republican congressman who co-led the bipartisan petition to force a vote on the release of the documents, “did not help her”.

Sharing Mr Trump's Truth Social post on Ms Greene's departure, Mr Massie wrote: “I'm sad to see one of my best friends Marjorie Taylor Greene leave Congress.

“She was one of the brave few who fought with me to release the Epstein files. The threats against us have been insane”.

The former Trump loyalist also became critical of what she called the US president's lack of focus on domestic policy, claiming that “all our country does is fund foreign countries and foreign wars, and never does anything to help the American people”.

Last week, Mr Trump had had enough. He announced that he was withdrawing his support from Ms Greene and would back primary challenges for her seat in the 2026 midterm elections. He also called her a “ranting lunatic” who had “gone far-Left”.

On Friday evening, Ms Greene said she had decided to leave to avoid a “hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president that we all fought for”, adding that the Republican party was likely to lose the midterm elections in 2026.

Ms Greene was elected to Congress in 2020 and, for five years, was one of the US president's strongest backers, defending him through numerous scandals and enduring what she characterised as “never-ending personal attacks” from her opponents.

However, in recent weeks, their relationship had soured.

Ms Greene, one of the most powerful and outspoken figures in the Maga movement, claimed their falling-out resulted from her vocal support for the release of the Epstein files, which include several emails alleging that Mr Trump had spent time with one of Epstein's victims.

Mr Trump has vociferously denied wrongdoing and has called the files a “hoax”, while claiming without evidence that Epstein had deep ties with Democrats.

Over the next several days, Mr Trump called her a “traitor” and a “disgrace”.

Ms Greene hit back, accusing the president she once loyally defended of inciting death threats against her.

“Loyalty should be a two-way street,” she said in the video announcing her resignation.

“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14 years old, trafficked and used by rich, powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, who I fought for.”

The dramatic falling out should not be seen in isolation. It is the culmination of a new divide in Mr Trump's Maga coalition between America First and “Trump First”.

A growing number within Mr Trump's base have become disillusioned with the president's foreign policy, economic priorities, freedom of speech and position on foreign visas.

In a phone call with ABC News on Friday night, Mr Trump called Ms Greene's resignation “great news for the country”.

The congresswoman announced her resignation in a video filmed at her home in Georgia, and was shown sitting on her couch with her Christmas tree in the background.

“I ran for Congress in 2020, and have fought every single day believing that Make America Great Again meant America First,” Ms Greene said in her nearly 11-minute-long message.

“My only goal and desire has ever been to hold the Republican Party accountable for the promises it makes to the American people and put America first.”

Her resignation will narrow the Republican majority in the House to 218 members over the Democrats' 213.

Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate.

Ms Greene ended her video with the message that it is up to “common American people” to understand that Washington is “gradually destroying our country”.

“I'll be here by their side to rebuild it,” she said. “My self-worth is not defined by a man.”

Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman are united by their shared ideology of censorship and state violence.

Fascism thrives in societies that grow desensitized to violence. Once cruelty is normalized, political life collapses into a spectacle of force, lies, and corruption. Under such conditions, the humanity of selected populations becomes disposable. Bodies disappear, injustice parades as lawful, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security reveal themselves as having assumed the violent role once played by militia groups, carrying out home invasions, mass detentions, and punitive deportations that leave entire communities traumatized. They operate less like civil agencies and more like state-sanctioned paramilitary forces whose mandate blurs policing with coercion and state terrorism.

The scope and reach of state violence under Donald Trump's regime is chilling. His so-called “drug boat” killings, conducted without due process or evidence, have resulted in the deaths of more than 80 people he unilaterally labeled terrorists and members of drug cartels. Here, the category of “terrorist” functions as a death sentence, naming individuals who, stripped of legal protections, can be executed at will.

These extrajudicial killings form part of a broader authoritarian project aimed not only at expanding presidential power through militarized violence but also at normalizing the logic of regime change. As Greg Grandinpointed out in Jacobin, the bloodbath in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean cannot be separated from the long-standing racialized drug war in the United States, which for decades has targeted people of color at home while providing cover for U.S. military operations across Latin America. What was once obscured from public view has now become political theater, a stage on which “Donald Trump presides over his own Murder Incorporated, less a government than a death squad.” In this climate, state terrorism is reduced to a bumper sticker and repackaged as a policy virtue to be praised, normalized, and widely disseminated.

What is particularly dangerous and horrifying is how Trump wields the label of “terrorist” domestically, transforming it into an arbitrary mechanism for criminalizing dissent and inflicting violence — including deportations, torture, and even death — on any individual or group he chooses. His deployment of state violence, at home and abroad, is part of a widening assault on the left, made plausible by portraying progressive organizations and critics as existential threats. As Stephen Prager notes in Common Dreams, Trump's expansion of the terrorism designation exposes U.S. citizens to government surveillance, asset seizure, and material support charges. This strategy was crystallized when Trump formally labeled “antifa” a domestic terrorist organization, even though it is not a formal group but a loose constellation of individuals committed to resisting authoritarianism. Civil rights advocates immediately warned that such a vague designation could be used to prosecute anyone who names the Trump administration as fascist. Soon after, Trump signed the little-reported National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, which mandated a national strategy to investigate, disrupt, and criminalize “networks” allegedly linked to political violence — an open door to target activists, journalists, and critics.

These developments are not isolated policies or rhetorical excesses. They signal a political worldview in which violence becomes the defining grammar of governance. Once violence is normalized as a tool of statecraft, and once entire populations can be designated as enemies without evidence or due process, the boundaries between domestic policing, foreign assassination, and authoritarian rule collapse. This collapse is precisely where fascism takes root: at the moment when cruelty becomes policy, when the state's power to kill is hidden beneath the language of “security,” and when leaders reward rather than condemn those who commit unspeakable crimes.

It is within this expanding landscape of state-sanctioned terror and moral disintegration that Trump's recent meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman must be understood. The meeting between a U.S. president and the Saudi strongman — who, according to a damning forensic UN report, ordered the dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi — is no anomaly. It is a chilling marker of the political direction the United States is now taking. This encounter with bin Salman exposes both Trump's unreserved embrace of dictatorship and his dangerous ambition to steer the U.S. down the same dangerous road. In this unsettling alliance between Trump and bin Salman, the specter of violence and authoritarianism draws nearer, as if the shadows of history are once again stirring to life, not as a past we have learned from, but as a future we are rushing toward.

As Tony Judt warned in Ill Fares the Land, societies enthralled by the “pursuit of material self-interest” and the drive for unchecked power lose the moral language required for democratic life and slip into what he called a “moral wilderness,” a modern form of brutality. Trump's embrace of a ruler who treats the free press as expendable exemplifies this descent. It reflects precisely what Judt described: governments drained of social purpose, turning instead toward punishment, cruelty, and repression as organizing principles of power.

Trump made this collapse unmistakable. He not only defended bin Salman, claiming, in defiance of a 2021 U.S. intelligence report, that the crown prince “knew nothing” about the assassination, he went further, seeming to justify the murder by calling Khashoggi “controversial” and stating, “A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.” Bin Salman dismissed the killing as a mere “mistake.” Such grotesque rationalizations reveal a political culture that has grown comfortable with the idea that journalists can be eliminated and that state violence is simply another tool of governance. In a further flight from both reality and the truth, Trump stated, “I'm very proud of the job he's done. What he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.”

Trump's statement is truly alarming given the breadth, scope, and relentless enactment of political violence in Saudi Arabia. Organizations from Freedom House to Human Rights Watch have provided ample documentation of massive violations of human rights in Saudi Arabia. The list is as extensive as it is morally repulsive.

The monarchy silences dissent, offering no space for elected voices or critical perspectives. Journalists, women's rights activists, and social media critics are routinely detained in secretive prisons, where they face isolation and erasure. At the fringes of these abuses, Saudi forces carry out border killings of Ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers — acts that may amount to crimes against humanity. The country's courts continue to impose death sentences for nonviolent political dissent and social media activity, as well as for drug offenses, even though international norms restrict the death penalty to the most heinous crimes. Migrant workers, bound by the oppressive kafala system, endure exploitative conditions, paying exorbitant recruitment fees, suffering from extreme heat, and working without pay, while state authorities fail to hold abusive employers accountable.

Both bin Salman and Trump share a contempt for truth, an oppositional press, and any form of criticism that challenges their authority.

Amnesty International notes that Saudi authorities “have adopted a zero-tolerance policy for any criticism, no matter how innocuous,” adding that all human rights groups have been shuttered, effectively erasing any independent civil society. Since bin Salman's rise to power, the human rights situation has “deteriorated drastically.” Harsh prison sentences for even mild social media commentary, record-level executions, and death sentences for expression alone illustrate a regime that has turned brutality into state policy.

Both bin Salman and Trump share a contempt for truth, an oppositional press, and any form of criticism that challenges their authority. Bin Salman represents where such repression inevitably leads. Trump rehearses the same authoritarian script, if in a more chaotic register. He routinely berates and humiliates journalists who ask uncomfortable questions. When ABC's Mary Bruce pressed Trump about his business ties to the kingdom, he lashed out, calling her “a terrible person and a terrible reporter” and branding ABC “fake news.” His crude dismissal mirrored the contempt he showed other journalists, including referring to one journalist as “piggy” when questioned about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. These gestures are not incidental. They legitimize a global atmosphere in which journalism has become a dangerous profession, nowhere more so than in Gaza, where 240 journalists have been killed by Israeli forces, some “considered legitimate military targets.”

This moral free fall reached its most revealing moment when Bruce confronted bin Salman directly:

Your Royal Highness, the U.S. intelligence concluded that you orchestrated the brutal murder of a journalist. 9/11 families are furious that you are here in the Oval Office. Why should Americans trust you? And the same to you, Mr. President.

In the face of a question invoking the dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist murdered and literally cut to pieces for telling the truth, Trump did not express outrage or even discomfort. He snapped, smeared Bruce's employer, and rushed to defend his family's financial entanglements with the Saudi regime. In that moment, the Oval Office became a stage for authoritarian pedagogy: the evasion of justice, the protection of those who commit unspeakable crimes, and the public degradation of anyone who insists on moral reckoning. This is fascist pedagogy in real time: the rejection of accountability, the public degradation of truth, and the shielding of those who commit unspeakable crimes.

Trump's performance was no mere theater; it was the public staging of the U.S.'s descent into moral collapse. It is the full realization of Judt's warning that a society which “knows what things cost but has no idea what they are worth” becomes one in which human life, journalism, and democratic norms are reduced to expendable commodities. Here, before the world, cruelty was normalized and murder excused. What unfolded in that room was more than a meeting between two authoritarian figures, it was the public enactment of the U.S.'s moral collapse. It revealed how neoliberal opportunism fuses seamlessly with authoritarian terror, and how quickly a democracy, hollowed of ethical conviction, can drift into a political order where cruelty becomes the governing ethic.

We are not confronting a future danger so much as an unfolding present. The conditions for democratic collapse are already here.

What this exchange between Trump and bin Salman ultimately revealed was a moment when fascism shed its disguises and displayed itself without apology, offering cruelty, censorship, and violence as a governing philosophy. The Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben warned in his 1998 book Homo Sacer that the concentration camp had become “the fundamental political paradigm of the West,” a metaphor for a world where human beings can be stripped of rights, reduced to expendable life, and abandoned to sovereign violence. What once felt like a distant warning and provocation now takes shape before our eyes, tangible and terrifying. The architecture of authoritarianism is no longer a distant threat or a cautionary tale from another era; it is emerging in the daily erosion of democratic norms, the demonization of dissent, and the casual acceptance of state terror.

One instance of this erosion was on full display in another but more chilling and spectacular willingness of Trump to criminalize dissent. On his Truth Social platform, Trump suggested on November 20 that Democratic lawmakers who urged the military to refuse illegal orders could be executed, calling them “traitors” and accusing them of “seditious behavior,” adding, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” This reckless suggestion echoes the fascist tendencies within his rhetoric, signaling a dangerous call for violence and the politicization of death sentences. In response to backlash, Trump tried to backtrack somewhat on November 21, claiming that he's “not threatening death” toward the Democratic lawmakers, but that doesn't change the fact that some lawmakers are already being targeted with death threats in the wake of Trump's original post. Such statements are not isolated incidents but part of a broader strategy to intimidate, silence, and eliminate any opposition through the endorsement of violent, illegal practices — practices fully embraced by Saudi Arabia.

We are not confronting a future danger so much as an unfolding present. The conditions for democratic collapse are already here, settling into the rhythms of everyday life. They demand from us not quiet reflection but an urgency equal to the scale of the crisis, an awakening capable of breaking through cynicism, fear, and manufactured despair. Resistance can no longer remain a discourse, a gesture, or a hope deferred. It must become a collective force, waged with the conviction that democracy survives only when people refuse to surrender their moral imagination, their solidarity, and their willingness to fight for a world in which human life cannot be reduced to disposable matter.

Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power, cut against the mainstream narrative and uplift the movements resisting fascism.

But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political suppression under Trump.

A bipartisan group of 13 governors urges Congress to “reform” energy permitting. It's a terrible idea.

A bipartisan group of 13 governors urges Congress to “reform” energy permitting. It's a terrible idea.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

A bipartisan group of 13 governors is pushing to deregulate the permitting of energy infrastructure in the U.S., arguing that doing so is necessary to “win the AI race, lower costs for consumers, and responsibly develop the advanced energy sources of the future.”

But in reality, deregulating energy infrastructure construction would be a disastrous mistake that would increase greenhouse gas emissions and toxic pollution, further harming already polluted communities, and drive up utility bills by enabling proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

The bipartisan group of governors, which was led by Oklahoma Republican Kevin Stitt and Pennsylvania Democrat Josh Shapiro, sent a letter on October 28 to the leaders of several House and Senate committees urging them to deregulate the permitting of energy infrastructure. The group includes seven Republicans (Stitt plus Mike Braun from Indiana, Jeff Landry from Louisiana, Kelly Armstrong from North Dakota, Bill Lee from Tennessee, Spencer Cox from Utah, and Mark Gordon from Wyoming) and six Democrats (Shapiro plus Jared Polis from Colorado, Ned Lamont from Connecticut, Wes Moore from Maryland, Maura Healey from Massachusetts, and Dan McKee from Rhode Island).

Their letter essentially argues that all forms of energy are equally beneficial; that excessive regulation is impeding needed energy infrastructure; that a lack of energy infrastructure is raising utility bills; and that winning the “AI race” is in the public interest.

But every one of these assertions is demonstrably false. Let's correct the record, one by one.

There is a nearly universal scientific consensus today that building more fossil fuel infrastructure locks in growth in greenhouse gas emissions, precisely when we should be cutting them instead. Burning fossil fuels, of course, heats the planet. And building new infrastructure — even for supposed “bridge fuels” that could be phased out later on — creates costs that fossil fuel companies will want to recoup and profits that they'll want to lock in for years.

All of the credible international institutions with expertise on the subject — including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN Environment Program, and the International Energy Agency — have concluded that we need to stop building fossil fuel infrastructure. 

The International Court of Justice ruled in July 2025 that countries have an obligation under international law to phase out fossil fuels. Earlier, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights  and International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea reached similar conclusions as the International Court of Justice. 

The Trump administration officially rejects this overwhelming consensus, but its irrationality is no justification for governors from both parties to push for more fossil fuel infrastructure. 

We undoubtedly need to build more renewable energy infrastructure. But “permitting reform” won't help with that.

Peer-reviewed studies show that permitting requirements aren't a major factor in obstructing renewable energy. One study found that the vast majority of renewable energy projects are either subject to streamlined federal environmental review, or exempt from it altogether. Another study found that most delays in permitting under the National Environmental Policy Act are not attributable to stringency of the permitting process, but to staff shortages and turnover at permitting agencies (exacerbated by federal budget cuts), and delays in project developers submitting required information to agencies.

A real obstacle to expanding renewable energy is the “interconnection queue,” or the wait time for new power generation facilities to be connected to the grid. In 2023, the generation and storage capacity waiting in the interconnection queue (which overwhelmingly consisted of wind, solar, and battery storage) was more than twice the existing grid-connected capacity, which was dominated by fossil energy. 

A call for speeding up interconnection requests is one thing the governors' letter gets right. One of their proposals is to require grid operators to fulfill interconnection requests by new generation and storage facilities within six months of receiving a complete application. That makes sense.

Today, there are two other factors obstructing renewable energy growth. 

One is the repeal of tax credits for renewable energy. Under the GOP budget bill signed into law in July, tax credits for residential solar energy — essential for expanding distributed renewables — expire at the end of 2025. Tax credits for utility-scale solar and wind energy projects that commence construction after July 4, 2026, are ineligible for the tax credit if they are placed into service after December 31, 2027, creating significant uncertainty for new projects. 

A solar or wind energy developer planning to build a new project today is under pressure to complete all pre-construction activities (site selection, land acquisition, obtaining financing and permits, etc.) before July 4, 2026. Otherwise, they face an 18-month deadline to complete all of these steps, plus construction, to qualify for tax credits. 

Another factor is the Trump administration's arbitrary cancellation of offshore wind energy leasing and permits for already permitted wind energy projects. Why bother building a wind energy project if the administration can just cancel it for ideological reasons? 

Electric utility rates for residential customers reached a three-year high in August 2025, causing serious hardship. 

In 2020-2021 (the last time the U.S. government collected residential energy consumption data), 27 percent of all households, 52 percent of Black and Indigenous households, and 57 percent of households with an annual income below $10,000 had difficulty paying their utility bills. Today, these numbers are almost certain to be higher.

Two key factors are to blame. One, our energy mix contains too much of the wrong kind of generation capacity. Solar and onshore wind are significantly cheaper than natural gas or nuclear energy, but renewable energy projects are waiting in line to be connected while our grid is still dependent on old, expensive fossil and nuclear power plants. 

Accelerating the transition to renewables will help lower bills. But as we've seen, permitting “reform” won't help with this transition. 

Another factor, determined by analyses by the Union of Concerned Scientists and Bloomberg News, is the proliferation of data centers to power the internet — and increasingly, to provide the computational capacity to run AI. 

The AI industry is increasing the load on the grid, and passing the costs of needed generation, transmission, and distribution upgrades on to households. It's not an altogether new phenomenon. Residential customers consistently pay higher rates than commercial and industrial customers, subsidizing big corporations through their bills.

Winning the “AI race” and lowering costs for consumers are mutually exclusive — unless utility rate structures are reformed to make large commercial and industrial customers pay the full cost of their added load on the grid. 

Utility rate structures are set by state legislators and public utility commissions. If these governors were serious about lowering costs for consumers, they would prioritize reforming utility rate structures in their states, instead of writing gimmicky letters to Congress while encouraging data center development in their states — or while local governments in their states make secretive deals with data center developers. 

The U.S. data center boom is undermining the needed transition from fossil fuels.

The U.S. data center boom is undermining the needed transition from fossil fuels. Data centers are sourcing much of  their immense hunger for energy (40 percent of the total data center energy use in the U.S.) from fracked gas — a share that's likely to grow in the future, according to a recent Center for Biological Diversity study, which found that greenhouse gas emissions from data centers could triple by 2035. 

Besides threatening the climate, AI-driven fossil power generation is poisoning communities. A striking example is Elon Musk's data center in a majority-Black Memphis neighborhood already intensely polluted by legacy facilities. It was found to be illegally powered by more than twice the number of portable gas turbines allowed by its permit, greatly adding to air pollution. 

Data centers also consume prodigious quantities of water, threatening communities' access to water, especially in an age of increasing water scarcity driven by climate change.

No technology, however useful, should be allowed to have such existentially adverse impacts. The kicker, though, is that AI isn't particularly useful. Using AI for research is highly unreliable. But AI does appear to be useful for activities that harm the public interest, such as increased government surveillance, enabling more oil and gas extraction, and spreading online misinformation.

If these governors were well-informed and well-intentioned, they would not push for more fossil energy. Instead, they would focus on the real obstacles to building renewable energy and lowering utility bills, instead of being distracted by “permitting reform” and promoting polluting AI data centers that hurt consumers, our communities, and our planet.

The case of Edgemere reflects a wider trend among coastal resiliency efforts currently underway across US cities.

This article was produced in partnership between   Floodlight and New York Focus.  It was co-published by The Guardian.

Baba Ndanani has lived in one of New York City's most flood-prone neighborhoods for more than 20 years, and he knows the risks all too well. His two-story home in the coastal community of Edgemere sits directly beside Jamaica Bay. During high tides, he often watches with concern as the bay creeps into his backyard and climbs the steps to his back porch.

In 2012, during Superstorm Sandy, over 5 feet of water rushed into Ndanani's house. He had to swim across the street to higher ground, riding out the rest of the storm in a disabled car surrounded by water. 

“I was praying,” Ndanani told Floodlight. “I just wanted to get out, and that was it.”

After the storm, he returned to his decimated home and spent two weeks sleeping atop an overturned refrigerator. 

“There was nothing else for me to sleep on. I had nowhere else to go.” Ndanani said. “It was horrible.”

Despite his harrowing experience and a city-run voluntary buyout program designed to relocate residents of Edgemere, he says he has no intention of leaving his coastal home. 

“Even with everything that happened, I love the scenery, I love the environment,” he said. 

Instead, Ndanani is among the many Edgemere residents still holding out hope the city will deliver on its decade-old promise to protect the neighborhood from flooding. 



“In the other neighborhood(s) they've done that, so why is Edgemere different?” Ndanani asked, referring to the city's efforts to raise shorelines around Lower Manhattan. “Because we don't have Wall Street here?” 

The lack of flood protections in Edgemere, combined with a largely ineffective attempt to relocate residents in the working class minority neighborhood, reflects a wider trend among coastal resiliency efforts currently underway across America's cities. In Charleston and Miami and Norfolk, city officials are planning billion-dollar seawalls to protect their wealthy core, but not the vulnerable communities beyond it. 

“Neighborhoods like Edgemere will become more and more frequent,” Veronica Olivotto told Floodlight. Olivotto is a New School researcher who spent months studying flood risk mitigation efforts in the community. 

She says Edgemere illustrates how managed retreat from an increasingly uninhabitable coastal America “will have to confront the fact that some people cannot move either because they don't have the financial means or because they feel that this is the place they have always lived.”  

Olivotto stressed: “We need to think way more about the land that's left behind, and the people that are left behind after retreat than we are right now.” 

With more than 500 miles of waterfront, few American cities are more vulnerable to sea level rise than New York City. About 1.3 million New Yorkers live within or directly adjacent to a floodplain, and a recent report estimates more than 80,000 homes could be lost to flooding in the next 15 years. By 2050, city officials estimate that at least 800,000 residents will be living in a high risk floodplain. By 2080, nearly a third of the city's landmass could face significant flooding. 

New Yorkers got a terrifying glimpse of what's to come in 2012, when Superstorm Sandy flooded 17% of the city's landmass, killing 43 people and causing more than $19 billion in damage. 

Officials have been scrambling to make New York more resilient to rising waters ever since. The city has begun raising shorelines and installing massive floodgates around Lower Manhattan as part of the so-called Big U, a 10-mile-long U-shaped system that also includes mitigation features aimed to protect the island's southern tip from future floods. 

The estimated $2.7 billion project is among the most ambitious coastal protection efforts in the nation. But for many of New York's working class coastal residents, is just another city service they aren't seeing in their neighborhood. 

“Everybody deserves the same amount of protection,” Edgemere resident Jackie Rogers told Floodlight. “If they can invest in other communities, raising up the shorelines, putting berms in the communities that's along the Lower East Side, as well as the Hudson River, why can't they do the same thing to Edgemere?”

Unlike Lower Manhattan, Edgemere was among the hardest hit communities during Superstorm Sandy. A low-lying neighborhood located along a narrow stretch of the Rockaway peninsula, Edgemere is flanked by the Atlantic Ocean on one side and Jamaica Bay on the other. When Sandy struck, water rushed in from both sides, filling the streets with nearly 6 feet of water. 

“We were actually in the ocean at the height of Hurricane Sandy,” Edgemere resident Sonja Webber-Bey told Floodlight. “The ocean and the bay were one in the same. So whatever was in your house was the ocean and the bay.” 

Yet more than a decade after city officials pledged to fortify Edgemere, critics say little has been done to protect the community from flooding. 

“Edgemere, especially the portion towards the bay, is still highly vulnerable,” Olivotto said. “If a superstorm were to happen next month, the same exact issues would occur in Edgemere as they occurred in Superstorm Sandy.”

In 2015, the city began working on the Resilient Edgemere Community Planning Initiative. The goal was to reduce flood risks in Edgemere while also bringing in affordable housing. But a decade later, the plan's major resiliency project has yet to break ground. 

While the city upgraded drainage systems, elevated more than 100 homes and rebuilt the boardwalk to help fortify Edgemere's oceanside, a crucial protection feature to raise the shoreline along the bayside was dropped. 

“It's 13 years since Superstorm Sandy, and yet still no flood mitigation on the bayside,” Rogers said. “We are forgotten here.” The city's original plan earmarked $14 million for raising the bayside shoreline. 

“That money was taken away from Edgemere without Edgemere community members knowing about it and reallocated to another community. We want that money back. We want it reinvested back in our community. We want our shoreline to be raised,” Rogers said. 

“I understand the frustration of Edgemere residents and I think that what we're talking about with this plan is really challenging compromises,” Michael Sandler, associate commissioner at the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development, told Floodlight. 

“The plan will be a success,” said Sandler, whose agency is responsible for the effort. “I don't consider the plan to be complete. And I think the plan has taken much longer to implement than we would have preferred.”

Key setbacks, he said, such as “continuity of staffing at the agency” as well as the loss of funding during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the delays. Still, Sandler recognizes that Edgemere remains far too vulnerable. 

“We're coming up on the peak of hurricane season right now, and there isn't a coastal protection feature, and I think that residents in the neighborhood are right to be concerned about what the future looks like,” Sandler said in a September interview. He added, “I think that we have invested a lot in the community. We have a lot in the works right now that is coming in terms of community improvements.” 

The city now relies on a federal Army Corps of Engineers project to protect Edgemere's bayside. However, the project has remained in the design phase for years, and with the Trump administration's posture towards climate change, few in Edgemere expect the project to move forward anytime soon.

“It's not happening,” Edgemere resident Rogers said of the Army Corps project. “Nobody is looking to do anything along this bay to address the constant flooding of Jamaica Bay.” 

Sandler says there is federal funding for the project, and it is moving forward, but he acknowledges residents' frustration. 

“These are really big, complicated projects, and the city does not have the full resources for all of the coastal protection projects that are necessary to protect the city from climate change,” Sandler said. “And we have a partner in the federal government who is overall pulling back from this work and from their financial commitment to resiliency. And so it is a really big challenge for New York City.” 

Despite the lack of flood protections in Edgemere, the city has approved construction of new affordable housing towers in the area. One building is completed, and several other towers are slated for construction. All are in or adjacent to floodplains; sea level rise projections show they could be partially underwater by 2100. 

“The fact that Edgemere may be considered as the last bastion of affordable housing in New York City, considering all the flood-prone issues that it has, I think is ridiculous,” Olivotto said.

Officials stress the city's need for affordable housing and that apartment towers in Edgemere will be less flood-prone than one- and two- story homes. But Olivotto notes Edgemere has only one main road and one subway line for evacuation in the event of a flood. 

“If the subway is down and your car is submerged in water, people will not be able to evacuate,” she said. “ So your property may be safe because you are in a tower, but you might not be able to have access to services that you need, food, health care, etc. So I think the idea of bringing new homes to Edgemere needs to be rethought.” 

Bringing more affordable housing to Edgemere continues a nearly century-old tradition of trying to concentrate low-income residents in public housing along the city's perimeter. 

It began in the 1930s under the infamous city planner, Robert Moses, and has resulted in thousands of working class New Yorkers living in vulnerable floodplains across the city. Under Moses, New York City bought swaths of land in Edgemere and bulldozed homes to make way for public housing towers. Some got built, but many of the city lots remain empty, despite multiple urban renewal projects in the ensuing years. 

“All of the services that were promised as part of the urban renewal were also not delivered,” Olivotto said. “So many people moved in the area and were able to access some of this housing, but none of the schools or health care services that a community needs.”

Rogers moved to Edgemere in 2007 through a city-run affordable housing initiative under the administration of then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. “There were promises of supermarkets, promises of retail stores, shops. Nothing. Nothing came,” she said. 

Rogers also says she wasn't fully informed about the flood risks in the area before moving there. “Nobody ever said that in a couple of years this community would be underwater,” she said.

“Seeing these lots vacant is very depressing to me,” Rogers added. She has watched as people from outside the community dump garbage on the lots, which she says are poorly maintained by the city, with overgrown grasses forcing pedestrians off the sidewalk and into the street. 

“Just to have a sidewalk, just to have the basic things that most communities should have is a fight,” Rogers said. “Why does everything have to be a fight in this community? All we want is to live a decent quality of life.” 

The lack of services, coupled with the city's attempt to relocate some residents along the bayside through a voluntary buyout program, has sparked concerns that officials are trying to push out Edgemere's long-time residents. 

“They're developing the whole neighborhood, but I don't think they're building for the people that already live here,” said Webber-Bey, who has lived in Edgemere for nearly 50 years. “I think people feel they just want our land and then they're going to build something that's three or four times as expensive and build a whole new community on the coast.” 

Another goal of the 2015 Resilient Edgemere Community Planning Initiative was to relocate some of the community's most vulnerable residents through a voluntary buyout program. 

“We were really pulling back and trying for the first time in New York City some form of managed retreat from the shoreline,” Sandler said. 

The city established a Hazard Mitigation Zone in Edgemere along Jamaica Bay where it limited development and offered to buy people's homes in exchange for moving elsewhere. Ultimately, only seven of the approximately 50 eligible homeowners participated in the buyout program. 

“We saw a mixed uptake. We had homeowners who were not interested in leaving. And I think you see (that) in most buyout communities around the country,” Sandler said. 

“They've been neglected in the past and they see retreat as a new sign that the city just doesn't want to invest in this neighborhood,” Olivotto said. She added it's important the city takes steps “to try to regain trust of the citizens of Edgemere.”

Despite Edgemere's vulnerability to flooding and the lack of coastal protections, few of the residents interviewed for this report expressed any interest in leaving. 

“It is still one of the hidden gems in New York City, even with all the vacant lots, with all the mosquitoes. It's quiet. You can hear yourself think at night,” Rogers said. 

Research shows she is far from alone. Less than 10% of Americans who experience a natural disaster decide to relocate, according to one study. For most, it's simply too difficult to leave the economic, social and cultural networks they've built their lives around. 

Those who move generally do so only after the economic outlook has deteriorated so much — due to rising insurance costs or the loss of jobs — that they feel they have no other choice. 

Residents fleeing climate-fueled disasters tend to be younger, higher income households who can afford to rebuild elsewhere. When these wealthier residents leave, research shows their departure can lower the community's tax base, leaving the older, lower income households behind with fewer resources to recover and guard against future flooding. 

“We live from day to day not knowing what a high tide or hurricane's going to do to this community. It is very scary,” Rogers said. “But by the grace of God, I ain't going no place.” 

Rogers is president of a community garden, which regularly hosts community events and encourages residents to literally lay down roots. 

“People have suffered a lot of trauma here,” Rogers said, citing years of storm damage and neglect from city officials. “So being in a space that is nature centered, we get centered.” 

Rogers has fortified the garden by installing raised metal beds, but she dreams of a day when her community finally gets the protection it's been promised. 

“I don't believe it's going to be underwater, even though the scientists say it is,” Rogers said. “And I'm hoping good people with good minds and good hearts look at this community and recognize the potential of what this community can really be.”

Live Updates


            • Peace proposal deadline: President Donald Trump has given Ukraine less than a week to accept his 28-point proposal to end the war with Russia, which is widely seen as favoring Moscow, though he suggested today that the plan is still open for negotiation.
    


            • Geneva meetings: Top US diplomats will meet with senior Ukrainian officials and European national security advisers tomorrow in Switzerland. The US proposal needs “additional work,” Kyiv's European allies said today, after discussing the plan on the sidelines of the G20 summit.
    


• Plans for NYC: Meanwhile, Trump has indicated that New York City is not a priority for deploying National Guard troops, as he's done in other cities during the administration's immigration and law enforcement crackdown. It follows a notably cordial appearance alongside NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House yesterday.
    


            President Donald Trump suggested today that New York City is not a priority for deploying National Guard troops, following a cordial Oval Office meeting with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani yesterday.
    


            Asked if he plans to send the National Guard to New York, Trump said, “If they need it.”
    


                    “Right now, other places need it more,” the president told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. “We had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that. But if they need it, I would do it.”
                





            Yesterday, Trump said he and Mamdani discussed crime in New York City and that they appeared to be on the same page in their efforts to combat it.
    


            “He doesn't want to see crime, and I don't want to see crime, and I have very little doubt that we're not going to get along on that issue,” the president said.
    


Remember: Trump has made extraordinary use of the military during his second term, including deploying the National Guard to cities where his administration is carrying out immigration raids and other law enforcement efforts. The deployments have prompted a slew of legal challenges and condemnation from Democrats.
    


            President Donald Trump expressed today he was open to reconciliation with Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene shortly after she announced her plans to resign from Congress amid a falling-out she had with the president.
    


                    “Sure, why not? I mean, I get along with everybody,” Trump told reporters.
                





            Trump recently rescinded his endorsement of Greene and attacked her in personal terms.
    


            “I just disagreed with her philosophy. She started backing perhaps the worst Republican congressman in our history,” Trump said to reporters a short time ago. The president made it clear he was referencing Greene's support of GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky.
    


For context: Massie helped lead a bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill to get the Department of Justice to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Greene was one of a handful of Republicans in the House who signed on to his petition to force a vote in the chamber.
    


            After a monthslong political pivot that catapulted Greene from one of Trump's closest allies to a critic on various issues, Greene announced yesterday that she will be resigning from office in January.
    


                    “I said go your own way and once I left her, she resigned,” Trump said today. “She would never have survived the primary, but I think she's a nice person.”
                





            President Donald Trump said the US peace plan presented to Ukraine is not the final offer to end the war with Russia.
    


            “No, not my final offer,” Trump told reporters just now. “We'd like to get to peace. It should've happened a long time ago.”
    


            “The Ukraine war with Russia should have never happened. If I were president, it never would have happened. We're trying to get it ended. One way or the other we have to get it ended,” he added.
    


            Asked by CNN's Kevin Liptak what happens if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky doesn't accept the plan by his deadline Thursday, Trump replied:
    


                    “Then he can continue to fight his little heart out.”
                





            Trump made the remarks as he said he was heading to meet with former professional golfer Jack Nicklaus at the Joint Base Andrews golf course.

            Democratic Rep. Maggie Goodlander's district office in Concord, New Hampshire, was the target of a bomb threat yesterday, according to her spokesperson.
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday accused Goodlander and five other Democrats, who had urged service members and intelligence officials in a video to disobey illegal orders, of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”
    


            “Tonight, the office of Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander was targeted with a bomb threat. Law enforcement responded swiftly and confirmed that no credible threat is present at this time,” Annie Lentz, a spokesperson for Goodlander, said in a statement.
    


            The district offices of three other Democratic lawmakers who appeared in the video — Reps. Chris Deluzio, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow — were also targeted by bomb threats yesterday.
    


            The home of Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who was also featured in the video, was the target of a bomb threat, according to her spokesperson.
    


            President Donald Trump said early this morning that Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation from Congress is due to poor polling numbers and fear of a potential primary challenge against a Trump-endorsed candidate.
    


                    “Marjorie ‘Traitor' Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it ‘quits,'” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
                





            That was the president's first public reaction to Greene's resignation, which she announced on social media yesterday evening.
    


How we got here: It came after a months-long political pivot that catapulted Greene from one of Trump's closest allies to one of his top antagonists.
    


            And it caps a turbulent five-year career in Washington, during which she was publicly condemned for violent rhetoric on the House floor and booted from the Freedom Caucus over a feud with a fellow Republican — while wielding extraordinary influence in her party as one of Trump's most trusted political allies.
    


Ripple effects: Greene, who just months earlier had been discussed as a potential candidate for her state's Senate race, currently has no plans to run for any office, according to a person close to her.
    


            The Republican's exit is likely to be quickly felt in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson must navigate a razor-thin majority.
    


            The speaker already faces the tall order in the new year of corralling his fractious conference to move on major legislation and further the president's priorities.
    


            Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and his team landed in Geneva this morning, where he will hold meetings with senior Ukrainian officials to discuss next steps for peace, a US official said.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will join the talks tomorrow in Geneva, the official said. The goal is to iron out language before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meets with President Donald Trump.
    


            A meeting between a Russian delegation and the US to discuss the proposed peace plan is also planned and “will happen quickly,” the official said, but not in Geneva. The official declined to elaborate further on where or when that meeting would take place.
    


            National security advisers from Germany, France and the United Kingdom are also going to the Geneva meeting, a diplomatic source told CNN Saturday.
    


What Ukraine is saying: Senior Ukrainian defense official Rustem Umerov confirmed on X that senior US and Ukrainian officials will go over “possible parameters of a future peace agreement” in Switzerland.
    


            Zelensky made a presidential decree approving a delegation of top Ukrainian security officials for talks with the US, Ukrainian allies and Russian representatives, his office said on X today.
    


            It comes as Zelensky's government grapples with a US peace plan that backs key Russian demands. 



                    “Ukraine will never be an obstacle to peace, and representatives of the Ukrainian state will defend the legitimate interests of the Ukrainian people and the foundations of European security,” Zelensky's office said.

            Ukrainians spoke to CNN today about their reaction to a US proposal for ending the war with Russia, which President Donald Trump has given Kyiv less than a week to accept.
    


            Vira Semenova, a Kyiv resident and mother of three, told CNN she feels as scared as she has been since Moscow first launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            She said the talks are “definitely not heading in the right direction” and that she may need to flee Ukraine if the plan is adopted:
    


            Valerii Moroz, a builder who spoke with CNN in Kyiv, said the country risks losing its identity and its independence if it agrees to a deal that's favorable to Russia:
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to spend this weekend in Washington, DC.
    


            We've seen the White House schedule, which states the president will leave at 11:35 a.m. ET today en route to Joint Base Andrews to visit the golf courses at The Courses at Andrews at 12 p.m. ET. His departure will take place from the South Lawn and will be open to the press.
    


            Trump is then due to return to the South Lawn at the White House at 2:40 p.m. ET. This will again be open to press.
    


            He has no public events scheduled tomorrow.
    


            As we keep a close eye on the diplomacy surrounding Russia's war in Ukraine during our coverage of the Trump administration today, here's what to know about how we got here.
    


Looming deadline: President Donald Trump has given Kyiv until Thursday to accept his 28-point plan to end the war, which lays out commitments each side would make to finally end the conflict that began with Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


What's in the plan: The proposal calls on Kyiv to cede territory, limit the size of its military and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war. It calls for a halt to fighting, global funding for reconstruction and a board overseeing the commitments led by the US president.
    


Reaction to the proposal: European powers have been caught off guard by the plan, with the European Council saying in a statement today that it needs “additional work.” US and Ukrainian officials will meet tomorrow in Geneva to discuss next steps.
    


It looks like a win for Moscow: The proposal is widely seen as favoring Russia. Trump appears to be giving Moscow almost everything it wants, largely resembling the Kremlin's maximalist positions from talks in Istanbul shortly after the invasion, when its forces held more of Ukraine.
    


What Ukraine is saying: President Volodymyr Zelensky said yesterday that Ukraine faces a choice between losing its dignity or a key ally in the US. He vowed to “work calmly” and quickly with the US and its partners toward an end to the war.
    


What Russia is saying: President Vladimir Putin earlier told a security council briefing he had received the US proposal and that he believed it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement.”
    


Here's a deeper dive for subscribers: CNN annotated the 28-point proposal.
    


            The US plan for peace in Ukraine needs “additional work,” the European Council said in a statement today, as leaders on the continent scramble to find a coordinated response to the proposal.
    


            While welcoming the US efforts, the leaders expressed concern over “proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces.”
    


            “We reiterate that the implementation of elements relating to the European Union and relating to NATO would need the consent of EU and NATO members respectively,” the statement added.
    


Remember: European powers have been caught off guard by the plan, which contains major concessions to Russia and was drawn up with little input from Ukraine or Europe.
    


            One of the stipulations includes a commitment by Kyiv not to join NATO, a long-standing Kremlin demand.
    


            Ukraine's allies will discuss the US-drafted peace plan on the sidelines of the G20 summit today amid alarm over the proposals, which are widely seen as favoring Russia, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.
    


            “Ukraine's friends and partners will meet in the margins of the G20 summit to discuss how we can secure a full ceasefire and create the space for meaningful peace negotiations,” Starmer said in a statement released by the UK government ahead of the talks.
    


                    “We will discuss the current proposal on the table, and in support of President Trump's push for peace, look at how we can strengthen this plan for the next phase of negotiations.”
                





            We'll bring you any significant developments from these meetings when we get them.
    


            President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said on X that she sat down for talks with Starmer ahead of the summit.
    


            “The situation regarding Ukraine right now a clear reminder of why that matters,” von der Leyen said.
    


For context: The summit, which is being held today and Sunday, marks the first taking place in Africa. It will be attended by leaders including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva but the US will be absent.
    


            Trump wrote in a social media post on Friday that the US would boycott the event due to South African “human rights abuses” against Afrikaners, an ethnic group descended mostly from Dutch settlers, as well as German, French and British immigrants to South Africa, claims strongly disputed by the South African government.
    


            Welcome to today's coverage of the latest developments from the Trump administration.
    


            We'll keep you updated on President Donald Trump's movements in Washington, as well as reaction to the United States' 28-point proposal to end the war in Ukraine. The US will be absent from the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa today, where world leaders are expected to discuss the proposal.
    


            In the meantime, here's what's happened over the last 24 hours or so:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Weekend meetings and consulting Paul Anka: What it's like to build ballrooms for Trump","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/22/politics/trump-ballroom-renovations-white-house","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 11:01:00 GMT","


            President Donald Trump leads a weekly meeting at the White House where the agenda includes discussions on the size of windows, the placement of bathrooms and options for interior finishes for the East Wing ballroom he has promised to complete before leaving office.
    


            Piles of sample materials that have been brought for Trump's perusal sit in the Oval Office or the adjacent dining room, according to people who have seen them.
    


            Visiting foreign leaders and members of Congress are sometimes asked to weigh in on materials or designs.
    


            Over the last 10 months, Trump has personally selected the white limestone that lines the Rose Garden after laying out different slabs on the ground to compare them; dictated the type of flag poles to use on the North and South Lawns (tapered galvanized steel, with interior ropes); and picked out the chandeliers that hang from the Palm Room connecting the executive mansion to the West Wing.
    


            As he paves, tiles, gilds and demolishes major swaths of the White House, Trump is overseeing the projects the same way he did in his years building towers, clubs and golf courses: focused on even the smallest details, down to the fixtures and stone.
    


            Those who have worked with Trump to transform his private properties in New York and Florida told CNN that the president would take a notable personal interest in their renovation work.
    


            “My expectation was there might be three or four levels between me and him, and I would rarely see him,” said Wes Blackman, a project manager who worked with Trump at Mar-a-Lago for a decade in the 1990s and 2000s. “That couldn't have been further from the truth. He'd call me all the time. I remember riding my bike getting calls when I wasn't at the property.”
    


            When architect Tamara Peacock was helping turn Mar-a-Lago into a private club in the 1990s, she remembered frequently meeting with Trump on Saturdays at the property while others had to wait.
    


            “They'd be lined up in the foyer while we're spending hours going over every light fixture and every paint color,” Peacock told CNN. “And he'd get in his limo and go buy light fixtures, and line them up and say, ‘What do you think?'”
    


            White House officials describe Trump as a “builder at heart,” and say his focus on renovation projects serves as a creative outlet of sorts.
    


            Even as the president seems to revel in his adopted role of builder-in-chief, the demolition of the East Wing and plans for a $300 million new ballroom have sparked criticism over cost, transparency and propriety.
    


            Those who have worked with Trump in the past paint a picture of a developer who is demanding, but skilled at solving problems and finding his way through red tape. The current challenges for his White House construction, though, are as much about politics as they are project management.
    


            Builders, architects and artisans who worked for Trump on his past construction and renovation endeavors praised his ability in the field.
    


            Trump had a “good eye,” Peacock said, for “taking areas that were kind of ‘dungeoness' — that was the word he used — and then he would come up with a way to kind of brighten it up and push life into it.”
    


            During the 1990s Mar-a-Lago renovation, Trump would spend the weekdays at Trump Tower in New York and then fly down to Florida to have weekend meetings.
    


            He pushed hard for progress on his projects, said Peacock, who now runs an architecture firm in south Florida and North Carolina.
    


            “It's not just a casual meeting where you're sitting around with a friend — you have to be on your toes,” she said. “You really have to ramp up, coming up with your best ideas to solve problems on a Saturday morning.”
    


            Trump always wanted the pace of projects to move quicker, said Blackman. When Trump would “ask me to do the impossible, I'd pull out a rabbit,” he said, likening his work that of a magician.
    


            Trump used his signature black sharpie to mark up plans from his architects and project managers.
    


            “He loves design, and on any project we've done for him, he always marks up the drawings,” said Rick Gonzalez, an architect who's worked with Trump at Mar-a-Lago for three decades and helped build its ballroom in 2005. “He doesn't cut corners. He does everything extremely well done, to the point where I've seen him on job sites say to rip it out and redo it because it's not properly done.”
    


            After the Rose Garden paving project was completed earlier this year, Trump noticed a deep gash in the new material. He insisted officials go through video surveillance to identify the culprit.
    


            Gonzalez said that Trump focuses on the details of his projects whether he's building a grand ballroom or the small guard house installed at the front of the Mar-a-Lago last year.
    


            “He would get into discussions on the stone, what kind of stone is used, the quality of the woodwork … the colors, the roofing material,” said Gonzalez, who worked on two subsequent ballrooms at Trump's properties in Florida and Scotland after Mar-a-Lago.



            John Icart, a Florida cabinetmaker, has worked with Trump on numerous personal projects over three decades and is responsible for one of the finishes perhaps most synonymous with Trump's name and aesthetic: gold.
    


            He's long worked at Mar-a-Lago and also helped with Trump's golden additions to the White House during his first year in office, according to the Wall Street Journal.
    


            Reached last month by CNN, Icart did not deny his involvement with the East Wing project, but said that he is working on some things now he's not able to discuss yet.
    


            Icart told CNN that over the 34 years he has worked with Trump, the president has “always been very loyal to me. He treats me very well.”
    


            Icart's business in West Palm Beach, Florida, is temporarily closed, according to the listing online.
    


            Besides gold, Trump has also been known for an affinity for marble (which is what he used to renovate the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom earlier this year).
    


            For the Palm Room at the White House, he selected the type of highly polished marble and insisted it be “book-matched,” meaning slabs are lined up to resemble one continuous piece of stone.
    


            The acoustics of a room with marble floors can be loud, so for the Mar-a-Lago ballroom, Trump had Blackman speak to an old friend, songwriter Paul Anka, for ideas with about how to handle the sound in the room.
    


            “He said, ‘Well, if you have marble and all these hard surfaces — you've lost the battle with acoustics,” Blackman recalled.
    


            Besides his involvement in the physical renovations of his properties, Trump was diligent in navigating the legal and regulatory hurdles required to convert and expand his properties, those who worked with him said.
    


            By comparison, the speed in which Trump bypassed any red tape and demolished the White House's East Wing delivered a jolt to Washington. Even the president himself expressed surprise at how easy it was.



            In the 1990s, Trump faced a more difficult road as he battled opposition from the town of Palm Beach and his neighbors over his plans first to subdivide Mar-a-Lago and then to turn the property into a private club.
    


            “We had to do a whole lot of presentations to Palm Beach, and every time I'd go and do a presentation to talk about the conversion and the rezoning into a private club, all the neighbors would show up and speak against the project,” Peacock said.
    


            Trump eventually reached an agreement with the town, but there are still disputes over the property, even today.
    


            Choosing where to build a ballroom on the property took several years, as Trump needed approval from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded nonprofit based in Washington. The estate was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1972, and Trump's agreement with Palm Beach included a conservation easement requiring sign-off from the Trust.
    


            Trump was involved in the back-and-forth with the National Trust while they debated the best place to put a ballroom that would not disrupt the historic mansion, Gonzalez said.
    


            Ultimately, they settled on a location that was the lowest on the property to satisfy concerns from the Trust, which kept the new building concealed by a tree line and connected it to the mansion with an awning.
    


            “He took them seriously, and we used it strategically,” Blackman said. “It helped us with the town of Palm Beach to have a letter with the National Trust to say they're OK with this location.”
    


            With the East Wing, however, Trump has so far brushed off any preservation concerns.
    


            Last month, the National Trust urged the administration to pause demolition of the East Wing, citing concerns that the new ballroom will “overwhelm the White House itself — it is 55,000 square feet — and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House.”
    


            The next step for Trump is the National Capital Planning Commission, the government's central planning agency for development in the Washington, DC, area. While the commission does not have jurisdiction over demolition, according to its prior legal opinions, the White House has said it will go to the NCPC to approve plans for the ballroom construction.
    


            Of course, Trump will have a built-in advantage to fend off any concerns that might arise from the commission: He's appointed Will Scharf, the White House staff secretary, as its chair.
    


            Last month, Trump also fired six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency that's previously reviewed proposed additions to the White House.
    


            While that's likely to aid Trump with any construction and logistical problems with the ballroom project, he still faces a new sort of challenge while he builds: the political fight.
    


            Democrats slammed Trump for focusing on his ballroom during the government shutdown, at a time when his administration was trying to stop the distribution of food stamps.
    


            Republicans have worried about the optics of Trump's opulent ballroom as the party suffered losses in the off-year elections earlier this month.
    


            While in the minority, Democrats on Capitol Hill have launched probes into the details of the private donations that are funding the project. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Coinbase, Comcast and Meta are among the major companies that have donated to the Trust for the National Mall, the nonprofit organization that administers the funds for the renovations.
    


            Many of the donors, in response to requests from congressional Democrats, have defended their involvement, according to more than two-dozen letters reviewed by CNN.
    


            The companies said they made the donations in accordance with state and federal lobbying laws and regulations.
    


            When hosting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump talked up the ballroom project and the private donations funding it, lamenting the fact that he couldn't ask the Saudi to contribute because of restrictions on foreigners.
    


            “This would be a perfect night to have that ballroom open,” he added.

            A top-secret Russian unit based in Moscow has changed the landscape of drone warfare, turning what was an advantage for the Ukrainians into a vulnerability.
    


            The unit is known as Rubicon and has expanded rapidly under Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov since his appointment in June last year. Belousov visited its headquarters in October 2024 and was shown a range of drones being developed, according to video published by official Russian media.
    


            The advent of Rubicon – full name the Rubicon Center for Advanced Unmanned Technologies – is a prime example of how the Russian military has learnt to shrug off its rigid way of warfare during the Ukraine conflict and adapt to a rapidly evolving battlefield.
    


            Ukraine had already established a separate branch within its military – the Unmanned Systems Forces – in mid-2024.
    


            As Rubicon proved its worth, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in June that Russia would establish a military command dedicated to “unmanned aerial systems.”
    


            That unit came into being last week.
    


            “The head of unmanned systems has been appointed, and military command and control bodies have been created at all levels,” said its deputy commander, Col. Sergei Ishtuganov.
    


            “Just a year ago, our troops weren't so saturated with drones of all types. But gradually, Russian units managed to turn the tide in the skies,” he told Russian daily kp.ru.



            “We are assigning operators, engineers, technicians and other support specialists to these units,” Ishtuganov added, a clear sign of the resources being dedicated to the command.
    


            It even has its own emblem – featuring a crossed arrow and sword, with a microchip bearing a star and wings in the center.
    


            Rubicon is not just about designing and deploying drones. It develops and tests advanced robotic systems and AI.
    


            It pioneered the use of fiber-optic drones, which have had a significant impact on the battlefield. These are controlled via a fiber-optic cable, providing a secure video feed in real time and cannot be jammed.
    


            It also improves the performance of other units.
    


            “Rubicon formations remain a leading problem for [(Ukrainian)] drone operators, not only the drone companies themselves, but because they train other Russian drone units,” notes Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment.
    


            Within months of Rubicon's establishment, its units were fanning out across the front lines with a new generation of drones, turning the tables on Ukrainian forces.
    


            Their first known involvement was inside Russia, after Ukrainian forces entered and took a part of the Kursk region last summer. Shortly after Rubicon's appearance in the area, the Ukrainian military reported that their supply lines had been almost completely cut off by drone attacks.
    


            Ukrainian forces withdrew from the area early this year. Later, two commanders told CNN that a well-trained Russian unit had suddenly changed the battle, hunting Ukrainian logistics and drone operators. At the time, they had no idea Rubicon had been deployed.
    


            Since then, Rubicon units have been reported in many parts of the battlefield, often giving Russian troops an advantage by attacking Ukrainian supply routes well behind the front lines – as well as enemy drone operators.
    


From meat grinder to mopeds: How Russia rethought its war-fighting in Ukraine



            In August, the commander of Ukraine's 93rd Brigade battalion told CNN that Rubicon units had been integrated with Russian brigades in the Kostiantynivka area of Donetsk.
    


            Within a week, he said, his unit had lost most of its vehicles, drone launch sites, antennas, and communications equipment. From the beginning of the war, the Russians have tried to target Ukrainian drone operators. Rubicon units have taken that to a new level.
    


            The conflict is now “a saturated drone operating environment,” according to military analyst Mick Ryan, who was recently in Ukraine.
    


            Ryan said frontline officers had told him that Russian innovation in drones probably now just outstrips that of Ukraine.
    


            “Within 15 kilometers (9 miles) of the front line, vehicle movement is difficult to impossible. Infantry soldiers must march to their positions for 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles),” Ryan said.
    


            “Where armoured vehicles and artillery are deployed, these can be subject to dozens of attacks per platform per day. Every HQ is now buried deep underground to avoid detection and destruction by Russian drones,” according to Ryan, author of the blog Futura Doctrina.
    


            “Today it is drone pilots who are the architects of victory, shaping the modern battlefield. They are the ones who, to a large extent, ensure the advance of… infantry,” wrote the Russian Telegram channel Lost Armor, posting a nearly five-minute video of Ukrainian armor that had been destroyed in the Pokrovsk area.
    


            Ukrainian forces have erected nets on roads and tracks behind the front lines to ensnare Rubicon's drones, but they are of limited help given the sprawling combat zone.
    


            Rubicon has also been innovative in developing radar networks to bring down Ukrainian drones.
    


            “They captured ALL TYPES of our main UAVs as trophies,” says Ukrainian electronic warfare specialist Serhiy Beskrestnov. “Of course, they studied all the electronics, communication systems inside our UAVs, and navigation systems.”
    


            Rubicon also appears to have been involved in the first successful use of a Russian naval drone, which struck a Ukrainian vessel in the Danube estuary in August.
    


The fog of war: Changing weather becomes a new player on the battlefield in Ukraine



            Two weeks ago, Rubicon claimed to have taken out a Ukrainian naval vessel mooring at a gas production facility in the Black Sea.
    


            So important are Rubicon units that the Ukrainian security services are now intensively searching out their forward bases. A drone strike on a Russian base in occupied Avdiivka destroyed a Rubicon headquarters earlier this month, according to Ukrainian Defense Intelligence.
    


            One Ukrainian drone unit attached to the 71st Jaeger brigade recently posted video showing strikes on antennas and hide-outs in Sumy that it said belonged to “the elite Russian Rubicon unit.”
    


            “We detect, search for antennas, satellite communication terminals, dugouts, and strike them,” said Vyacheslav, the unit's commander. They had detected take-off points and intercepted radio communications to establish the presence of a Rubicon unit, he said.
    


            While the two sides have similar capabilities, the Russians had an advantage in the number of fiber-optic drones they were producing, Vyacheslav told CNN.
    


            “The availability of these drones, how many they can launch, how many we can launch. That's the key difference.” And there were more Rubicon operators now, he said.
    


            The conflict in Ukraine has increasingly become one of counter-measures, designed to leap-frog or neutralize an innovation by the enemy.  It's a constant battle between drones and electronic warfare that can detect, jam or spoof enemy drones.
    


            “The enemy plays with frequencies; we reconfigure our electronic warfare systems. The enemy begins to suppress us with electronic warfare; we switch to other frequencies,” according to the Russian commander, Ishtuganov.
    


            Adaptation is never-ending.
    


            In Rubicon's arsenal is the Molniya drone, a relatively simple UAV largely made of plywood. The second generation of the Molniya (lightning in Russian) carries a payload of up to 7 kilograms (15 pounds) and can fly more than 30 kilometers (19 miles) deep behind the front lines. It can also act as a “mothership” that launches two first-person view (FPV) munitions – and, as CNN discovered in August, has made travel along critical routes much harder.
    


            As soon as the Ukrainians captured a Molniya, they began copying – and improving – the design. They have also developed a new drone – the FP-2 – that can strike Rubicon command centers at least 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the front line.
    


            In the early days of the war, Russian forces were frequently derided in the West for their rigid tactics, poor equipment and mediocre leadership. That has changed.
    


            In a major departure, the Russian military has begun embracing start-up manufacturers such as the Oko Design Bureau in St. Petersburg, which makes two types of drones now widely used in combat. Oko has been sanctioned by the United States.
    


            The Russian military's embrace of innovation makes Russia “a more dangerous adversary for Ukraine, as well as a much more capable and dangerous military to threaten Europe,” according to a new analysis by the Special Competitive Studies Project, a US think-tank.
    


            The world envisioned by Rubicon and its backers “will soon have swarms of autonomous drones that can overwhelm adversaries' defenses, microdrones that are difficult to identify or stop, and drones that mimic birds, bugs, or other wildlife,” said military analyst Dara Massicot.
    


            Drone warfare – and anti-drone electronic warfare - is evolving at an almost weekly pace as the price of survival.
    


            “Experts are fond of saying that armies shape war. But war shapes armies, as well,” Massicot said.
    


            In the forests of Sumy in northern Ukraine, that translates to what Vyacheslav, the commander of the drone unit, as an endless routine.
    


            “It's systematic work: detection, destruction, detection, destruction.”

NEW YORK (AP) — There was a time when presidential hopefuls played coy about their ambitions, crisscrossing the country under the guise of helping other candidates and deflecting when pushed on their obvious plans.

Not so for some Democrats considering running in 2028. With no clear party leader and Democratic voters raring for a fight, some could-be candidates are being far more transparent about their intentions, doing away with pretensions as they try to gain maximum visibility at a time when authenticity is in high demand.

“Of course I'm thinking about it. I haven't ruled it out,” New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker recently told Fox News during a trip to early-voting New Hampshire, even as he stressed that his focus is on 2026, when he will be up for reelection.

“I'd be lying otherwise. I'd just be lying and I can't do that,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom told CBS when pressed on whether he will consider a run after the midterms next year. 

To be sure, many Democrats remain circumspect. 

Of the dozen potential 2028 candidates The Associated Press requested interviews with to discuss the changing dynamic, none was immediately available. Some Democrats deflect questions and say their attention is elsewhere even as they campaign for others in early-voting states. 

On the Republican side, an entirely different dynamic is brewing under the surface. Potential candidates are keeping low profiles amid expectations that President Donald Trump will play kingmaker in choosing his would-be successor.




Presidential campaign strategists say the Democrats' less guarded approach makes sense given the wide-open 2028 field and sheer number of candidates competing for attention. Among the others who have said they are considering a run: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who also was a White House chief of staff, and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green. 

“Old rules just don't apply to anything anymore,” said Jess O'Connell, a Democratic strategist who advised Pete Buttigieg's 2020 presidential campaign. She said the change was a good thing for the party.

“You've got to be out there every single day fighting and sharing your vision,” she said. “And I think the more runway they have to talk to people in this moment and to communicate about meeting the needs of the future,” then the better.

Alex Conant, a veteran of the presidential campaigns of Republicans Marco Rubio, a former Florida senator who is now Trump's secretary of state, and Tim Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor, said the dynamics of the emerging Democratic primary, with no clear front-runner, have changed the calculus for candidates.

“I think the Democratic primary is going to be the longest primary of our life. It's hard to recall a field that is this wide open. And the Democratic base is so hungry for someone to take on Trump and win back the White House,” he said. “The more crowded it is, the more important it is to start early.” 

Candidates, he noted, are also “immediately more relevant if you might be the next president,” adding to the incentive to say the quiet part out loud.

Voters these days are also turned off by the kind of politician-speak that was once the norm.

“One of the takeaways from Trump is that people want authenticity,” Conant said. “Voters are rejecting candidates who sound like politicians, so the rhetorical tricks that politicians have used for decades to avoid answering questions now just irritates voters.” 

Not everyone has embraced the approach. 

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker played coy on stage during a recent interview with journalist Kara Swisher, repeatedly dodging her questions about his expected timeline.

“Blah, blah,” she responded as he tried to pivot to talking about the strength of the Democratic bench.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has been equally circumspect, refusing to acknowledge any White House ambitions or even commit to running again for governor, even as the shadow of 2028 follows him everywhere he goes. But during an appearance on “The Breakfast Club” podcast last month, as he reflected on the arson attack on his official residence, he sounded like someone who is eager to remain in the arena. 

“I love public service,” he said. “You can't walk away now, with everything that's on the line. ... This is not a time to quit.”

His perceived national ambitions have become a frequent attack line for his potential GOP rival for governor, state Treasurer Stacy Garrity.

“We need somebody that is more interested in Pennsylvania and not on Pennsylvania Avenue,” Garrity said recently on a conservative radio show in Philadelphia.

That is one of the risks for candidates, said Mike DuHaime, a longtime GOP strategist who advised the presidential campaigns of Chris Christie, John McCain, Rudy Giuliani and George W. Bush.

In 2013, he noted, Christie's opponent in the New Jersey governor's race often tried to use his national buzz as a campaign issue against him.

Candidates, DuHaime said, also need to strike a balance and make that they are not distracting from midterm races by funneling money or attention away from candidates who need them.

“I think it makes sense not to be so coy because people kind of get it, but they still should be careful about putting themselves in front of the country cause it could backfire,” he said. They “have to be careful that they still look a little bit like team players.”

In other cases, candidates have genuinely not made up their minds, and may be lured by party leaders in early-voting states eager to draw rising stars to their events, DuHaime said.

“It's very intriguing and exciting for candidates and would-be candidates to be asked,” he said, with some deciding, “Let's go experience it, the national circus. Let's be part of that.”

Along with potential legal considerations, O'Connell, the Democratic strategist, also noted that many of those expected to run have day jobs they need to balance. While picking fights with Trump certainly puts them in the spotlight, it could have ramifications for constituents if the Republican president retaliates, meaning that candidates will need to choose their moments wisely.

“You have to fulfill your obligations to the states that you're in,” she said. “It's not so much that you're playing a game, it's that I think that there are some practical considerations.”

“I think we're going to see people struggling with that,” she added.

She also urged candidates to embrace what she called a “Beyonce-Taylor Swift strategy,” referring to the pop stars' boosting the economies of the cities where they performed on tour.

“What I would advise anyone who wants to be president in 2028,” she said, “is to roll up your sleeves and help.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors said Friday that Luigi Mangione's death penalty case in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson should carry on unimpeded, urging a judge to reject a defense push to dismiss charges and rule out capital punishment over Attorney General Pam Bondi's public statements suggesting Mangione deserves execution.

The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan also asked U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to deny the defense's bid to suppress certain evidence collected during the arrest last year, including a 9 mm handgun, a notebook in which authorities say Mangione described his intent to “wack” an insurance executive and statements he made to police.

“Pretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect,” prosecutors wrote in a 121-page court filing, citing prior rulings from the Supreme Court and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

As for the evidence, which Mangione's lawyers contend was collected without a warrant and without him being read his rights, prosecutors said police officers were justified in searching the suspect's backpack to make sure there were no dangerous items. His statements to officers, they said, were made voluntarily and before he was taken into police custody.

Rather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense's concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione's rights are respected at trial.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




“What the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments” rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. “None warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.”




Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. 

In September a judge threw out state terrorism charges against him but kept the rest of that case — including an intentional murder charge — in place. He is due back in court in the state case Dec. 1 as his lawyers seek to bar prosecutors from using much of the same evidence seized upon his arrest. 

Mangione's next court date in the federal case is Jan. 9.

Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for his company's annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.

Mangione, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later while eating breakfast at a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan.

Bondi announced in April that she was directing federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment is warranted for a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”

The defense argued in a September court filing that Bondi's announcement — which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance — showed the decision was “based on politics, not merit.” They also said her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later.

Bondi's statements and other official actions — including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration's flouting of established death penalty procedures — “have violated Mr. Mangione's constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,” his lawyers said.

Trump, who oversaw an unprecedented run of 13 executions at the end of his first term, has also offered opinions about Mangione despite court rules against any pretrial publicity that could interfere with the right to a fair trial.

“He shot someone in the back, as clear as you're looking at me or I'm looking at you. He shot — he looked like a pure assassin,” Trump told Fox News in September.

In their Friday filing, federal prosecutors countered that Bondi's remarks were irrelevant to the process because there's no evidence that grand jurors who voted to indict Mangione were influenced.

“This argument, like others, rests on conjecture rather than evidence,” the prosecution team said. 

Nor has the defense cited any precedent “suggesting that public commentary renders a grand jury incapable of fulfilling its constitutional role,” they added.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — And Rosalía said, “Let there be Lux.”

Rosalía, the global Spanish pop star loved by millions for fusing flamenco with Latin hip-hop and reggaeton, has amazed her fans with a radical shift.

The singer and songwriter's new album, “Lux” (“Light” in Latin), is unabashedly spiritual. Fifteen songs, sung in 13 different languages, including fragments in Latin, Arabic and Hebrew, are laden with a yearning for the divine.

And it is receiving praise from on high.

Xabier Gómez García, bishop of Sant Feliu de Llobregat which includes Rosalía's hometown of Sant Esteve Sesrovires near Barcelona, was one of the first church leaders to laud her work in an open letter to his flock. Rosalía's grandmother regularly attends mass in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, according to the diocese.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Gómez said that while some of her songs were “provocative,” Rosalía “speaks with absolute freedom and without hang-ups about what she feels God to be, and the desire, the thirst (to know God).”

“When I listened to ‘Lux' and Rosalía speaking about her the context of her album and the creative process, I found myself faced with a process and a work that transcended the musical. Here was a spiritual search through the testimonies of women of immense spiritual maturity,” he said.

From her opening lyrics sung over piano and mournful cello, “Who could live between the two/ First love the world and later love God,” Rosalía announces that this album is a rupture from its Grammy-winning predecessors. “El mal querer (¨The Bad Loving” in Spanish) and “ Motomami "" had established Rosalía as one of the leading artists in the Spanish music world with her experimental urban beats.




Despite — or thanks to — its diversity of styles and song forms, ranging from classical strings, snippets of electronica with a cameo by Björk, a boys' choir from a thousand-year-old monastery, an aria-like song in Italian, a Portuguese fado and, of course, modern flamenco and hip-hop beats, “Lux” is off to a powerful start among listeners. It has four songs in Spotify's Top 50 global chart for this week, more than any artist, including Taylor Swift. 

Madonna has declared herself a fan of “Lux,” and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has lavishly called it the “album of the decade.”

Rosalía, 33, has said that after her success in more popular music forms, she let her long-held longing for the spiritual guide her in making “Lux.”

“In the end, in an age that seems not to be the age of faith or certainty or truth, there is more need than ever for a faith, or a certainty, or a truth,” she told reporters in Mexico City last month.

She said that she was guided by the concept that “an artist doubts less of his vocation when he works in the service of God than when he works in the service of him or herself.”

Rosalía apparently has not had a revelatory “come-to-Jesus” moment common among evangelical believers in America. Like many Spaniards, she grew up in a once staunchly Catholic Spain that has quickly secularized in recent decades, especially among the younger generations, leaving churches mostly to elderly parishioners. 

Even her early music flirted with medieval religious poetry, including one video clip from 2017 when she set a poem by 16th-century Spanish poet Saint John of the Cross to music.

While embracing Catholic symbols and expressing a fascination with female saints, Rosalía seems to eschew strictly organized practice and draws inspiration from other religions, as well. “Lux” responds to that diversity of interest, at one point quoting a Sufi poetess.

“I have read much more than I did years ago, reading many hagiographies of feminine saints from around the world,” she said. “They accompanied me throughout this process.”

Her style has also morphed. Gone are the hip-hop fashion and long fake nails Rosalía sported only a few years ago when she took the Latin Grammys by storm. Contrast that now with her look on the “Lux” album cover, where she is dressed in a solid white nun's veil with her arms apparently trapped inside a white top, her gaze averted.

Despite the potentially controversial move of comparing God to an obsessed lover in the song “Dios es un stalker” (“God Is a Stalker” in Spanish), Rosalía has won over the equivalent of the Vatican's culture minister.

Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça, prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Culture and Education, told Spanish news agency EFE this month that Rosalía has detected a wider dissatisfaction with the secular world.

“When a creator like Rosalía speaks of spirituality,” he said, “it means that she captures a profound need in contemporary culture to approach spirituality, to cultivate an inner life.”

Among the songs about faith, Rosalía found the time to deliver tunes like “La Perla” (“The Pearl” in Spanish) that dishes out scorn for a former lover.

That deft mix of both high and pop culture is part of the allure of “Lux,” said Josep Oton, professor of religious history for the ISCREB theology school in Barcelona.

“She has succeeded in making popular music with very deep cultural roots,” Oton told the AP. “Anyone can listen to it, and people with different backgrounds can take away different things. It is pop music, but it is profound.”

“Lux” can be intimidating for listeners, both due to its elaborate orchestration and smattering of esoteric lyrics that Rosalía was inspired to write after reading medieval mystical poets and their accounts of undergoing a transformative union with God through deep prayer and meditation.

In the exhilarating “Reliquia” (“Relic” in Spanish), Rosalía compares herself to female saints, listing the parts of her body and life she has left in cities around the world as relics for others' keeping. Her “Mio Cristo Piange Diamanti,” (“My Christ Weeps Diamonds” in Italian), brims with the extravagant Baroque image of the jewels dripping from the eyes of the Messiah.

In “Divinize,” Rosalía sings of the “divina buidor” (“divine emptiness” in Catalan), a central concept of medieval mysticism which focused on how the soul must experience abandonment to open a space where God can enter.

Victoria Cirlot, professor of humanities at Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University and expert in medieval feminine mystical tradition, liked “Lux” for its ability to introduce complex religious concepts to the general public, while noting it is “a minimalist” sample of the mystical tradition.

Cirlot said the moving “La Yugular” (“The Jugular” in Spanish) is rich in mystical thought because the throat, the home of the voice and the breath, is associated in many religious traditions as the body's door to the divine.

But, for Cirlot, it's the entire package that makes “Lux” so impactful.

“Rosalía is not just a great singer; she is a great actress, and her body language is full of these mystical gestures like contorting her face in an expression of ecstasy, of staring into nothing,” Cirlot said. “And then we have her amazing voice, which creates a sense of flight.”

The clock is ticking for the U.S. government to open up its files on Jeffrey Epstein. Congress has passed and President Donald Trump has signed legislation compelling the Justice Department to give the public everything it has on Epstein. (AP video produced by Joseph B. Frederick)

The fallout from Jeffrey Epstein's transgressions spans oceans and continents, from the vulnerable girls he exploited to the privileged people and institutions that chose to associate with him, cover up his activities — or look away. No one has paid a higher cost than Epstein's victims, who number more than 1,000, according to the Justice Department.

The world will soon have more information. President Donald Trump, friends with Epstein for years before he says they had a falling out in the early to mid-2000s, signed a bill late Wednesday forcing the Justice Department to make public many of its files on Epstein. The president's reversal was a rare bow to the fact that his fight to quash the files was doomed in the Republican-led Congress, a development noted in foreign news outlets as a moment of exposure on the home front for the brash American president who had dominated geopolitics all year.

It's worth noting that elected representatives of a nation bitterly divided on so much else at least could agree that the web of Epstein's sex trafficking must be exposed. Yet even that has limits, because the legislation shields some of the case files from public view. Trump has insisted throughout that he has done nothing wrong and did not know of Epstein's activities. 

But even in death, Epstein bedevils not only the president but academics, government leaders, royalty, journalists and banks, across borders and parties. Public trust has suffered, too. Here's a look at the escalating cost of the truth in the ongoing scandal. 




Economist Lawrence Summers has bounced back before after falling from the pinnacles of academia, government and punditry. That's not likely for now, in the face of newly released emails showing that Summers stayed in touch with Epstein years after the disgraced financier pled guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor.

The letters reveal that Summers appeared to ask Epstein for advice about women — and Epstein dubbed himself Summers' “wing man” — as late as 2019. That has cost the economist his positions with OpenAI, the Center for American Progress, a think tank, and the Budget Lab at Yale University. At first, Summers pledged to keep teaching classes at Harvard, captured in an eyebrow-raising video Wednesday in which he opened a class by noting his shame about the relationship with Epstein. Then he stepped away from that job, too, the university said. 

The 70-year-old Summers, a former treasury secretary and onetime contender to lead the Federal Reserve, has had to give up responsibilities at Harvard before. In 2006, he stepped down as president of the elite school after a speech in which he suggested that women were less represented in math and science fields because of “intrinsic aptitude.”

This week, Harvard said it was conducting its own review. In 2020, the elite school reported that Epstein visited its Cambridge, Mass., campus more than 40 times after his 2008 plea deal. It said he was given his own office and unfettered access to a research center he helped establish. It also found that Harvard accepted more than $9 million from Epstein during the decade leading up to his conviction but barred him from making further donations after that point.

A well-documented connection with Epstein has cost Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor his home on castle grounds and his title as prince of the realm. 

Revelations about the king's brother trickled forth for years and left little doubt that Mountbatten-Windsor, as Prince Andrew is now known, not only was involved in Epstein's sex crimes against minors but stayed in touch with the disgraced financier after his conviction. 

The evidence against Andrew grew increasingly hard to ignore even by his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who was said to consider Mountbatten-Windsor her favorite child and may have shielded him from the full consequences of his scandals.

That became impossible after Andrew gave a disastrous interview to the BBC in 2019. He was widely panned for failing to show empathy for Epstein's victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for the friendship.

In her posthumous memoir, Virginia Giuffre said she was only 17 when she was trafficked to Andrew and that Epstein took a now-famous photograph that showed the then-prince with his hand around her waist.

Andrew denied ever meeting Giuffre, did not recall the photo being taken and committed no crimes. But he did reach a settlement with her. Giuffre died by suicide in April.

“I can't take any more of this,” a sender identified in Epstein's contacts as “The Duke” wrote to him in 2011 of the scrutiny of their friendship, according to the partly redacted emails released by the House.

The flood of tawdry stories threatened to undermine support for the British monarchy at a time when Charles, 77 and in cancer treatment, is seeking ways to buttress the institution for his son, Prince William, to inherit.

Charles stripped Andrew of his title and forced him to move out of Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle where Mountbatten-Windsor has lived for more than 20 years. Mountbatten-Windsor is banished to Sandringham, the king's remote and private estate in the east of England.

This time, the president failed to control a crisis of his own making — then claimed credit for resolving it.

In fact, Trump signed the bill to release files only after he'd lost a highly visible political fight, including with some of his fiercest MAGA defenders. That started a 30-day clock ticking for the release. 

But six years after Epstein's death, his friendship with Trump continues to chip away at the president's time, attention and support. 

Trump increasingly began paying those costs in July, when the Justice Department abruptly reversed course and announced that no “further disclosure” of the Epstein files would be forthcoming. MAGA supporters, expecting Trump to make good on his campaign promise to release the files, edged toward rebellion.

Trump claimed he no longer wanted the support of such “stupid people” and “weaklings” — but that didn't quiet them. He tried lashing out at reporters who asked about Epstein, but they kept doing so. A White House effort to lean on key Republicans supporting the files' release didn't work. 

Major developments that Trump has trumpeted as achievements didn't quiet the Epstein issue for long. Democrats made sure of that, releasing their choice Epstein emails on Nov. 12, the same day Congress and Trump ended a record 43-day government shutdown. 

The president thundered on social media that Epstein's email claiming that Trump “knew about the girls” was a “hoax.” At another point, the president was forced to respond to a Wall Street Journal report that he'd written and signed a bawdy birthday note to Epstein that referred to secrets. Trump denied writing the note and filed a $10 billion defamation suit against the news outlet. Earlier this month, the president directed the Justice Department to investigate Democrats linked to Epstein.

Then, faced with the fact that all but one Republican in Congress would vote to release the FBI files, Trump abruptly backtracked. 

“I DON'T CARE!” Trump wrote in a social media post. “All I do care about is that Republicans get BACK ON POINT.”

PHOENIX (AP) — The Minnesota Timberwolves had an eight-point lead with less than minute to go Friday night, talking a little smack to their opponents as a hard-fought, chippy game between Western Conference rivals came to a close.

There was one problem: The Phoenix Suns weren't done.

Backup guard Collin Gillespie hit the go-ahead jumper with 6.4 seconds left and the Suns rallied to stun the Timberwolves 114-113 for their seventh win in eight games. The preceding minute was a masterclass in comeback moxie, with a no-name group of Suns putting together a wild win.

“They were talking too early and I love that, when guys get too confident,” Suns forward Dillon Brooks said. “Once the pressure starts heating up, their eyes start getting big, they start getting scared.”

Here's how the unexpected happened: Minnesota pushed ahead 113-105 with after Donte DiVincenzo hit his second free throw with 1:09 left. Phoenix brought the ball up the court and Brooks' 3-pointer was off the mark, but Royce O'Neale was there for the offensive rebound and putback, cutting it to 113-107 with 49.3 seconds left.

A few seconds later, Gillespie stole the in-bounds pass and Brooks found Jordan Goodwin for a 3-pointer, slicing the lead to 113-110. There were still 43.4 seconds remaining.

“We're just super competitive, winners and want to play winning basketball,” Gillespie said. “I think you saw a little of that at the end of the game. Just no quit. Fight until there's no time left.”




Brooks stole Julius Randle's pass on the next possession, Goodwin followed with a quick layup and it was suddenly 113-112 with 21.4 seconds. Edwards missed two free throws with 12.7 seconds, setting up a final shot for the Suns.

“We lost our minds, poor execution, turnovers, obviously, and just didn't stay locked-in during the last 90 seconds,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said.

By that time, Brooks and star guard Devin Booker had fouled out for the Suns, leaving Gillespie as the team's lead scoring option on the final possession.

The third-year guard out of Villanova never hesitated, burying a contested 10-foot jumper for the 114-113 lead. Randle's 3-pointer at the buzzer was off the mark, setting off a wild celebration as teammates mobbed Gillespie.

“The person (Randle) who was talking too much had two turnovers — and missed a shot,” Brooks said. “We don't give up. Anything's possible in this league to win games and lose games.”

Picked by many pundits to be one of the worst teams in the NBA, the Suns have a 10-6 record and are earning a reputation as a hard-nosed team that might be quite a bit better than expected.

Phoenix was able to win despite a tough game for Booker, who finished with 16 points on 4-of-18 shooting and a season-high nine turnovers.

“Just tough, gritty, competitive, together and selfless, that's what we've seen from this group from day one,” first-year coach Jordan Ott said. “Whatever it takes, whenever takes, whoever is out there, just find a way to outscore the opponent. 

“These wins are big for our group and what we're doing, but it doesn't stop.”

More than 500 Chinese drones confiscated by Florida officials will be used for military target practice for evaluation and training.

Instead of torching the machines, the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) will shoot them down with shotguns, according to Bloomberg News.

The quadcopter drones will be used over the course of three days next month to train elite U.S. troops on how to take out enemy drones.

The Military Drone Crucible training event is scheduled for Dec. 4-6 at Camp Blanding, according to the U.S. National Drone Association's (USNDA) website.

The event will feature training sessions focused on clearing a room with opposing troops present and striking an enemy convoy.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announces the guilty plea of former cartel boss 'El Mayo' and touts the success of the DOJ and law enforcement.

FIRST ON FOX — Two federal inmates previously on death row, one a crooked New Orleans cop and the other the man behind a multi-state killing spree, have been transferred to a notorious ""supermax"" prison in Colorado, the Justice Department told Fox News Digital. 

News of their transfers comes as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi looks to crack down on the previous administration's sweeping clemency actions, especially those against violent crime. 

The former death row inmates were transferred Thursday to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado, also known as ""ADX,"" Justice Department officials confirmed. 

They are among the 37 death row inmates whose sentences Biden commuted shortly before leaving office last December. The news prompted criticism and complaints that the record clemency and commutation actions were done as a political ""Hail Mary,"" and without proper vetting.

Eight death row inmates have already been transferred to ADX, the Justice Department told Fox News Digital, bringing to 10 the number of death row inmates that have been transferred to the facility since mid-September.

More are expected soon, as all 37 death row inmates commuted by Biden are expected to be moved to the facility by ""early next year,"" the Justice Department told Fox News Digital.

The effort comes as Bondi and the Trump administration have sought to reverse some of the Biden administration's efforts on criminal justice reform, with an emphasis on cracking down on violent crime.

Though sentence commutations cannot be fully reversed, Justice Department officials told Fox News Digital, Bondi has prioritized ways to penalize these individuals, in coordination with directives from Trump, and to ensure that the ""conditions of confinement"" are ""consistent with the security risks those inmates present because of their egregious crimes, criminal histories, and all other relevant considerations,"" according to an earlier DOJ memo. 

""Two more monsters who plotted and violently murdered innocent people will spend the rest of their lives in our country's most severe federal prison,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News Digital in a statement. 

""This Department of Justice will continue to seek accountability for the families blindsided by President Biden's reckless commutations of 37 vicious predators,"" she added.

Like the eight former death row inmates that were sent to Colorado's supermax prison, the two criminals processed in ADX on Thursday have been convicted of particularly heinous crimes. 

One individual chased down his ex-girlfriend from Roanoke, Virginia, to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he cut the phone lines to the apartment she was living in before using cans of gasoline to set the building on fire.

Though she escaped via a second-story window and was hospitalized for second-and third-degree burns, he followed her back to her family's home in Virginia two months later, where he gunned her down on the streets of her neighborhood and just steps from her mother.  

Another inmate, a former New Orleans police officer dubbed ""Robocop"" for his large physical demeanor and aggressive law enforcement style, was caught on tape by the FBI as he ordered and orchestrated the killing of a mother of three who had come to the precinct hours earlier to submit a supposedly confidential brutality complaint about his behavior that she witnessed on her way home the night before. 

The FBI had stumbled upon the conversation as part of a broader probe they had started to investigate a so-called ""protection racket"" between cocaine dealers in New Orleans and the city's police force, which had been guarding a warehouse stocked with the drug. The same officer was later revealed as one of the chief conspirators in the protection racket.

He was also found to have falsely testified in two murder cases, including one murder he has since been linked to. The statements were used to exonerate four men from prison, including three teenagers who had been wrongfully convicted of a murder 28 years prior.

ADX is the only true federal ""supermax"" prison in the U.S., and its inmates are as notorious as the prison's reputation. 

Among them are Ramzi Yousef, convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers; former Sinola Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán, or ""El Chapo""; and Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the co-founder of al-Qaeda.

Shortly after her confirmation as attorney general, Bondi issued a memo aimed at ""restoring a measure of justice"" to the victims' families. 

The measures granted by Biden earned more criticism than former President Barack Obama: As Fox News reported at the time, the vast majority of Obama's clemency actions focused on commuting the sentences of federal inmates who met certain criteria outlined under his administration's Clemency Initiative.

Bondi hosted victims' families earlier this year to hear their concerns about the commutations, DOJ said. Some said they had been stunned by the eleventh-hour commutations, and that they not been given a heads-up by the Biden administration.

In February, Bondi issued a memo to the Bureau of Prisons ordering an evaluation of where these prisoners should be detained.

Criminal defense attorney Josh Ritter joins 'Fox & Friends' reacting to an 18-year-old convicted of raping two girls sentenced to a year of rehab instead of prison, sparking outrage and questions about the DA and judge's decision.

Friday – A convicted sex offender freed from prison two weeks ago allegedly posed as a doctor and sexually assaulted a student inside an Arizona elementary school, sparking outrage and calls for answers from parents, according to reports.

Abel Kai Gblah, 25, is accused of sexual assault and kidnapping after he accessed school grounds and posed as a doctor to lure a student into a classroom and assaulted her at Orangewood Elementary School on Nov. 19, according to the Phoenix Police Department (PPD).

PPD officials said in a statement to Fox News Digital that officers were called to the school after administrators reported that an incident had occurred on campus.

""When officers arrived, they learned an unauthorized man had made it onto school grounds and lured a grade-school-aged girl into a classroom where he sexually assaulted her,"" police said. ""At some point, the student was able to push the man away. He then ran from the scene before officers arrived.""

FOX 10 Phoenix reported that court documents show Gblah allegedly drew the attention of a student by impersonating a doctor and expressing that he had to examine her.

After fleeing the school, police located Gblah, who was booked into jail on multiple charges.

Gblah was released from prison two weeks ago on similar charges, according to the outlet, and was also allegedly involved in human smuggling across the U.S. border. 

According to FOX 10, a prosecutor at Gblah's court appearance said he was convicted twice in 2021 for sexual conduct with a minor and a registered sex offender.

The news station reported that the Washington Elementary School District said in a statement that school administration immediately called 911 and placed the school on lockdown for over an hour.

""He was on campus for approximately 10 minutes and during that time, he made inappropriate contact with a student,"" the district wrote.

The district shared a separate statement with Fox News Digital that it released to parents on Friday, which revealed the results of its internal investigation, including that Gblah was a former student of the school who attended from 2012 to 2015.

While initial reports indicated that the Gblah gained access to the campus behind a student who had buzzed in, further investigation revealed that he entered through an unlocked lobby door, and walked in with a tardy student, the district stated.

Following the investigation, a staff member has been placed on administrative leave, the district added.

""We understand how alarming this situation has been and want you to know that we are reviewing every aspect of our safety procedures and communication to ensure that an event like this does not happen again, wrote Orangewood Elementary Principal Emily Paterson.

According to FOX 10, Gblah is being held on a cash-only bond of $500,000, with a preliminary hearing scheduled for Dec. 1.

A new robotic breakthrough out of South Korea may soon turn your clothes into assistive tech. Researchers have found a way to mass-produce ultra-thin ""fabric muscles"" that can flex and lift like human tissue. The innovation could redefine how wearable robots support people in everyday life.

Scientists at the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM) developed an automated weaving system that spins shape-memory alloy coils thinner than a strand of hair.

Despite weighing less than half an ounce, this new material can lift about 33 pounds. That makes it light, flexible and strong enough to power the next generation of wearable robotics.

WORLD'S FIRST AI-POWERED INDUSTRIAL SUPER-HUMANOID ROBOT

Dr. Cheol Hoon Park, principal researcher at the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials, examines a lightweight clothing-type wearable robot. (KIMM)

Until now, most wearable robots have relied on motors or pneumatic systems. These made them bulky, loud and expensive. They also limited how easily a person could move.

KIMM's solution replaces the metal core of earlier coil designs with natural fiber. This shift allows the yarn to stretch more freely while keeping its power. The upgraded weaving system now produces these fabric muscles continuously, paving the way for large-scale manufacturing.

The result is a lightweight actuator that moves naturally with the body. It can support multiple joints at once, like the shoulders, elbows and waist, without restricting movement.

The team built the world's first clothing-type wearable robot weighing less than 4.5 pounds. In testing, it cut muscle effort by more than 40% during repetitive work.

A smaller version designed for shoulder support weighs only about 1.8 pounds. In hospital trials at Seoul National University Hospital, patients with muscle weakness improved their shoulder movement by more than 57%.

These results show that fabric muscles can do much more than help factory workers; they can restore independence and mobility for people who need it most.

THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST

This new kind of wearable tech could one day show up in your daily routine. Picture a jacket that quietly helps lift groceries, or a work shirt that reduces strain during long shifts. For people in recovery, it could offer gentle, continuous support that makes movement easier and less painful.

Healthcare professionals could see fewer injuries, while patients gain more freedom. And in industries like construction and logistics, these fabric muscles could reduce fatigue and boost safety.

KIMM's success with automated fabric muscle production marks a turning point for wearable robotics. By weaving strength into soft, flexible materials, engineers are closing the gap between machine power and human comfort. As this technology spreads from labs to workplaces and homes, the idea of clothing that truly supports you, physically and practically, is becoming a reality.

Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson and Rep. María Salazar, R-Fla., join ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's increased military pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and an upcoming Capitol Hill vote to condemn socialism.

The Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines about flying over Venezuela as it issued a notice urging them to ""exercise caution"" due to the ""potentially hazardous situation"" in the region. 

The advisory comes as the U.S. has significantly increased its military presence across the Caribbean under U.S. Southern Command, deploying bombers, warships and Marines as part of an expanded campaign targeting drug-trafficking and so-called ""narco-terrorist"" networks operating near Venezuela. 

""Operators are advised to exercise caution when operating in the Maiquetia flight information region at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela,"" the FAA advisory said. 

""Threats could pose a potential risk to aircraft at all altitudes, including during overflight, the arrival and departure phases of flight, and/or airports and aircraft on the ground,"" it added, requesting airlines to provide at least 72-hour advance notice to the FAA if they plan to fly through the area.

Direct flights from U.S. passenger and cargo carriers to Venezuela have been suspended since 2019, but some airlines still fly over the country on their South American routes, according to Reuters. 

It added that American Airlines said Friday it stopped flying over Venezuela in October, while Delta Air Lines said it stopped ""a while ago.""

""Since September 2025, there has been an increase in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interference in the Maiquetia Flight Information Region (SVZM FIR), as well as activity associated with increasing Venezuela military readiness,"" the FAA also said.

""Some civil aircraft recently reported GNSS interference while transiting the SVZM FIR, which, in some cases, caused lingering effects throughout the flight. GNSS jammers and spoofers can affect aircraft out to 250 nautical miles and can impact a wide variety of critical communication, navigation, surveillance, and safety equipment on aircraft,"" the FAA continued.

""Additionally, since early September, Venezuela has conducted multiple military exercises and directed the mass mobilization of thousands of military and reserve forces. While Venezuela has at no point expressed an intent to target civil aviation, the Venezuelan military possesses advanced fighter aircraft and multiple weapons systems capable of reaching or exceeding civil aircraft operating altitudes, as well as potential low-altitude risk from man-portable air defense systems and anti-aircraft artillery,"" it also warned.

Fox News Digital pressed Democratic lawmakers on whether the shutdown was worth it and if Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer did enough to hold the line.

On the heels of a historic 43-day government shutdown, Democrats are facing tough questions about whether the record-breaking standoff was worth it, and whether Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave up too soon.

After failing to secure the healthcare subsidies they demanded, and with several senators breaking ranks to join Republicans in reopening the government — a move widely seen as a black eye on Schumer's leadership — Senate Democrats continued to blame President Donald Trump and the GOP for the shutdown when pressed by Fox News Digital.

""I'm disappointed and angry that Republicans forced a false and impossible choice between healthcare insurance and reopening the government,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Wednesday. ""They promised that there will be a vote on extending the healthcare subsidies. If they fail to provide that vote, or if the vote fails, they should be held accountable. They are to be blamed.""

PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS TURN ON PARTY LEADERSHIP AFTER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ENDS WITHOUT HEALTHCARE GUARANTEES

Blumenthal charged that it was Republicans who ""forced the false choice between reopening the government and affordable health insurance,"" which he said has been ""viewed reprehensibly by the American people, and rightly so.""

Like many of his Democratic colleagues, the Connecticut senator sidestepped a question about whether Schumer could have done more to hold the line on negotiations.

SENATE VOTE TO END GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IGNITES DEMOCRAT CIVIL WAR

Seven Democratic senators, including one independent who caucuses with them, and six House Democrats voted to reopen the government last week, without extending the pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that Democrats had pushed for since the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

The intraparty revolt has exposed a widening rift between Democratic leadership and its left flank, as progressive candidates accused Schumer of surrendering leverage to Republicans in exchange for a funding deal that left key healthcare priorities unresolved.

""We have federal workers across the country that have been missing paychecks. We have SNAP recipients, millions of SNAP recipients across the country whose access to food stability was imperiled, and we have to figure out what that was for,"" Ocasio-Cortez said last week, before adding, ""We cannot enable this kind of cruelty with our cowardice.""

Back on Capitol Hill this week, Democrats were less willing to blame Schumer for the Democrats who broke ranks, instead blaming Republicans for the ultimatum.

When asked if the shutdown was worth it, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, told Fox News Digital that Democrats ""should absolutely continue fighting for healthcare.""

And Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., said, ""I don't think you can look at a shutdown from that kind of perspective"" of whether it was worth it.

""I think what's absolutely clear is that Republicans now own this healthcare crisis,"" McBride added. ""Americans very clearly understand that it was Republicans who are stopping at nothing to prevent a vote on the Affordable Care Act tax credit, including having been willing to shut down the government.""

""I voted against reopening without having secured the changes to healthcare and addressing the healthcare-increase spikes. That remains the focus, that remains the work ahead of us still,"" Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said when pressed on the same question and without answering whether the government is headed for another shutdown.

Democrats who spoke to Fox News Digital said they hoped the government isn't headed for another shutdown but maintained that the party should continue to fight for healthcare guarantees.

While the government reopened last week, the stopgap funding bill only keeps federal spending at current fiscal-year-2025 levels through Jan. 30 to give Congress more time to negotiate a longer-term appropriations package for fiscal year 2026. If Congress can't reach a consensus, the government could be headed toward another shutdown.

As part of a backroom deal to reopen the government, Senate Democrats were promised a separate vote on extending healthcare subsidies.

""I certainly hope we'll avoid another government shutdown, but, again, Republicans promised a vote on extending the healthcare tax credit subsidies. If they fail to provide that vote, or if the vote fails, they'll be to blame. They'll be held accountable,"" Blumenthal said.

And Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said he was looking forward to Republicans having the opportunity to go on the record by voting on the healthcare guarantees this December. 

As for whether the government is barreling toward another shutdown, Kelly said, ""[You] gotta ask the President and the Republicans in the House and Senate.""

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kristen Gillibrand and Elissa Slotkin did not respond to Fox News Digital's question about whether the shutdown was worth it, and their offices did not immediately respond to further inquiries. 

When reached for comment, White House Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson flipped the script on the Democrats who placed blame on Republicans for the government shutdown. 

""Democrats shut down the government and inflicted great pain on the American people because they wanted to use struggling families as ‘leverage' for their far left agenda,"" Jackson told Fox News Digital. 

""President Trump defeated their absurd gambit and delivered yet another win to the American people, but it's alarming that even after their ploy failed, Democrats still can't admit their shutdown hurt the American people,"" she added.

President Donald Trump has terminated temporary protected status for all Somalis in Minnesota, he announced on Friday evening.

The Truth Social announcement followed a City Journal report alleging millions of Minnesota taxpayer dollars were stolen in a fraud scheme and fell into the pockets of the Somali-based al Shabaab terrorist group.

“Minnesota, under Governor Waltz (sic), is a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity. I am, as President of the United States, hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota. Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It's OVER!” Trump wrote.

The City Journal investigation found what authors Ryan Thorpe and Christopher F. Rufo called a “Minnesota drowning in fraud.”

“Federal counterterrorism sources confirm that millions of dollars in stolen funds have been sent back to Somalia, where they ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,” the report reads. “As one confidential source put it: ‘The largest funder of Al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.'”

Trump did not provide any details on how his announced plan would unfold, or explicitly connect his Truth Social post to the report.

Minnesota has the highest Somali population of any state in the U.S.

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here.

Seinfeld, the greatest TV comedy of all time, is famously known as a show about nothing. Still successful in syndication almost 30 years since going off the air, the plot focuses on the lives of four single New Yorkers navigating their way through various dating, career, and cultural oddities. The episodes never involved some great reveal, action, or cliffhanger, but simply the quirks of the characters and the people they encounter in the big city. 

Capitol Hill currently has a reality-style Seinfeld series playing out courtesy of the Jeffrey Epstein files, which, from a political perspective, is also a show about nothing. The spectacle underscores and crystallizes everything we know about Washington, especially when it comes to the modern-day Democratic Party. 

IN FOCUS: TRUMP 2.0 SO FAR GIVES REASONS FOR GRATITUDE AND REASONS FOR ALARM

We all know what the endgame is here, and it has nothing to do with the young women who were trafficked by the monster who was Epstein. This, of course, is all about damaging President Donald Trump, and legacy media is more than happy to make this Epstein show about nothing into the sequel of the Trump-Russia collusion scandal that ate up most of Trump's first term despite there being no there there. 

Let's be clear: If Democrats had anything on Trump while they were in power, they would have absolutely leaked that to the press or held hearings when he ran for president in 2016, or when he ran again in 2020, or when he ran a third time in 2024. This is a party that has weaponized the justice system against him in his last run for president through laughable cases attempted to be carried out by partisans such as Jack Smith, Fani Willis, Alvin Bragg, Leticia James, and others, so why would they hold back their biggest winning hand with Epstein? 

Unless it's a show about nothing.

Things got to laughable heights thanks to the laughable lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), earlier this week. Crockett, who is seemingly on CNN and MSNBC more than most of its paid anchors and analysts these days, railed during a speech in Congress about Epstein once donating money to current Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Lee Zeldin. One problem: The Epstein whom Crockett was referring to was Dr. Jeffrey Epstein, a New York physician who died in 2018. 

One would think that Crockett, who is eyeing a run against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) next year, would apologize for making such an egregious error. But that just ain't happening because that would take having an ounce of humility and integrity. “Listen, I never said that it was that Jeffrey Epstein,” Crockett told CNN “anchor” Kaitlan Collins, later adding, “So my team, what they did is they Googled, and that is specifically why I said a Jeffrey Epstein. Unlike Republicans, I at least don't go out and just tell lies. 

“Because it was not the same one? That's fine,” she continued as Collins listened intently. “But when Lee Zeldin had something to say, all he had to say was, it was a different Jeffrey Epstein. He admitted that he did receive donations from a Jeffrey Epstein. So, at least I wasn't trying to mislead people … I literally had maybe 20 minutes before I had to do that debate.”

You. Have. To. Be. Kidding. Us. 

“He admitted he did receive donations from a Jeffrey Epstein…” 

And that proves what exactly? 

As for Kaitlan Collins, this was a textbook example of how not to interview someone. She allowed Crockett to ramble on and end her statement by hilariously claiming she hadn't meant to mislead people. She absolutely did — guilt by association, just as Democrats are doing with Trump. 

The whole thing is reminiscent of a Seinfeld episode involving the main female character, Elaine, who begins dating a guy named “Joel Rifkin.” Rikfin, of course, was a serial killer who carried out nine murders in New York in the late 80s and early 90s. But Elaine becomes too embarrassed by the name, so she tries to convince him to change it. 

Ironically enough, Elaine suggests “O.J.” as a benign possible replacement. Seven months after the episode aired, O.J. Simpson was arrested on charges of murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. 

Former Vice President Kamala Harris has also jumped into the act, demanding that the Epstein files be released during an event with The Bulwark Podcast in Nashville. The host, Trump Derangement Syndrome sufferer Tim Miller, predictably didn't bother to ask Harris why she and former President Joe Biden didn't release the files during their years in office, nor did he ask why she never mentioned Epstein once on the campaign trail when she ran for president in 2019 or 2024. Instead, Miller just chuckled along and followed up with zero questions. 

Things got even better when it was revealed that Rep. Stacey Plaskett, a non-voting delegate of the U.S. Virgin Islands, was texting with Epstein on the House floor during a hearing with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen in 2019, after Epstein had been convicted as a sex offender. But much like Crockett, Plaskett was unrepentant when politely asked about it on CNN. 

“I believe that Jeffrey Epstein had information, and I was gonna get information to get at the truth,” she explained. “Having a friendship with him is not something that I would deem to have. And so I'm just looking forward. I'm moving forward.” 

Yes, because there's no more reliable source of credible information than a convicted sex offender whom Plaskett once took donations from. But Plaskett says we should just ignore what she did and “move forward.” 

Overall, Trump will be unfairly and dishonestly associated with Epstein the same way he is with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. Both are attacks via innuendo. The Mueller report cleared Trump, and even in 2025, the president is still accused of being a Russian pawn six years after it was released. 

There also isn't a shred of evidence of Trump doing anything nefarious via Epstein, and Democrats and the media don't care because of the main goal: Hurt Trump by attempting to split the Make America Great Again base courtesy of attention-seeking Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA)… the media's next Liz Cheney. 

IN FOCUS: ISRAEL SHOULD PHASE OUT US AID FOR ITS OWN GOOD

Anything involving Epstein or any files should focus on the perpetrators and the victims. Full stop. 

Instead, it's become yet another political football, the Seinfeld of Capitol Hill, and therefore a show about sound and fury… signifying nothing.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Department of Homeland Security has been awarding a number of federal contracts for just under $100,000, after Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to review contracts of six figures and more personally.

On June 11, Noem vowed to review and consider department proposals upwards of $100,000. Since then, DHS has authorized 11 federal contracts for between $99,999.00 and $99,999.99, starting on Aug. 14. The contract trend was first reported by the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight.

“All proposals for my consideration must include all relevant details, including any mission impact, dollar values, description of the supplies or services any timeline issues, and a description of the proposed action,” Noem wrote in the June memo. “Requests for approval of obligations above the $100,000 threshold must be submitted via memo through the Executive Secretary process. As with any request for Secretarial approval, please allow a minimum of 5 days for Front Office review.”

Prior to Aug. 14, no other DHS contracts were awarded for between $99,999.00 and $99,999.99 in 2025. The POGO analysis pointed to an August New York Times report that showed Noem's sign-off rule caused a delay in “mission critical” contracts.

Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the Washington Examiner that the 11 contracts were “for routine operational needs.”

“These contracts were for routine operational needs. Under Secretary Noem's leadership, DHS is rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and is reprioritizing appropriated dollars — saving taxpayers more than $13.2 billion in her first 7 months,” McLaughlin said.

DHS REVIEWS BIDEN-ERA GRANTS TO ‘TERROR-LINKED' GROUPS

According to available online federal spending data going back to 2007, no administration's DHS has ever awarded 11 or more federal contracts within the one-dollar range in question. Former President Barack Obama's administration came the closest with nine awarded in 2013. President Donald Trump's first-term DHS only awarded two contracts within the $99,999.00 and $99,999.99 price range.

There were two contracts within this price range awarded in 2024, one in 2021, two in 2020, two in 2016, four in 2015, seven in 2014, nine in 2013, two in 2012, two in 2011, one in 2010, one in 2009, two in 2008, and one in 2007.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO) shared an audio recording of several graphic, violent threats he has received in the wake of President Donald Trump suggesting Crow's actions of urging U.S. military members to “refuse illegal orders” were punishable by death.

Crow was among six Democratic lawmakers who recorded a video calling for service members to disobey illegal orders. Trump responded on Truth Social, suggesting the death penalty should be used against them, writing, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”

DEMOCRATIC VETERANS IN CONGRESS URGE SERVICE MEMBERS TO REFUSE UNSPECIFIED UNLAWFUL ORDERS

Trump's post sparked a flurry of lawmakers condemning the post and violent rhetoric. On Friday evening, Crow posted a compiled audio recording of violent threats, among which people have called for his death and the death of his family, that he has received this week. 

The callers called Crow a “worthless f***ing traitor” and “scum,” but reached far more graphic extents.

“You disgraced America, and I pray you die today, but not before your family does. I pray they die a painful death,” one of the threats against Crow said.

Crow called for the condemnation of the rhetoric.

“Trump called for my arrest, prosecution, and execution. Almost immediately, the threats exploded—against me, my family, and my office. All Americans must condemn this political violence,” Crow said.

In response to the Washington Examiner‘s request for comment, the White House pointed the publication to Trump and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's comments from today.

“I'm not threatening them, but I think they're in serious trouble. I would say they're in serious trouble. I'm not threatening them, but I think they're in serious trouble. In the old days, it was death that was [the penalty for] seditious behavior, that was a big deal. Today, nothing's a big deal. Today's a different world,” Trump said on Fox News's Brian Kilmeade Show.

TRUMP BLASTS ‘SEDITIOUS' DEMOCRATIC VETERANS: ‘PUNISHABLE BY DEATH'

The six lawmakers — Sens. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ), and Reps. Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Chris Deluzio (D-PA), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), and Crow — urged military personnel to “refuse illegal orders.” They said “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home.”

“These are people that, in my opinion, broke the law,” Trump said. “Now what happens to them, I can't tell you.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The president likes winners. And the mayor-elect proved he can charm a foe.

Today's White House meeting between New York's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, and President Donald Trump suggests that maybe, just maybe, the U.S. government won't go to war with its largest city. The event was much anticipated as blood sport, a showdown between a young communist and an old despot, to use their favored insults for each other.

Instead, the two men put on such a show of good manners that at times I had to laugh out loud at the stagecraft. After a closed-door meeting, Trump and Mamdani summoned the press, and there was Uncle Donnie seated behind his desk in the Oval Office, beaming as his favorite nephew, Zohran, stood by his right shoulder looking dutiful.

“We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,” Trump said, peering at Mamdani. “I feel very confident that he can do a very good job.”

He is? Trump, after all, had previously posted on Truth Social that Mamdani “looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he's not very smart.” He had also threatened to defund the city if Mamdani became mayor. Mamdani, for his part, said of the president on Election Night earlier this month: “If there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.”

Tom Nichols: The president is losing control of himself

No hint of such insults—or of attempted “dismantling”—was heard today. When a reporter asked Mamdani whether he considers the president a fascist, the mayor-elect momentarily fumbled. “I've spoken about—”

“That's okay,” Trump interjected. “You could just say ‘yes.' It's easier—it's easier than explaining it.” He smiled indulgently and patted Mamdani on the arm. “I don't mind.”

This was one of several moments in the press conference that felt more like a Saturday Night Live skit than a newscast. But perhaps all this was not as improbable as it looked and sounded. Trump bellows and insults and demeans, but so much of that is an act, guff and bullying. His earlier talk of Mamdani as “my little communist mayor” even carried an odd hint of affection, and there was evident admiration in the way in which he spoke of Mamdani's unlikely mayoral victory. These men are, in their very different ways, populists, Queens men, and sometimes statists; they share a disdain for political establishments. And Trump, the developer, is aware of the extremely high cost of New York real estate, a focus of Mamdani's campaign.

Trump always and ever loves winners, whether a Saudi crown prince, a billionaire businessman, or, apparently, a democratic-socialist mayor fresh off an underdog win. He also admires those who dress well and carry themselves with confidence. Mamdani meets these requirements. He is a well-educated, well-spoken son of privilege; his parents are among the cinematic and academic elite. Several wealthy New Yorkers already talk with him entre nous. Kathryn Wylde, the long-serving president of the Partnership for New York City, a sort of oligarch's chamber of commerce, offered advice during his campaign and recently said that she had voted for Mamdani.

Michael Powell: Zohran Mamdani is about to confront reality

Mamdani can at times drop his smile and sound confrontational, as he did in his Election Night speech, slamming his vanquished opponent, Andrew Cuomo, and challenging Trump directly. But his more impressive ability as a pol was on display in the weeks that followed, as he slipped into that smile of his once more and quietly went about appointing some wise old hands as mayoral aides.

This afternoon, Mamdani appeared to charm a dangerous foe and, in so doing, perhaps purchased himself a respite from Trump's threats to send the National Guard to New York. But Mamdani should restrain his postgame talk.

In 2017, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, then the Senate and House minority leaders, talked, joked, and negotiated hard with Trump, and they emerged with a budget deal so beneficial for Democrats that Republican legislators were startled and wounded. Many Democrats bragged that they'd outmaneuvered Trump, which turned out to be deeply unwise; he remains adversaries with Schumer and Pelosi to this day, of course. Trump prides himself on being a dealmaker and is acutely sensitive to any claim that he has been taken.

In the months to come, Trump could still decide to send the National Guard marching down Broadway, or direct masked Border Patrol agents to raid Roosevelt Avenue in Queens, or try to strip federal funding for housing and bridges. The best way to avoid these outcomes is for Mamdani to accept his victory quietly.

And perhaps he knows that. Mamdani appears to be preternaturally possessed. As the half-hour press conference at the White House wound down, I watched for a presidential slap, or a slip of Mamdani's genial mask. That never came; in fact, Trump went on to say that he would feel comfortable living in Mamdani's New York.

“I'll be cheering for him,” Trump concluded. He shook Mamdani's hand and, with his other hand, gave him a benevolent pat. I doubt that Mamdani needs any lessons in getting what he wants.

The conservative backlash against Nick Fuentes has yet to challenge the president who had him over for dinner.

Last month, Tucker Carlson, the host of one of the country's most popular podcasts, interviewed Nick Fuentes, a white-nationalist influencer, for more than two hours. The two men got along famously, and it was little wonder why. Carlson has become a fierce and obsessive critic of Israel; he has interviewed a Holocaust revisionist and said that “Christian Zionists” have “been seized by this brain virus.”

Not everyone on the right was pleased. So in the aftermath of the Carlson-Fuentes conversation, Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, put out a video defending Carlson, a “close friend” of the institution, against the “venomous coalition attacking him.” Heritage's proper role, according to Roberts, is to “focus on our political adversaries on the left, not attacking our friends on the right.” Roberts said he may disagree with, and even abhor, some of what Fuentes has said, but he made clear that “canceling him is not the answer, either.” What Roberts didn't anticipate is the backlash he received, from both within and outside Heritage.

“An old political poison is growing on the new right, led by podcasters and internet opportunists who are preoccupied with the Jews,” the conservative editorial board of The Wall Street Journal wrote. “It is spreading wider and faster than we thought, and it has even found an apologist in Kevin Roberts, president of the venerable Heritage Foundation.”

Roberts, clearly unprepared for the outrage, backtracked, first blaming his staff for what happened but eventually admitting, “I made a mistake and I let you down and I let down this institution. And I am sorry for that. Period. Full stop.” Roberts, however, has yet to utter a critical word about Tucker Carlson.

The Heritage Foundation is as good an institution as any in which to study the intellectual and moral decline of the American right. Founded in 1973 by Edwin Feulner, Paul Weyrich, and Joseph Coors, it became the most influential think tank in America in a matter of a few years. Proudly conservative, its Mandate for Leadership, published in 1981, served as something of a blueprint for the Reagan administration, which maintained close ties to Heritage.

After the Ronald Reagan years the influence of Heritage waned, though it continued to be a potent political and ideological force in politics, and especially within conservatism. (Though it was not my main institutional home, I was affiliated with the Heritage Foundation in the early 1990s.)

But in the mid–Barack Obama years, Heritage, to align itself with the Tea Party movement, began to lean hard into populism. A conservative intellectual who is a keen observer of the happenings on the right, and who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly, told me that in the process, Heritage “changed altogether their basic conception of what the institution's purpose was.” In place of policy research and advocacy, “they transformed themselves into a kind of grassroots populist group that is fundamentally hostile to the institutions of our government.”  This suited Jim DeMint, a former senator with populist instincts who became president of Heritage in 2013. DeMint built up Heritage Action, a sister institution that engaged in direct lobbying and grassroots organizing, and which provided a legislative scorecard. DeMint also transformed Heritage's funding model, creating a small-dollar-donor machine that operated by constantly inflaming the anger and fear of its supporters. Heritage dictated populist messaging to its policy teams rather than letting them help policy makers find more effective ways to govern.

In 2015, as Donald Trump began his march toward the Republican presidential nomination, Heritage became even more radicalized.

“The institution came to organize itself around Trump's person rather than any set of ideas he might usefully advance,” the conservative intellectual told me. “They were unwilling to criticize him, which was never their approach to prior Republican presidents, even Ronald Reagan, and essentially forced their scholars to endorse whatever the administration was doing or else keep quiet.”

Kay James, who became president in 2018, made efforts to restrain some of these excesses, but to little avail. Heritage viewed its role as assisting Trump in his transformation of the right, to the point that by the end of Trump's first term, Heritage was doing all it could to provide cover for Trump in the aftermath of the January 6 assault on the Capitol and had embraced absurd conspiracy theories about a stolen election. (In 2025, Heritage put out an Orwellian statement after Trump issued pardons: “President Trump's decision to pardon the January 6 defendants marks a pivotal moment in restoring the integrity of America's justice system.”)

James left in 2021. Heritage's new president, Kevin Roberts, pushed the institution in an even more populist, MAGA-friendly direction. By 2024, it was clear that Trump would win the GOP nomination for a second time; there would be no daylight between him and Heritage. The latter would conform to the wishes of the former, under any and all circumstances, even if it meant jettisoning conservative principles.

Something else was happening as well. In 2021, the Heritage Foundation allowed Tucker Carlson, then the most popular cable-news host in the country, to gain a “stranglehold” over it, as the journalist Michael Warren has detailed in The Dispatch. As a result, according to Warren, “Heritage has institutionally abandoned many conservative principles—free enterprise, American leadership on the world stage, constitutionalism—in favor of a grab bag of positions that track both with the priorities of the Trump administration and the particular whims of Carlson.”

The criticisms directed at Roberts for his defense of Carlson came from politicians, historians, and public intellectuals; from pundits, magazine editors, radio-talk-show hosts, and podcasters. It was as if a light switch had been flipped. For a moment at least, large parts of the American right wanted to publicly distance themselves from Fuentes—a white supremacist, an anti-Semite, and a defender of Hitler—and from those who promoted him. A decade into the Trump era, it turns out that there is still a faint moral pulse to be found on the right, a belief that some lines shouldn't be crossed. Those of us who are conservative critics of Trump will take encouragement where we can find it.

But even this dim hope comes with qualifiers. For one thing, speaking out against a white nationalist who praises Hitler and Stalin, who says “a lot of women want to be raped” and who insists that segregation was “better for them, it's better for us,” seems like a pretty low bar to clear.

But it's actually worse than that. In 2022, Trump hosted Fuentes and Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort. A source familiar with the dinner conversation told Axios that Trump “seemed very taken” with Fuentes.

“There was a lot of fawning back and forth,” Axios reported. At one point during the dinner, Trump turned to Ye and said of Fuentes, “I really like this guy. He gets me.”

I'm sure he does.

Here's the problem: Many of the same people who ripped Carlson for hosting a podcast with Fuentes—Senator Ted Cruz is one name that comes to mind—failed to criticize Trump for hosting a dinner with Fuentes. And last Sunday, Trump said he did not have a problem with Carlson interviewing Fuentes to “get the word out” so that people could make up their mind.

When asked, “What role do you think Tucker Carlson should play in the Republican Party and the conservative movement?” Trump responded, “Well, I found him to be good. I mean, he said good things about me over the years. He's—I think he's good.” Fuentes, meanwhile, sent out a four-word message on social media: “Thank you Mr. President!”

Trump, then, continues to provide cover to the worst among us, and the voices of conscience who screwed up the courage to speak out against a podcaster and a Holocaust denier, and even the president of a think tank, do what they have always done, which is to shrink back when it matters most. When it comes to taking on Trump—the dark, dominant figure in MAGA world—the majority go sotto voce. That's a fight they'd rather leave to others.

In that sense, nothing has really changed.

The reason Trump has been the dominant figure in world politics for the past decade rests in part on the MAGA true believers. They have a cultlike devotion to Trump, as unshakable as anything I've seen in my lifetime. Their moral blindness is almost incomprehensible to me. From what I can tell, they live in a twilight zone, a place of unreason, detached from reality, at least regarding politics. It's a world where black is white, where up is down, and where Trump is good.  But at least as responsible for the Trump era are the people who knew better, or should have known better; who had concerns about Trump but kept them to themselves; and who felt most comfortable embracing the mindset of “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.” They became known as “never–never Trumpers.” They rationalized, time after time after time, their support for a man whose every part of his life is touched by corruption.

When confronted with inconvenient facts, they reject them. When Trump does cruel and wicked things, they ignore them. When they need Bible verses to justify their support for Trump, they find them. When reminded about their criticisms of Bill Clinton for his ethical lapses, they dismiss them. There is always a reason to stick with Trump, to vote for him, to justify his actions, to look the other way when needed. However bad Trump was, they assured themselves and others, the Democrats were far, far worse. And so they pulled their punches. Their ethos aligns with that of the Heritage Foundation: There are no enemies to the right.

I long ago lost track of the number of people I know on the right who have expressed frustration with my warnings about Trump. One of them, a former Republican member of Congress who served during the Reagan era, wrote to me on December 7, 2020, after I published an article titled “Trump's Most Malicious Legacy,” and told me this: “Advice from a friend. You need to liberate yourself from Trump hatred.” He wrote to me a month later, at 2:52 p.m. on January 6, 2021. This time his message was shorter: “You are validated.” A gracious note on his part, perhaps, but it was of little use as a mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol, chanting “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” and beating cops along the way.

So we are where we are. Those who aided and abetted an arsonist are now expressing shock that the city is turning to ashes. The very people whose support for Trump's reelection paved the way for the rise of what they call the “fascistic, neo-Nazi, radical right” are now in a panic. People who said, in the aftermath of Trump's 2024 victory, that this “could be an emerging new golden age for the country” are now warning that the GOP is “being eaten by its radicals.” Those who were “unbelievably relieved” that Trump was reelected now lament “the new radicalism racing through the young Right” and warn that young Christians are “neck-deep in anti-Semitism.” They've recognized that “the Groyper thing”—a term associated with Fuentes and his followers—“has infiltrated young conservative Washington networks to a significant degree.”

Unnerved by this, some people on the right are now, belatedly, trying to draw boundaries. And that includes those who, to their credit, have broken with Trump at times in the past. But what boundaries can you effectively draw when the movement you are part of has for a decade embraced the most unethical and transgressive political figure in American history?

Martin Niemöller was a German theologian and Lutheran pastor. In 1920, after having served in World War I, he decided to follow the path of his father into the ministry and began seminary training at the University of Münster.

Niemöller's sermons reflected his politics, which were strongly nationalist. The year that Hitler came to power, 1933, he wrote that the Weimar Republic had been “years of darkness.” Hitler would lead a national revival, Niemöller believed. The führer would return Germany to Christian morals, act as a bulwark against secularism, and usher in a new and glorious era.

But Niemöller, despite holding anti-Semitic views, soon broke with the Deutsche Christen, or “German Christians,” a pro-Nazi faction within the German Protestant Church, because of their interference in Church matters and attacks on “non-Aryan” Church members. In 1934, he helped create the Confessing Church, an anti-Nazi alternative to the state Church. His opposition to the Nazi regime's control of the Church led to his arrest several times, and he was eventually sent to concentration camps in Sachsenhausen and Dachau and a camp in Tyrol, Austria, where he was liberated by American troops in 1945.

His imprisonment by the Nazis was an inflection point; in 1945, he was a prominent figure in the creation of the Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt, which confessed the Church's collective guilt for its insufficient opposition to the Nazi regime.

Yair Rosenberg: The MAGA influencers rehabilitating Hitler

In a sermon a year later, Niemöller said, “We must openly declare that we are not innocent of the Nazi murders, of the murder of German communists, Poles, Jews, and the people in German-occupied countries.” This guilt, he continued, “lies heavily upon the German people and the German name, even upon Christendom. For in our world and in our name have these things been done.”

In that same year, 1946, Niemöller shared words that would soon become immortalized. “First they came for the socialists and I did not speak out, because I was not a socialist,” he said. “Then they came for the trade unions and I did not speak out, because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak out, because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.”

America is not Nazi Germany and Trump is not Hitler. But one can act in ways that are a good deal less malevolent than the Nazis and still do an awful lot of harm. Niemöller's words can apply to nations quite different from Germany in the 1930s and '40s. And Niemöller's warning about passivity and indifference, about the dangers of silence and inaction in the face of injustice, about going along to get along and speaking out too late, is enduring.

The Trump era is far from over. There will be many more occasions on which American conservatives will face Niemöller's test, and be asked whether they have the courage to stand opposed to Nazism and Hitler apologists. And those who criticized Carlson and Fuentes this time will have the chance to speak out again, and to speak out against the president for the first time. Perhaps condemning his call for the death of Democratic lawmakers could be a good place to start.  It may or may not be too late to salvage the American right and the Republican Party. But it's never too late to speak against cruelty and lawlessness, and to speak up for justice and compassion and human dignity.

One word of truth shall outweigh the whole world.

Who will benefit from the White House's 28-point proposal for Ukraine?

The 28-point peace plan that the United States and Russia want to impose on Ukraine and Europe is misnamed. It is not a peace plan. It is a proposal that weakens Ukraine and divides America from Europe, preparing the way for a larger war in the future. In the meantime, it benefits unnamed Russian and American investors, at the expense of everyone else.

The plan was negotiated by Steve Witkoff, a real-estate developer with no historical, geographical, or cultural knowledge of Russia or Ukraine, and Kirill Dmitriev, who heads Russia's sovereign-wealth fund and spends most of his time making business deals. The revelation of their plan this week shocked European leaders, who are now paying almost all of the military costs of the war, as well as the Ukrainians, who were not sure whether to take this latest plan seriously until they were told to agree to it by Thanksgiving or lose all further U.S. support. Even if the plan falls apart, this arrogant and confusing ultimatum, coming only days after the State Department authorized the sale of anti-missile technology to Ukraine, will do permanent damage to America's reputation as a reliable ally, not only in Europe but around the world.

The central points of the plan reflect long-standing Russian demands. The United States would recognize Russian rule over Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk—all of which are part of Ukraine. Russia would, in practice, be allowed to keep territory it has conquered in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. In all of these occupation zones, Russian forces have carried out arrests, torture, and mass repression of Ukrainian citizens, and because Russia would not be held accountable for war crimes, they could continue to do so with impunity. Ukraine would withdraw from the part of Donetsk that it still controls—a heavily reinforced and mined territory whose loss would open up central Ukraine to a future attack.

Read: A self-defeating reversal on Ukraine

Not only would this plan cede territory, people, and assets to Russia; it also seems deliberately designed to weaken Ukraine, politically and militarily, so that Russia would find it easier to invade again a year from now, or 10 years from now. According to a version of the text that appeared in the Financial Times yesterday, the plan does state that “Ukraine's sovereignty would be confirmed.” But it then imposes severe restrictions on Ukrainian sovereignty: Ukraine must “enshrine in its constitution” a promise to never join NATO. Ukraine must shrink the size of its armed forces to 600,000, down from 900,000. Ukraine may not host foreign troops on its soil. Ukraine must hold new elections within 100 days, a demand not made of Russia, a dictatorship that has not held free elections for more than two decades.

In return, the plan states that Ukraine “would receive security guarantees.” But it does not describe what those guarantees would be, and there is no reason to believe that President Donald Trump would ever abide by them. Russia would also “enshrine in law its policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine,” a bizarre and meaningless statement, given that Russia currently has a policy of permanent aggression not only toward Ukraine but also toward Europe and has, anyway, repeatedly violated promises before. The United States would lift sanctions on Russia, losing any existing leverage over President Vladimir Putin; invite Russia to rejoin the G8; and reintegrate Russia into the world economy. Awkward wording, evident throughout the document, suggests that at least some of it was originally written in Russian.

Why is the Trump White House pushing Ukraine to accept a Russian plan that paves the way for another war? The document offers some hints, declaring that the U.S. would also somehow take charge of the $100 billion in frozen Russian assets, for example, supposedly to invest this money in Ukraine and receive “50% of the profits from this venture.” Europeans, whose banks actually hold most of these assets, would receive nothing. European taxpayers, who currently provide almost all of the military and humanitarian support to Ukraine, are nevertheless expected to contribute $100 billion to Ukraine's reconstruction.

Meanwhile, the United States and Russia would “enter into a long-term economic cooperation agreement for mutual development in the areas of energy, natural resources, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, data centers, rare earth metal extraction projects in the Arctic, and other mutually beneficial corporate opportunities,” according to the plan. This is no surprise: Putin has spoken of “several companies” positioning themselves to resume business ties between his country and the United States.

In March, the Financial Times reported on one of these negotiations. Mattias Warnig—a German businessman and former Russian spy who has close links to Putin and is under U.S. sanctions—has been seeking a back channel to the Trump administration through U.S. investors who want to reopen the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline, part of which was blown up by Ukrainian saboteurs early in the war. One American familiar with the plan told the Financial Times that the U.S. investors were essentially being offered “money for nothing,” which is, obviously, an attractive prospect.

Phillips Payson O'Brien: Trump's devastating plan for Ukraine

Other details of the business negotiations carried out by Witkoff and Dmitriev remain secret. Ukrainians and Europeans, who would pay the military and economic price for this plan, deserve to know them. Above all, American citizens should be asking for the details of any business negotiations now under way. This plan has been proposed, in our name, as a part of U.S. foreign policy. But it would not serve our economic or security interests. So whose interests would it serve? Which U.S. companies and which oligarchs would benefit? Are Trump's family members and political supporters among them? The arrangements on offer should be public knowledge before any kind of deal is signed.

For a decade, Russia has been seeking to divide Europe and America, to undermine NATO and weaken the transatlantic alliance. This peace plan, if accepted, will achieve that goal. There is a long tradition of great powers in Europe making deals over the heads of smaller countries, leading to terrible suffering. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, with its secret protocols, brought us World War II. The Yalta agreement gave us the Cold War. The Witkoff-Dmitriev pact, if it holds, will fit right into that tradition.

The fall of El Fasher and Sudan's ongoing conflict, explained by an expert.

President Donald Trump announced that the US would intervene to end the civil war in Sudan. This promise came at the request of the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. The conflict in Sudan — which has been marked by serious human rights abuses by both sides — recently reached a turning point. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took control of the town of El Fasher, effectively splitting the country in half between the paramilitary group and the Sudanese military.

At the heart of this brutal conflict is the relationship between two men: the leader of the Sudanese military, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Muhammad Hamdan Dagano Musa, also known as Hemedti.

To better understand the conflict, Today, Explained host Noel King spoke with Alex DeWaal, the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts. Dewaal has been studying Sudan for over 40 years. He says the two leaders are a product of the cycle of violence that has embroiled the country for decades. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What has been happening in El Fasher?

What has happened in the last couple of years was that the people of Al Fasha, the different groups that were there, initially wanted to stay neutral in this war, but they couldn't sustain that. So, they sided with the so-called government, and they became the last place in Darfur that was resisting the Rapid Support Forces, this very vicious paramilitary. Then, just a few weeks ago, the RSF overran that garrison.

The people of El Fasher had been living in a state of suspended terror for 18 months, because when the RSF overran previous cities — notably a city called El Geneina, close to the border with Chad — it had committed the most horrendous massacres against the people there. What the people of El Fasher had been experiencing was shelling drone attacks, targeted on the hospitals, on the clinics, on everything that made civilian life bearable. Then, when the troops or the paramilitary men came in, they went house to house pulling people out, murdering men in the streets, raping women and girls in front of their families.

Perhaps just as horrific as the crimes themselves is the way the men who are perpetrating them film themselves. They put themselves on video, and you see their relish, the enjoyment with which they torture and torment their victims before killing them. These are videos that are simply too horrible to watch.

So, there are two sides in this war, and there is a general leading each side. Let's start with Sudan's regular army, the SAF. Who is the general leading that force?

General Abdul Burhan is a regular career military officer. And like many of those regular officers, he has a pretty mixed record. Some 20 years ago, he was one of those who served in the vicious war in Darfur. He was then head of a contingent of Sudanese soldiers that served in Yemen, paid for by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. He has his fingers in a number of crony capitalist enterprises that make money.

But, within his coalition, which is a very fractious coalition, he has some people who are utterly ruthless, among them an Islamist brigade. He relies on them, because they have money. They also have some of the best troops, and they are bitter and vengeful. When General Burhan has said he's ready to come to peace talks, it's the Islamists in his coalition who say, “no way.”

What does General Burhan want?

He calls himself the government of Sudan, even though he didn't actually control the capital. The United Nations recognized him, rather foolishly in my view, and he wants to basically restore the status quo, which is certainly better than what we have now.

But it was that status quo against which civilians rebelled against seven years ago.

How has General Burhan conducted himself and his forces during this war?

So, there's no doubt that his forces have committed war crimes. They've tried to cut off international assistance to rebel held areas. They've blocked the UN. Some of it is a lack of discipline, some of it is the vengefulness of local commanders.

The other side of this war is the Rapid Support Force, the RSF. This is a paramilitary group. Who is the general leading them?

His name is [Muhammad] Hamdan Dagalo [Musa]. He's widely known as Hemedti. I first came across him 20 years ago when I read a report from African Union monitors. There were some peacekeepers in Darfur at the time in which a notorious militia called the Janjaweed, which had been rampaging on a genocidal campaign throughout Darfur, they destroyed a village called Adwa in the centre of Darfur — killed 128 people, 38 of them children. When these African Union monitors showed up, this fellow Hemedti was there, and he didn't conceal the fact that they were responsible. In fact, he said, we've been planning this for a long time.

So, he was one of the most ruthless and capable commanders. He's also a very charming man. Many of these killers are; they don't have horns growing out of their heads. He became, over the succeeding years, a very capable commander serving the government, also a businessman. So, he took control of gold mines and became extremely wealthy.

He is a different kind of animal; he's much more sort of a mercenary commercial operator. He doesn't want to rebuild the state as it was. He basically would like to see power in the hands of him and his family, running the country as though it's really a family business with his own private army, his own companies in charge.

How has Hemedti conducted himself and his forces during this war?

Hemedti claims to be standing for democracy, and he claims to be the champion of the poor, and the marginalized, and all those who oppose the Islamists. That doesn't cut much ice. We see how his forces have behaved throughout the war; it is utterly atrocious. Right at the beginning of the war, they ransacked and pillaged the national capitol Khartoum, terrorized so many of its inhabitants, looted, raped their way through whole residential neighborhoods.

Then, in Darfur, they conducted what is candidly a genocidal campaign in this city of El Fasher. That was a longstanding goal of some of the groups that are allied with Hemedti and his forces.

You've been living in and writing about Sudan on and off for 40 years. These men have been shaped by years and years of war. Is the future of Sudan just more and more generations of men who've been shaped by war?

One of my very first hosts when I went to Darfur 40 years ago was an old sheikh from a nomadic Arab tribe, who told me, “We are so poor, we are so impoverished. We've lost our camels. The desert is encroaching. Our way of life is coming to an end.” And he said what this famine means isn't so much that our people are starving, but that our way of life is ending.

Now, his son, same age as me, 20 years later, became head of the Janjaweed, this notorious force. Then, that man, Musa Hilal, the head of the Janjaweed, was himself displaced by his second in command Hemedti, who said, this man is not ruthless enough. So, what we see is over those 40 years, you can trace how the pressures on the traumas of hunger and of conflict have translated into this merciless political culture that we have today.

President Donald Trump wants to send $2,000 tariff checks to Americans next year.

But to do that, he'll have to get Congress to go along with it — and even some of his top allies are skeptical.

""We're facing a deficit this year around $2 trillion,"" Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin told reporters. ""I think whatever revenue we get, from whatever source, ought to go to try and bring down those deficits.""

Trump's proposed tariff checks have received a cool response from most Republicans on Capitol Hill, with many saying they'd prefer to see the national debt addressed first.

That's a big problem for Trump, considering it takes an act of Congress to actually send the checks.

Even those who aren't outright rejecting the proposal — it's always risky to oppose Trump as a Republican — are politely signaling that they'd prefer a different path.

""I mean, everybody's got their own idea,"" Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona told BI. ""I would prefer we reduce the overall tax rate, and make that permanent.""

""You know, my focus would clearly be paying down the $38 trillion of the debt,"" Sen. Rick Scott of Florida told Business Insider. ""But I have to see what he proposes.""

Throughout the first year of his second term, Trump has at times flirted with the idea of sending checks to Americans. It began in February, when Trump said that ""DOGE Dividends,"" checks paid for by purported DOGE savings, were ""under consideration."" The tariff rebate talk picked up in August, when Trump embraced the idea, seemingly in response to a question from a reporter.

""We're thinking about that, actually,"" Trump said at the time.

The president in recent weeks has begun to speak more seriously about the idea, bringing it up multiple times in public remarks and Truth Social posts. On Monday, he said he was eyeing a rollout in mid-2026. And in calling for $2,000 checks, he's gotten more specific than before.

That's all been music to Sen. Josh Hawley's ears, who introduced a bill to send a tariff rebate to lower-income Americans in August.

""This is my pet idea,"" the Missouri Republican told reporters on Wednesday. ""I just think it's a terrific way to give relief to working people.""

And other Republicans have been forced to soften their opposition. In February, when asked about potential DOGE dividends, House Speaker Mike Johnson was relatively firm in saying he preferred to see the national debt reduced.

This month, he's struck a slightly more conciliatory tone.

""Well, I think there's some merit to it,"" Johnson said on Fox Business earlier this month. ""I mean, we'll have to figure that out.""

""The discussion would be: If you have trillions of dollars in new revenue, what's the best use for it?"" Johnson continued. ""Should you pay down the debt? Because that saves families a lot of money in the long run and puts us back on a sound fiscal trajectory.""

Still, plenty of other Republicans are holding firm. In July, when Trump was merely floating the idea, Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio told reporters that the proposal would ""never pass"" given the soaring national debt.

On Wednesday, he reiterated his opposition.

""I think we should pay down the deficit,"" Moreno told Business Insider.

Aside from the politics of it all, there are more basic problems with Trump's proposal.

First, there's the math: Several independent analyses of the proposal have found that there's not nearly enough tariff revenue to fund Trump's plan.

An analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the program could cost $600 billion — about double the $300 billion in projected annual tariff revenue. And that's assuming the Supreme Court doesn't strike down any of Trump's tariffs.

There's also the fact that stimulus checks are likely to be inflationary.

That's a pill that Republicans in particular are unlikely to want to swallow, according to Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the libertarian Cato Institute.

""Republicans have spent five years railing against the Biden administration for cutting people checks and sparking inflation,"" Lincicome told Business Insider. ""Now in power, they're going to start cutting people checks and maybe sparking inflation?""

Still, Lincicome predicted that Republicans might try to find other ways to satisfy Trump's demand, including by simply rebranding tax refunds that Americans are expected to receive as a result of the ""Big Beautiful Bill.""

""There are ways that they could maybe spin this,"" Lincicome said. ""You know, have a big press conference and some really nice poster board, that makes it look like they're actually giving people tariff rebates, when in reality, it's just One Big Beautiful Bill tax cuts.""

Michael Burry is officially a meme.

The investor of ""The Big Short"" fame is lighting up social media after he bet against Nvidia and called out the chipmaker and other AI companies on X, which may have contributed to the stock market's slump on Thursday.

Burry is best known for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s US housing bubble. His massive, contrarian wager was immortalized in the book ""The Big Short"" and a movie adaptation starring Christian Bale as Burry.

Known for his dire warnings of crashes and recessions, Burry goes by ""Cassandra"" on X — a reference to the priestess from Greek mythology who was cursed to speak true prophecies but never to be believed.

He burst back onto X in late October after more than two years of silence, and wasted no time firing off several warnings about a dangerous bubble in AI stocks.

His hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, revealed days later that at the end of September it held bearish put options on Nvidia and Palantir with a combined notional value of $1.1 billion.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp called the bets ""batshit crazy"" in a televised interview, spurring Burry to fire back that the AI company's boss couldn't ""crack a simple 13F.""

In later posts, Burry said that he wasn't short and had exited the Palantir puts in October. He also terminated Scion's SEC registration, closing it to outside cash.

Most recently, he took aim at Nvidia after its third-quarter earnings beat on Wednesday. He questioned the longevity of its chips, its ""give-and-take deals"" with other AI companies, and its stock dilution.

Some market watchers rushed to ridicule his bearish stance on the AI boom after Nvidia shares popped more than 5% following its earnings beat.

Other commenters poked fun at Burry's defiance, and his willingness to go up against technology titans and the dominant market narrative.

Still others have defended Burry, saying he's many things but foolish isn't one of them.

Shares of Nvidia opened higher on Thursday but swung to a 3% decline by the market's close, and fell another 1% on Friday.

Nvidia is the world's most valuable public company with a market capitalization above $4 trillion, so its sudden downswing dragged the entire stock market lower on Thursday.

The S&P 500 gave up a 1.9% gain to close 1.6% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite went from a 2.6% rise to a 2.2% fall, marking the indexes' largest intraday swing since April. Both closed less than 1% higher on Friday.

The reversal led some market watchers to rally behind Burry, celebrating his surprise comeback and suggesting he may have been right to be skeptical.

They also gave him kudos for cashing in on the chaos, even though Burry hasn't said whether he holds Nvidia puts or profited from Thursday's selloff.

Burry also received praise for his Palantir bet, as the AI stock has tanked 25% since November 3, when it reported earnings and Burry disclosed his puts.

By no means was Burry solely responsible for the market slump. Investors also soured on Nvidia after analysts flagged increases in inventories and deferred revenues, raising concerns the company's growth may have been frontloaded and could slow in future quarters. Moreover, delayed economic data showed US unemployment rose to an almost four-year high of 4.4% in September.

Burry is yet to post about the online furor surrounding his crusade against the AI giants. But his followers may hear more from him very soon, as his X bio reads: ""'Unchained' coming maybe sooner than Nov 25th.""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with entrepreneur Dagobert Renouf, 36, who lives in Lille, France, and now works in tech sales at the startup Comp AI. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.

I was an entrepreneur for seven years, bootstrapping businesses. That means not getting any funding. I had some good moments and some struggles. Over the summer, I launched a solo startup, and it wasn't going very well. I was running out of money.

Almost two years ago, I met my now wife. She's Russian and I live in France. We wanted to live together. Because of visa issues, we wanted to accelerate the wedding. I could absolutely not afford any kind of wedding because of the business situation, but at the same time, I didn't want to give up on either dream — of building my startup or on the wedding.

I have a community on social media talking about my journey as an entrepreneur. So I posted something like, ""I have to find a way to pay for my wedding. No idea how I'm going to do it.""

I said the minimum wedding I can do is going to be 4,000 euros. A friend of mine who's a famous entrepreneur in our community said, ""I'm going to loan you the 4,000, but you don't have to pay me back if you can't. I just want to support you."" Then somebody joked, ""If you really need help for your wedding, you just put my logo on your suit."" Because it's an entrepreneur community, everybody wants to promote themselves. That's what we do.

After all these years in business, I'm like, ""You've got to get out of your comfort zone. You try crazy shit if you want to make it."" So I said, ""Let's do it."" I posted on X, and then dozens of people were like, ""Yeah, I want to put my logo on your suit.""

When I told my fiancée, she hated it. All she saw was the reaction on X — people joking, making fun of it. What made her come around, and what was making this whole thing beautiful, was when I really connected it to the fact that it was a way to bring my community to our wedding. She said, ""OK, we can do it, but only if it's nice companies that you love, mostly indie companies — people you know.""

I had to convince people that she loved it. So, it became way harder than I thought to sell it. On average, I sold spots on my suit for 300 euros. I ended up selling about 10,000 euros' worth.

Once I started doing the suit, then I'm like, ""OK, now I want it to look good. I don't want to look like an idiot."" I have a friend who's a stylist — a very talented guy, but very expensive. He was like, ""It's going to be like 5,000 euros, but I can do this.""

We had the final list of logos at the end of August, and the wedding was in October. At first, he wanted to print everything on the suit, but that takes more time because you need prototypes. So we ended up having to do embroidery. The suit is high quality and very beautiful. When you look at it in person, it doesn't look like a joke. Our family and friends loved it.

The fun thing is, out of the 26 entrepreneurs who supported it, I know almost all of them. A lot of them told me something like, ""Just keep the money, but don't put it on your suit. I just want to support you."" It was like a wedding gift between entrepreneurs.

I was like, ""No, I want to do the suit. We love it.""

It's the most basic thing that we hear all the time as entrepreneurs: At first, they think you're crazy, and then it seems obvious. For the first time as an entrepreneur, I had this experience.

I really had to fight for this. It took months of me posting on social media about it. Every time, half of the people were like, ""This is so bad. This is disgusting."" I feel like sometimes I was the only one to see the beauty. That's because, for me, entrepreneurship is my life. There's nothing on the suit I don't like. I can almost see the face of every founder associated with their company.

I wanted to do right by all the people who supported me. They helped me get to where I'm at now. Because I felt like I owed them something, I was actually quite stressed — more stressed than my wife — during the wedding because I was always like, ""I need to make sure these logos are visible.""

I joked with a friend who was beating himself up because he missed putting his logo on the suit, ""Don't worry, you can have dibs on the baby crib."" My wife wasn't on board with that.

One of the people who replied to my posts about the suit was the cofounder of Comp AI. We were only acquaintances, but he kept replying to my posts, saying to put his company's logo on my suit.

At the same time, I realized that I can do sales, and he said, ""Let's get you a sales job."" That was completely unexpected. I was an entrepreneur for years, and I couldn't see any other way of living. Without the suit, I would have never gotten this job.

In 2017, Google was criticized for a bad emoji. This week, CEO Sundar Pichai fixed it. How he did this says a lot about the progress Google has made in generative AI.

The internet giant schooled the rest of the tech industry when it launched its latest model, Gemini 3, on Tuesday. It followed that up by rolling out an upgraded image-generation tool called Nano Banana Pro, which is churning out impressive, realistic pictures, diagrams, and charts.

Google proved that AI scaling laws still work, just as its rivals are being questioned. The stock jumped to a record, making the company worth more than Microsoft.

This is all a long way from 2017. Back then, Google rolled out a cheeseburger emoji for Android smartphones. It had the cheese under the meat. Absolute scandal.

I think we need to have a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top pic.twitter.com/PgXmCkY3Yc

Pichai apologized and said Google would get working on a fix immediately, in a joking kind of way.

Will drop everything else we are doing and address on Monday:) if folks can agree on the correct way to do this! https://t.co/dXRuZnX1Ag

Fast forward to this week with the launch of Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro.

These new AI models are much better at creating and rendering images. Their understanding of 3D space and how the world works, physics-wise, has improved so much that they now absolutely nail the cheeseburger stack.

Pichai tweeted an AI-generated image out to prove the point, writing ""iykyk"" as a nod to the 2017 furor. As you can see, the earth has been set back on its correct axis, and we can all calm down: the cheese is above the meat.

iykyk pic.twitter.com/LCqGm5VSQf

OK, it's time to get serious. Why am I telling you this?

The ability of AI models to innately understand where stuff should go in the world is really important.

""Normally, AI models struggle with spatial orientation, particularly with respect to the relative position of objects,"" Balaji Srinivasan, a tech investor and former Coinbase CTO, wrote on X after Pichai's latest burger post. ""But this image (if rendered by Gemini 3) seems to resolve that issue, as the exact spatial positioning of the cheese is handled correctly and precisely.""

If AI models can know where cheese should go in a burger, they might also know where more important stuff should be in the real world. That could mean better machine decision-making in design, engineering, and other fields.

One theoretical example: A safety barrier likely needs to be placed in the right spot on the corner of a road. Maybe AI models can guide workers to put this structure in exactly the best spot, down to the millimeter.

There's another takeaway from this eight-year cheeseburger saga. Google has been criticized for being behind in generative AI, and this week's releases have finally put those questions to bed.

Powerful products like Gemini 3 take many years, and a lot of technical research and plumbing, to pull off. Google has been working at this for a very long time, and Pichai has been pushing the company toward an AI-first mindset for about a decade. Now the fruits of these labors are showing through.

""Google really did drop everything they were doing to truly focus on AI. And Gemini 3 represents the moment when they actually retook the lead, at least for now,"" Srinivasan wrote. ""When combined with Sundar doubling Google's revenue to $100B, he's proven he can lead Google to unprecedented heights both technologically and commercially.""

""Hence: iykyk. If you know, you know,"" he added.

Zohran Mamdani won a resounding mayoral victory by promising to make it cheaper to live in New York City.

However, his victory earlier this month may have the unintended effect of making it even more expensive for the ultrawealthy to afford their homes in favorite ex-New Yorker haunts like Greenwich, Palm Beach, and the Hamptons, top real estate agents told Business Insider. Real estate agents in these elite zip codes say that the ""Mamdani effect"" is already creeping into prices or causing some to pull the trigger to buy, as locals anticipate another migration wave.

2025 was already a ""banner year"" for Dina Goldentayer, a Miami-based real estate agent who, with more than $3 billion in sales since 2021, is the top earner at real estate firm Douglas Elliman. Even as prices are dropping in Miami at the median-home level, they're growing for ultra-luxury buyers. As of September, the median home price for Miami was down about 4% year-over-year, while it was up 8.4% for luxury homes in Miami, according to Redfin.

""Every year, our price points get higher and higher,"" she said. Referencing million-dollar listings, she added: ""30 is the new 20.""

This dynamic mimics a broader consumer dynamic, with wealthy Americans spending more while the rest cut back.

She has not had any New York to Miami transplant clients say they were moving because of Mamdani, but she said Miamians believe the ""election results will flood the market with New Yorkers.""

""I've had some sellers in Miami say, 'Let's raise my price,'"" Goldentayer said, though she has cautioned them to wait until he actually rolls out policies before raising it.

Socialist Mamdani, who will take office in 2026, has proposed raising taxes on those making more than $1 million a year, and criticized the New York Police Department. His campaign left ultrawealthy New Yorkers concerned he's going to target their wealth and make the city less safe.

While sellers are salivating at steep price jumps, buyers are worried that New Yorkers will drive prices up, Goldentayer said.

""I had one client use the expression 'The Mamdani effect is being baked into the price,'"" Goldentayer said.

Nancy Batchelor, a top Miami real estate agent who heads her own group with Compass, wrote to BI that she's had ""a handful of buyers mention the election,"" but that it's never the ""sole reason.""

""What we're seeing is more subtle; people who were on the fence are now exploring their options with more urgency,"" Bachelor wrote. ""Many are waiting it out to see if anything changes in New York City before making a decision.""

That might mean buying a second home in Miami for now, but not actually moving their family south in the middle of the school year, she said.

And in markets like Palm Beach, which has been a magnet for Manhattanites, what started as a pandemic trend is turning into a ""full lifestyle shift,"" Samantha Curry, a top Palm Beach real estate agent, wrote to BI.

South Florida has attracted a number of billionaires like legendary investor Carl Icahn and Citadel's Ken Griffin, who moved his firm's Chicago headquarters to Miami. Steven Ross, former CEO of Related, which developed the upscale Hudson Yards neighborhood in NYC, spun out the firm's Palm Beach operations to form Related Ross.

Curry has heard from ex-New Yorkers who said the potential tax implications and safety concerns of Mamdani have been a reason for their searches. Right now, it's mostly ""driving conversations,"" especially with the top tier of clients, but actual increases in taxes will really change things.

""If that happens, we expect to see another wave of buyers from the north heading to Palm Beach,"" she wrote.

While Miami and Palm Beach have become destinations for financial types, a more traditional post-Wall Street destination, Greenwich, CT, is actually seeing some post-election sales.

Ultra-luxury Greenwish home sales jumped after Mamdani's June primary victory, with more homes sold in a shorter period, and at higher prices, with an average of $19.7 million per home after the nomination compared to $14.9 million before, according to the mid-November analysis by Mark Pruner, a top Greenwich agent for Compass.

Pruner said the town has seen three large sales go into contract since the election, ranging from $14 million to $28 million. He has had some clients say that Mamdani is a factor behind their move, but that the evidence is ""anecdotal.""

What is certain is that Greenwich is having a record year, he said, saying that it's on track for more than 50 sales over $10 million, compared to a prior high of 19 in 2007.

""A significant portion of it is the concern about the stock market,"" Pruner said. ""We're at record highs, people are sitting at lots of unrealized profits, and there are people who are taking money out of their stock investments and putting it into high-end real estate here in Greenwich.""

If a Mamdani wave continues, home hunters will have slim pickings in Greenwich. Inventory is down 82% from where it was pre-COVID, according to Pruner, pushing prices higher before any Mamdani effect became part of the equation.

So far, the numbers don't match the chatter. Despite all the talk of wealthy fleeing, and that penthouses and brownstones would be going for bargain rates, luxury home sales surged in the city following the election. The week of the election saw 41 contracts signed at $4 million and above, the most in a single week since late May, according to the Olshan Luxury Market Report.

New York's continued strength is a result of ""multi-market living,"" said Miami's Batchelor.

""Many aren't choosing between New York and Miami, they're choosing both,"" she said.

Now that's not to say there won't be some ultrawealthy people selling properties in New York, but many of the ultrawealthy will buy in Florida and change their domicile to shake off the tax man while keeping their pad on Billionaire's Row.

""The nice thing is, if you can afford an over $10 million house, you generally can afford two, or three, or four,"" said Pruner.

President Donald Trump on Saturday reacted to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's surprise resignation announcement, saying, ""Marjorie went BAD.""

Trump once again called the Georgia Republican a ""traitor,"" referencing Greene's alliance with Republican Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, who sponsored the bill demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by the Justice Department.

Greene, who had been a close ally of Trump for years, cited backlash from the president over her advocacy for the bill in her statement, saying that her last day in the House of Representatives will be Jan. 5. 

""Marjorie 'Traitor' Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it 'quits' "" Trump wrote early Saturday in a Truth Social post.

""Her relationship with the WORST Republican Congressman in decades, Tom Massie of Kentucky, also known as Rand Paul Jr. because he votes against the Republican Party (and really good legislation!), did not help her,"" Trump said.

""For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,"" he wrote.

""Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country.""

Trump had opposed the bill ordering the release of the Epstein files until the last minute. This week, the bill passed the House in a nearly unanimous vote and passed the Senate unanimously. The president then signed it into law.

Trump spoke with NBC News later Saturday morning about Greene, saying, ""It's not going to be easy"" for her to have a future in Republican politics.

""I would like to see it,"" Trump told NBC.

""She's got to take a little rest,"" he said.

""I can patch up differences with anyone,"" Trump said when asked if he believes he can reconcile with Greene.

Trump last week said he would support ""the right person"" if they challenged Greene in the Republican primary next year for her seat representing Georgia's 14th District.

In her resignation statement on Friday night, Greene wrote, ""I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family too much, and do not want my sweet  district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while  Republicans will likely lose the midterms.""

""And in turn, be expected to defend the President against impeachment after he hatefully  dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me,""  Greene said.

""I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and  gets better.""

""Standing  up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and  threatened by the President of the United States of America, whom I fought for.""

The possibility of another meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump is on the agenda, a senior Russian diplomat has said.

""I wouldn't rule anything out,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview for the state-owned International Affairs magazine, published on Saturday.

""The search for a way forward continues,"" he said.

Ryabkov said contacts between Russia and the United States had not been suspended, and channels for dialogue continued to function.

Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August, but failed to produce any agreement to resolve or pause Moscow's war in Ukraine. A subsequent plan to meet in Budapest was suspended indefinitely.

""We are working on an ongoing basis. We have well-established formats and channels. Not all of these channels are visible or audible, not all of them need to be discussed publicly, but the fact remains that everything is in working order.""

Ryabkov said the progress in establishing dialogue between Russia and the U.S. was ""impressive.""

Ryabkov also commented on the possibility of a trilateral meeting with China and the United States on nuclear stability, saying that Moscow did not intend to push Beijing towards it.

""We have no questions for China on the subject of arms control and strategic stability,"" Ryabkov said, adding that Russia had not received any formal proposals from the U.S. regarding such a meeting.

Trump has expressed interest in getting China involved in nuclear arms reduction efforts alongside Russia and the U.S.

Last month, he said Putin had raised the prospect of a bilateral nuclear de-escalation, and China could be added to that effort.

A Group of 20 leaders' summit in South Africa adopted a declaration addressing the climate crisis and other global challenges on Saturday after it was drafted without U.S. input in a move a White House official called ""shameful.""

The declaration, using language to which Washington has been opposed, ""can't be renegotiated,"" South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's spokesperson told reporters, reflecting strains between Pretoria and the Trump administration over the event.

""We had the entire year of working towards this adoption and the past week has been quite intense,"" spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said.

Ramaphosa, host of this weekend's gathering of Group of 20 leaders in Johannesburg, had earlier said there was ""overwhelming consensus"" for a summit declaration.

But at the last minute, Argentina, whose far-right President Javier Milei is a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, quit the negotiations right before the envoys were about to adopt the draft text, South African officials said.

""Argentina, although it cannot endorse the declaration ... remains fully committed to the spirit of cooperation that has defined the G20 since its conception,"" its foreign minister Pablo Quirno said at the summit. Ramaphosa noted this, but went ahead with it anyway.

In explanation, Quirno said Argentina was concerned about how the document referred to geopolitical issues.

""Specifically it addresses the longstanding Middle East conflict in a manner that fails to capture its full complexity,"" he said. The document mentions the conflict once, saying members agree to work for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in ... the Occupied Palestinian Territory.""

Envoys from the G20 — which brings together the world's major economies — drew up a draft leaders' declaration on Friday without U.S. involvement, four sources familiar with the matter said.

""It is a longstanding G20 tradition to issue only consensus deliverables, and it is shameful that the South African government is now trying to depart from this standard practice,"" a senior Trump administration official said on Friday.

The declaration used the kind of language long disliked by the U.S. administration: stressing the seriousness of climate change and the need to better adapt to it, praising ambitious targets to boost renewable energy and noting the punishing levels of debt service suffered by poor countries.

The mention of climate change was a snub to Trump, who doubts the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by human activities. U.S. officials had indicated they would oppose any reference to it in the declaration.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In opening remarks to the summit, Ramaphosa said: ""We should not allow anything to diminish the value, the stature and the impact of the first African G20 presidency"".

His bold tone was a striking contrast to his subdued decorum during his visit to the White House in May, in which he endured Trump repeating a false claim that there was a genocide of white farmers in South Africa, brushing aside Ramaphosa's efforts to correct his facts.

Trump said U.S. officials would not attend the summit because of allegations, widely discredited, that the host country's Black majority government persecutes its white minority.

The summit came at a time of heightened tensions between world powers over Russia's war in Ukraine and fraught climate negotiations at the COP30 in Brazil.

""While the G20 diversity sometimes presents challenges, it also underscores the importance of finding common ground,"" Japan Cabinet Public Affairs Secretary Maki Kobayashi told Reuters.

Commenting on Argentina's absence from the final envoy meeting to agree on the text, Magwenya said: ""Argentina (had) been participating quite meaningfully ... in all the deliberations,"" then never showed up to endorse the declaration on Friday. He added: ""We have what we call sufficient consensus.""

The U.S. president had also rejected the host nation's agenda of promoting solidarity and helping developing nations adapt to weather disasters, transition to clean energy and cut their excessive debt costs.

""This G20 is not about the U.S."", South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told public broadcaster SABC. ""We are all equal members of the G20. What it means is that we need to take a decision. Those of us who are here have decided this is where the world must go.""

But in a sign of the many geopolitical fissures underlying the agreed text, EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen warned in a speech about the ""weaponisation of dependencies,"" which she said ""only creates losers.""

This was an apparent veiled reference to China's export curbs on rare earths vital for the world's energy transition, as well as defense and digital technology.

The United States will host the G20 in 2026 and Ramaphosa said he would have to hand over the rotating presidency to an ""empty chair.""

The South African presidency on Saturday reiterated its rejection of a U.S. offer to send the U.S. charge d'affaires for the G20 handover.

""The president will not hand over to a junior embassy official the presidency of the G20. It's a breach of protocol that is not going to be accommodated,"" Magwenya said.

Lamola later said that South Africa would assign a diplomat of the same rank as a charge d'affaires to hand over the G20 presidency at the foreign affairs department.

Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on Friday that she will resign her seat in the House of Representatives in early January, after a dramatic falling out with President Donald Trump over the  Jeffrey Epstein files and other issues.

Greene cited Trump's recent attacks on her — which included calling her a ""traitor"" and a ""lunatic"" — in a video and statement posted on X that said her last day in Congress will be Jan. 5. 

""Loyalty should be a two way street and we should be able to vote our conscience and represent our district's interest because our job title is literally, 'Representative,'"" wrote Greene, who is in the middle of a third term representing Georgia's 14th District.

After her announcement, Trump told an ABC News reporter, ""I think it's great news for the country. It's great.""

Greene, 51, had been a leading supporter of Trump and a prominent figure in the Republican's Make America Great Again, or MAGA, movement, while sparking controversy for promoting conspiracy theories and using extreme rhetoric.

But in recent weeks, Trump has blasted her for backing a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release investigative files about the notorious sex offender Epstein.

Greene also has drawn Trump's ire for criticizing him for prioritizing meeting with foreign leaders at the expense of paying attention to the needs of Americans.

Trump last week said that he was withdrawing his support and endorsement of Greene, who was first elected in 2020, the year he lost a re-election bid to former President Joe Biden. He said that he would fully support ""the right person"" if they challenged her in the Republican primary next year. 

In her statement on Friday night, Greene wrote, ""I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family too much, and do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms.""

""And in turn, be expected to defend the President against impeachment after he hatefully dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me,"" Greene said.

""It's all so absurd and completely unserious,"" she wrote. ""I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.""

Greene wrote that she had ""fought harder than almost any other elected Republican to elect Donald Trump and Republicans to power,"" and that she had left her mother's side as her father had brain surgery to vote against Trump's second impeachment by the House in 2021.

She said that her voting record ""has been solidly with my party and the President,"" with the exceptions of ""a few areas"" such as her stance against H1B visa recipients replacing American jobs, U.S. involvement in foreign wars, ""and demanding the release of the Epstein files.""

""Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States of America, whom I fought for.""

Greene's resignation from her seat could set the stage for her to seek to replace Trump in the White House in the 2028 election, and possibly become the next leader of the MAGA movement once he exits political life.

But Greene's statement conceded that her resignation might end not only her congressional career but also her role in MAGA.

""If I am cast aside by MAGA Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can't even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.""

Greene's resignation will reduce the Republican caucus's already extremely narrow majority in the House.

Currently, there are 219 Republican House members and 213 Democratic members.

But the 14th District is very conservative and is likely to elect a Republican to replace Greene whenever a special election for her seat is called.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that found Texas' 2026 congressional redistricting plan pushed by President Donald Trump likely discriminates on the basis of race.

The order signed by Justice Samuel Alito will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map favorable to Republicans to be used in the midterm elections.

The court's conservative majority has blocked similar lower court rulings because they have come too close to elections.

The order came about an hour after the state called on the high court to intervene to avoid confusion as congressional primary elections approach in March. The justices have blocked past lower-court rulings in congressional redistricting cases, most recently in Alabama and Louisiana, that came several months before elections.

The order was signed by Alito because he is the justice who handles emergency appeals from Texas.

Texas redrew its congressional map in the summer as part of Trump's efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year's elections, touching off a nationwide redistricting battle. The new redistricting map was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats, but a panel of federal judges in El Paso ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the civil rights groups that challenged the map on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters were likely to win their case.

If that ruling eventually holds, Texas could be forced to hold elections next year using the map drawn by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2021 based on the 2020 census.

Texas was the first state to meet Trump's demands in what has become an expanding national battle over redistricting. Republicans drew the state's new map to give the GOP five additional seats, and Missouri and North Carolina followed with new maps adding an additional Republican seat each. To counter those moves, California voters approved a ballot initiative to give Democrats an additional five seats there.

The redrawn maps are facing court challenges in California, Missouri and North Carolina.

The Supreme Court is separately considering a case from Louisiana which could further limit race-based districts under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It's not entirely clear how the current round of redistricting would be affected by the outcome in the Louisiana case.

In this article

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Just one week after Berkshire Hathaway's revelation last Friday that it purchased 17.8 million Class A shares of Google's parent, Alphabet, in the third quarter (July-September), that position has increased in market value by $415 million to almost $5.35 billion.

GOOGL gained 8.4% this week while its biggest tech rivals fell significantly as Nvidia's strong earnings failed to overcome fears of an ""AI bubble.""

Alphabet shares started the week with a 3.1% boost on Monday, apparently in reaction to the news of Berkshire's purchase.

Wednesday's release of Google's new Gemini 3 AI model, which is receiving positive reviews, gave the stock another push higher.

(Google's AI momentum is reportedly beginning to worry Sam Altman at OpenAI.)

While the full evaluation of the move obviously can't be made until months or years from now, someone in Omaha is probably smiling right now.

Warren Buffett is getting the credit in a lot of headlines, as he usually does, with many publications assuming he is responsible for everything Berkshire does.

We know that's not the case, however, since portfolio managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs are able to act as ""free agents.""

As I noted last week, Alphabet doesn't feel like Buffett's ""kind of stock.""

CNBC.com's Yun Li writes the investment ""likely"" was the work of Weschler or Coombs, noting they have been behind many of Berkshire's ""tech-leaning"" investments, including its Amazon stake, now worth $2.2 billion.

(Even before that position was first disclosed in 2019, Buffett went out of his way to tell CNBC's Becky Quick it wasn't his decision and ""no personality change has taken place."")

Bloomberg Opinion columnist Nir Kaissar recalls Buffett's famous refusal to invest in a business he doesn't fully understand, which kept him out of the internet bubble in the late 1990s, calling AI ""orders of magnitude more complicated than selling books or pet food online.""

He adds, ""Combine opaque technology with premium valuations, and you're sure to lose Buffett.""

Kaissar says he has the impression CEO-designate Greg Abel may have just shown us a ""very different approach than Berkshire's shareholders are used to – notably, a new willingness to pay more now for potentially higher growth down the road, a chance Buffett rarely took, if ever.""

Berkshire has not responded to my midday email asking for clarification on who decided to make the Alphabet purchase. The company almost never reveals who bought what.

Some links may require a subscription:

Warren Buffett explains that when he says he doesn't understand tech stocks, he means he doesn't understand where the tech industry will be in ten years.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: In terms of these tech stocks, you say that you don't understand them... I can't imagine you not understanding something.

WARREN BUFFETT: Oh, we understand the product. We understand what it does for people. We just don't know the economics of it 10 years from now.

That, I mean, you can understand all kinds -- you can understand steel. You can understand home building. But if you look at a home builder and try and think where it's going to be in five or 10 years, the economics of it, that's another question.

I mean, it's not a question of understanding the product they turn out or the means they use to distribute it, all of those sort of things. It's the predictability of the economics of the situation 10 years out. And that -- that's our problem.

Oops, something went wrong

European investors will soon be able to take bigger, leveraged bets on Ethereum and Bitcoin via new exchange traded products from Leverage Shares, which will offer 3x leveraged short and long options for both assets on the SIX Swiss stock exchange. 

The offerings will allow investors to add risk amid a volatile time in markets, characterized by Bitcoin and Ethereum's weekly plunges—now down 11.8% and 12.5%, respectively. 

“Leverage Shares is launching the world's first ever 3x and -3x Bitcoin and [Ethereum] ETFs in Europe next week,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posted Friday on X. “Timing is either really good or really bad, depending on your point of view.”

Balchunas expects the products to start trading next week, but a representative for Leverage Shares did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. 

The latest leveraged products join a variety of global offerings that provide amplified, and therefore riskier investment opportunities to investors. Last month, ETF manager Volatility Shares applied to offer up to 5x leveraged ETF products on Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP to United States investors. 

Unlike traditional crypto ETFs, which track the underlying price of an asset like Bitcoin or Ethereum, leveraged ETFs aim to provide boosted returns based on the activity of the tracked asset. 

And they're coming for more than the major crypto assets. 

On Thursday, 21Shares unveiled a 2x leveraged Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF—TXDD—which essentially allows investors to take a long position on the leading meme coin and potentially reap two times the token's daily performance, less fees and expenses. 

The product launches come in the wake of crypto's record-breaking $19 billion liquidation cascade that first propelled the market's recent downturn on October 10. 

Like the rise of leveraged exchange traded products, perps trading and leverage products on-chain have gotten more popular too, potentially creating a risk to the long-term health of the market, some industry experts told Decrypt last month.

Are Perps and Leverage Creating Systemic Risk in Crypto Markets? Experts Weigh In

Industry veterans like Fundstrat CIO and BitMine Immersion Technologies Chairman Tom Lee continue to suggest that the market's recent chaos is still part of a broader recalibration from the events of October 10. Nevertheless, Lee is still calling for an Ethereum supercycle. 

Bitcoin is down nearly 13% in the last week, recently trading at $84,065. Ethereum has fallen harder in the same time frame, dropping 14% over the past seven days and changing hands at $2,731.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) breaking below key support levels has sparked debate over whether fundamentals are to blame — but Fundstrat's Tom Lee argues the real culprit is far more mechanical.

What Happened: In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Lee said crypto has been bleeding ever since a massive Oct. 10 liquidation event crippled major market makers and left liquidity dangerously thin.

Don't Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

According to him, a pricing glitch on one exchange caused a stablecoin to internally wick down to $0.65, which in turn triggered an auto-deleveraging cascade that liquidated nearly two million accounts.

Lee said the so-called ""software bug"" blew a hole in market makers' balance sheets, forcing them to de-risk, pull liquidity, and sell into weakness, creating a reflexive, multi-week slide like the 2022 washout.

With liquidity damaged and leverage unwinding, Bitcoin and Ethereum have effectively become leading indicators for broader risk assets, Lee noted, as large funds continue to sit in cash while markets attempt to stabilize.

What's Next: Lee expects the washout to bottom with Bitcoin near $77,000 and Ethereum around $2,500, arguing that recoveries in past cycles tend to be faster than the declines due to pent-up sidelined demand.

He also pointed to Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) as a key sentiment gauge since institutions often hedge large BTC positions by shorting MSTR due to its highly liquid options market.

Historically, once selling pressure from damaged market makers clears, typically within eight weeks, crypto markets have staged sharp rebounds.

Despite volatility, Lee reiterated Ethereum's long-term thesis remains solid during the last week.

He recently called ETH the ""neutral, 100%-uptime blockchain"" and argued it is still undervalued and quietly gaining relative strength versus Bitcoin this year.

That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

Ethereum ETFs see $55.7M inflows as price tests danger zone, with oversold charts mapping key support near 2,100 dollars.

Ethereum faces a sharp split between strong ETF demand and a spot chart sliding through major support levels. Fresh inflows clash with a deep technical danger zone and oversold signals, setting up a tense next phase for the market.

Ethereum spot ETFs pulled in about 55.7 million dollars in net inflows yesterday, according to the latest Farside Investors data. The green total came even as BlackRock's ETHA fund recorded roughly 53.7 million dollars in outflows on the day.

At the same time, rival issuers such as Fidelity and Bitwise absorbed fresh demand that more than offset BlackRock's selling. Their positive flows turned the complex back into net-buy territory, signaling that investors still added Ethereum exposure overall despite the heavy redemption from the largest player.

Ethereum has slipped into a key danger zone after losing its main daily uptrend line and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, according to analyst DrBullZeus. The break signals a structural shift in the chart, with bears tightening their grip as price trades near the mid-2700 range.

Now attention turns to the first major support band between 2,100 and 2,300 dollars, marked as the initial defense zone on the chart. If ETH stabilizes there, bulls could attempt a recovery toward higher levels, but failure to hold that area would confirm deeper technical damage.

In that bearish scenario, DrBullZeus maps a possible slide toward roughly 1,500 dollars, labeled as the major support and the “0” level on the chart. The analyst notes that momentum currently favors sellers, and the next sessions will show whether Ethereum can defend its support zones or extend the breakdown.

Now, Ethereum is showing one of its sharpest weekly oversold readings in years, according to a new chart from CryptoCaesar. The indicator highlights multiple past moments when ETH hit similar lows on the stochastic oscillator before staging strong recoveries. The latest dip places ETH inside that same historical zone, suggesting momentum has reached exhaustion.

The chart also marks previous cycle bottoms across September 2023, May 2024, September 2024, March 2025, and now November 2025. Each circled oversold point aligns with periods where sellers lost steam and price bounced from major support regions. The current setup mirrors those patterns, with ETH now approaching a broad demand zone beneath the 2,300 level.

At the same time, broader market structure shows ETH pulling back from its recent local peak, leaving a clear downward candle on the weekly timeframe. CryptoCaesar notes that conditions remain technically oversold rather than structurally broken, and the coming weeks will show whether Ethereum can repeat its prior rebound behavior or slide deeper into the lower support block.

Ethereum has extended its downward trend and is now trading inside a critical multi-month demand block. With liquidity being aggressively flushed above and below the price, ETH is approaching a major decision point where either a relief rebound or a deeper capitulation into the lower demand zones may unfold.

By Shayan

ETH has continued its sharp corrective leg, sliding from the $3.5K–$3.6K supply zone and breaking decisively below both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. This breakdown has placed the asset directly inside the $2.7K–$2.85K demand region, which previously acted as the launchpad for the July breakout.

The daily market structure remains firmly bearish, with a clear sequence of lower highs and lower lows. The descending channel, combined with the failed retest of the 200-day MA, suggests that sellers are still in full control.

The current zone around $2.7K is where the price last accumulated before the August rally. A clean loss of this area would expose the next major decision level at $2.45K–$2.55K, where long-term bids previously stepped in. On the other hand, any sustained recovery must begin with a reclaim of $3K and a close back above the 100-day MA to signal a meaningful shift in momentum.



The 4-hour timeframe highlights the precision of the downtrend. The asset continues respecting the descending trendline originating from the $4.2K breakdown, and each retest of this trendline has generated new waves of selling. ETH has now reached the lower boundary of the descending channel while sitting inside the $2.7K demand block.

Short-term liquidity sweeps have been occurring on both sides of the range, indicating increasing volatility and the potential formation of a local bottom. If buyers defend the current channel low, the first upside target becomes the $3.05K–$3.15K imbalance region, followed by a more significant test of the $3.45K supply area. Without a clear breakout above the trendline, however, any rebound is more likely to remain corrective rather than structural.



By Shayan

The two-week liquidation heatmap reveals that ETH is surrounded by dense liquidation clusters above the current price, particularly between $3.1K and $3.6K. These zones reflect the heavy accumulation of short positions and forced exits during the recent drop.

Historically, when price enters a deep liquidity vacuum below major clusters, markets often overshoot to the downside before staging a volatile rebound as liquidity above price becomes the next target.

Currently, clear liquidity voids sit above $3.2K, matching the major daily fair value gap. These areas tend to act as magnets during rapid corrections. With liquidity compressed below and large unfilled pockets above, ETH is approaching a pivotal zone. A temporary capitulation into the lower demand region cannot be ruled out, but this same motion has historically preceded strong recovery phases once exhausted sellers are cleared.

As the market bleeds red and most altcoins lose crucial levels, some have suggested that investors must reshape their expectations of the crypto market this cycle and the long-awaited “alt season.”

Old Crypto Cycle Is Gone – Analyst

Over the past month, the crypto market has wiped out over $1 trillion in market capitalization due to a series of large-scale liquidations and strong selling pressure since the October 10 pullback, which has sunk investors' sentiment to its lowest levels in months.

Amid this performance, the early Q4 rally buzz has faded, and most altcoins have lost the ground gained during the Q3 market breakout. Market observers have shared their outlook on how the crypto market has changed and what to expect in the future.

In October, Nic Carter, crypto investor and partner at Castle Island Ventures, weighed in on the shift in retail sentiment regarding most altcoins. As reported by NewsBTC, he affirmed that the bearish sentiment means the space has matured significantly.

Carter explained that crypto is “boring” now because most of the uncertainties that drove much of the historical volatility have been resolved, adding that the industry has also largely derisked as a technological substrate.

The investor considers that “crypto natives no longer control the narrative, there's more serious businesses (which don't require tokens), there's less chaos, the whole space has matured significantly.”

In a Friday thread on X, the Altcoin Sherpa also discussed the market changes, affirming that the “old cycles” have been “dead” for a while. As he explained, the previous cycles consisted of an euphoric phase, a corrective phase, and an accumulation phase before the start of a recovery phase.

He highlighted the performance of Altcoins like Solana (SOL) between 2020 and 2024, noting that “this market environment is gone.” Instead, the analyst believes that the market is in a “hyper-accelerated regime.”

Altcoins In A ‘Hyper-Accelerated Regime'

Under this new regime, the market experiences short-term uptrends followed by mid-term downtrends, similar to the price action of altcoins like BONK since late 2023, Altcoin Sherpa added:

We have 1-3 months of pump followed by 2-6 months of downtrend and rinse repeat. There is no more euphoria where things go berserk for an entire year. Just 1-3 months and then down. Look how many cycles BONK had in a year or 2.

The analyst suggested that investors should not expect 2021 conditions for most altcoins or a traditional “Alt Season,” where most tokens experience massive gains at once. He advised to capitalize when the “good times” arrive and be aware that “price can still die in 3 months.”

“Reframe your brain in how you think about alt pumps and ‘alt season'. Coins will still downtrend, just not in a slow bleed. More [of] an accelerated destruction + carnage, Altcoin Sherpa detailed.

He also noted that, unlike previous cycles, altcoins will also recover “a bit quicker than before,” and won't take over a year to bottom and accumulate before a new leg up begins again.

However, Sherpa affirmed that the lack of an accumulation phase will mean that “the overall coins will NOT have as strong of pumps like they used to,” as that period is what makes the rallies strong. “We aren't seeing anything close to that anymore,” he concluded.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","How Will Federal Reserve Rate Cuts Influence Bitcoin and Altcoins?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/federal-reserve-rate-cuts-bitcoin-altcoin-markets","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 11:02:02 GMT","

The Federal Reserve's expected rate cuts are stirring the cryptocurrency market significantly. When the Fed reduces interest rates, it generally enhances market liquidity, making riskier investments, including cryptocurrencies, more attractive. Lower rates lessen borrowing costs, prompting investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets rather than in conventional savings or bonds.

With the Fed signaling a dovish approach, the probability of a rate cut has risen sharply, with recent data revealing an increase from 39.10% to 69.40% for a cut in December. This alteration in expectations can lead to heightened buying activity in the crypto market as investors prepare for possible gains. Traditionally, rate cuts have coincided with bull runs in the crypto sector, suggesting Bitcoin and altcoins may see increased interest and price rises.

Bitcoin's trajectory is often seen as a precursor to the rest of the cryptocurrency market. A recent 10% drop in Bitcoin can lead to cascading effects on altcoins. However, this decline can also open doors for altcoins to emerge.

If Bitcoin's market dominance decreases, altcoins may claim a larger segment, prompting potential rallies. Historically, during Bitcoin's downturns, altcoins have sometimes outperformed due to investors diversifying their portfolios. Current market sentiment indicates that if Bitcoin keeps declining, altcoins could benefit greatly, drawing trader interest toward alternatives.

Investors looking to manage Bitcoin's volatility while leveraging altcoin opportunities have various strategies at their disposal:

Diversification: A broad spread of investments across numerous cryptocurrencies, including altcoins and stablecoins, can mitigate risk. This strategy lessens exposure to Bitcoin's price fluctuations.

Timely Conversion: Converting Bitcoin payments to fiat or stablecoins swiftly protects cash flow from price volatility. Using stablecoins for operational transactions can stabilize exchange rates, ensuring consistent costs.

Hedging: Using derivatives such as options or futures can hedge against adverse price movements in Bitcoin. Smart contracts with stop-loss orders can also ensure automated risk management.

Operational Optimization: Integrating cryptocurrencies into payment systems can lower transaction fees and speed up settlements. Multi-currency digital wallets streamline cash flow management.

Data-Driven Tools: Employing AI and data analytics to track market trends can guide investment decisions. Analyzing on-chain data may offer insights into market behaviors.

The current scenario suggests that altcoins may be primed for a rally, albeit cautiously. Recent data showcases that altcoins have recorded positive returns and increased trading volumes, occasionally outpacing Bitcoin. This trend is partly fueled by stablecoin adoption and growing institutional investor interest.

Nevertheless, altcoins' performance remains closely linked to Bitcoin's price dynamics. Analysts suggest a decline in Bitcoin's dominance could herald an ""altcoin season"", where investors shift focus towards alternative cryptocurrencies. However, this anticipated rally is expected to be selective, favoring established altcoins with solid fundamentals rather than an all-encompassing surge.

Several critical indicators and events could shape market dynamics in the coming weeks:

Federal Reserve Announcements: Investors must keep a close watch on the Fed's interest rate decisions, which will greatly influence market sentiment and liquidity.

Bitcoin's Price Movement: Bitcoin's performance remains central to the broader market. If its downward trend continues, altcoins could rally, whereas recovery in Bitcoin's price might redirect attention to it.

Market Mood: Investor sentiment and market trends can shift rapidly based on economic indicators and regulatory developments, so remain vigilant.

Institutional Involvement: Heightened interest from institutional investors could bolster altcoin markets, especially if cryptocurrencies are perceived as inflation hedges.

Regulatory Changes: Market dynamics can be influenced by alterations in regulations, necessitating continuous awareness of the evolving regulatory landscape.

In summary, the interaction between Federal Reserve rate cuts, Bitcoin's trajectory, and altcoin potential creates a multifaceted yet potentially lucrative environment for investors. By employing strategic measures and staying informed, investors can navigate the volatility while seizing opportunities in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

The crypto market is buzzing again, and this time the spotlight isn't just on the giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A new presale crypto named Tapzi (TAPZI) is creating serious noise, pulling in early investors who believe it could be one of the best altcoins to buy now before next crypto bull run hits. With fresh energy returning to the market, several high-growth altcoins to invest in are positioning themselves for strong growth, some through innovation, some through community strength, and others through sheer utility.

Among the top cryptos heating up the charts are Tapzi, Litecoin, MoonBull, Binance Coin, and Ethereum. Each one stands out for a different reason, and together they form a powerful mix of stability, innovation, and early-stage opportunity. The following exploration dives deep into why these tokens are catching investors' attention right now.

Every bull cycle begins with one token that lights the match. This time, the next crypto to explode might just be Tapzi (TAPZI), a top crypto presale that blends gaming excitement with crypto earnings. Tapzi has captured investor imagination through its mission: turning gamers into early winners by merging skill-based gaming rewards with a cleverly designed economy. The platform offers a refreshing twist: players actually earn real value for their time, making it feel closer to a financial system disguised inside a game.



The TAPZI token is powering up quickly, with early traction building fast. What makes Tapzi even more appealing is its feel-good mixture of simplicity and ambition. The project talks openly about creating a fair, engaging space for players, and early supporters love that the mechanics are transparent. Its presale growth patterns remind many investors of early-stage gaming tokens that later delivered massive returns.

With rising interest from GameFi investors and general crypto traders alike, Tapzi is becoming one of the best altcoins to buy now for those aiming for high growth potential. If the momentum continues, the 100x narrative may not sound far-fetched at all.

While newer tokens are capturing wild excitement, Litecoin (LTC) plays the opposite role: steady, dependable, and quietly rising. Often called “digital silver,” Litecoin is one of the oldest high-growth altcoins in existence and has proven its staying power through every market cycle. It's fast, lightweight, and extremely reliable, which is exactly why traders start circling back to it when the market begins heating up.

There's a growing belief that Litecoin is undervalued relative to its fundamentals. Its network speed remains superior to many newer blockchains, and the LTC halving cycle still plays a major role in long-term price movements. Historically, Litecoin tends to make sharp climbs once the market strengthens, and that's what investors are watching for now.

Even though it's not the flashiest token on the list, Litecoin's long-term consistency is what makes many call it one of the best altcoins to buy now, especially for people who want exposure to proven crypto assets without the chaos of experimental projects.

Every crypto wave has its trend, and in this cycle, the emerging star is MoonBull (MOBU). It is a meme-utility hybrid token that blends viral branding with actual use cases. MoonBull brings together fun, light-hearted aesthetics with strong token mechanics, giving it an edge over typical meme coins that rely solely on hype.

Its growing community is one of its biggest strengths. Crypto analysts often say that community equals currency, and MoonBull is living proof. The token's presence on social media has exploded recently, with daily mentions and community events turning it into a trending topic among younger traders. While the project is still early, its energy and engagement levels mirror early-stage meme tokens that later went on to achieve massive market caps.

MoonBull also plans to introduce staking and in-app utility, bridging the gap between entertainment and earnings. This ability to merge meme coin virality with real value puts MoonBull in the conversation as one of the best altcoins to buy now, especially for investors who enjoy high-risk, high-reward opportunities backed by strong community momentum.



If reliability had a mascot, it would be Binance Coin (BNB). Unlike many altcoins, BNB is deeply woven into the fabric of the world's largest crypto exchange: Binance. Every time users trade, stake, participate in launchpads, or explore new products in the ecosystem, BNB is right at the center of it.

BNB's long-term strength comes from simple math: the Binance ecosystem keeps expanding, and with every new service, BNB gains more utility. From transaction fee discounts to liquidity pools to DeFi integrations, BNB has continuously evolved far beyond its original purpose. That adaptability is one reason it has remained one of the top-performing altcoins for years.

Investors who want a blend of stability and growth often place BNB near the top of their list of the best altcoins to buy now. It's mainstream, deeply integrated, and has one of the strongest real use cases in the entire crypto industry. As regulatory clarity improves globally and crypto adoption widens, BNB is likely to benefit from that larger shift.

Many analysts believe that BNB's next breakout could come once trading volumes increase during the next bull run, giving existing holders a push toward higher valuations.

No discussion about the best altcoins to buy now is complete without Ethereum (ETH); the backbone of decentralized apps, smart contracts, and thousands of innovative projects. Ethereum isn't just an altcoin; it's the foundation of Web3 itself. Whenever developers build, innovate, or experiment with blockchain technology, Ethereum sits right at the center of it.

Its transition to Proof-of-Stake has made the network more efficient, environmentally friendly, and attractive for institutional investors who prefer sustainable systems. ETH staking has also created a new wave of passive income seekers, locking large amounts of supply and strengthening long-term price floors.

Ethereum's roadmap includes upgrades that promise greater scalability, lower costs, and better user experiences. Each upgrade has historically triggered market excitement and significant price appreciation. ETH is also the gateway token for the booming sectors of NFTs, DeFi, and tokenized real-world assets—all major narratives expected to accelerate in the coming years.

This makes Ethereum not just a safe pick, but an essential part of nearly every serious investor's portfolio. It blends innovation, longevity, and unmatched utility, making it one of the best altcoins to invest in for long-term holding and also for accumulation during market uptrends.



The crypto market gives more profit when the investor's portfolio is diversified. Some investors look for the next crypto to explode 100x, while a few prefer to invest in established tokens. Some would enjoy the thrill of new crypto coins and social media hype. Some may be gaming enthusiasts, and others might be fascinated by finance and blockchain utility. The beauty of the current market cycle is that it offers all of these options at once, with the best altcoins to buy now.

Together, these top cryptos to buy now represent a powerful mix of innovation, reliability, and future potential. As the digital landscape evolves and makes way for the next big opportunity, these tokens are among the best altcoins to invest in now. The projects offer different opportunities to suit different interests.

                            Global banks have completed the migration to ISO 20022. Credit: Expect Best via Pexels.                        

For nearly half a century, the SWIFT MT (Message Type) format has been the backbone of international financial communication.

However, with the migration to an updated format based on the ISO 20022 standard now complete, on Saturday, Nov. 22, the older MT system was officially retired .

With global banks and payment networks now unified around ISO 20022, the stage is set for the widespread integration of blockchains into mainstream finance.

When SWIFT went live in 1977, it revolutionized cross-border payments by giving banks a globally standardized way to talk to each other.

At the heart of the system, the MT format enforced a rigid, fixed-field structure for all financial messages.

Simple, alphanumeric codes conveyed transaction information, freeing bank workers from the cumbersome, back-and-forth communications that characterized the previous era.

Moreover, as a universal language, the MT format transcended differences between national banking systems, enabling unprecedented interoperability.

This standardization was instrumental in SWIFT's rapid growth, allowing it to connect thousands of financial institutions around the world and facilitate the explosion of global trade and finance in the late twentieth century.

However, the very design that made the MT format successful in its era became its most significant limitation in the digital age.

Highly structured, character-limited fields were designed for efficiency over low-bandwidth connections, not for rich data exchange.

As transaction complexity increased and financial regulations required banks to record more information, the MT format struggled to keep up.

By the early 2000s, fragmented supplementary messaging systems threatened to undermine SWIFT's mission of global interoperability. 

To address the challenge, the International Organization for Standardization introduced ISO 20022 in 2004.

Unlike the rigid MT format, ISO 20022 is designed to be more flexible, allowing for the creation of new fields and message types.

For instance, national bank networks can define their own parameters according to domestic requirements.

Crucially, because the new format utilizes XML, messages are both human- and machine-readable, making it ideal for blockchain integration.

Platforms like Ripple, Stellar, and Hedera were explicitly designed with ISO 20022 in mind, making it easier to map financial messages onto smart contract calls or on-chain token transfers.

Post-migration, the blockchain developers and central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects building tomorrow's payment rails look to ISO 20022 as the canonical data model enabling interoperability.

Instead of each platform inventing its own fields, the standard provides a shared vocabulary that makes translation possible.

As banks sunset the MT format, they aren't just swapping the old standard for a new one.

They're also experimenting with new blockchain-based rails that use ISO 20022 to bridge financial ecosystems.

Perhaps the most significant development is the move toward tokenized deposits.

From JPMorgan to UBS, financial institutions worldwide are bringing commercial bank money on-chain at a rapidly accelerating pace.

According to Citi's latest projection, tokenized deposits could support up to $140 trillion in annual transaction volume by 2030, surpassing stablecoins as the most popular medium of on-chain currency exchange.

For its part, SWIFT is looking to secure its role in the emerging financial order by integrating new forms of money and tokenized assets into its existing framework.

Other players using blockchain technology to upgrade the global banking system include Ripple, Partior, Fnality, and various multi-CBDC architectures being explored by central banks.

In each case, ISO 20022 functions as a neutral, richly structured description of a payment or securities transaction.

This allows banks to keep their core payment engines and compliance tools consistent, even as settlement hops between different rails.

Whether firms move tokenized deposits, stablecoins, CBDCs, or old-school fiat via SWIFT, a blockchain network, or some alternative platform, ISO 20022 helps ease data conversion and minimize friction.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Whether other networks will follow remains an open question.

A blockchain platform completed a radical shift in September 2022 that dropped its electricity usage to nearly zero, Outlook India reported. 

Ethereum's upgrade, named The Merge, ditched its energy-hungry mining system for a leaner verification process. The network previously burned through 23 million megawatt-hours each year. After the transition, yearly consumption fell to 2,600 megawatt-hours, shrinking from a small country's draw to what a handful of office towers might use. 

Before The Merge, Ethereum relied on mining. Thousands of machines worldwide competed to crack mathematical equations, with only one winner receiving payment while the rest wasted electricity on failed attempts. This Proof-of-Work system still runs Bitcoin. 

Ethereum switched to Proof-of-Stake, where users deposit their coins to validate transactions rather than running power-hungry equipment. Standard computers can now join the validation process, eliminating the need for costly mining hardware. 

Carbon output dropped from 11 million tons yearly to 870 tons. Individual transactions now generate less than one-hundredth of a kilogram of CO2, compared to over a hundred kilograms previously.

Cryptocurrency's climate connection is messy. Bitcoin and other mining-dependent networks consume a ton of electricity, drawn from fossil fuel facilities in many cases. This has turned crypto into a lightning rod for climate criticism. 

The era of compromises is over. With T-Mobile, getting a brand-new phone is finally simple — and it only takes 15 minutes per line to switch over.  

With Easy Switch, you'll get customized insights and recommendations about what plan is right for you. Plus, once you make the switch, your new phone is eligible for same-day delivery.

But the field backs clean energy growth. Many crypto mining facilities now operate using renewable sources such as sun, wind, and hydropower. Some miners help fund green energy projects by buying electricity that grids cannot use.

Ethereum's shift shows the sector can shrink its carbon footprint when motivated. Whether competing blockchain networks will make similar moves or cling to electricity-intensive designs remains an open question.

The transition expanded who can help secure the network outside of people who are wealthy enough to buy mining gear. App developers working on Ethereum can now call their products climate-friendly, a claim that wasn't available before.

Solo mining in crypto is a gamble with potentially life-altering payouts, yet the rarity of such wins holds essential lessons for crypto-friendly SMEs. This article delves into the financial aspects of solo mining and offers strategic insights for businesses operating within the crypto space. Learn how to navigate risk and reward optimally while refining your operational strategies in this ever-changing environment.

Think of solo mining as a lottery, but with very low odds. The Bitcoin network's hashrate is staggeringly high, making it tough for solo miners to hit those block rewards. To put it in perspective, a miner boasting a hashrate of 1 PH/s has only a 1 in 650,000 chance of mining a block every 10 minutes. This extreme rarity serves as a wake-up call for crypto-friendly SMEs to consider a more diversified approach to their mining strategies.

Solo mining doesn't just come with risks; it also carries unpredictable financial consequences. Yes, a successful solo miner can rattle off some hefty rewards—like the recent $371,000 payout from block 910,440—but let's be real: most miners will endure long stretches without a dime. This volatility can be a financial nightmare, especially for small businesses that depend on steady cash flow. The unpredictability of solo mining income highlights the pressing need for risk management and the exploration of other revenue channels.

Given the high stakes of solo mining, crypto-friendly SMEs would be wise to prioritize operational efficacy and diversify their risks. Here's what to think about:

Diversify Mining Efforts: Rather than putting all eggs in the Bitcoin basket, SMEs might want to consider other cryptocurrencies with lower difficulty. This could improve returns while lowering overall exposure to risk.

Utilize Pool Mining: Joining mining pools can lead to steadier payouts, providing SMEs with the benefits of shared hashing power while dodging the solo mining pitfall.

Explore Blockchain Payroll Solutions: With the gig economy on the rise, integrating blockchain payroll solutions can streamline payments for freelancers and contractors. This enhances operational efficiency and aligns with the decentralized spirit of cryptocurrency.

Invest in Energy-Efficient Hardware: To maximize profits, SMEs should consider investing in modern, energy-efficient ASIC miners. This move can help lower operational costs and boost overall mining output.

The recent success in solo mining has ignited conversations within the crypto community. Industry leaders are quick to point out the randomness and unpredictability of the endeavor. Con Kolivas, a key player in Solo CKPool, mentioned that a miner of a similar size would statistically solve a block every seven years at the current network difficulty. This serves as a reminder for SMEs to engage with the community and to stay updated on the latest technical advancements and strategies in the mining arena.

The rarity of solo mining victories serves as an important lesson for crypto-friendly SMEs. Emphasizing operational efficiency, risk management, and diversified strategies is essential. By considering alternative blockchain applications and leveraging community insights, businesses can maneuver through the intricate landscape of crypto more adeptly. As the industry continues to evolve, adaptability and awareness will be critical for success.

Interest in Maradona memorabilia has soared to unprecedented heights, with NFT sales featuring the legendary footballer experiencing a remarkable 1,000% increase. This explosion underscores a broader trend within digital collectibles and marks a significant moment in the NFT market's expansion. As digital artifacts continue to gain popularity, investors and fans alike are capitalizing on this surge to invest in sports history.

The dramatic increase in Maradona NFT sales primarily reflects growing global interest in digital collectibles. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, offer a unique ownership certification for digital assets, making them especially appealing for rare and iconic items. With notable sales spikes, such as a recent transaction exceeding CHF 75,000, collectors seek to capture a piece of Maradona's legacy. 

In a recent social media post, market analyst Ollie Vargas noted how such trends echo broader NFT market dynamics. Visit https://x.com/OllieVargas79/status/1991720498217275864 for more insights.

Legally, NFTs operate in a complex environment. In Switzerland, the regulatory framework around NFTs remains fluid, with ongoing debates about classification. Under current Swiss law, NFTs are often considered assets, but clarity around taxation and intellectual property rights is still evolving. This ongoing regulatory development ensures that traders must stay informed to manage potential risks. 

This regulatory uncertainty, however, hasn't dampened enthusiasm, as investors continue to embrace NFTs as a modern investment avenue.

The Maradona NFT boom is not an isolated phenomenon. The NFT market overall has witnessed rapid growth, with estimates showing a global transaction volume reaching CHF 1.2 billion. This growth is fueled by celebrity involvement, increased digital engagement, and the broader crypto investment trend. These dynamics point to a significant shift, marking NFTs as a prevalent component of modern digital economies. This growth aligns with the burgeoning digital collectibles market, where art, music, and now sports memorabilia are fetching high prices.

Investing in NFTs like Maradona's collectibles presents both opportunities and challenges. For investors, NFTs offer a chance to diversify portfolios beyond traditional assets. Their value, however, can be volatile, influenced by market trends and cultural relevance. Additionally, potential regulatory changes could impact NFT trading conditions. Thus, investors need to conduct thorough research and remain vigilant about market updates, especially as interest in high-profile NFTs grows. 

Leading investors are already capitalizing on this potential, anticipating long-term profitability.

The Maradona NFT boom exemplifies how digital collectibles are rapidly becoming a major asset class. As interest in digital assets skyrockets, particularly NFTs featuring iconic figures like Maradona, the market presents enticing opportunities for both collectors and investors. However, as regulatory landscapes continue to evolve, participants must stay informed about legal developments to harness these opportunities responsibly. The convergence of sports memorabilia and digital innovation highlights a transformative trend shaping the future of digital investments.

The surge is driven by heightened global interest in owning digital memorabilia of iconic figures like Maradona. NFTs offer certified ownership of digital assets, making them attractive for collectors.

In Switzerland, NFTs are often considered assets. The regulatory environment is evolving, with ongoing discussions about their classification, taxation, and intellectual property implications.

NFT investments are volatile, subject to market trends and regulatory shifts. Investors should perform due diligence and keep abreast of industry updates to navigate risks effectively.

In a high-velocity ecosystem, accurate analytics are the backbone of decision-making. Be it analyzing emerging artists, evaluating blue-chip collections, or finding suspicious activities around wash trading, data from the NFT marketplace forms the backbone of meaningful insights.

This article breaks down the relevance, uses, and importance of NFT marketplace data in today's digital economy and points out that data-driven decisions are most likely to increase the chances of better crypto gains.

Every big NFT marketplace, such as OpenSea, Blur, Magic Eden, and LooksRare, generates a huge quantity of live data. Every single sale, bid, wallet movement, and listing leaves a footprint that could be tracked and interpreted.

Marketplace data matters: it reveals the

Market health and liquidity patterns

True demand for collections

Price trends and volatility

Events leading to sharp increases or decreases

Whale & retail user buying behaviour

It has always been important to separate the signal from noise with data, especially because traders always chase crypto gains. A collection that might be trending on social media will count for nothing if there is not enough real buying volume to give it weight. The opposite may be a quiet collection showing strong accumulation coming from smart money wallets.

Understanding the types of data available helps to decode the NFT market even more completely. Let's take a closer look at a few of the most impactful:

Sales Volume and Floor Price Movement

The sales volume shows how actively the collection is traded, while the floor price gives the minimum cost of entry. Sudden jumps generally indicate either hype or strong fundamental interest.

Wallet Analysis and Whale Tracking

NFT markets are generally whale-driven. Their buying or selling behavior might be followed in order to predict major moves and with it try to optimize crypto profits.

Listing and Delisting Patterns

Fear or uncertainty is normally marked by a sudden listing of a large number of NFTs. Delistings are therefore indicative of belief in long-term value.

Rarity impacts the pricing of NFTs.

Data tools help to define exactly how much the rarity contributes to the final sale value.

Transaction History and Price Spikes

The volatility of prices is monitored for manipulation or actual growth.

Data turns speculation into strategy. Here's how:

Many NFT collections burn brightly only to fade. Investor insight, powered by marketplace data, can reveal:

Collections with regular trading activity

Developers who keep releasing updates.

Put these factors together, and the prospects for long-term stability—and therefore crypto gains—significantly improve.

Repeated sales to the same wallet

Sudden, unnatural jumps in trading volume

Very low liquidity despite high social media activity

These may point to wash trading or artificial inflation.

Minting patterns

Buyer retention metrics

Traders can get in early and stand to benefit more from any gains in rising crypto markets.

Launch of major projects

Utility Upgrade Announcement

Whale movements Marketplace comparisons Price predictions These tools make complex blockchain data simple to digest and help users-from beginner to professional-make smarter, more profitable decisions.

Marketplace data matters more than ever, considering the rise of institutional interest, standardized regulations, and professional market players within the NFT ecosystem. Here's how that may shape future opportunities for crypto gains. Valuations better informed by more transparent historical data Improved risk assessment as fraud detection tools evolve Improved liquidity as more marketplaces integrate cross-chain trading.

Higher credibility due to regulated analytics-driven systems. Going forward, the NFT ecosystem will be more in tune with a data-first digital economy where every insight matters. Quick Highlights NFT marketplace data provides actionable insights for market health assessment.

Traders analyze data to estimate collections, follow whales, and identify scams. The chances of maximizing crypto gains improve with the ability to access accurate analytics. Data-driven decisions are superior to investing based upon emotions or hype. The future of NFTs will require standardized and transparent data systems.

NFT marketplace data involves all the metrics and analytics gathered from virtual marketplaces where people sell and buy NFTs. This includes sales volume, floor price trends, activity of the wallets, listing information, and more.

The data allows traders to make more informed decisions in terms of watching market fluctuations, considering demand, and avoiding scams. Moreover, data increases the possibilities of better gains in crypto.

Popular choices include Nansen, CryptoSlam, DappRadar, NFTScan, and Blur Analytics.

Though no data can predict prices with certainty for the future, it does reveal patterns, helps block guesswork, and provides a much clearer overview of how the market behaves.

One may identify wash trading, pump-and-dump schemes, and other fraud by monitoring wallet behavior, the frequency of transactions, and jumps in unnatural, user-set prices.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Regretted Missing Tensor's ICO? LivLive's 300% Bonus Makes It the Best Crypto Presale to Buy Right Now","https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/regretted-missing-tensors-ico-livlives-300-bonus-makes-it-the-best-crypto-presale-to-buy-right-now/","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 09:58:41 GMT","

Every cycle has a moment where one project quietly slips through the cracks, only to explode later while most investors watch from the sidelines. Tensor ($TNSR) was one of those stories. Before becoming the backbone of Solana's NFT trading infrastructure, it lived in relative obscurity, a perfect setup for early movers who saw utility before the crowd did.

Today, the market is offering another rare early-access window. LivLive ($LIVE) is gaining strong traction as an AR-powered ecosystem that transforms real-world actions into on-chain rewards. With over $2.13M raised and a limited 300% Black Friday bonus, LivLive is rapidly climbing watchlists as the best crypto presale to buy before the next stage triggers higher pricing.

Crypto presales rarely unlock bonuses that truly shift investor positioning, but LivLive‘s BLACK300 offer has become the biggest catalyst of Q4. The promo triples every token purchase, giving early buyers a massive allocation advantage while the price is still at its starting level. A multiplier like this is the type of early-window opportunity that often defines the biggest winners of a cycle.

With $LIVE beginning at $0.02, the token is scheduled to climb through ten increasing presale stages toward a projected $0.25 listing value. Over 300 participants have already locked in allocations, and the BLACK300 bonus has accelerated demand far faster than the project's internal projections, adding urgency to those looking to enter before the next markup.

LivLive introduces a fresh approach to crypto utility by turning everyday physical activity into verifiable digital value. Through AR wearables and location authentication, the platform rewards users for attending events, completing missions, exploring venues, and engaging with gamified real-world environments.

For users, this creates an entirely new earning layer woven into daily life. For brands, it finally provides measurable human presence through on-chain verification, eliminating bots, fake check-ins, and inflated metrics. This dual benefit gives LivLive a real-world use case that positions it well beyond typical speculation-driven presales.

The BLACK300 window dramatically reshapes the math behind a $2,500 investment. At the current $0.02 presale rate, a standard purchase would secure 125,000 $LIVE tokens. However, BLACK300 adds a 300% token bonus, unlocking an additional 375,000 tokens, bringing the total to:

500,000 $LIVE tokens from a $2,500 buy.

If LivLive reaches its projected $0.25 launch value, that allocation translates into $125,000 in potential value, a position built not through large capital but through timing. This kind of asymmetry explains why early-stage bonuses often produce the strongest upside in presales.

Tensor began as a niche trading interface for experienced NFT players. Its execution speed, liquidity aggregation, and advanced market tools quietly positioned it as a superior alternative to slower, less efficient platforms on Solana. Early adopters noticed, long before social media picked up on its potential.

When the broader NFT market surged, Tensor was perfectly positioned to take advantage. Its user-friendly tools and high-performance backend turned it into the preferred marketplace for professional traders. Tensor's climb is a reminder of how utility-rich projects can skyrocket once real demand arrives, rewarding those who recognized them early.

LivLive isn't just another token chasing hype; it's a platform designed around real-world engagement, verifiable activity, and meaningful rewards that blend digital and physical experiences. Its AR-powered mission system and on-chain verification model place it in a category of high-utility projects with long-term growth potential.

What's pushing urgency now is the BLACK300 300% bonus, a rare presale advantage that triples early token allocations before the price increases. Once this tier sells out, the multiplier disappears permanently. For investors who missed major early-stage opportunities like Tensor's rise, LivLive represents a fresh chance to secure meaningful upside before broader attention arrives.

Claim your BLACK300 bonus now and lock in your $LIVE allocation before the multiplier window closes.

Key Takeaways

After years of cautious testing with its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital rupee, India is now preparing to roll out ARC, which is short for Asset Reserve Certificate.

ARC is a regulated, rupee-backed stablecoin  created by the private sector, which signals India's most serious push yet toward a two-layer digital money system, one that keeps the Reserve Bank firmly in control of settlement while allowing private firms to build faster, smarter, more flexible payment rails on top of it.

Here's everything you need to know about ARC.

ARC is structured as a fully collateralized, INR-pegged digital asset, backed by cash equivalents such as Government Securities (G-Secs), Treasury Bills (T-Bills), and fixed deposits.

Government officials and industry partners describe it as a way to ensure India maintains monetary control as crypto usage accelerates.

Rather than competing with the Reserve Bank of India's digital rupee, ARC is designed to sit on top of it.

India's model creates two distinct layers:

• Settlement Layer — The CBDC: The RBI's digital rupee continues to handle final settlement and monetary oversight.

• Interaction Layer — ARC: ARC operates on blockchain rails as the programmable layer used for payments, remittances, DeFi experimentation, and business transactions.

Every ARC token is minted only after an equivalent deposit of INR reserves, keeping the system fully backed and compliant with India's capital-control rules.

The project is being developed by Polygon and Indian fintech firm Anq, which has worked closely with regulators on integrating blockchain systems into the rupee framework.

The ARC initiative is rooted in a concern shared by India and other emerging markets: the massive flow of capital into dollar-pegged stablecoins during crypto bull markets.

Foreign stablecoins dominate India's crypto trading volumes, indirectly draining rupee liquidity. A domestic stablecoin aims to reverse that trend.

ARC also fits into India's long-term digital-economy vision:

• Strengthen INR liquidity: ARC keeps value inside the domestic financial system, instead of routing trade through offshore USD pools.

• Support government securities demand: Because ARC must be backed by G-Secs, it naturally increases demand for sovereign debt.

• Enable programmable payments: ARC introduces smart-contract-driven transactions, something the CBDC alone does not currently offer.

• Lower costs for remittances and settlements: A blockchain layer lets payments clear in seconds, not days, and at significantly lower fees.

Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, said the arrangement shows how CBDCs and private stablecoins “can reinforce each other,” combining central-bank credibility with the speed and programmability of modern crypto rails.

“With rupee-backed stablecoins, the ARC project demonstrates that CBDCs and stablecoins can not only co-exist but also reinforce each other. It brings together the credibility of a CBDC as the core settlement layer with the low-cost, real-time efficiencies of stablecoins, unlocking DeFi use cases and smart-contract capabilities.”

“This combination creates room for private players to build innovative applications and drive meaningful real-world adoption,” Patel adds.

While the Reserve Bank of India has not announced a formal rollout date, industry sources say the operational framework is nearly complete.

The target window is Q1 2026, though regulatory approvals are still required.

The timing coincides with India's ongoing CBDC pilots, which began in 2022 and now include wholesale banks, retail trials, and limited offline-payment testing.

If ARC launches on schedule, India would become one of the first countries in the world to deploy a regulated private stablecoin designed to work in tandem with a CBDC.

ARC's impact will depend on adoption, particularly by banks, payment companies, and fintech platforms.

The first phase limits ARC issuance to corporate and institutional accounts, meaning retail usage will come later.

Still, analysts say ARC could reshape India's digital-asset landscape by:

ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II,

Senior Contributor.

Bitcoin prices fell further on Friday, November 21, dropping to almost $80,000 and reaching their lowest in more than seven months as what one analyst described as a “perfect storm” of macro factors fueled additional bloodletting. 

The world's largest digital currency by total market value approached $80,500, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. At this point, it was down roughly 36% from the all-time high it set last month and trading at its lowest since approximately April 14. 

William Stern, founder of Cardiff, spoke to the various factors that drove these losses, stating via email that “Bitcoin testing $80,500 isn't just about sentiment; it's about a massive liquidity exit. We are seeing a 'perfect storm' of macro headwinds."" 

“First, the Fed's 'higher for longer' reality is finally sinking in, crushing the hope for cheap money,” he continued. “Second, we just saw a single whale dump over $1.3 billion in Bitcoin onto the market.” 

“When you combine a hawkish Fed with that level of supply shock, the floor naturally falls out. This is the market aggressively repricing risk.” 

Several other analysts also highlighted sentiment, along with market leverage and macro factors, as contributing to the digital asset dropping to its latest multimonth low. 

Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, highlighted developments like these, stating via email that “The latest decline is a mix of risk-off sentiment, ETF outflows, and leveraged positions getting unwound."" 

“Broader markets have pulled back, liquidity has been thin, and each wave of selling has triggered more forced liquidations, creating a mechanically driven slide rather than a single catalyst,” he stated. 

Katherine Dowling, advisor at Bitwise Asset Management, also highlighted multiple variables when explaining bitcoin's latest drop. 

“A likely blend of factors has put bitcoin into this seeming spin cycle including fed rate sentiment, labor market, general tech ‘risk off' mood fostered by frothy AI multiples and a dash of margin calls to boot,” she stated via email. “The government shutdown back drop has also not helped.” 

However, Dowling also offered some input that might help manage expectations, stating that “It is important to keep in mind that pull backs of this magnitude are on brand for bitcoin and better to focus on the long term hold fundamentals.” 

Matt Williams, head of financial services at Luxor, focused on the impact of falling liquidity and high leverage when detailing bitcoin's latest decline. 

“Liquidity continues to dry up due to bearish sentiment, which is exacerbated heading into the holiday week when liquidity historically shrinks anyway,” he stated via email. 

“There are more forced liquidations amongst participants that took on long positions around $90k,” said Williams. “There are also rumors of large crypto market makers being forced to liquidate sizable long BTC derivatives positions, but these rumors have not been substantiated yet.”

David Brickell, head of international distribution for FRNT, described the factors that drove the latest losses as a “continuation” of variables that caused declines in recent weeks. 

“Tech remains under pressure — even NVIDIA's stronger-than-expected results weren't enough to offset growing concerns about stretched valuations. At the same time, liquidity in US funding markets remains tight,” he stated via Telegram. 

“Key funding rates are still elevated, even as the TGA begins to draw down, which is limiting the usual relief that would follow a fiscal liquidity injection,” Brickell added, referring to the Federal Reserve's Treasury General Account . 

“Meanwhile, we've broken through several major technical levels, triggering systematic and momentum strategies to sell into weakness,” he noted. 

“The combination of tighter liquidity, systematic selling, and a lack of any compelling new bullish narrative is leaving markets without a natural bid,” said Brickell.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

ARC is a regulated, rupee-backed stablecoin  created by the private sector, which signals India's most serious push yet toward a two-layer digital money system, one that keeps the Reserve Bank firmly in control of settlement while allowing private firms to build faster, smarter, more flexible payment rails on top of it.

Here's everything you need to know about ARC.

ARC is structured as a fully collateralized, INR-pegged digital asset, backed by cash equivalents such as Government Securities (G-Secs), Treasury Bills (T-Bills), and fixed deposits.

Government officials and industry partners describe it as a way to ensure India maintains monetary control as crypto usage accelerates.

Rather than competing with the Reserve Bank of India's digital rupee, ARC is designed to sit on top of it.

India's model creates two distinct layers:

• Settlement Layer — The CBDC: The RBI's digital rupee continues to handle final settlement and monetary oversight.

• Interaction Layer — ARC: ARC operates on blockchain rails as the programmable layer used for payments, remittances, DeFi experimentation, and business transactions.

Every ARC token is minted only after an equivalent deposit of INR reserves, keeping the system fully backed and compliant with India's capital-control rules.

The project is being developed by Polygon and Indian fintech firm Anq, which has worked closely with regulators on integrating blockchain systems into the rupee framework.

The ARC initiative is rooted in a concern shared by India and other emerging markets: the massive flow of capital into dollar-pegged stablecoins during crypto bull markets.

Foreign stablecoins dominate India's crypto trading volumes, indirectly draining rupee liquidity. A domestic stablecoin aims to reverse that trend.

ARC also fits into India's long-term digital-economy vision:

• Strengthen INR liquidity: ARC keeps value inside the domestic financial system, instead of routing trade through offshore USD pools.

• Support government securities demand: Because ARC must be backed by G-Secs, it naturally increases demand for sovereign debt.

• Enable programmable payments: ARC introduces smart-contract-driven transactions, something the CBDC alone does not currently offer.

• Lower costs for remittances and settlements: A blockchain layer lets payments clear in seconds, not days, and at significantly lower fees.

Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, said the arrangement shows how CBDCs and private stablecoins “can reinforce each other,” combining central-bank credibility with the speed and programmability of modern crypto rails.

“With rupee-backed stablecoins, the ARC project demonstrates that CBDCs and stablecoins can not only co-exist but also reinforce each other. It brings together the credibility of a CBDC as the core settlement layer with the low-cost, real-time efficiencies of stablecoins, unlocking DeFi use cases and smart-contract capabilities.”

“This combination creates room for private players to build innovative applications and drive meaningful real-world adoption,” Patel adds.

While the Reserve Bank of India has not announced a formal rollout date, industry sources say the operational framework is nearly complete.

The target window is Q1 2026, though regulatory approvals are still required.

The timing coincides with India's ongoing CBDC pilots, which began in 2022 and now include wholesale banks, retail trials, and limited offline-payment testing.

If ARC launches on schedule, India would become one of the first countries in the world to deploy a regulated private stablecoin designed to work in tandem with a CBDC.

ARC's impact will depend on adoption, particularly by banks, payment companies, and fintech platforms.

The first phase limits ARC issuance to corporate and institutional accounts, meaning retail usage will come later.

Still, analysts say ARC could reshape India's digital-asset landscape by:

HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:HIVE) is one of the top cryptocurrency stocks to consider for long-term investment. On November 18, H.C. Wainwright raised its price target on Hive Digital Technologies (NASDAQ:HIVE) to $10 from $8, maintaining a Buy rating after the company's AI Cloud expansion and a strong Q2 FY2026 beat.



A day earlier on November 17, HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd delivered record revenue in its digital currency mining and BUZZ HPC segments for its second quarter of fiscal 2025. Revenue in the quarter was up 285% year over year to $87.3 million. The increase was driven by a 101.2% increase in digital currency mining revenue, reflecting an 86.2% quarter-over-quarter increase in average hashrate. During the quarter, the company mined 717 Bitcoin, representing a 76.6% sequential increase in production. Nevertheless, the company ultimately reported a GAAP net loss of $15.8 million, primarily due to the accelerated two-year depreciation of ASICs.

“With 25 EH/s of operating hashrate recently achieved, we now have a Bitcoin mining revenue run-rate approaching $400 million at a 50% operating margin after electrical costs. At the same time, we are accelerating our AI data center initiatives across Canada and Europe, laying the groundwork for Tier III+ facilities capable of supporting hyperscale GPU deployments. BUZZ HPC is becoming a powerful growth engine,” said CEO Aydin Kilic.

Hive Digital's high-performance computing division, Buzz, generated a record revenue of $5.2 million, representing a 175% increase. The increase came as the company completed a 300 MW addition of new capacity in Paraguay. It exited the quarter with a 540 MW hydro power data center footprint, securing a path of 400 MW in Paraguay. Amid the increase, the company expects $140 million in annualized HPC revenue by the end of the fourth quarter next year.

HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:HIVE) is a company focused on green Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing (HPC) and AI cloud services. It operates data centers powered by clean energy sources to mine Bitcoin and provides GPU-based cloud services for AI and other high-performance computing tasks. HIVE also holds a significant portion of the Bitcoin it mines as a long-term asset.

While we acknowledge the potential of HIVE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HIVE and that has 100x upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

November 22, 2025 @ 10:27 am By Michael Wong 

India's central bank is taking a “very cautious” stance on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, arguing that their volatility and potential to bypass safeguards could threaten financial stability, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra said.

Malhotra's remarks, delivered in a memorial lecture at Delhi School of Economics, come as India's government weighs whether to introduce a formal stablecoin framework even while the RBI has repeatedly flagged risks and pushed its own central bank digital currency as a safer alternative.

He said new financial products such as stablecoins, cryptoassets and buy-now-pay-later schemes are testing the boundaries of what should fall within regulation, requiring authorities to constantly reassess the regulatory perimeter.

In the lecture, Malhotra set out the RBI's broader regulatory philosophy, describing regulation as essential to correcting market failures and protecting consumers, but especially critical in finance because of the sector's potential to transmit shocks through the entire economy.

He said financial institutions are uniquely interconnected, structurally fragile because they borrow short and lend long, and prone to pro-cyclical herd behaviour that can inflate bubbles and deepen downturns.

Against that backdrop, Malhotra reiterated that safeguarding financial stability is the RBI's “north star”, with other objectives including prudential rules for liquidity and capital, conduct standards to protect consumers, anti-money-laundering controls and support for priority-sector credit.

He warned that short-term growth achieved at the expense of stability can raise the cost of future crises.

Malhotra said the RBI is trying to shift toward principle-based regulation to avoid “tick-box” compliance and reduce opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, while acknowledging that India will continue to use hybrid rules where clarity is needed.

He pointed to the RBI's proposed expected credit loss (ECL) provisioning framework as an example, combining principles with quantitative floors.

The new ECL norms are slated to begin on April 1, 2027, with a phased glide path to March 31, 2031 to smooth any capital impact on banks.

The governor also stressed proportionality, tailoring rules by size and risk, along with public consultation, evidence-led policymaking and mandatory reviews every five to seven years to prevent a build-up of outdated rules after crises.

He added that regulators face recurring trade-offs between innovation and stability, and that any regulatory forbearance should be exceptional, time-bound and transparent to avoid delaying recognition of underlying problems.

Oops, something went wrong

SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) is one of the best crypto-related stocks to invest in.

An aerial view of large skyscrapers downtown, signifying the company's presence in the financial industry.

On November 11, 2025, SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) announced the launch of SoFi Crypto. The company made itself the first nationally chartered, FDIC-insured bank in the U.S. to launch such a platform. Its SoFi app will directly allow trading of major cryptocurrencies. Additionally, future USD stablecoin integration will be supported by the platform, embedding crypto into lending and infrastructure offerings. The demand for the all-in-one platform is also significant, with 60% of crypto-owning members preferring to use a licensed bank.

Meanwhile, on October 30, UBS raised its price target on SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) from $20.50 to $27.50, while reiterating a “Neutral” rating. The price target increase followed the company's Q3 results announcement on October 28.

In the second quarter, SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) reported a 38% YoY revenue growth, taking it to $950 million. Furthermore, $277 million was recorded in adjusted EBITDA, a roughly 50% YoY increase. Total loan originations rose by $1.2 billion QoQ to $9.9 billion. Fee-based revenue growth of 50% to $409 million was a key revenue driver. Thanks to an equity raise and debt reduction, tangible book value increased to $7.2 billion. As a result of the strong performance, the management raised full-year guidance for revenue, EBITDA, and EPS. Strong member growth and capital-light business momentum are expected to drive future growth.

SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI), a U.S.-based fintech and banking platform, offers crypto services, alongside loans, deposits, and investments.

Crypto is no longer a fringe technology – it's becoming part of the financial mainstream. 

Traditional institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan now offer crypto investment products. Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds that track the price of Bitcoin and can be bought and sold like stocks), approved in the US in 2024, have opened the doors to mainstream investment capital. In countries like Argentina and Venezuela, crypto is being used to fight hyperinflation. Bitcoin is now legal tender in countries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic.

Poker players have always been early adopters in this space. Crypto poker sites have existed since 2011, when Black Friday forced PokerStars and Full Tilt out of the US market. Seals With Clubs (SwC) launched that year as a Bitcoin-only poker site offering a decentralized solution for American players. You might not have heard of it, but it's still running today as SwC Poker, after a 2015 rebrand. Its player pool is limited, but it has a cult following among crypto-poker diehards.

Crypto poker is also making its way into the mainstream. Two sites are at the forefront of this push, and both are represented by some of the biggest names in the game. 

CoinPoker was founded in 2017 by well-known poker pro Tony G, who said in an interview with Cardplayer Lifestyle, “I believe that blockchain is the future.” CoinPoker uses its own native token (CHP), built on Ethereum, and offers blockchain-based RNG verification. Tony G has since moved away from CoinPoker to concentrate on more fundamental crypto businesses, and the site now boasts Patrick Leonard among its ambassadors. 

Phenom Poker is another major crypto poker site – and it's just celebrated its first birthday. While it's still building its player pool, its roster of ambassadors and crypto-native design are drawing attention. Brian Rast, Viktor Blom, Dan ‘Jungleman' Cates, Huck Seed and Alec Torelli are among the names in one of the most impressive pro teams in online poker. 

Crypto might scream anonymity and illegality to some, but that isn't the case with more mainstream sites. Phenom Poker, for example, is based in Panama with an online license in Anjouan and actually requires KYC up front. In a recent interview with PokerOrg, Phenom Poker founder Matt Valeo explained why: “We do the KYC process upfront, which might not seem like a good thing on the surface… But you can't be serious about security if you don't know who's playing. If (players are) acting maliciously … we just don't want you here.”

So, if these new crypto poker sites don't promise anonymity, what exactly are they offering that fiat-based sites can't?

A crypto poker site is an online poker site that provides deposits and withdrawals, and runs games with cryptocurrency instead of fiat. Phenom Poker accepts deposits in USDT (Tether) on the Polygon network or a number of other tokens like Ethereum (for a small conversion or bridging fee). Depositing is simple: copy your wallet address from inside the Phenom Poker client, and send funds from your external crypto wallet. Transactions on Polygon aren't always instant and depend on where you're sending funds from (your own wallet or an exchange), but they're fast – both for deposits and withdrawals. 

But a true crypto poker site isn't just about using crypto for payments – it should be built on Web3 principles like decentralization, user ownership, transparency, and on-chain verification.

Phenom Poker offers a good example of this approach. The Phenom Wallet is an on-chain wallet that the player controls fully. Players can instantly deposit and withdraw from it, and the funds are never touched by the site. You can verify your funds at any time on the blockchain using tools like PolygonScan. This setup reduces the risk of internal fraud or site insolvency — players retain control over their funds at all times. 

When your money is in play, it's kept in a smart contract that can also be viewed and verified on-chain. This brings a new level of transparency to online poker.

Unlike other speculative crypto tokens, the Phenom Token exists to facilitate a shared ownership model. You can't buy it – instead it's a form of rakeback or loyalty system that allows players to collectively accrue up to a 50% stake in the business by playing on the site.

While crypto sites often operate without traditional oversight, many now hold gaming licenses in jurisdictions like Anjouan or Curaçao. These licenses don't provide the same player protections as, say, the UK Gambling Commission, but they represent a move toward legitimacy.

Sites like Phenom Poker and CoinPoker hold gaming licenses but also operate in gray and black market regions, such as the USA. If you're a US player, you may well think this is a good thing. There are very few options to play legal real-money poker outside of a handful of states in the US. However, it's true that they're not under the same regulatory scrutiny as more traditional online poker sites. 

What they would argue is that their blockchain-based approach delivers more transparency than traditional sites – a new kind of trust model. Ironically, many crypto-poker players say they're choosing these sites because they don't trust traditional online poker companies.

As crypto becomes more mainstream, it follows that the barriers to playing on crypto poker sites are starting to break down. 

For a lot of players, it comes down to speed, control, and access. Traditional poker sites can delay withdrawals for days or block you from playing on the site if you're in the wrong territory. Crypto poker flips that model — offering rapid payouts, borderless play, and a sense of ownership over funds. For a generation of poker players who have grown up with crypto and a more liberal world outlook, that control is key.

                    FILE PHOTO: Bitcoin and ether slumped to multi-month lows on Friday, with cryptocurrencies swept up in a broader flight from riskier assets as investors worried about lofty tech valuations and bets on near-term U.S. interest rate cuts faded.

Bitcoin and ether slumped to multi-month lows on Friday, with cryptocurrencies swept up in a broader flight from riskier assets as investors worried about lofty tech valuations and bets on near-term U.S. interest rate cuts faded.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, fell 5.5% to a seven-month low of $81,668. Ether slid more than 6% to $2,661.37, its lowest in four months.

Both tokens are down roughly 12% so far this week.

Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as a barometer of risk appetite and their slide highlights how fragile the mood in markets has turned in recent days, with high-flying artificial intelligence stocks tumbling and volatility spiking.

CRYPTOCURRENCIES LOSE $1.2 TRILLION IN SIX WEEKS

""If it's telling a story about risk sentiment as a whole, then things could start to get really, really ugly, and that's the concern now,"" Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG, said of the fall in bitcoin.

About $1.2 trillion has been wiped off the market value of all cryptocurrencies in the past six weeks, according to market tracker CoinGecko.

Prices of Hong Kong-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched by China AMC, Harvest and Bosera fell close to 7% each on Friday.

FALL FROM GRACE

Bitcoin's slide follows a stellar run this year that propelled it to a record high above $120,000 in October, buoyed by favourable regulatory changes towards crypto assets globally.

But analysts say the market remains scarred by a record single-day slump last month that saw more than $19 billion of positions liquidated.

""The market feels a little bit dislocated, a bit fractured, a bit broken, really, since we had that selloff,"" said Sycamore.

Bitcoin has since erased all its year-to-date gains and is now down 12% for the year, while ether has lost close to 19%.

Citi analyst Alex Saunders said $80,000 would be an important level as it is around the average level of bitcoin holdings in ETFs.

The selloff has also hurt share prices of crypto stockpilers, following a boom in public digital asset treasury companies this year as corporates took advantage of rising prices to buy and hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets.

Shares of Strategy, once the poster child for corporate bitcoin accumulation, have fallen 11% this week and were down nearly 4% in premarket trade, languishing at one-year lows.

JP Morgan said in a note this week that the company could be excluded from some MSCI equity indexes, which could spark forced selling by funds that track them.

Its Japanese peer Metaplanet has tumbled about 80% from a June peak.

Crypto exchange Coinbase was down 1.9% in premarket trade and is on course for its longest losing streak in more than a month.

Crypto miners MARA Holdings and CleanSpark were down 2.4% and 3.6%, respectively, while the Winklevoss twins' newly-listed Gemini has plunged 62% from its listing price.

""Bitcoin market conditions are the most bearish they have been since the current bull cycle started in January 2023,"" said digital asset research firm CryptoQuant in its weekly crypto report on Wednesday.

""We are highly likely to have seen most of this cycle's demand wave pass.""

Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, a firm that helps wealthy individuals and their families navigate the world of cryptocurrency, recalls how one of his clients, “a gentleman from Dallas,” turned $11,000 into almost half a billion dollars, primarily from trading memecoins – culturally themed crypto tokens with no real utility whose valuations can fluctuate wildly.

The lucky investor, whom Claver got to know first as a friend, managed his own crypto. “He used a sniper bot [automated software that will buy and sell newly listed tokens in milliseconds according to certain parameters] that made him millions from memecoin trading,” Claver said.

Eventually, Claver persuaded his friend to attend one of the registered investment adviser's (RIA) family office events, which led to a portion of the trader's portfolio being rolled into XRP, the well-established native token of the Ripple network. “We saw a 6x on XRP so he did pretty well,” Claver said.

Several years before, Claver found himself searching for advice on managing his own crypto gains. Specifically, he wanted to explore how best to structure his crypto estate, handle his taxes, carry out succession planning and so on.

But none of the typical wealth advice you find in the traditional high net worth (HNW) space seemed to be available for holders of crypto. After a few useful introductions, Claver consulted with some family offices and saw a glaring advisory gap in the market. This led to the formation of Digital Ascension, and from a standing start, the firm now looks after about $1 billion in crypto assets for wealthy families.

“Asension started taking capital in October last year, and we partnered with Anchorage for institutional custody,” Claver said in an interview. “So, we've gone from zero to a billion in all crypto in about one year. We work with 10families, and we have about another 1,500 clients that have somewhere between half a million and 5 million in total portfolio value. And I can confidently say we are the largest RIA in the world for crypto.”

Ascension takes any private client services that you can think of, and does that for crypto, explained Claver. That includes estate planning, taxes, accounting, bill-pay and everything a family office would provide. This sits alongside wealth management, which includes allocating to various cryptocurrencies, setting up lines of credit and earning returns on assets, but all done in a buttoned-up and regulated fashion – “Not through DeFi [decentralized finance],” Claver said.

“We do it with institutional custody and with insurance on your assets and things like tri-party agreements to mitigate risk of loss,” he said. “It's very different from the kind of onchain stuff. You can get all the additional assurances you would get from an institution with the benefit of the additional services.”

A crucial component here is custody, courtesy of technology built by Anchorage, one of the first U.S.-regulated crypto safekeeping firms. It was recently selected by BlackRock to look after its crypto ETF assets.

“The institutional custody at Anchorage and sub accounts structure means the client is never a creditor,” Claver said. “These are always your assets. They sit in your account. Effectively, a Schwab account for your crypto is basically what it ends up being.”

This allows for a structure that's a lot more intricate and nuanced than a few people having keys to some cold wallet (a means of holding crypto assets that stays remote from the harsh winds of the internet).

“You can have beneficiaries on the account such as your spouse,” Claver said. “If you have a trustee that has to sign off — say it's an asset-protection trust or another type of structure — we can add multiple signers and governance on who gets access to the assets, when, and for what reasons.”

Trading crypto assets prone to periods of intense volatility may not be for the fainthearted, but the industry has amassed monumental wealth for investors in recent years and continues to create more wealthy individuals in each cycle. The global population of crypto millionaires increased by 40% from the previous year to 2025, according to a recent study.

That said, the lack of grown-up advice and basic crypto wealth management — which Ascension is servicing — was highlighted in a recent survey by Swiss software firm Avaloq that found the traditional wealth sector is under mounting pressure to deliver digital assets to wealthy clients. In the UAE, for instance, 63% of ultra-rich investors have switched managers or are considering doing so, according to that survey.

What often happens is the children of ultra-high-net-worth families are the ones educating their elders about digital assets. A generation that grew up with crypto, family-office kids use laptops or phones to purchase large quantities of tokens on exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.

It's mostly second- or third-generation family office members that Ascension initially speaks with, Claver said, guided via his firm's social media presence. The next step is to schedule a call with the elders.

“It's usually a conversation with the matriarch or patriarch and I kind of explain to them that this is the next iteration of the internet, and that there's certain protocols and networks that will be used for public infrastructure, and also how this is kind of a hedge against other positions that they might have,” he said.

Oftentimes, the second or third gen person that's brought the conversation will be given a couple of million dollars to invest in digital assets to see how it works out. Most of the time it's somewhere less than 1%, Claver said.

“If they want to make a large allocation to certain cryptos — bitcoin, Ethereum, SOL, Matic, chainlink, XRP, XLM, HBAR, whatever it is — we help them make that allocation. Or, if they already have those allocations in a cold wallet, and they don't have a continuity plan built around that, then they can put it in institutional custody. Then you get assurances and planning, versus having keys or words written down on a piece of paper that a few people might have and have to reconstitute a wallet every quarter to make adjustments.”

Claver admits things have evolved since the early days of Bitcoin libertarians. Apart from anything else, the demographic of these early holders has changed, with many entering the 40-plus age group. And anyone's perspective starts to change when they suddenly have a lot of capital to protect, he added.

“If you've got a couple 100 grand, or even a couple million dollars, you may feel comfortable managing the risk associated with that, like cash in your mattress. I get that,"" Claver said. “But when it becomes $20, $50, $100 million or even a billion dollars, it's a very different animal.”

The Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index, which measures the price gap between bitcoin on Coinbase and the global market average, has fallen to a negative divergence of -0.15%, the widest since Q1 this year. 

A negative reading of the index means bitcoin is trading cheaper on Coinbase, signalling weakness in U.S. demand, selling pressure and waning institutional appetite. This trend began after the crypto liquidation event on Oct. 10 and has persisted throughout November.

The move comes as bitcoin BTC$84,569.00 is on track for its worst week since early March, having fallen more than 11% and briefly dipped below $81,000 before stabilizing at around $84,000. November has also delivered steep losses, with bitcoin currently down 23%, marking its worst monthly performance since June 2022, when it dropped 38%.

This shift in market sentiment is also visible in U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, which have seen persistent outflows for most of November.

However, Friday broke that streak with $238.4 million of inflows, the largest since Nov. 11, according to Farside data. It was also a record volume day, with the ETFs collectively trading $11.5 billion according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. BlackRock's IBIT accounted for $8 billion of that total. 

Balchunas also noted that IBIT saw a record week for put volume, indicating that ""this is one thing that may help people stay the course, they can always buy some puts as a hedge while they stay long.""

Given bitcoin's 36% drawdown from its October all-time high, Friday may represent a high-volume capitulation event, often observed at local price bottoms. While it's not guaranteed, the events may be signaling BTC's potential attempt to stabilize in the low $80,000 range.

Glassnode data shows more than $4 billion in realized bitcoin losses on Friday, the highest level since March 2023 during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis, another potential capitulation data point.

Bitcoin BTC$84,569.00 sentiment has plunged into extreme pessimism, suggesting a tactical or interim low from which a BTC price bounce is likely, according to analytics firm 10x Research.

The firm's proprietary ""Greed & Fear"" Index, which measures market sentiment, has crashed to a record low of less than 5 points. Readings below 10% represent extreme fear or pessimism, and above 90% signal green or over-optimism.

More importantly, the 21-day simple moving average of the index has slipped to 10%, a level that has consistently marked tactical lows over the years.

""Our own 10x Greed & Fear Index has been sitting near its lowest possible reading, and the slower-moving average has now reached the 10% zone, a level that often marks a tactical low,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, told CoinDesk.

Peak pessimism does not necessarily signal an immediate end to the downtrend. While prices may continue to decline, the pace is likely to slow, with a tactical low in sight.

""Prices can still fall further, as we saw in March when the indicator bottomed before bitcoin continued to slide into April. Yet, bitcoin still staged a 10% rebound immediately after that initial sentiment low. With sentiment now near rock bottom again, a similar short-term rebound is possible,"" Thielen explained.

Bitcoin traded near $84,800 at press time, having hit a low of $80,880 on Friday, according to data from CoinDesk. Despite the bounce, prices are still down 10% for the week and 23% for the month.

A new report from decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch has shown a growing crisis in decentralized finance (DeFi): the vast majority of capital deployed in major DeFi liquidity pools is not being used effectively.

According to data presented at Devconnect Buenos Aires, between 83% and 95% of liquidity in top pools, including Uniswap v2, v3, and v4, as well as Curve, remains idle for most of the year. That means billions of dollars sit in smart contracts without earning fees or generating meaningful returns.

In Uniswap v2 alone, only 0.5% of liquidity typically falls within active trading price ranges, rendering nearly $1.8 billion ineffective according to the report.

This inefficiency hits retail participants the hardest. Research cited in the report shows that 50% of liquidity providers (LPs) are losing money when factoring in impermanent loss, with net liquidity provider deficits exceeding $60 million. In one notable example, a single Uniswap v3 pool saw over $30 million in lost profits due to Just-in-Time liquidity manipulation.

Part of the problem stems from the sheer number of fragmented pools, with more than seven million across the ecosystem. This complexity not only dilutes liquidity but also makes it harder to route trades efficiently, further reducing returns for liquidity providers.

To 1inch, the solution is its Aqua protocol, which is designed to let DeFi applications share the same capital base across multiple strategies without compromising user custody.

“We address this problem by introducing a new approach,"" 1inch cofounder Segej Kunz told CoinDesk in an interview at Devconnect Buenos Aires. ""We allow people to just keep assets in the wallet, and we allow people to create virtual trading positions.""

To Kunz, the current situation constitutes a ""DeFi liquidity crisis.""

The protocol also aims to lower the barrier to entry for developers who want to utilize this deep liquidity. ""Any existing DEX right now can be implemented under 10 lines of code,"" Kunz added, noting that the goal is to provide ""a foundation to build on top"" so that liquidity providers can ""hold assets in the wallet"" rather than locking them inside complex protocol contracts.

5 Charts Show Climate Progress as Paris Agreement Turns 10

The 2015 Paris Agreement forged a path for the world to stave off the worst climate change scenarios. Here's where we stand 10 years later

By Meghan Bartels edited by Andrea Thompson

Amanda Montañez

Ten years ago the world came together to forge a path out of the climate emergency in the form of a global treaty dubbed the Paris Agreement.

Under the accord, nations committed to keeping global temperatures to “well below” a two-degree-Celsius increase over preindustrial levels and to striving to limit that increase to 1.5 degrees C. These goals were ambitious and required greenhouse gas emissions to begin declining by 2025.

Yet emissions continue to rise. Annual negotiations around seeing the Paris Agreement through have continued over the past two weeks at this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP30, in Brazil, where participants are acknowledging two simultaneous truths: we have made meaningful strides in protecting our planet, but huge leaps are still needed to avoid the worst outcomes. Those leaps are daunting, given that President Donald Trump is once again pulling the U.S. out of the accord and that countries such as China and Saudi Arabia are also still trying to keep fossil fuels in the energy mix. China, however, is rapidly overtaking the U.S. as a renewable energy powerhouse, and solar and wind have seen exponential gains globally in recent years.

These five charts show why the Paris Agreement is vital—and how the world is doing 10 years into the endeavor.

The Paris Agreement is built around temperature increases compared with an unspecified preindustrial baseline, generally taken as the latter half of the 19th century. Every year since 1970—more than half a century—temperatures have been above this average and soaring upward.

In 2015 the average global temperature was 1.1 degrees C hotter than it was during the preindustrial period. Today it is around 1.3 degrees C. (In 2024—the hottest year on record—the planet was more than 1.5 degrees C, but the Paris agreement looks at the average over many years. The World Meteorological Organization projects that 2025 will be around 1.4 degrees C above the preindustrial average and either the second or third hottest year on record.)

The increase is grim but not the end of the story—especially if humans can stop climate pollution quickly enough to reverse the warming trend. “Every ton matters; every tenth of a degree we avoid matters; every year matters,” says Costa Samaras, an energy policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University.

Amanda Montañez; Source: “IPCC 2014: Summary for Policymakers,” in Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, February 2015 (2015 projection); Rhodium Group (2025 projection)

In fact, before the Paris Agreement, the world was set to see between 3.7 and 4.8 degrees C of warming by 2100. But if nations follow through on their Paris commitments to reduce emissions, that level of warming will drop to around 2.9 degrees C, with a likely range of 2.3 to 3.4 degrees C, according to one recent estimate.

It's still a steep challenge to follow through even on the Paris road map, however—and its goals permit some spewing of carbon pollution into the atmosphere.

“Until global emissions are at net zero,” Samaras says, “the climate outcomes of tomorrow are going to be worse than today.”

Amanda Montañez; Source: “Ten Years of the Paris Agreement: The Present and Future of Extreme Heat,” Climate Central and World Weather Attribution (data)

Those climate outcomes could be dire, though not as dire as those that would occur on our pre-Paris track. New research shows that with around four degrees C of warming, U.S. residents would see some 118 more extremely hot days than would occur under a preindustrial climate by the end of the century. (Other nations would fare even worse.)

If we achieve the current commitments to reduce emissions, the number of days with the worst heat in 2100 will drop to 88 in the U.S. If we can limit global warming to 1.3 degrees C, the U.S. will see just 58 such days per year on average.

Amanda Montañez; Source: “Intergenerational Inequities in Exposure to Climate Extremes,” by Wim Thiery et al., in Science, Vol. 374; October 8, 2021 (data)

Of course, even if we follow through on current commitments, there will be climate consequences regardless. With 2.6 degrees C of warming, today's five-year-olds will experience an extra 22 percent more heat waves than today's 15-year-olds, work by climate scientist Wim Thiery of Vrije University of Brussels shows. Similarly, today's children will experience more than twice as many heat waves than their 35-year-old parents will—and more than six times as many as their 65-year-old grandparents.

Other climate-fueled disasters, including droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones, are also increasing in frequency.

Amanda Montañez; Source: International Energy Agency (data)

One of the key bright spots since the Paris Agreement was signed is the surge of renewable energy. A particular win has been that solar power facilities are coming online much faster than anyone expected in 2015. Better yet, energy from these facilities is being stored for nighttime use thanks to battery technology that was nonexistent when the Paris Agreement was signed. “Batteries is really the miracle story here,” Samaras says.

Now we need a similar miracle story for sectors such as transportation, agriculture, industry and land use. “I hope that we can revisit this in 10 years and be able to say that the Paris Agreement started a rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,” Samaras says. “But we need to work for the next 10 years in order to make that happen.”

While its mouth is closed, this artifact speaks volumes about the medieval past.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Many ancient wooden structures have been lost to time, as wood unfortunately decomposes quickly. However, water can act as a time capsule—in perfectly anaerobic wetland or underwater conditions, wood can survive for centuries. And recently, archaeologists from Nicolaus Copernicus University (NCU) discovered a striking example of that preservation—a 1,000-year-old wooden face during an underwater research expedition.

In 2024, scientists from NCU's Center for Underwater Archaeology and the Museum of the First Piasts in Lednica found the face submerged in Poland's Lake Lednica. The team recently presented its findings at a press conference. 

The face was carved onto a wooden structural beam called a hook. According to a press release from NCU, the carving measured 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) tall and 9 (3.5 inches) centimeters wide, and features intricate details including realistic eyes, nose, mouth, and oval-shaped head. The wood was also marked with the number 353. 

Experts estimate that the tree from which the face (and beam) were carved the face's tree fell in the year 967, meaning the carving has likely existed for over a millennium. This was around the same time that the founder of the Polish state, Mieszko I, was baptized, and Poland shifted into a state of Christian assimilation. 

This isn't the first face of its kind to be discovered. Similar depictions have been found in other Slavic cities including Wolin, Novgorod the Great, and Staraya Ladoga. According to experts, consistencies between these finds suggest that the beam found at Lednica reflects a local artistic and spiritual tradition, rather than Scandinavian or Rus influence. In short, the recent discovery is just one piece in the larger puzzle of medieval Slavic life. 

“This discovery not only evokes admiration for the craftsmanship from over a thousand years ago but also opens a fascinating discussion about the spiritual life of early medieval Slavs,” Andrzej Pydyn, director of the Centre for Underwater Archaeology at NCU, said in the press release.

Experts suggest the beam on which the face was engraved served as part of the settlement's defensive rampart—and its purpose may have gone far beyond just architecture. The style of woodworking suggests that the face had mystical meaning, and likely depicted a deity, protective spirit, or hero watching over inhabitants of the area. 

Other evidence supports the idea of the being part of the spiritual practices of medieval Slavic society. The researchers also discovered horse jaws and bones around ramparts, which may have come from ritual offerings or protective sacrifices, Mateusz Popek from NCU said. The team also found similar bones underneath houses.

  “The [wood] face is a priceless monument and a rare example of an item combining utility and symbolic functions,” a post from the Museum of the First Piasts in Lednica reads. “The discovery from Lake Lednica not only impresses, but also opens new questions about the life, culture and spirituality of the inhabitants of these lands from over a thousand years ago.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

There's a new language in town. Well, actually, it's ancient, and experts can't even read it yet. But they're excited to find out more.

Archaeologists discovered a basalt tablet about the size of a piece of paper bearing 60 unknown script characters expertly etched onto its surface in the Bashplemi Lake region of Georgia—the same site where some scientists believe the first European, a 1.8-million-year-old hominin, was discovered. 

According to a study published in the Journal of Ancient History and Archaeology, the tablet—which measured 9.4 inches by 7.9 inches—was made from local vesicular basalt and featured seven rows of writing. 

“This tablet, which bears 60 signs, 39 of them different, raises the question of the origin of the Georgian script, proto-Georgian,” the study authors wrote. “While the basalt on which it is based is known to be of local origin, its meaning is unknown, and there remains a long way to go to decipher it.”

An initial comparative analysis conducted with over 20 languages shows that the characters bear some similarities with the written forms of the Semitic, Brahmani, and North Iberian languages. 

“Generally, the Bashplemi inscription does not repeat any script known to us,” the authors wrote, “however, most of the symbols used therein resemble ones found in the script of the Middle East, as well as those of geographically remote countries such as India, Egypt, and West Iberia.”

Some symbols may have taken inspiration from early Caucasian scripts—whether that be Georgian Mrglovani or Albanian alphabets—but there also seem to be ties to Proto-Kartvelian, Near East Phoenician, Proto-Sinaitic scripts. But without a direct link to any other known pattern of writing, this new find could be a completely unknown language. 

“The script, some of whose 39 characters are numbers and punctuation marks, may have been an alphabet,” the authors wrote. 

Researchers believe that the new find bears the strongest resemblances to the Proto-Kartvelian script from the fourth millennium B.C., which was used throughout Georgia and Iberia. But there are also likenesses to Bronze Age Georgian symbols, including “some similarities with Phoenician, Aramaic, and Greek alphabets [that] are not surprising as their role in the region and their relations to local scripts are well-known.”

The area in which this tablet was found is already an archaeologically rich location, and adding a new language to the mix only furthers the intrigue of Bashplemi Lake. 

The 60 total characters etched across seven horizontal rows also showed off intensely skilled craftsmanship, according to the study, and would have been done with advanced tools for the time. Researchers believe the person who crafted the writing used a conic drill to outline the contours of each individual character and a “smooth and round-head tool” to finish the job.

Around 115 million years ago, the waters north of Australia supported a massive shark that can be viewed as an early relative of the creatures made famous by ""Jaws."" Newly examined fossils show that modern sharks began developing extremely large body sizes far earlier in their evolutionary timeline than scientists once thought. These remains indicate that enormous sharks shared the top of the food chain with giant marine reptiles during the Age of Dinosaurs. The research introduces a broad, interdisciplinary effort to track how shark size changed through deep time.

Modern sharks trace their roots back more than 400 million years, yet the branches that eventually produced today's species originated during the Age of Dinosaurs. The oldest fossils representing these modern lineages date to about 135 million years ago. These early sharks, known as lamniforms, were small and may have measured only around 1 m (~3 feet) in length. Over millions of years they evolved into much larger forms, including the enormous 'Megalodon', which may have exceeded 17 m (56 feet), and the modern Great White shark, an apex-predator that reaches about 6 m (20 feet).

Why Shark Fossils Are Mostly Teeth

Because sharks possess skeletons made of cartilage, their bodies rarely fossilize. As a result, most of what survives are their teeth, which are shed continuously and accumulate on ancient sea floors. These teeth commonly appear in sedimentary rocks alongside the bones and teeth of fishes and the giant marine reptiles that dominated many prehistoric ocean ecosystems.

The rocky shores near today's city of Darwin in northern Australia were once part of the mud-covered floor of the Tethys ocean, a vast body of water that extended from Gondwana (now Australia) to the island chains of Laurasia (now Europe). Numerous remains of ancient marine life have been uncovered here, including plesiosaurs (long-necked marine reptile resembling the popular image of the Loch Ness monster), ichthyosaurs ('fish-lizards'), and large bony fish. Among the most remarkable discoveries are several huge vertebrae that indicate the presence of a very large lamniform shark.

Revealing the Early Giant: Cardabiodontid Characteristics

Five vertebrae have been recovered, each partly mineralized, which helped preserve them. Their structure is almost identical to that of today's Great White shark. However, while adult Great Whites have vertebrae about 8 cm wide, the vertebrae from the Darwin shark exceed 12 cm in diameter. Their features clearly link them to a cardabiodontid, a group of giant predatory sharks that inhabited the oceans around 100 million years ago. The Darwin specimen is especially notable because it is roughly 15 million years older than other known cardabiodontids and had already reached the extremely large size typical of the group.

To determine the body size of this early modern shark mega-predator, a team of researchers from multiple fields collaborated on a detailed analysis. The group included paleontologists and specialists in tomography from the U.S.A. Sweden, and Australia, as well as ichthyologists from South Africa and the U.S.A.

The findings appear in the Nature portfolio journal Communications Biology. Fossils of ancient sharks from the Age of Dinosaurs can be viewed by the public at the Swedish Museum of Natural History.

Scientists have known for many years that hormones can shape how the brain works, affecting emotions, mental energy, and everyday choices. What remains unclear is exactly how these chemical signals bring about such changes.

A recent investigation offers new insight by examining the role of estrogen, a hormone central to the female reproductive cycle. Through controlled experiments using laboratory rats, researchers found that the brain processes involved in learning and decision-making shift naturally throughout the cycle. These shifts appear to stem from molecular changes linked to dopamine, the chemical messenger behind the ""reward"" signals that help the brain learn.

The study appears in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

How Estrogen May Shape Cognitive Function

""Despite the broad influence of hormones throughout the brain, little is known about how these hormones influence cognitive behaviors and related neurological activity,"" explains Christine Constantinople, a professor in New York University's Center for Neural Science and the senior author of the paper. ""There is a growing realization in the medical community that changes in estrogen levels are related to cognitive function and, specifically, psychiatric disorders.""

Carla Golden, an NYU postdoctoral fellow and the paper's lead author, adds, ""Our results provide a potential biological explanation that bridges dopamine's function with learning in ways that better inform our understanding of both health and disease.""

Laboratory Tests Reveal Estrogen's Effects

The research team, which also included scientists from NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Neuroscience Institute and Virginia Commonwealth University's Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, monitored brain activity in rats while the animals completed a set of learning tasks.

The rats learned to reach a ""reward"" -- in this case, access to water -- after recognizing audio cues that indicated when water would be available and how much they would receive.

Performance improved when estrogen levels were elevated. According to the authors, estrogen increases dopamine activity in regions of the brain responsible for reward processing, strengthening the signals that support learning.

Lower Estrogen Levels Reduce Learning Ability

When estrogen activity was reduced, limiting its influence on dopamine regulation, the rats learned less effectively. These findings suggest a possible link between hormone fluctuations and symptoms seen in certain neuropsychiatric disorders. The team also emphasized that estrogen's influence did not extend to decision making; only learning was affected.

""All neuropsychiatric disorders show fluctuations in symptom severity over hormonal states, suggesting that a better understanding of how hormones influence neural circuits might reveal what causes these diseases,"" notes Constantinople.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New evidence shows tirzepatide and semaglutide strongly protect the heart","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251121090742.htm","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 04:11:49 GMT","

A research team at Mass General Brigham has released new evidence directly comparing how well tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound) and semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) protect the heart. According to the analysis, both medications lowered the chances of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause. The study appears in Nature Medicine, and the findings were also presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2025.

Earlier studies had already shown that semaglutide lowers the likelihood of major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. What had remained uncertain was whether tirzepatide, another widely used treatment for type 2 diabetes, offers similar protection.

Large Real-World Dataset Offers New Clarity

To investigate this, researchers examined national health insurance claims and compared cardiovascular outcomes among nearly one million adults using tirzepatide, semaglutide, or other type 2 diabetes therapies.

""Randomized controlled trials are often considered the reference standard in the medical evidence generation process. However, not all questions can be answered using this time- and resource-intensive method,"" said first author Nils Krüger, MD, a research fellow in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine. ""Data generated in clinical practice and used secondarily for research allow us to address a wide range of clinically relevant questions time- and resource-effectively -- when applied correctly. Moreover, we can study patients who reflect the reality of everyday clinical care, in contrast to the highly selected participants of randomized experiments.""

Risk Reductions Seen in Both Medications

The results showed measurable cardiovascular benefits among people with type 2 diabetes who were at higher risk for heart-related complications. When compared with sitagliptin, a diabetes medication known to have a neutral effect on cardiovascular outcomes, semaglutide lowered the combined risk of heart attack and stroke by 18 percent. Tirzepatide produced a 13 percent reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death when compared with dulaglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been on the market for many years.

""Both drugs show strong cardioprotective effects. Our data also indicate that these benefits occur early, suggesting that their protective mechanisms go beyond weight loss alone,"" said Krüger. Although the study highlights strong results, the biological pathways behind these heart-protective effects are still not fully understood.

Head-to-Head Comparisons Show Only Small Differences

Since these medications are relatively new, scientists continue to investigate how they protect the heart, especially in studies that directly compare tirzepatide and semaglutide. Krüger noted that ""According to recently presented database analyses by the respective manufacturers, each company's own drug appears to reduce cardiovascular risk much more effectively than the competitor's."" He added, ""However, our study found only small differences between tirzepatide and semaglutide in cardiovascular protection among populations at risk of adverse events, underscoring that both agents provide protective benefit and could be integrated into clinical cardiovascular practice.""

""We hope that our study will help clinicians better understand how these new medications work in clinical practice. Our transparent and open science practices, including pre-registration of a public protocol and shared analytic code, are designed to support scientific discussion,"" said last author Shirley Wang, PhD, an associate epidemiologist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine.

In the United States, age-related macular degeneration is one of the most common causes of permanent vision loss in adults who are 60 and older. It affects the macula, the central region of the retina that contains tightly packed cells used for sharp, detailed color vision.

Roughly 20 million adults in the country are living with some form of AMD. People with this condition typically lose the ability to see objects directly in front of them, although their peripheral vision remains intact. Available therapies can slow how the disease progresses, but none of them can restore lost vision.

Exploring a New Cell-Based Approach

In a study published in Cell Stem Cell, scientists tested retinal pigment epithelial stem cells in a phase 1/2a clinical trial. The cells were obtained from adult postmortem eye tissue. These early-stage trials are designed to determine whether a treatment can be safely administered.

AMD occurs in two forms: dry and wet. More than 90% of patients have the dry type, which develops when retinal pigment epithelial cells begin to malfunction and eventually die.

In the early stages of AMD, these cells no longer work correctly. At more advanced stages, they die and cannot regenerate. As the condition worsens, multiple regions in the central retina lose these essential cells.

Transplanting Specialized Stem Cells

In the current study, individuals with advanced dry AMD received transplants of specialized stem cells originally sourced from eye-bank tissue. These adult stem cells were limited in function and could only mature into retinal pigment epithelial cells.

Six participants were given the lowest dose of the treatment (50,000 cells) during an eye surgery. The procedure proved safe, with no serious inflammation or tumor growth reported in any of the patients.

Early Signs of Vision Improvement

Participants also showed vision improvements in the treated eye, while their untreated eye did not show the same changes. This difference suggests that the technique itself may hold therapeutic potential. ""Although we were pleased with the safety data, the exciting part was that their vision was also improving,"" said Rajesh C. Rao, M.D., Leonard G. Miller Professor of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, and an associate professor of pathology and human genetics. ""We were surprised by the magnitude of vision gain in the most severely affected patients who received the adult stem cell-derived RPE transplants. This level of vision gain has not been seen in this group of patients with advanced dry AMD.""

When tested on a standard eye chart, the low-dose group was able to read 21 additional letters one year after treatment.

Next Steps in the Clinical Trial

The research team is now monitoring 12 more participants who received higher doses of 150,000 and 250,000 cells. If no safety issues are identified, the investigators plan to move on to later stages of the clinical trial.

""We are grateful to all our participants who are allowing to better understand whether this intervention is safe enough to be a future therapy,"" Rao said. ""These kinds of NIH-funded studies can help us offer advanced treatments in the field of regenerative medicine, and we are happy we can offer this first-in-human, cutting-edge clinical trial at the University of Michigan.""

About Age-Related Macular Degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration is a condition that gradually damages the macula, the small but vital area at the back of the eye that supports sharp central vision. The disease typically develops as people get older, and it is more common in individuals over 60.

There are two primary forms of AMD. The dry form appears most often and involves the slow breakdown of retinal cells that help the eye process detail and color. The wet form is less common but progresses more quickly and involves abnormal blood vessel growth under the retina.

Over time, both types can cause blind spots in central vision, making activities such as reading and identifying faces increasingly difficult. While current treatments can slow the disease, scientists have been searching for ways to restore the lost cells, which is why stem cell research has become a promising direction.

Researchers at Tokyo Metropolitan University have uncovered how a catalyst used in a promising industrial reaction helps generate ammonia, a major component of fertilizer. In this process, copper oxide acts as an important catalyst in the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction, a more environmentally friendly approach compared to the traditional Haber-Bosch method. The team found that tiny copper particles form during the reaction itself, and these particles assist in converting nitrite ions into ammonia. Understanding this hidden step offers new opportunities to advance cleaner industrial chemistry.

Ammonia plays a central role in fertilizer production and is vital to modern agriculture. Today, most ammonia is produced through the Haber-Bosch process, which combines nitrogen and hydrogen under extremely high temperatures and pressures. This approach demands large amounts of energy and is estimated to contribute roughly 1.4% of global carbon dioxide emissions. Because ammonia is tied so closely to global food supply, there is strong motivation to develop cleaner alternatives.

Investigating a Low-Temperature Route to Ammonia

A research group led by Professor Fumiaki Amano at Tokyo Metropolitan University has focused on the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction, an emerging method that creates ammonia from nitrates at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure. Electrochemical techniques use electrodes placed in a chemical solution while voltage is applied to trigger specific reactions. Although earlier studies have identified individual steps occurring at the electrodes during ammonia formation, the full sequence of events has remained difficult to pin down.

Tracking Catalyst Changes With Advanced Tools

Through the use of advanced measurement techniques, the team gained a much clearer understanding of how ammonia forms when a copper oxide catalyst is present, with copper oxide considered one of the strongest electrocatalysts for this reaction. They relied on operando X-ray absorption, a technique that examines both electronic behavior and local structural changes. By attaching small copper oxide particles to carbon fibers, they were able to observe how the material responds when the applied voltage becomes increasingly negative.

Under a positive voltage, they found that nitrate ions ""passivate"" the catalyst by attaching to its surface, which prevents copper oxide from converting to metallic copper and instead results in the formation of nitrite ions. Once the voltage becomes more negative, ammonia production rises sharply. This increase occurs at the same time that metallic copper particles appear, confirmed by a large jump in copper-copper bonds. The researchers determined that this metallic copper helps add hydrogen to nitrite ions, which leads to ammonia formation.

Pathways Toward More Efficient Green Ammonia

The findings show how surface passivation influences the performance of copper oxide and demonstrate that creating metallic copper during the reaction is essential for efficient ammonia production. These results point to a broader set of strategies for improving green ammonia methods and for designing future generations of electrochemical catalysts.

This research was supported by Tokyo Metropolitan University and the Tokyo Global Partner Scholarship Program and is based on results from project JPNP14004 commissioned by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

A recent investigation has revealed that African lions use two separate kinds of roars, not just one. This finding is expected to play an important role in improving how conservation groups track and study these big cats.

Researchers at the University of Exeter uncovered a previously unrecognized ""intermediary roar"" that appears alongside the well-known full-throated version. The study, published in Ecology and Evolution, is the first to apply artificial intelligence to automatically sort lion roars into different types. The system reached a 95.4 per cent accuracy rate and greatly reduced the influence of human interpretation, allowing for more consistent identification of individual lions.

Lead author Jonathan Growcott of the University of Exeter said: ""Lion roars are not just iconic -- they are unique signatures that can be used to estimate population sizes and monitor individual animals. Until now, identifying these roars relied heavily on expert judgment, introducing potential human bias. Our new approach using AI promises more accurate and less subjective monitoring, which is crucial for conservationists working to protect dwindling lion populations.""

Lion Numbers Continue to Fall

The International Union for Conservation of Nature red list categorizes lions as vulnerable to extinction. Current estimates suggest Africa holds only 20,000 to 25,000 wild lions, and this population has dropped by about half over the last quarter century.

The new study concludes that a lion's roaring sequence includes both the established full-throated roar and the intermediary version, overturning the long-standing assumption that only one roar type existed. Similar developments have been reported in research on other large carnivores, including spotted hyaenas, and reinforce the expanding value of bioacoustics in ecological science.

AI Improves Monitoring Accuracy

By applying machine learning to classify full-throated roars, the research team advanced the ability to distinguish individual lions. The automated, data-focused method also streamlines passive acoustic monitoring, offering a more dependable and accessible option than common techniques such as spoor surveys or camera trapping.

Jonathan Growcott added: ""We believe there needs to be a paradigm shift in wildlife monitoring and a large-scale change to using passive acoustic techniques. As bioacoustics improve, they'll be vital for the effective conservation of lions and other threatened species.""

Broad Collaboration Supports New Findings

The project was carried out by the University of Exeter in partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Unit at the University of Oxford, Lion Landscapes, Frankfurt Zoological Society, TAWIRI (Tanzania Wildlife Institute for Research) and TANAPA (Tanzania National Parks Authority). Computer scientists from Exeter and Oxford also contributed to the work.

Funding came from the Lion Recovery Fund, WWF Germany, the Darwin Initiative, and the UKRI AI Centre for Doctoral Training in Environmental Intelligence.

The promise of interoperability for your smart home gadgets that Matter was supposed to bring has been a slow process, but it is starting to deliver, and the addition of cameras in the 1.5 release may be its biggest win yet. The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) says the latest release supports all kinds of cameras, so we're talking indoor security cameras, outdoor security cameras, video doorbells, baby monitors, and pet cameras.

This could vastly improve a seriously fractured landscape, enabling you to easily add and access your cameras on whatever platform you choose. It's also something that can potentially be delivered in a software update, so some of the cameras you already own might get Matter support.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

You may be worrying about limitations, but the supported feature list is impressive, including video and audio streaming, two-way communication, local and remote access, multiple streams, pan-tilt-zoom controls, and both detection and privacy zones. There's also support for continuous or event-based recording, either locally or to the cloud. What it won't handle is how that storage is managed, meaning some camera manufacturers will still require you to use their cloud-based subscription models.

Pleasingly, there are no limitations on resolution, unlike Apple HomeKit Secure Video, or restrictions on AI detection features. Matter is using WebRTC technology, with remote access handled via the STUN and TURN protocols, meaning that manufacturers can choose to implement end-to-end encryption for footage. TCP transport support is designed to allow more efficient and reliable transmission of lots of data, like video cameras produce, which should reduce the load on your Wi-Fi and the impact on camera battery life.

While this is very exciting news and the potential backwards compatibility is laudable, there's no telling when you'll see it in a camera in your home. The big trio: Apple, Amazon, and Google have yet to announce any plans to adopt Matter in their cameras.

Matter 1.5 isn't just about cameras, though—it also revamps support for closures, from garage doors to smart window shades, allowing for different motion types and configurations. There's soil sensor support, too, to measure moisture and temperature and potentially trigger Matter-based water valves and irrigation systems.

Enhanced energy management features are the final addition. Matter 1.5 enables devices to exchange data on energy pricing, tariffs, and grid operation, enabling you to potentially get a picture of the true cost of your gadgets in energy usage, cost, and carbon impact. EV charging has also been bolstered, with state-of-charge reporting and bi-directional charging that could enable vehicle-to-grid schemes in the future.

While the Matter 1.5 spec is now available, it will take developers a while to adopt it and get their devices certified by the CSA. Expect some announcements at CES 2026. —Simon Hill

Google has been gradually replacing its long-lived Google Assistant with the souped-up Gemini AI chatbot on all its platforms for the past year. After deploying it on its Wear OS smartwatches and, more recently, adding it directly to Google Maps, the company is bringing it to Android Auto. Google says the rollout will take place over the coming months for any Android Auto users who have upgraded from Google Assistant to Gemini on their phones.

The main highlight is that you can speak with Gemini naturally, whereas Google Assistant often relied on more rigid commands. With Gemini in control, you can say you're craving BBQ and ask for recommendations along your route (you can even ask if it's dog-friendly). Sending messages is much more of a conversational process, with the option to translate the message before it's sent, and you can easily ask to share your ETA with a spouse without fiddling with the screen.

The implementation also includes Gemini Live, which enables a back-and-forth conversational mode that lets you dig deeper into any topic. For example, you can chat with Gemini about historical facts about a town you're driving to, or practice a speech and have it give you tips. You can still control the assistant with the “Hey Google” command.

It's 20 years since the first Planet Ocean was released, amazingly, so against the backdrop this week of the watch world descending on Dubai for its annual gathering, Omega is attempting to steal some limelight with the launch of a completely overhauled model. This 4th generation, 42-mm 2025 version is flatter (thanks to the level sapphire crystal on the front) and slimmer, and, mirroring the current fashion of timepieces right now, more angular.

The matte black dial has rhodium-plated hands and indexes with white Super-LumiNova, while the Co-Axial Master Chronometer Calibre 8912 self-winding movement boasts 60 hours of power reserve. Being a Planet Ocean, you'd expect water resistance suitable for a proper diver, and here we have a model good for depths of 600 meters. The polished ceramic bezel ring comes in orange, blue, or black, but take our advice and opt for the stainless steel bracelet over the bezel-matching rubber strap. —Jeremy White

DJI has announced a new action camera, the Osmo Action 6. The Action 6 features a new, larger, square, 1/1.1-inch sensor, but perhaps more interesting is its variable aperture, which can stop down from f/2.0 to f/4.0. That means you don't have to immediately start putting on neutral-density filters just to deal with changes in brightness; just stop down or open up to control exposure as you need to. Two stops of aperture control isn't going to eliminate the need for ND filters, but it's nice to have a little more latitude in exposure control. The downside is that you can't manually control it—you can either set the aperture to fixed (f/2.8) or Auto with the ability to either set f/2.0 to 4.0, or f/2.8 to 4.0.

Other new features in this update include better lowlight performance and the ability to crop to just about any common aspect ratio without dropping below 4K (thanks to the square sensor). There's also now a reversible magnetic mount system, which solves my only real gripe about the Action 5. As you would expect, the Action 6 integrates well into the DJI ecosystem with good support for the company's wireless mics, as well as frame rates and codecs to match what you get from the drones.

The DJI Osmo Action 6 can be preordered in the U.S. from B&H Photo or Adorama for $379 for the standard combo, or $479 for the Adventure Combo, which includes two extra batteries, a charger, more mounts, and a selfie stick. —Scott Gilbertson

This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

I've been a vegetarian for over a decade. It's not because of my health, or because I dislike the taste of chicken or beef: It's a lifestyle choice I made because I wanted to reduce my impact on the planet. And yet, twice a day, every day, I lovingly scoop a cup of meat-based kibble into a bowl and set it down for my 50-pound rescue dog, a husky mix named Loki.

Until recently, I hadn't devoted a huge amount of thought to that paradox. Then I read an article in the Associated Press headlined “People often miscalculate climate choices, a study says. One surprise is owning a dog.”

The study, led by environmental psychology researcher Danielle Goldwert and published in the journal PNAS Nexus, examined how people perceive the climate impact of various behaviors—options like “adopt a vegan diet for at least one year,” or “shift from fossil fuel car to renewable public transport.” The team found that participants generally overestimated a number of low-impact actions like recycling and using efficient appliances, and they vastly underestimated the impact of other personal decisions, including the decision to “not purchase or adopt a dog.”

The real objective of the study was to see whether certain types of climate information could help people commit to more effective actions. But mere hours after the AP published its article, its aim had been recast as something else entirely: an attack on people's furry family members. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one Reddit user wrote. Others in the community chimed in with ire, ridiculing the idea that a pet Chihuahua could be driving the climate crisis and calling on researchers and the media to stop pointing fingers at everyday individuals.

Goldwert and her fellow researchers watched the reactions unfold with dismay. “If I saw a headline that said, ‘Climate scientists want to take your dogs away,' I would also feel upset,” she said. “They definitely don't,” she added. “You can quote me on that.”

Loki grinning on a hike in the Pacific Northwest.

The study set out to understand how to shift behavior by communicating climate truths. Instead, its media coverage revealed a troubling psychological trade-off: When climate-related messaging strikes a nerve, it may actually turn people off from the work of shifting societal norms.

It's an instinct I understand on some level. I love Loki, and my knee-jerk reaction is to defend the very personal choice of sharing one's life with a dog. I also sympathize with redirecting the blame toward the biggest polluters: billionaires and fossil fuel companies (not Bon-Bon, the pet Chihuahua in question). But is it irresponsible to shrug off any conversation about the environmental impact of our pets—something far more within our control than, say, the overthrow of capitalism?

Is there a way to have a frank discussion about the climate impact of our personal lives without it going to the dogs?

Oftentimes, when I'm questioning how a particular climate behavior might fit into my life, I try to imagine how it looks in my vision of a sustainable future. It's why, for instance, I don't own a car and am dedicated to riding public transit, even though it isn't always super convenient. I'm keen to be an early adopter of systems I believe in. But I struggle to imagine a future without companion animals, even knowing about their environmental impact—which is admittedly substantial.

Dogs and cats eat meat-heavy diets, which is where the bulk of their carbon pawprint comes from. A 2017 study from UCLA found that dogs and cats are responsible for about 25 to 30 percent of the environmental impact of meat consumption in the United States. That's equivalent to a year's worth of driving by 13.6 million cars. For pets that eat traditional kibble or wet food, that protein may come from meat byproducts—otherwise-wasted animal parts, such as organs and bones, not approved for human consumption. But an increasing number of pet owners are opting to feed their fur babies “human-grade” meat products, which requires additional resources and generates extra emissions.

After they eat, of course, they poop. A lot. At least for dogs, that poop typically gets bagged in plastic and sent to the landfill. And it turns out all the biodegradable poop bags I've diligently bought over the years don't help matters much; they also release greenhouse gases in landfills, and most composting programs don't accept pet waste.

With more dogs around than ever before—the US dog population has steadily increased from 52.9 million in 1996 to a new peak of 89.7 million in 2024—their overall climate toll is more than a Chihuahua-sized issue. But pets are also more than just sources of carbon pollution. According to a 2023 Pew Research poll, 97 percent of owners say they consider their pets to be part of their families, with 51 percent of respondents saying they are on the same level as a human family member. So whenever their climate impact crops up in the discourse, as it has periodically, it makes sense that people tend to get defensive.

This don't-you-dare-take-away-my-dog-you-horrible-environmentalist backlash is certainly not the first time the climate movement has been accused of depriving people of the things they love. Climate policy has long been painted as a force for austerity, coming for your burgers, your gas stoves, your coal-mining jobs. That framing has been politically potent, used by fossil fuel interests and their allies to stoke resentment and delay government action. Big Oil at once wants us to believe that the climate crisis is our fault and that we shouldn't have to give up anything to fix it.

For some climate advocates, the solution has been to shift messaging away from individual responsibility and focus instead on big, systemic changes like overhauling our electricity and transit systems through governmental investment in clean energy. In her essay “I work in the environmental movement. I don't care if you recycle,” author and podcaster Mary Annaïse Heglar wrote: “The belief that this enormous, existential problem could have been fixed if all of us had just tweaked our consumptive habits is not only preposterous; it's dangerous … It's victim blaming, plain and simple.”

Heglar and others have taken a strong stance against environmental purity—the idea that you can't care about or advocate for systems-level change if you aren't first changing your own habits. But not everyone agrees that individual actions should be completely deemphasized in the climate conversation. Kimberly Nicholas, a climate scientist and author of the popular book Under the Sky We Make, has argued that wealthy people living in wealthy countries—and globally, “wealthy” is a lower bar than you might think—do have a responsibility to slash their outsize carbon emissions. And particularly for those of us living in democracies, personal action isn't just about the choices we make as consumers.

“There's still an ongoing tension between personal and system change, or individual and collective action,” Nicholas said. “It's really hard to get that right—to get the right balance there that acknowledges the role and the importance of both, and to talk about and study and describe both in a way that motivates people to take high-impact actions.”

Goldwert saw that tension play out in her maligned climate communications study. In the experiment, participants reviewed 21 individual climate actions (like eating less meat) and five systemic actions (like voting) and rated their commitments to taking each action. Two test groups then received clarifying information about the relative impact of the 21 individual actions—one group was asked to estimate their ranking before learning how they actually ranked, the other group received the information straight-up. But participants didn't receive any data about the carbon-mitigation potential of the five collective actions, which would be far more difficult to quantify.

What Goldwert's team found surprised them: The teachings did nudge people toward higher-impact personal actions, but their stated likelihood of engaging in collective ones actually went down—a backfire effect that hints at the perils of focusing too much on personal lifestyle choices.

“It might be kind of like a mental substitution,” Goldwert said. “People feel like, ‘OK, I've done my part individually. I kind of checked the box on climate action.'”

Participants were also asked to rate the “plasticity” of each of the actions, or how easy it would be to adopt. And those measurements revealed another nuance in how people view different forms of climate action. For the individual-focused options, participants were more likely to commit to actions they saw as requiring little effort. For the systemic actions, they were more interested in whether it would have an impact—something researchers are still working on quantifying.

“If you think voting or marching is just symbolic or ineffective, you're not going to engage,” Goldwert said. “We have to show people evidence that their voice or their vote can shift policy, corporate practices, or social norms.”

I, for one, was surprised to see that participants rated the commitment to “not purchase or adopt a dog” as easy. When I asked Goldwert what might be behind that, she noted that dog ownership is a decision people don't make very often. It also doesn't require any action at all for people who already don't own dogs. The results surely would have been different if the listed action was “get rid of your existing dog.” (Which it was not—a point that readers seemed to miss, based on Reddit comments about the study and the “crazy emails” Goldwert said she received.)

Still, for an animal lover like me, the idea of never adopting another dog doesn't feel easy to commit to at all. It feels like an immense sacrifice. The sadness I feel at the thought of a future without dogs points me to another important factor when it comes to motivation for climate action: joy.

Loki in one of his most dramatic napping positions.

Actions we take to try to mitigate the climate crisis may be partially driven by how easy they are for us or how effective we believe them to be—but any choice we make is also driven by what we find joy in. It's an essential part of staying committed and resilient in the fight for a better future. In this way, carbon-intensive activities like dog ownership have value beyond their weight in emissions.

“People have an emotional attachment to the people and animals and creatures that we love,” Nicholas said. “And that is actually, I think, very powerful. We're not only going to solve climate change by lining up all the numbers—we certainly need to do that, but we have to tap into what people really care about and realize all those things are on the line and threatened by the amount of climate change we're heading for with current policies.”

Would I fight to ensure that dogs, like my beloved Loki, can continue wagging happily on this planet? Heck yes, I would. I've always felt that being a pet person goes hand-in-hand with a sense of altruism and responsibility. And if not giving up our pets means fighting climate change by voting, marching, donating, advocating, and consuming like our pets' lives depend on it, I think we can all get on board.

That might also mean adjusting our pets' diets. While making my dog a full vegetarian seems challenging (though technically possible), just cutting out beef has a significant impact—shifting to “lower-carbon meats” was even one of the high-impact actions included in Goldwert's study. That's one Loki can easily commit to. And we already buy insect-based treats, which leave a pungent odor in my pockets but seem to please his taste buds.

There are also ways that dog ownership intersects with other climate-related behaviors. Anecdotally, I would say I travel less because I have a dog whose care I need to think about. Walking him every day has also made me vastly more connected to my local environment, the goings-on in my neighborhood, and my neighbors themselves—all of which are important aspects of building climate resilience. Some dogs have even been trained to sniff out invasive species and help identify environmental contaminants. (Not Loki, who has never worked a day in his life.)

Though I'd never thought about it quite this way before I read Goldwert's study, the climate actions I take have a lot to do with the love I feel for Loki. Not because I want to leave a better world for him—I recognize the reality that I will almost certainly outlive him—but because my feelings for him bring me closer to the love I feel for all living things on this planet. This “ice age predator” who shares my home, as the anthropologist and comedian David Ian Howe puts it, is a living reminder of the relationship humans have with other species, going back many thousands of years.

As the saying goes, “Be the person your dog thinks you are.” And next time you get a little worked up about the realities of the climate crisis and your accountability within it, consider taking yourself on a walk.

For the first year of its life, the Ninja Slushi didn't go on sale much. Mostly what it did was sell out of stock—over and over and over.

But of course it did. The Ninja Slushi offers something that feels so rare these days: adult fun. It was the first device that really brought the bar slushie machine into the American home kitchen. It basically just takes whatever flavors you already have on hand and makes it into the kind of boozy slushie that would be sold at the 7-Elevens in heaven.

Anyway, it's now on a hefty sale—matching its lowest price for the full-time machine since it first went on sale in July 2024, then sold out almost instantaneously. On Amazon and the Ninja site, the Slushi is on sale for just $270, just in time for holiday gifts and holiday parties.

I can attest to enjoying the Ninja Slushi immensely. I have made cold-brew slushie lattes, mimosa slushies, frosé slushies, daiquiri and margarita slushies, sour-beer slushies, Mike's Hard Mango Lemonade Slushies, and of course slushies made with fruit juice and simple syrup for parties full of children. All things cold and sweet are delicious.

The Ninja Slushi was discounted to $300 as recently as October. At the time, this was the lowest I expected to see the price fall this year. Glad to be wrong, I guess. (But note that the smaller, Walmart-exclusive, 72-ounce Ninja Slushi machine is on sale for $250, a price it's seen multiple times since last year.)

Discounts often come when brands release next-generation devices. And in late October, Ninja released a big-boi update to the Slushi. The Slushi Max XXL is named a bit like an energy drink and holds a whopping 150 fluid ounces—making it the likely choice for frat houses and patio parties next year. We haven't tested it yet, but Ninja promises that the larger capacity also comes with faster freezing to keep pace.

The Ninja Slushi Max, too, is on a steep sale. If you go to the Ninja site, you can get the new, larger device for just $350; same as the regular asking price for the smaller Ninja.

The Amazon price is a little bit higher on the Slushi Max XXL, at least for now—though Ninja has a cascade of overlapping sales before and during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so don't expect this price to remain wholly stable.

Either way, cheap slushies for everyone.

The recent announcement from Valve of a new slate of hardware products has excited players, but while a revamped Steam Controller and an updated virtual reality headset, the Steam Frame, have drawn plenty of attention, the biggest buzz is around the new generation of Steam Machines.

Designed to sit under your TV as comfortably as it would under a monitor, these are micro PCs—but only because Valve seems shy of branding them consoles.

The new Steam Machines are Valve's second attempt at launching a dedicated device to bring the PC into the living room. The first generation Steam Machines launched a decade ago, in November 2015, and while that iteration ultimately flopped, the marketplace in 2025 is much different.

The Steam Deck has been a huge success, inspiring a whole fleet of gaming handhelds—with even Xbox joining the party—and PC gaming as a whole is in a much stronger position.

So, when the announcement video for this new product family went to great lengths to explain that the new Steam Machine is still a PC and not a console, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise. Valve makes and sells PC games; here's a PC to play those games on. Except … c'mon, look at it: in every way that counts, the new Steam Machine effectively is a console—and that's no bad thing.

Pop quiz: what defines a games console? Traditionally, they've been devices manufactured by a single company, with a uniform hardware design, intended to play games developed specifically for that machine, most commonly on a big screen television.

The benefits include fixed specifications meaning developers know exactly what they're building games for, and buyers knowing that any game they buy for that system will run (catastrophic bugs aside, of course). Roughly every half-decade, they might buy a new generation model.

What then defines a PC, gaming or otherwise? Almost the opposite—a typically desk-bound rig, built from whatever parts the user fancies, and when they need a bit more power, they can swap out the graphics card, or RAM, or even core CPU rather than buying a whole new rig. PC gamers aren't beholden to a particular storefront to get their games, allowing them to shop around for better prices. The downside is that having no fixed specs invites bugs or crashes if some combo of parts doesn't like each other—and even a single component can be thousands of dollars.

However, the line between the two camps has been blurring for years at this point, if not decades. Take game sales—physical game releases on PC are so vanishingly rare as to effectively no longer exist, but even console players barely purchase real-world copies nowadays.

Industry analyst Mat Piscatella highlighted in January 2025 that, as of 2024, physical video game sales in the US have halved since 2021 alone, and are at “more than 85 percent below its 2008 peak.” If players on PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch are predominantly buying their games through their respective digital stores, they're already in the same habit as PC gamers. The only difference is the walled ecosystem of each platform, but even there, crossbuy and crossplay offers help mitigate that somewhat—I've personally been hopping between Switch 2 and PC for Hades II sessions of late.

Meanwhile, although PC players aren't locked into a single digital store connected to their hardware, Steam has such dominance in the sector (its market share hovers around 75 percent, and GamesIndustry.biz found that 72 percent of game developers think Steam has an effective monopoly) that most players aren't looking elsewhere for their games. The convenience of having a massive library in one place keeps them loyal, just like console players.

Then there's the hardware side. The PC's modularity is still a big selling point, but no longer an entirely unique one. Compare to PS5: off the shelf, it's already available in a few form factors, allowing buyers to choose how much storage they want to start with, or whether to go straight for the all-powerful PS5 Pro. You could get a basic digital Slim PS5 and then later upgrade the SSD or bolt on a disc drive for physical games and 4K Blu-ray. Not quite the same as being able to swap around every PC component like Lego bricks, but it shows consumers are more familiar than ever with being able to tweak their consoles.

Back to the new Steam Machine itself, then. As announced, it's an unusually static piece of hardware for a PC. Valve promises a device capable of delivering ""4K gaming at 60 FPS with FSR""—an upscaling algorithm—""thanks to a discrete semi-custom AMD desktop class CPU and GPU,"" which doesn't sound like users will be upgrading it after a few years.

It's set to offer two internal storage capacities, with 512GB or 2TB SSDs, with storage further expandable via microSD. Valve seems to be approaching the external storage format as a glorified game cartridge, as players will be able to move a single card between Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Deck. That also indicates that current gen SDXC format cards will be usable, rather than requiring the newer, faster microSD Express format that the Switch 2 does to run games.

It also features 16GB DDR5 RAM, 8GB GDDR6 VRAM, a host of input/output options—DisplayPort 1.4. HDMI 2.0. One USB-C and four USB-A ports—and crams even its power supply into “a roughly 6-inch cube.” That's about the size of Nintendo's classic GameCube, or half an Xbox Series X. It's cute! If you want to make it cuter, you can swap out the front face plate (not unlike the range of cosmetic PS5 shells, hmm …).

That's all a far cry from the original Steam Machines, which stood out by not having a specific form factor. The Valve of 2015 instead set a minimum spec that any manufacturer could meet to label a device as a Steam Machine, a degree of confusion that no doubt hurt its wider adoption. The new generation is 100 percent a Valve product.

About the only commonality is that both generations have been designed around using SteamOS to navigate your game library (it's set to run KDE Plasma for its desktop environment). Valve adds that it is expanding its ""Deck Verified"" program, which certifies games as being compatible with the handheld Steam Deck, ""to include ratings for Steam Machine, so customers can understand how their games will run.""

So. A gaming PC that seems to offer only minimal hardware customization options, in a fixed form factor, produced by one manufacturer, with games designed to run on it. You know what that looks a lot like? A console. And that should be celebrated.

It's easy to understand why Valve may not want to embrace the ""console"" label for Steam Machine. As arguably the biggest driving force in PC gaming, it'd practically be tearing up its own street cred to do so.

However, consoles remain popular precisely because of their comparative limits—for many players, being able to plug a box into their TV and enjoy games on a couch is just a nicer way to play. It's more sociable, too, especially for local co-op games. Even hooking my gaming laptop up to a TV to play PC games with friends is more of a faff than turning on a console. Plus, given the extraordinary volume of games released on Steam—more than 18,500 in 2024—why wouldn't you want to make them more comfortable and accessible?

Valve is even leaning into the living-room setup with the updated Steam Controller, which will be able to wake the Steam Machine from sleep. Up to four controllers can be wirelessly paired with a Steam Machine, too, just like every other console presently on the market.

Meanwhile, SteamOS has been refined over the years, and now its ""Big Picture Mode"" feels a lot like using PlayStation or Xbox's core interfaces. I'd actually argue it's better, lacking the ads and extra services those platforms constantly push, simply giving players a clean, bold view of their game libraries and a store to browse. Although Valve stresses that you can “install your own apps, or even another operating system,” I'd be quietly amazed if many buyers end up taking that latter option. Installing a media server under the SteamOS hood is perhaps more likely, I'd wager.

Of course, I may eat crow on all this once the new Steam Machine's launch in 2026. Maybe you will be able to somehow squeeze in a beefier graphics card, or dock one externally to give the base hardware a boost. Perhaps that “semi-custom AMD desktop class CPU and GPU” chipset will be upgradeable. I'd actually be surprised if the internal storage isn't replaceable, since you can already do that on Steam Deck (even though it requires quite a bit of tinkering). Maybe people will install their own OS en masse on it, perhaps to escape the increasingly AI-infested world of Windows.

Mainly, though, I foresee the vast majority of people who pick up a Steam Machine using it exactly as they would any other console—plugging it in, picking up a controller, kicking back, and enjoying games on in the living room. What could be better?

This week on the GeekWire Podcast: Jeff Bezos is back in startup mode (sort of) with Project Prometheus — a $6.2 billion AI-for-the-physical-world venture that instantly became one of the most talked-about new companies in tech. We dig into what this really means, why the company's location is still a mystery, and how this echoes the era when Bezos was regularly launching big bets from Seattle.

Then we look at Amazon's latest real-world experiment: package-return kiosks popping up inside Goodwill stores around the Seattle region. It's a small pilot, but it brings back memories of the early days when Amazon's oddball experiments seemed to appear out of nowhere.

And finally…Todd tries to justify his scheme to upgrade his beloved 2007 Toyota Camry with CarPlay, Android Auto, and a backup camera — while John questions the logic of sinking thousands of dollars into an old car.

Byju Raveendran, the embattled founder of Indian ed-tech giant Byju's, has blasted a U.S. bankruptcy court's order directing him to pay more than $1.07 billion. He is denying wrongdoing, accusing lenders of misleading the court, and vowing to appeal a ruling that marks a dramatic fall for a onetime poster boy of India's startup boom.

The Delaware bankruptcy judge issued a default judgment after finding that Raveendran had repeatedly ignored court orders and provided “evasive, incomplete” responses regarding about $533 million that Byju's U.S. unit allegedly transferred in 2022 and never recovered. The judge also cited issues with a separate limited-partnership stake later valued at roughly $540.6 million. The ruling, dated November 20, stems from legal action by lenders seeking to claw back funds linked to the $1.2 billion term loan they extended to the ed-tech startup in 2021.

Earlier this year, in April, a group of U.S. lenders led by GLAS Trust sued Raveendran and his wife, Byju's co-founder Divya Gokulnath, in the Delaware bankruptcy court over the missing $533 million in loan proceeds. The couple denied wrongdoing at the time and accused lenders of attempting a hostile takeover of the company. They later said they planned to pursue a $2.5 billion lawsuit against GLAS Trust and others in India and other jurisdictions, though no such filing has publicly surfaced. This was in addition to the complaint Byju's filed in the New York Supreme Court challenging the acceleration of the term loan in 2023.

The court's latest order followed a September 29 hearing on the default request, where the judge cited a months-long pattern of noncompliance. The judge noted that Raveendran skipped hearings, missed extended deadlines, and ignored a prior contempt order imposing $10,000 in daily sanctions that remain unpaid.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon said the relief granted in the case was “extraordinary,” adding that “the circumstances of this case are, frankly, unique and unlike anything the undersigned has encountered before, thereby making such relief… richly warranted.” The judge has given the parties seven days to respond to the ruling.

“We consider that the U.S. Court erred in its judgment of this matter and will be filing the necessary appeals and other contestations related to this judgment and related orders,” said J. Michael McNutt, senior litigation advisor at Lazareff Le Bars, representing Raveendran, in a prepared statement to TechCrunch. “The court, in our view, ignored relevant facts.”

Raveendran's legal counsel argued that the court issued the judgment without giving him an opportunity to present a defense and instead relied on an earlier contempt order. The counsel also argued that the ruling failed to acknowledge that GLAS Trust was aware the Alpha loan funds were not used for the personal benefit of Raveendran or other founders but rather for Think & Learn, the startup's parent company, the counsel said.

The counsel said Byju's founders are preparing claims against GLAS Trust and others in multiple jurisdictions, expected to seek at least $2.5 billion in damages and, absent a settlement, to be filed before the end of 2025.

Nonetheless, the default judgment marks a stunning fall for Raveendran and his eponymous company, once India's most valuable startup with a $22 billion valuation and backed by global investors including Tiger Global, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Prosus. The company is now mired in lawsuits, funding droughts, mass layoffs, and a battle for control as lenders and creditors race to recover what they can.

Raveendran previously challenged the Delaware court's jurisdiction, but the judge rejected that argument in an earlier ruling, writing that “Raveendran's conduct that gives rise to the litigation here relates to his activities … in the United States fundraising and serving as a director, officer, or manager of a United States corporation.”

Earlier this week, a filing in the Delaware bankruptcy case alleged that most of the $533 million missing from Byju's U.S. unit, Alpha, was “round-tripped back to Byju Raveendran and associates.” In a response, Raveendran denied the allegation, saying the funds were not used for personal gain.

Meanwhile in India, Byju's is undergoing a court-supervised sale process after insolvency proceedings began last year, with early bidders including Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG) and Ronnie Screwvala's UpGrad.

Conventional wisdom suggests that climate tech is entering a winter season, where political and investor interest and investment levels are cooling — an ironic contrast with the climate itself, which keeps delivering years of record warmth. 

A new report from the International Energy Agency suggests there has never been a better time to go all-in on climate tech. In comparing it with the IEA's stance from a decade ago, it's clear the world's expectations about the future have changed dramatically in less than a generation. 

In 2014, the International Energy Agency assumed that, absent any international effort to rein in carbon pollution, emissions would continue to go up and to the right. Even the most optimistic forecast at the time predicted a linear increase, just with a lower slope. Those scenarios essentially took the trend line from the previous few years and extended it through 2050.

Fast forward to today, and the IEA's current worst-case scenario is essentially 2014's best case. A decade ago, without any major changes, the world was headed toward 46 metric gigatons of CO2 per year by 2040. If countries cut emissions as they had pledged, the best we could have hoped for was 38 metric gigatons per year by 2040.

Today, if countries continue with business as usual, the IEA expects emissions will level off at 38 metric gigatons per year. If countries follow through on their pledges, the IEA suggests we'll hit about 33 metric gigatons per year by 2040. It's still far off from what's needed to hit net zero by 2050, but it's a significant shift in a short amount of time.

If the IEA's earlier projections turned out to be overly pessimistic compared with where we are today, what does that say about today's projections?

How you answer that question depends on how you interpret trend lines. 

When forecasting the future, do you analyze today's data? Or do you look at that data in conjunction with how our expectations about the future have changed over time? (An even nerdier way to look at it is, do you view the world through a lens of algebra or calculus?)

Put another way, will the world hit net zero in 2050? Today's trend lines suggest we'll miss that target by a wide margin. But if you look at how expectations have changed over the last decade, you might come up with a different answer. Instead, you might think the rate of change has increased, that we might be in the middle of an inflection point that starts to bend global emissions downward.

There are a few recent anecdotes to support the idea that we're at an inflection point. 

In Germany, sales of electric vehicles have set new records even after the government repealed incentives in 2023. In developing countries, renewables are reshaping the economies of developing countries, which were long thought to be among the last to adopt clean power. And China, which had previously refused to commit to reducing its carbon emissions, has now said its emissions will peak before 2030. 

How the world views the future of carbon emissions has changed significantly over the past decade. A range of technologies have made that happen, including cheap solar and wind power paired with inexpensive batteries. 

In the near future, geothermal energy and grid-optimizing software could propel the next leaps in optimism. For investors who agree, the upside could be dramatic.

For many climate tech investors, these days probably feel pretty gloomy. But amidst the gloom, there are still bright patches to be found.

Thomas Lee Young doesn't sound like your typical Silicon Valley founder.

The 24-year-old CEO of Interface, a San Francisco startup using AI to prevent industrial accidents, is a white guy with a Caribbean accent and a Chinese last name, a combination he finds amusing enough to mention when he's first introduced to business contacts. Born and raised in Trinidad and Tobago, the site of substantial oil and gas exploration activity, Young grew up around oil rigs and energy infrastructure because his entire family worked as engineers, stretching back generations to his great-grandfather, who immigrated to the island nation from China.

That background has become his calling card in pitch meetings with oil and gas executives today, but it makes for more than a great conversation starter; it underscores a path that has been anything but straightforward and that Young might argue gives Interface an edge.

It was years in the making. From age 11, Young fixated on Caltech with the intensity of someone much older. He watched shows about Silicon Valley online, mesmerized by the idea that people could build “anything and everything” in America. He did everything possible to secure admission, even writing his application essay about hijacking his family's Roomba to create 3D spatial maps of his house.

The ploy worked – Caltech accepted him in 2020 – but then COVID-19 hit, and so did its ripple effects. For one thing, Young's visa situation became nearly impossible (visa appointments were cancelled and processing came to a halt). At the same time, his college fund, carefully built over six or seven years to $350,000 to cover his education, “basically got hit entirely” by the abrupt market downturn in March of that year.

Without a lot of time to decide his future, he chose a cheaper three-year engineering program at the University of Bristol in the UK, studying mechanical engineering, but never abandoning his Silicon Valley dreams. “I was devastated,” he says, “but I realized I could still get something done.”

At Bristol, Young landed at Jaguar Land Rover, working in something called human factors engineering – essentially the UX and safety design of industrial systems. “I had never heard of it before I even joined,” he admits. The role involved figuring out how to make cars and manufacturing lines as safe as possible, ensuring they were “dummy proof” for smooth operations.

It was there, inside heavy industry, that Young saw the problem that would become Interface. He says the tools many companies use to manage safety documentation are either nonexistent – pen and paper – or so siloed and poorly designed that workers hate them. Worse, the operating procedures themselves — the instruction manuals and checklists that blue-collar workers rely on to stay safe — are riddled with errors, outdated, and nearly impossible to maintain.

Young pitched Jaguar on letting him build a solution, but the company wasn't interested. So he started plotting his exit. When he learned about Entrepreneur First (EF), a European talent incubator that recruits promising individuals before they have a co-founder or even an idea, he cold applied despite its 1% acceptance rate. He was accepted to essentially pitch himself.

He told Jaguar he was going to a wedding in Trinidad and would be away for a week. Instead, he went to EF's selection process, impressed the organizers, and the day he returned to the office, quit. “They realized, ‘Oh, so you probably weren't at a wedding,'” he laughs.

At EF, Young met Aaryan Mehta, his future co-founder and CTO. Mehta, of Indian descent but born in Belgium, had his own thwarted American dream. He'd been accepted to both Georgia Tech and Penn but similarly couldn't get a visa appointment during COVID. He ended up studying math and computer science at Imperial College London, where he developed AI for fault detection before building machine learning pipelines at Amazon.

“We had similar backgrounds,” Young says. “He's super international. He speaks five languages, very technical, amazing guy, and we got along very well.” In fact, they were the only team in their EF cohort not to break up, says Young.

More than that, today, they live together in San Francisco's SoMa neighborhood, though asked about spending so much time together, Young is adamant that that's not an issue given their respective workloads. “Over the last week, I've seen [Aaryan] at home for maybe a combined total of 30 minutes.”

As for what, exactly, they are building, Interface's pitch is straightforward: use AI to make heavy industry safer. The company autonomously audits operating procedures using large language models, cross-checking them against regulations, technical drawings, and corporate policies to catch errors that could – in a worst-case scenario – get workers killed.

Some of the numbers are arresting. For one of Canada's largest energy companies, where Interface is now deployed across three sites (Young declines to name the brand), Interface's software found 10,800 errors and improvements across the company's standard operating procedures in just two and a half months. As Young tells it, the same work done manually would have cost more than $35 million and taken two to three years.

One error Young found particularly troubling, he says, was a document that had been in circulation for 10 years with the wrong pressure range listed for a valve. “They're just lucky that nothing happened,” says Medha Agarwal, a partner at Defy.vc, which led Interface's $3.5 million seed round earlier this year, with participation from Precursor Ventures, Rockyard Ventures, and angel investors, including Charlie Songhurst.

The contracts are considerable. After initially trying outcome-based pricing (the energy company “hated it,” Young says), Interface adopted a hybrid per-seat model with overage costs. A single contract with the Canadian energy company is worth more than $2.5 million annually, and Interface has more fuel and oil services customers coming online in Houston, Guyana, and Brazil.

The total addressable market isn't entirely clear, but it's not small. In the U.S. alone, there are something like 27,000 oil and gas services companies, per the market research outfit IBISWorld, and that's just the first vertical that Interface wants to tackle.

The outsider's edge

Interestingly, Young's age and background – things that might seem like disadvantages when it comes to more established industries – have become his secret weapons. When he walks into a room of executives twice or three times his age, he says, there's initial skepticism. “Who the hell is this young guy and how does he know what he's talking about?”

But then, he says, he delivers his “wow moment,” by explaining an understanding of their operations, their workers' daily routines, and exactly how much time and money Interface can save them. “Once you can flip them, they will absolutely love you and advocate and fight for you,” he says. (He claims that after a recent, first site visit with operators, five workers asked when they could invest in Interface, which made him particularly proud, given the field workers typically “hate software providers.”)

Indeed, though Young works from Interface's office in San Francisco's Financial District, his hard hat sits on a table not far from his desk, ready for the next site visit. (Agarwal suggests Young could use a little more down time in his life, recalling a recent call where Young told her that he hadn't seen the sun all day.)

The company now has eight employees – five in the office, three remote – mostly engineering hires, plus an operations person who started just this week. Interface's biggest challenge is hiring fast enough to keep up with demand, a problem that requires its small team to tap networks across both Europe and the US.

As for what Young makes of the life in San Francisco he wanted and is now living, he marvels at how accurate the Silicon Valley stereotypes turned out to be. “You see people online talking about, ‘Oh, you go to a park and the person sitting next to you has raised $50 million building some insane AI agent.' But it is actually like that,” he says. “I think back to what life was like in Trinidad. I mention these ideas to people back home, and they just don't believe me.”

He occasionally makes time to go out in nature with friends – he says they went to Tahoe recently – and Interface hosts events like a hackathon they threw last weekend. But mostly, it's work, and most of that work involves AI, just like everyone else's in San Francisco right now.

Which makes the trips to oil rigs oddly appealing.

Indeed, that hard hat at the office isn't just a practical necessity; it's also a lure, suggests Young. For engineers tired of building “some low-impact B2B sales or recruiting tool,” as Young puts it, the promise of occasionally leaving the Bay Area bubble to work with operators in the field has become a recruiting advantage. Less than 1% of San Francisco startups work in heavy industry, he notes, and that scarcity is part of the appeal, for him and for the people he's hiring.

It's probably not quite the version of the Silicon Valley dream he spent his childhood chasing from Trinidad: long hours, intense pressure, endless AI discussions everywhere, punctuated by the occasional trip to an oil rig.

Still, for now, he doesn't seem to mind it. “Over the last month or two months, I have not done much at all [outside the office], because there's just been so much intensity here, with building, hiring, selling.” But “I feel pretty strong,” he adds.

Threads and Bluesky still have quite a way to go to catch up with X in the U.S., according to data from Pew Research Center's latest report released this week. 

The research firm asked about these smaller services for the first time and found they're each used by just under 1 in 10 U.S. adults or fewer.

While X is not one of the largest social networks in the U.S., it's still the one to beat within the smaller market of social apps that focus on short, real-time text posts that appear in a vertical feed.

This space has seen increased competition since Elon Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it as X in October 2022, as Musk's changes to the platform's content moderation policies and the site's rightward political shift sent some users looking for alternatives.

In addition to the growth seen by decentralized, open source networks like Mastodon and Bluesky, other startups launched would-be Twitter rivals like Spill, Post, T2 (Pebble), and Hive. Many of these have since shut down, however.

Pew's data indicates how hard X's grip on the market remains. 

Even Meta, with all its resources and platform power, hasn't yet been able to beat X with its competitor, Threads, the report found.

According to Pew, 21% of U.S. adults said they have used X, compared with only 8% who have used Threads, and 4% who have used Bluesky. Truth Social, meanwhile,  had attracted 3% of U.S. adults.

Despite this competition, X hasn't seen much of a slip in usage over the years, according to the report. For instance, Pew's report on U.S. adults' social media use published at the beginning of last year found that X was then used by 22% of U.S. adults. Its 2021 report showed Twitter (before its rebranding to X) was used by 23% of U.S. adults.

In other words, if X is declining, it's been a long, slow drop. 

This year's report also found that YouTube and Facebook continue to be the most widely used platforms by U.S. adults, with 84% and 71% saying they used them, respectively. 

Meanwhile, 50% of U.S. adults said they used Instagram, 37% used TikTok, 32% used WhatsApp, 26% used Reddit, and 25% used Snapchat.

Many of these services have seen their adoption grow over time, Pew noted. TikTok is up from 21% in 2021, and Instagram, now used by half of U.S. adults, is up from 40% in 2021. Around a third of adults now use WhatsApp, up from 23% in 2021.

Reddit, which has become a darling of the AI era thanks to numerous content licensing deals, was used by only 18% of U.S. adults in 2021, compared with 26% today.

Of course, all these figures look very different from U.S. teens' social media use, where YouTube remains No. 1, but is then followed by a different set of top apps, including TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat.

> The trio published their first study in 2005, and the results were damning. Shifting to universal child care appeared to lead to a rise in aggression, anxiety and hyperactivity among Quebecer children, as well as a fall in motor and social skills. The effects were large: anxiety rates doubled; roughly a third more kids were reported to be hyperactive. Indeed, the difference in hyperactivity rates was larger than is typically reported between boys and girls.They basically make the case that childcare is extremely difficult and requires a lot of attentive care, which is hard to scale up in a universal way.[1] https://archive.is/ScFRX

1. any universal childcare scheme will involve groups larger than the median at-home familial group. Avery is watching ~1-2 kids, but if those kids are at creche, they are in a group of (say) ~4-5.2. In much of the country, a) is financially out of reach for many couples due to cost of living generally being based around two-income households.

Part of the reason it's not included in GDP is just that it's not reliable to measure precisely so it's not as valuable as a statistic for making monetary and fiscal policy decisions.

In scenario A, the labor of watching the kids is untaxed.In Scenario B is Avery watches many kids and the effort per kid is reduced, but you get taxed.

I mean what, 10ish% of our entire GDP in the US, and IIRC that's generously low, is being throwing in a fire from excessive spending on healthcare for effectively no actual benefit, versus peer states. And that's just one fake-productivity issue (though one that affects the US more than most). But our GDP would drop if we fixed that!

Spending on childcare means we need to offset those debts with other revenues.We have close to full employment, so I'd argue that freeing up labor isn't as strategic as other categories of spending.It all depends on what you want to prioritize. For the long term health of the nation, these areas seem key for continued economic resiliency:- pay down the debt so it doesn't spiral out of control (lots of strategies here, some good, some bad: higher taxes, lower spending, wanton imperialism, inflation, etc.)- remain competitive in key industries, including some catch-up: robotics, batteries, solar, chip manufacture- if we're going for a multipolar world / self-sufficiency play, we need to rebuild the supply chain by onshoring and friendshoring. This means the boring stuff too, like plastics and pharmaceutical inputs.- lots of energy expansion and infrastructure

If the economy stops growing, or worse, degrades, everyone will suffer incredibly. Job loss, investment loss, higher cost of living.There's a wide gulf between childcare for none and childcare for all.I'm an atheist, but some of the cheapest childcare is at churches. Orders of magnitude cheaper than private childcare because they already have the infrastructure for it. I've had affluent people turn their nose at the idea of Christians watching their kids. But there are entirely affordable options if you're not being choosey.

A lot of the UBI trials have actually had disappointing results. The arguments usually claim that it's not a valid test because it wasn't guaranteed for life, or the goalposts move to claim that UBI shouldn't be about anything other than improving safety nets.Unfortunately I think the UBI that many people imagine is a lot higher than any UBI that would be mathematically feasible. Any UBI system that provided even poverty level wages would require significant tax increases to pay for it, far beyond what you could collect from the stereotypical “just tax billionaires” ideal. Try multiplying the population of the US by poverty level annual income and you'll see that the sum total is a huge number. In practice, anyone starting a business would probably end up paying more in taxes under a UBI scheme than they'd collect from the UBI payments.

Or cutting other things to pay for it, in addition to smaller tax increases. And the costs go down once it's bootstrapped long enough to obtain the long-term economic benefits that grow the economy (which will take a while to materialize).Honestly, my biggest concern with it is that people will (rightfully) worry that it won't last more than 4-8 years because the subsequent administration will attack it with everything they have, and thus treat it as temporary.

Americans really should be asking why we're paying a significantly higher tax burden than New Zealand and not getting similar services as part of the bargain.Put another way: the US is incredibly rich compared to other countries. Our poorest states have higher GDP per capita than most rich countries. And our taxes are not particularly low. Our social issues are 100% about how we choose to allocate our shared resources. The good thing is we can always choose to make different choices.

It's complicated. Having 1% fraudulent recipients despite having very thorough and deep vetting processes should be a clue that fraud is a big problem.The fallacy is assuming that the fraud rate would stay the same if we removed the checks. It would not. The 1% fraud rate is only what gets through the current checks. The more you remove the checks, the higher the fraud rate.When systems remove all fraud checks, the amount of fraud is hard to fathom if you've never been on the side of a fraud detection effort.

I'm actually wondering if the program will make a big dent though. One issue with formal childcare arrangements is that the hours tend to not be flexible. Parents who have to work til 6 some nights, or who have nontraditional work schedules in general may not be better served by the state's option.

reply

Also, I'm not even against state support for parents needing childcare, but giving $500 a month to each parent who needs it to find childcare in an informal system will actually be much better than a state run system that spends $2000 per kid.

OTOH, very few children have enough individual income to be disqualified from Medicaid, but it's based on household income.My handwavey plan for universal federalized healthcare includes using the child's income as a qualifier for Medicaid, phased in so the system will hopefully adjust over time rather than get overloaded to collapse. Also reduce the Medicare eligibility age over time. A solution that takes decades to roll out leaves a lot of unsolved problems, but adding a large number of people to an existing program in one fell swoop feels like it's going to be a negative too.

Of course, nothing is truly “free.” It comes at a significant cost that must be carefully understood and balanced for the future. It hinders market dynamism and credit flow, which can easily stifle innovation over time. Calling it “free” is a mere emotional appeal, not a rational justification for its long-term sustainability. It's no wonder that business in Europe, despite being more regulated and restrained than any other part of the world, is so vilified by the youth. We must stop conflating prosperity with corporate misgivings if we are to progress at all.

reply

The second aspect to this is that specifically when it comes to economics the timescales needed to understand the impact of a policy are generally longer than the collective memory of the people. Politicians inevitably sell and enact good intentions, but by the time the reality of the consequences from those intentions becomes manifest it will be years or decades later and the causal relationship is masked and the politician will generally be long gone. At that point it just looks like a new problem that similarly needs a “solution”.

This problem is most obvious in UBI discussions. Anyone could use Google to look up the US population and multiply it by their imagined UBI payment amount to see how much it would cost. Yet 9 times out of 10 when I hear someone talking about UBI they have some fanciful ideas about everyone getting $30-40K per year without realizing that the total cost of such a program would be far higher than even our total tax revenues currently. Even if you cut all other social programs and only offered UBI it wouldn't make a difference. A UBI program that writes large checks to everyone would require tax increases that reached into the middle class.

reply

I disagree that it's a recipe for disaster - there are many valid kinds of holistic experiences of how a product is priced / sold, that don't change the positivist economics of what is happening.As long as childcare is economically positive, I think it is, it doesn't really matter whatever you call it. And perhaps, it's free in a way that matters most: redistribution from the very rich, that makes more customers with bigger budgets to spend on shit made by the firms they own.

The definition of habitat loss here is a bit poor because it doesn't mention the main contributor: farm land which over the past century got changed from something where insects could still survive to something which is more of a barren wasteland to them. And the thrid factor which goes hand in hand with that is pesticide use.In many areas things have gone in the opposite direction.Could be, but I'm pretty sure globally there are more areas where it is not going in that direction though.

It's not because one specific area has been properly restored that insects would suddenly go there from surrounding areas, let alone that from the restored areas they then would suddenly have colonized neighboring areas (the entire east coast as you mention). Mainly because the speed at which they can colonize is limited and insects bound to forests don't necessarily all survive in other types of habitats.

What I suspect is driving it is actually pavement and development ready property. The footprint for pavement for a building is usually three times the footprint for the building itself. This includes parking lots, connecting roads, sidewalks, and even the concrete slabs needed to place things like air conditioning units or tall signage. That pavement denies undergrowth and pioneer species that small insects thrive on seasonally.It also denies water runoff. Without the water being able to saturate the ground it gets redirected to elsewhere. There's several issues with that, including unnatural subsidence and runoff pollution. The ground has some ability to naturally filter out small amounts of pollution as water seeps down through the soil and to the water table. But if there's pavement all of that water torrents to a single area which gets oversaturated. The soil can't hold any more, and so the water is rejected and pools above the surface. This is why you see so many puddles at the edges of parking lots or road intersections. This allows the pollutants to concentrate, and when the ground finally does absorb the excess water it pulls in those pollutants all the way down to the water table as they're in too high a concentration for the soil to capture.And development ready property is an actual serious problem. Companies buy real estate and then deforest and regrade it in anticipation of someone eventually buying it. They don't have a buyer lined up, they're just expecting someone to eventually want to settle there, be it a business or a home. In the meantime they keep the land stripped, with no trees or shrubbery, no native plants, and sometimes without even grass. There are places I've seen that were turned into development ready property that have sat hollow and scarred for twenty years.Even in places where there's native plants, undergrowth, and pioneer species that overcome this, the continual removal of trees makes it almost impossible for animals to stay there for long. Part of this is that with the heat island effect of nearby pavement you get constant blowing lateral winds. Winds which birds can't use as updrafts, winds which blow away rodent ground nests, and winds which scatter colonies of insects. But even if they survive all of that, the constant grooming of the land to keep it ""presentable"" means zero turn mowers rolling over all of that and destroying it, irrigation being dug that drains naturally forming ponds that house insects and amphibians, and the turfing that chokes out everything with fast growing non-native grasses.

It also denies water runoff. Without the water being able to saturate the ground it gets redirected to elsewhere. There's several issues with that, including unnatural subsidence and runoff pollution. The ground has some ability to naturally filter out small amounts of pollution as water seeps down through the soil and to the water table. But if there's pavement all of that water torrents to a single area which gets oversaturated. The soil can't hold any more, and so the water is rejected and pools above the surface. This is why you see so many puddles at the edges of parking lots or road intersections. This allows the pollutants to concentrate, and when the ground finally does absorb the excess water it pulls in those pollutants all the way down to the water table as they're in too high a concentration for the soil to capture.And development ready property is an actual serious problem. Companies buy real estate and then deforest and regrade it in anticipation of someone eventually buying it.

It used to be the case that rural areas were splintered into many small farms, with bushes being used to mark borders, and these bushes in turn provided harbor and food for insects and cover for small rodents and other mammals.""Thanks"" to mechanisation however, which prefers large uniform land because thats easier for ever larger machines to process, a lot of these splinters were consolidated together and so there is nothing left to support any wildlife, be it insects or small animals, which in turn also causes bird populations to drop - when there are no mice because they don't have any place to build their nests, the birds don't have food as well.[1] https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/news-and-events/news/detail/...[2] https://www.riffreporter.de/de/umwelt/flugbegleiter-umfrage-...[3] https://naturschutz-initiative.de/aktuell/neuigkeiten/landwi...

Now sure, the causes could be multipliers, insect_pop = base * (cause_0 * cause_1 * …), or even exponential, insect_pop = 1/e^(cause_0 + cause_1 + …), so I'm not saying none of that stuff matters, but also there's definitely something nee.

When governments do try to push and make it law to have X amount of bushes and unfarmed land in a way that makes sense for wildlife to thrive you instantly get angry farmers on your roads, lose their votes and get publicly accused to starve the nation.And farmers, due to the difficulty of their job (in time, investments and returns) and their role in a society's lifecycle get instant empathy.There's areas in Italy where farms have absolutely polluted water to insane level, and this further compounds with heavy pollution of drinkable water wells (which should always be at least 120 meters from the closest farm from what I know).Regular citizens, which end up getting heavily sick from all these farms (often in mortal ways) never get any kind of support as they lack the political and financial weight, and as soon as the argument scales, you're back at populist ""you want to starve our people and kill our economy"" arguments.I had a house in the country, by law there shouldn't be more than one chicken farm in a 4 miles radius, yet they built two in less than 2 miles, one of them 300 meters from my house. It literally smells in disgusting ways 24/7, from ammonia to rot I had to sell it for pennies (5'000 euros, renovated), as nobody but the farmers in the area had the slightest intention to moving to such a beautiful yet disgusting place. And I haven't even mentioned that to avoid having to bring the hundreds of dead animals to a registered incinerator (as the law requires) they just dig mass graves in 5 minutes and cover the entire land.Wildlife has absolutely disappeared.It's really a tough, tough political battle.Everything from agriculture to cattle to fishing is insanely polluting and bad for the environment, but the idea of really tracking and controlling how those industries operate is beyond naive. The labels on your tuna can saying it didn't kill dolphins are worthless, there's no way to check what happens on these boats, so are the labels for your coffee or cocoa not using child labor or your food being organic. It's all absolutely fake and a matter of money.

Here in the netherlands as soon as you try to do something, the farmers start flyingh upside down flags. I call them the 'head in the sand' flags since they stand for ignoring the problems.I fear the problem is just that the earth suffers from an infestation of humans and the equilibrium will be restored in the same way all infestations end. It won't be pretty (already isn't in lots of places).

The problem is... farmers are a pretty split bunch. On the one side you have the last few remaining small holdouts trying to make ends meet with a few dozen cows or so, they already get swamped in ever increasing bureaucracy, and on the other side you got the megafarms who not only have the benefits of scale available to them (in anywhere from machines to sheer purchase power for feedstock) but also got dedicated full time employees just taking care about getting government handouts.Of course the small ones get up in arms whenever anything changes, they don't have the capacity and resiliency left anymore.

Lake Issyk-Kul sits in the northeast of the Kyrgyz Republic, also known as Kyrgyzstan. It's the country's biggest lake and the second-largest high mountain lake in the world, and beneath its surface hides a centuries-old watery grave.

Researchers recently conducted an underwater archaeological expedition in Issyk-Kul's northwest to investigate the remains of a city that used to sit along the iconic Silk Road. The team found the remains of a medieval graveyard, ceramics, and various buildings, confirming the presence of the ancient settlement.

The site was “a city or a large commercial agglomeration on one of the important sections of the Silk Road,” Valery Kolchenko, a researcher at the Institute of History, Archeology, and Ethnology of the National Academy of Sciences of the Kyrgyz Republic who took part in the investigation, said in a statement by the Russian Geographical Society, which also contributed researchers to the project. “At the beginning of the 15th century, as a result of a terrible earthquake, the city went under the waters of the lake.”

Kolchenko compared the event to Pompeii, even though the settlement had already been abandoned by the time the earthquake struck. Still, the region's population changed dramatically after the event, with nomads replacing the rich medieval site, according to the researcher.

The archaeologists investigated four different areas of the lake. In the first spot, they discovered the brick buildings with a millstone, one of a pair that together would have ground grain into flour or grits. They also found evidence of a decorated social building, possibly a mosque, bathhouse, or madrasa (a Muslim educational institution). In a second area, Kolchenko and colleagues identified a 13th- to 14th-century Muslim necropolis, or burial ground. The documented skeletons faced north in the direction of Mecca, the holiest place in Islam, now in modern-day Saudi Arabia.

“In the 10th century, the Kara-Khanid State was formed on this land,” explained Maksim Menshikov, a researcher at the Institute of Archaeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences who also participated in the discoveries. They ruled the Issyk-Kul Lake area of the Silk Road.

“It was a Turkic dynasty. People here practiced various religions: pagan Tengrianism, Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity. The ruling elite often turned to Islam throughout their rule, but this religion became widespread in Central Asia only in the 13th century,” Menshikov added. “Prior to that, Islam was primarily the religion of the nobility and the population involved in active economic activity.” The recently discovered Muslim necropolis is likely associated with this period. Since the region is mentioned in medieval Chinese sources, the researchers hope to connect their findings with historical materials.

At a third location, the team identified three other likely earlier burials, medieval ceramics, and a large vessel. Because the vessel is buried deep under the lakebed, the team wasn't able to retrieve it and plans to try again next archaeological season. In the last site, the researchers investigated the remains of more structures and carried out underwater drilling to retrieve samples that will hopefully reveal the various phases of the settlement's transformation.

Kolchenko compares the site to Pompeii, but I think Central Asia has its very own Atlantis.

Are you curious about the recently released emails of Jeffrey Epstein but don't feel like clicking through thousands of cumbersome files? There's now a way to search Epstein's inbox in a much easier way. And it's both interesting and creepy at the same time.

It's called Jmail.world and it's a project by Riley Walz and Luke Igel. They've built a tool that might best be described as Jeffrey Epstein Inbox Simulator '25. At least that's how The Atlantic's Charlie Warzel puts it. And it feels like an apt description.

Basically it looks like Gmail and it has many of the same features. And while it's a clever way to present the tens of thousands of documents released by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, it's a very odd feeling to essentially be placed in the late sex trafficker's shoes.

“The problem was that the PDFs that the above pointed to were hard to read, so we felt putting it in a familiar form with shareable links and easy to screenshot views would be helpful for people. We also wanted to focus on just the emails in that drop,” Igel told Gizmodo over email.

Idel is the co-founder of Kino, an AI video assistant that allows users to index massive amounts of video. Idel says he previously worked at SpaceX, NASA, and was an undergrad at MIT. And he built this tool with Riley Walz, who has done a number of clever projects in the past.

“Riley and I knocked this out in a few hours Wednesday night using Cursor,” Igel told Gizmodo. “This is our first real coding project together! Riley has done so much amazing stuff like this in the past as you know.”

Igel tells Gizmodo it's “pretty much all” of the emails from the latest batch released by Congress. So while it's an interesting project, don't necessarily assume it's comprehensive. But it's still an interesting way to browse the inbox of a truly heinous man.

These emails aren't the “Epstein files” that everyone has been clamoring for over the past few years. Those are files still held by the Department of Justice, though Congress has passed a law requiring their release. The question is whether they'll ever see the light of day. President Trump ordered a new investigation into Epstein's ties to powerful Democrats so many people worry that DOJ will say they can't release any files because there's an ongoing investigation. But time will tell.

Following the success of New Glenn's second test flight, Blue Origin announced a super-heavy variant of its rocket that could compete with SpaceX's Starship.

Jeff Bezos' rocket company unveiled the new design for its rocket, named New Glenn 9×4 for the number of engines it boasts on the booster and upper stage. That's an increase of two engines for each stage from New Glenn's current design, which features seven engines on the booster and two on the upper stage.

“The next chapter in New Glenn's roadmap is a new super-heavy class rocket,” Blue Origin wrote in a statement. The company recently launched New Glenn for its second mission, sending NASA's ESCAPADE mission on its way to Mars. Although Blue Origin didn't specify when it would start launching the larger variant of New Glenn, the rocket has a packed schedule for 2026 and 2027.

Blue Origin debuted its New Glenn rocket in January after years of delays. The rocket's inaugural flight didn't go so smoothly, with the company failing to recover the booster during its descent. An investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration laid out seven corrective measures for the rocket to fly again, and its second mission was a major success for the company.

Now, Blue Origin is focusing on going bigger. Outfitted with nine engines on the booster and four on the upper stage, the added thrust will allow the new New Glenn to lift more than 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, over 14 metric tons directly to geosynchronous orbit, and over 20 metric tons to trans-lunar injection. That's way below Starship's capability of carrying up to 150 metric tons to low Earth orbit, but it's a powerful launch vehicle nonetheless.

The upgraded New Glenn will also feature a larger 28.5-foot (8.7-meter) fairing to allow for bigger payloads. “Both vehicles: 9×4 and our current variant, 7×2, will serve the market concurrently, giving customers more launch options for their missions, including mega-constellations, lunar and deep space exploration, and national security imperatives such as Golden Dome,” Blue Origin wrote.

Because you asked… pic.twitter.com/HRbQjRpHWC

Dave Limp, Blue Origin's CEO, posted an illustration of the upgraded New Glenn standing taller next to the Saturn V rocket that was used to launch astronauts to the Moon as part of NASA's Apollo program. New Glenn 9×4 also appears much larger than its predecessor.

The success of New Glenn's second flight proved the rocket's worthiness in the orbital launch game. With the super-heavy variant of its New Glenn rocket, Blue Origin will be able to compete with SpaceX on an even larger scale.

The Atari Gamestation Go works as intended. However, the unique built-in controls, including the paddle and trackball, would benefit vastly from user-configuration options. Some rendering issues I saw in classic vector games also take some shine off this handheld, which should be better for its price.

Atari officially launched the Gamestation Go handheld retro gaming console a couple of months ago, and we were lucky enough to acquire one recently. This is quite a departure from the best PC gaming handhelds we usually test, but it still packs in buckets of fun for those with a taste for retro.

Fuelling the Gamestation Go's potential success are several special features. Probably the most alluring features of this 7-inch handheld are its pleasing array of retro arcade--appropriate controls, and My Arcade's inclusion of a whopping 200+ classic games from Atari, Jaleco, Namco, and others built-in.

The combination of a bumper selection of classic console and arcade titles, alongside those unique for its form factor controls, should make this product a winner. However, the price, compared to portable retro-gaming alternatives out there, and a failure to play to its strengths, means we are marking it down quite strongly.

The Atari Gamestation Go takes its cues from the most popular PC handheld designs right now. In other words, it looks a lot like a Steam Deck or ROG Ally – from a distance. Once you take a little more time to absorb what you are seeing, though, some interesting differences will catch your eye.

Scanning beyond the now familiar 7-inch landscape form factor, several things become obvious. To the right, there is a numeric keypad. That's different. But to the right are some of the most important physical controller design ‘innovations' – in our experience. From top to bottom, you will see an integrated paddle/dial/spinner; below that, there's a more familiar D-pad, and below that a trackball. Control options like these can really impact the retro-gaming experience – and there are several famous Atari console and arcade games that used controls like paddles and trackballs to differentiate the gaming experience.

 




Atari and My Arcade have produced some excellent packaging for this device. The box looks glossy, bright, and eye catching, highlighting the console design and its classic arcade contents. This positive impression grows when you flip up the faux-top to reveal a gatefold gaming content reveal. The games that My Arcade must expect to exert the strongest pull are shown in a grid on the upper half of the gatefold; below you will see the full 200+ games listed.

Inside the box, we see everything is very well padded for protection in transit. Moreover, the makers haven't skimped on accessories. There's an HDMI cable, USB-C charging cable, and power brick, all provided. A couple of bits of paperwork are also to be found in the box. One asks users to connect to Wi-Fi to keep the system up to date, and the other advertises the upcoming GamePad and Arcade Stick controller peripherals, made especially for Gamestation users. These will surely plug directly into the two USB-C ports on the back of the device.

In my hands, the Gamestation Go feels plastic but very solid. Twisting it, there is a little give, but nothing dramatic, and there was no easily induced creaking heard, or threat of panels buckling observed.

Processor, RAM, storage 

Atari and My Arcade don't disclose the components used inside the Gamestation Go, so I was more than curious to open up this handheld up to take a look at the PCB.

First, the good news: Accessing the battery was a cinch. Two T6 screws needed to be removed from the back panel, and then the battery cover, sat between the legs of the integrated kickstand, could slide down and reveal the 7,200mAh 3.7W battery pack.

It was simple enough to unplug the battery, as the two adhesive strips fixing it in place just needed some gentle persuasion. This battery is attached to the PCB via a small 3-wire removable connector.

 




Now onto the bad news. I could find no more screws and couldn't pry apart the console by levering any of its seams with my tools. Stumped, I went along to my local smart device repair emporium, and they thought the screen would need to be heated up, and the PCB would be uncovered by pulling this up and away, like one might open up a tablet. However, they couldn't guarantee the device would still work after such an operation, so I decided not to sacrifice this handheld.

We have seen no other teardown online, but Atari enthusiasts buzzing around forums generally think that the innards of the new Gamestation Go are closely related to the non-portable Gamestation Pro, released two years prior. This non-portable TV-companion console was torn down here.

If the assumption that these consoles have a very similar set of inner components is correct, the new Gamestation Go will be Rockchip RK3032-powered. This is a very modest SoC, with dual Arm Cortex-A7 cores, supported by Mali-400MP graphics and up to 512MB of DDR3 RAM.

For software support, an RK3032 retro gaming device maker will usually look to Linux SpectralElec 3.0 and EmuELEC v9.0 builds. It will also struggle with any games newer than the 16-bit era, which tallies with my experience of this system (as we'll discuss later).

From sliding the red switch to the on-position, to reaching the game UI of the Gamestation Go, takes an unwelcome full 30 seconds. Once there, you will be presented with a colorful interface where the D-Pad is used to scroll horizontally between ‘systems.' After a system has been selected, there are usually subcategories to flick through vertically, followed by a cascading list of actual games.

It can take a while to get to a game you like, and (perhaps obviously) the Atari family contains a long list of consoles and platforms, each with rather long game lists inside. Thankfully, you can favorite/bookmark titles, and there is a recent list, too, but these shortcut lists aren't global. Thus, you have favorite lists for Atari games, for PIKO, and Jaleco titles. Moreover, smaller main categories like Atari Recharged, Balls of Steel (pinball), and Pac-Man titles are offered up in a horizontally scrolling format, like the home screen.

As you scroll through the list of games in your chosen category, the console UI shows a picture of the cartridge or cabinet, plus an animation showing gameplay, and beneath that, there's a more-info section.

In your chosen game, it is quick and easy to head to the settings menu to adjust brightness, screen aspect ratio, load and save states, and view (but not adjust) the controls available. Moreover, the Home button works quickly for getting straight back to the game selection UI and picking something else to enjoy.

I was keen to dive into some of the classics I remember from the arcades of yesteryear. Some of these titles ate through quite a few coins in my time. Thus, it was exciting to see Asteroids, Berzerk, Breakout, Millipede, Missile Command, Space Duel, Breakout, and Tempest among the roster of titles.

Quite a few of my favorite old arcade titles are ‘vector' style, and I enjoyed playing them. However, bear in mind that many arcade games get hard and frantic quite quickly. Remember, these titles were designed to hook people in and extract cash as quickly and efficiently as possible – not for lengthy gaming sessions.

Still on the topic of the arcade games on this machine, it was interesting to check each one, and the SmartGlow lighting choices for controls that had been pre-ordained by My Arcade.

For example, Asteroids used the D-pad for ship rotation and thrust, and one of the ABXY buttons for fire. I also enjoyed using the rotational paddle dial in Super Breakout and Tempest. Some fun trackball games that got me playing were Millipede and Missile Command.

It's also important to note the Gamestation Go ahs many duplicate games. Sometimes I wondered why there were so many duplicates, especially in the Atari library. For example, there are versions of Centipede for the Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, and arcade. Then titles like Asteroids and Breakout also have modern Recharged Editions, as well as various old console and arcade versions.

While control method authenticity is something of a star attraction for Gamestation Go gamers, there are some clear issues with it, in my experience.

One of the first things you may notice when gaming on this handheld is that you can't change the controller configuration. The pre-defined SmartGlow indicated controller configuration is what you have to live with. If a game is configured to use the D-pad for movement by Atari / My Arcade, then trying the paddle or trackball will be futile. There's no way to change this in any of the firmwares I had during testing (v 1.0 and v1.1).

Not only did the SmartGlow highlighted pre-selected controller choices and adjustment possibilities disappoint, the physical interfaces aren't the best. Specifically, I found the inertia of the paddle, dial, spinner (or whatever you prefer to call it) was too strong. So it was often cold-treacle slow to move in response to on-screen action. I didn't enjoy the trackball either. I'd instead call it the track-marble, as it is so small. This control method is really overly sensitive, with no way to tone it down. The D-Pad, ABXY buttons, and shoulder buttons all felt good enough, though.

With the pre-installed games, I didn't notice any poor performance or symptoms of the hardware not being up to the job. I'd say the most processor-intensive (newest) titles available in the pre-installed list all worked without a hitch, without slowdowns, glitching, or audio pops or crackling. Thus, this handheld, with its underlying hardware, is fit for purpose.

Though not documented by Atari or My Arcade on the official product pages, Gamestation Go users can expand their playable games library using the system's microSD card slot. This feature is another one that is shared by the prior Gamestation Pro console.

To get an SD card to be recognized by the system, you must format it using exFAT. ROMs for particular systems need to use pre-set extensions. It also makes sense to keep ROMs for different systems in different sensibly named folders, for your hygiene and sanity.

To access these files, you must turn on the system with the SD card already inserted. Just before the UI settles down and is ready for user interaction, you then select between the 'Local Storage' or 'Micro SD card' options (see above gallery). It is easy to press the Home button and get back to the basic folders and files SD card list. If you press Home twice in a row, it will take you to the built-in games. From here, I didn't find a way to get back to the SD card contents, except via a system restart.

I successfully tested and enjoyed some games from the Sega Genesis (AKA Mega Drive), Super Nintendo (SNES), Atari Lynx, and NeoGeo Pocket Color (NGPC) systems. All the titles I tried from these systems played nicely, albeit with just the D-Pad and ABXY buttons usable during play. Perhaps some SNES games pushed the system a little too far, as I heard a bit of audio crackling in some of these classic titles.

Moving beyond the 16-bit era, I had no success with original PlayStation, Nintendo 64, or PlayStation Portable titles, whatsoever. While the latter two platforms may have been limited by the lack of analog joystick controls provided by the Gamestation Go, the PS1 should have been fine in this respect.

I could have tried more titles, and I've read of other testers having success with them, but I gave up when all my picks just black-screened and returned me to the UI. I'd only very limited hopes that the Rockchip CPU could have coped with the newer systems, anyway.

My Arcade and Atari have crafted a handheld retro gaming console graced by a bevy of unique retro-futuristic controls. It is clever to differentiate this device by having a paddle and trackball built-in, and this will surely exert a gravitational pull on retro gamers in its orbit. While the Gamestation Go largely works as intended, its appeal is dulled by the lack of user-configuration options, rendering quirks in classic vector games, and a price point that feels misaligned with its level of hardware and software polish. We remain hopeful that further firmware updates can improve matters, but canny customers don't buy on a promise.

Another thorn in the Gamestation Go's sides is that nearly everyone owns a smartphone, with a screen approaching the 7-inch diagonal of this handheld. Many more will have access to a portable in the form of a tablet, laptop, or handheld - often with even larger, more immersive, screens. Add a nice game controller to the powerful mobile device you already own, and you can probably enjoy playing emulated consoles from eras much more recent than the Gamestation Go can hope to support.

These flexible alternative platforms also have legitimate access to many of the same Atari games via Google Play, the Apple App store, and the various PC/Steam games libraries.

Providing yet more competition to the Atari Gamestation Go are consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Users of this popular hybrid console can load up carts / downloads like Atari Mania, and several Atari Recharged collections.

 




Last but not least, there are dozens of gaming handhelds on Amazon, AliExpress and other marketplaces that are designed primarily for playing retro console and arcade ROMs. These platforms may have fewer legitimately licensed game collection options, but that won't bother some. While I haven't seen any rivals with the trackball or paddle that the Atari offers, they often come with analog joysticks - and enough processing power to make later generations of console and arcade games playable. Moreover, there are lots of options around $50, if a 4-inch screen is enough for your retro gaming fix.

Among these alternatives, to be fair, is the My Arcade Atari Pocket Player Pro at just $39.99 on Amazon at 11% off right now. It has a small screen at just 2.75-inches, and relatively limited controls. However, it still has a decent 100+ licensed games built in and similar cool styling to the newer and more substantial Gamestation Go. That alternative Atari-branded product might just be enough for an enjoyable blast from the past. We'd also expect the larger new console to have some attractive price cuts in due course, rewarding those who are patient.

During my testing, the Gamestation Go's firmware received an update from version 1.0 to 1.1. It was good to see some improvements, but I feel there's still plenty more to do in future revisions.

If you're still in for the nostalgia, you can grab the Atari Gamestation Go from Amazon.com for $179.99 today.

What is the most cramped memory card you own?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Small Capacity Memory Card Championship (Japan), in which participants submitted their smallest memory cards, has been a tightly run race, but now the results are in. The smallest memory card found by the retro-computer-loving followers of X68PRO-HD on X was a 0.5MB SmartMedia card. While entrants such as the 1.44MB Flash FDD stick and Casio 2KB battery-backed RAM card didn't make the cut (they didn't quite fit the category), we were intrigued to see them.

Without further ado, the full list of tiny-capacity winners was as follows (machine translation):

If I were to join in this low-capacity competition, the best entrant from my drawers of detritus would be the 1GB xD-Picture card I found (see top picture). I also remember spending far too much on a 64MB CF card (and PCMCIA adaptor) back when digital cameras were cutting-edge tech objects of desire. Even that, though, seems massive compared to the 0.5MB SmartMedia card found by X68PRO-HD and their social media acquaintances.

 




The competition poster tipped a hat to other interesting small-capacity flash storage card entrants, but several were disqualified from the final list. Formats like PS1 memory cards, ‘bubble memory,' USB thumb drives, and battery-backed flash RAM cards didn't make the grade. Some of these were out of bounds as they weren't ‘general-purpose' flash memory cards.

Nevertheless, the rejects pile offered up some very interesting artifacts from earlier computing eras. Probably the most remarkable small-capacity entry that didn't make it was the Casio 2KB battery-backed RAM card. This was a type of memory card exclusively for the Casio ‘Pokecon' (ポケコン) range of pocket computers from the 1980s and 90s.

Another entry that didn't quite make the grade was a 1MB PCMCIA card that was produced before it became a standard – that was a near miss.

Last but not least, it was interesting to see pictures and information about a 1.44MB ‘Flash FDD' stick. This was a flash drive with the same capacity as a standard HD floppy. Moreover, it was designed with firmware to emulate a real floppy disk and could be booted from, like a floppy, by Windows and Linux users.

Aston University's Dr Jonathan Cox and New Zealand Mānuka honey company Comvita have announced a significant milestone in their three-year research collaboration, with the filing of a new patent for a formulation to fight bacterial infections.

The formulation harnesses the unique antimicrobial properties of Mānuka honey to help address the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The new patent covers a breakthrough Mānuka honey formulation that is more effective at fighting bacteria than Mānuka honey alone. Early results are very promising, showing it is effective against many highly drug-resistant bacterial species, including MRSA, and others that are major causes of serious hospital infections and deaths worldwide.

This announcement comes during World Antimicrobial Resistance Awareness Week, highlighting the power of international science partnerships, and the shared commitment of New Zealand and the UK to develop novel, effective, and globally relevant solutions.

AMR is considered by the WHO as one of the top 10 global public health challenges, with the potential to cause up to 10 million deaths a year by 2050. In New Zealand, Māori and Pacific people are more likely to be hospitalised with infection illnesses, and are therefore at greater risk from antibiotic-resistant infections. In the UK, the government classifies AMR as a ""chronic risk"", and 35,200 deaths every year are attributed to AMR.

Dr Cox, senior lecturer in microbiology in Aston University School of Biosciences said:

""Antibiotic-resistant infections such as Mycobacterium abscessus are incredibly difficult to treat, and new therapeutic options are urgently needed. Our work shows that Mānuka honey has remarkable potential, both on its own, as novel formulations, and in combination with existing antibiotics to tackle AMR. Filing this patent is an exciting step toward translating our laboratory discoveries into real-world treatments that could make a meaningful difference for patients globally.""

This patent marks a major milestone in our mission to advance the science of Mānuka honey and unlock its full potential in supporting global health. Our collaboration with Dr Cox reflects the best of science and nature working together and a model for how industry and academia from all corners of the world can work together to solve big problems. As AMR continues to rise worldwide, the need for safe, natural, and effective alternatives has never been greater. We're proud to be leading research that could one day contribute to better outcomes for communities everywhere.""

Dr. Jackie Evans, chief science officer at Comvita

Her Excellency Iona Thomas, British High Commissioner to New Zealand, said:

""This collaboration between Comvita and Aston University is a standout example of the strength of UK-New Zealand research partnerships. AMR is one of the most serious health challenges of our time, and it will take innovative, cross-border thinking to solve it. Seeing world-class researchers and industry leaders come together to advance a nature-based solution is exactly the kind of impact our countries can deliver when we work side by side.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists identify cellular control points to tackle multiple viruses","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251121/Scientists-identify-cellular-control-points-to-tackle-multiple-viruses.aspx","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 01:43:00 GMT","

Scientists were pleased when they learned more about how the common cold gains a foothold in the body, identifying key cellular checkpoints that are important targets of the virus.But the real excitement extends far beyond the cold virus, which is a coronavirus like MERS-CoV or COVID-causing SARS-CoV-2. The team hopes its work will help protect people against multiple viruses by helping open up a new front in the fight to stop viral pathogens.

Rather than focusing on how to attack a specific virus directly - as antiviral drugs today work - researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory want to protect the body against many viruses. The idea is to fortify the body's defenses against multiple invaders in one fell swoop, not to stop only the threat at hand.

“A virus thrives by taking over the cellular machinery of its host, hijacking normal processes to churn out copies of itself,” said John Melchior, a biochemist and a corresponding author of a Sept. 12 paper in the Journal of Proteome Research. “We want to identify and then fortify the molecular complexes that are susceptible to many invading viruses - to stop viruses before they have a chance to take over the cell.

Instead of going after the virus itself, we manipulate the control points in the cell to battle the virus.”

John Melchior, biochemist

Virologist Amy Sims, the co-corresponding author of the study, said the approach is a new way to fight many kinds of coronaviruses, from those that cause usually minor symptoms like a cold to those that cause severe diseases like COVID-19 and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

“This approach offers a pathway for using a single drug to stop multiple types of viruses,” said Sims. “When you target only the virus, it can produce strains that readily escape antiviral medications. But by targeting key functions in the host cell that the virus needs to replicate, and by turning off those host functions, we hope to eliminate the escape route most viruses use to cause disease.”

Melchior, Sims and colleagues have adapted a newer technique that pinpoints proteins whose conformation, or shape, has changed. In the current study, they looked at human cells infected by HCoV-229E, a virus that causes the common cold. 

The technique, called limited proteolysis-based mass spectrometry or LiP-MS, determines not just the changes in abundance of thousands of different proteins present in a sample but also which proteins have changed shape. For a protein, shape is everything, determining its function and regulating which molecular partners it can interact with and when.

The PNNL team identified eight targets of the virus, including two molecular assemblies that are key control points involved in RNA processing. In both cases, the virus usurps the normal function in the cell and then takes control of the cellular machinery to make more copies of itself. The team showed that by blocking the virus from interacting with those molecular assemblies, the ability of the virus to replicate in the human lung cells where it normally thrives was reduced.

One molecular target is Nop-56, which gives a chemical stamp of approval to let the body know that a given strand of RNA is legitimate. With that chemical approval in hand, a cellular unit known as the ribosome makes the strand's protein product. When the cold virus hijacks Nop-56, human RNA is destroyed, normal proteins are not made - and rogue viral proteins are approved instead.

The spliceosome C-complex is another important target. The molecule helps cells edit RNA strands by removing non-essential regions within RNA. When the virus commandeers the molecular assembly, it again diverts the body from making its normal proteins and instead makes its own proteins that go on to hurt the host.

Picture a drone factory in a country at war, turning out products to defend itself. Imagine that a foreign invader takes over the factory, halts production and then uses the factory to turn out its own drones that are used to attack the home country. That's similar to what happens when a virus invades a person.

“We hope our work provides a list of common molecular targets that sets the foundation for the development of drugs that could block not just one but many viruses that cause disease,” said Snigdha Sarkar, a postdoctoral fellow and first author of the paper.

“Viruses can mutate quickly, and that poses a problem when targeting a virus directly,” she added. “That obstacle is removed if you target proteins that many viruses rely upon in the host.”

Now, the PNNL team is exploring existing compounds that have been shown by scientists at Oregon Health & Science University to have antiviral potential. The team is also using artificial intelligence to rapidly identify compounds that could affect the molecular targets that its technology identified.

The work was funded by PNNL's Predictive Phenomics Initiative, an effort to understand how factors beyond the genetic code determine the traits of people, plants and all living things. The research holds promise for the bioeconomy, human health and other areas. Understanding the molecular steps involved when the environment changes - such as when a viral infection occurs - and then predicting the outcomes from those changes is at the heart of the initiative.

In addition to Melchior, Sarkar and Sims, authors include Song Feng, Hugh Mitchell, Madelyn Berger, Tong Zhang, Isaac Attah, Chelsea Hutchinson-Bunch, Victoria Prozapas, Kristin Engbrecht and Stephanie King.

University of Minnesota Medical School researchers have shown that reducing chronic inflammation can significantly protect against age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-like pathology in preclinical models. The findings were recently published in Cell Death and Disease.

AMD is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness for Americans aged 65 years and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most current AMD therapies treat only late-stage disease, this research takes an innovative approach by focusing on early protection.

These results demonstrate that targeting key aspects of inflammation has the potential to prevent a spectrum of eye diseases that are reminiscent of age-related macular degeneration. Our hope is that this work will ultimately pave the way for new, preventive treatments for AMD centered around the inflammasome pathway.""

John Hulleman, PhD, associate professor, University of Minnesota Medical School

The research team found that removing key components of the inflammation cascade prevented hallmark signs of early retinal disease, including the infiltration of immune cells into the subretinal space and the formation of subretinal deposits. By intervening before severe damage occurs, the strategy may offer the best chance to delay or prevent progression to the most harmful stages of AMD.

""We are encouraged by our findings and the potential to prevent or delay vision loss for those with the early signs of AMD. What we are learning could be life-changing for many in the future, as AMD affects nearly 20 million Americans today,"" said Dr. Hulleman, who is also the paper's corresponding author.

The research team aims to next determine if similar anti-inflammatory approaches could be used to not just prevent disease, but reverse it once it begins. 

This research was funded by the National Eye Institute, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Helen Lindsay Foundation, Larson Endowed Chair for Macular Degeneration Research, Edward N. and Della L. Thome Memorial Foundation Award in Age-Related Macular Degeneration Research and UT Southwestern's Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute Sprouts Grant Program.

A breakthrough could be coming in the way young people recover from surgery to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee, a common sports injury. 

A new clinical trial soon will begin enrolling patients at the University of Cincinnati to study extended postoperative use of the drug tranexamic acid (TXA), which helps reduce bleeding after surgery and may improve recovery outcomes.

More than 200,000 ACL reconstructions are performed in the United States each year, many in young athletes eager to return to play. The recovery process often takes nine to 12 months, and complications such as swelling, stiffness and loss of muscle strength can delay rehabilitation.

David Bernholt, MD, is the principal investigator of the study and an associate professor of clinical medicine in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery in the Division of Sports Medicine.

TXA is typically given intravenously during an ACL surgery to minimize blood loss. This clinical trial will test the effects of extended dosing outside of the operating room. It will be prescribed orally for seven days after surgery.""

David Bernholt, MD, principal investigator of the study

Bernholt noted that extended TXA dosing is now being used in joint replacement procedures due to recent studies showing improved results. This clinical trial will test whether similar benefits occur in ACL reconstructions.

""This could be a game changer,"" said Bernholt. ""Anything we can do to reduce pain, decrease swelling and promote earlier movement in patients is critical.""

Bernholt is leading a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, Duke University, Washington University in St. Louis, Endeavor Health in the Chicago area and Campbell Clinic in the Memphis area.

The sites will enroll a total of 100 participants between the ages of 14 and 22. Half will receive extended TXA dosing, while the other half will receive a placebo.

Eligible participants include high school and college athletes, recreational athletes, and others with ACL injuries caused by injuries or trauma. Patients who are interested in taking part in the trial should consult their orthopaedic surgeon.

Bernholt recently received the Sandy Kirkley Clinical Outcomes Research Grant, valued at $25,000, from the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) to support the clinical trial. One physician per year in the United States is selected for this award.

In 2021, Bernholt was awarded the Steven P. Arnoczky Young Investigator Grant from the AOSSM to support earlier research.

""We are optimistic that quicker improvements in pain and range of motion can lead to earlier progress in physical therapy, which may in turn lead to an overall quicker recovery,"" said Bernholt. ""Patients' muscle strength may not be impacted as much.""

Bernholt explained that extended TXA use could help prevent arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI), a physiological response that limits muscle activation after joint injury or surgery. AMI protects the joint but can also delay recovery.

""If patients can regain mobility more quickly, they may be cleared by a physician to return to their sport sooner,"" he said. ""With ACL injuries already requiring extended recovery, many student-athletes are eager to limit their rehabilitation time and return to competition.

Researchers will study participants' one-year outcomes. Published results are expected in late 2027 or early 2028.

Medical reports written in technical terminology can pose challenges for patients. A team at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has investigated how artificial intelligence can make CT findings easier to understand. In the study, reading time decreased, and patients rated the automatically simplified texts as more comprehensible and more helpful.

To simplify the original documents, the researchers used an open-source large language model operated in compliance with data protection regulations on the TUM University Hospital's computers. An example: ""The cardiomediastinal silhouette is midline. The cardiac chambers are normally opacified. [...] A small pericardial effusion is noted"" was simplified by the AI as follows: ""Heart: The report notes a small amount of fluid around your heart. This is a common finding, and your doctor will determine if it needs any attention.""

From the researchers' perspective, making medical terminology accessible is more than a minor aid. ""Ensuring that patients understand their reports, examinations, and treatments is a central pillar of modern medicine. This is the only way to guarantee informed consent and strengthen health literacy,"" says Felix Busch, assistant physician at the Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and co-last author of the study, which was published in the journal ""Radiology"".

While previous research has shown that AI models can make specialist medical texts more comprehensible, little was known about their impact on actual patients. Therefore, the team included 200 patients who underwent CT imaging at the TUM University Hospital due to a cancer diagnosis. One half received the original report, while the other half received an automatically simplified version.

The results were unambiguous: reading time fell from an average of seven minutes for the original reports to two minutes. Patients who received the simplified findings reported that they were much easier to read (81% compared with 17%) and easier to understand (80% compared with 9%). They also rated them as helpful (82% compared with 29%) and informative (82% compared with 27%) far more often.

Various objective measurements also confirmed the improved readability of the simplified reports.""

Felix Busch, assistant physician, Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology 

Future studies are needed to determine whether these advantages translate into measurable improvements in patient health outcomes. From the researchers' perspective, however, the study clearly shows that patients can benefit from AI-supported simplification of medical reports by improving their understanding. ""Providing automatically simplified reports as an additional service alongside the specialist report is conceivable. However, the prerequisite is the availability of optimized, secure AI solutions in the clinic,"" says Felix Busch.

The team advises patients not to turn to a chatbot like ChatGPT as a stand-in doctor to simplify their report. ""Aside from data protection concerns, language models always carry the risk of factual errors,"" says Dr. Philipp Prucker, first author of the study. In the investigation, 6% of the AI-generated findings contained factual inaccuracies, 7% omitted information, and 3% added new information. Before the reports were provided to patients, however, they were reviewed for errors and corrected if necessary. ""Language models are useful tools, but they are no substitute for medical staff. Without trained specialists verifying the findings, patients may, in the worst case, receive incorrect information about their illness,"" Prucker concludes.

Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. The emerging application of artificial intelligence (AI) in pediatric ultrasound has shown significant potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in addressing the challenges of conventional ultrasound in operator dependence, inconsistent image quality, and limited quantitative analysis capabilities.

These limitations arise from the inherent complexity of pediatric ultrasound image interpretation, such as organ immaturity, motion artifacts, and intestinal gas interference. AI can enhance structural recognition, offering automated, standardized measurements. AI applications can also assist non-expert physicians in enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

This review summarizes recent advances in AI applications for pediatric ultrasound across different systems, including preliminary diagnosis, screening, detailed analysis, and decision support, while providing a detailed discussion of technical advances, unmet challenges, and future directions. Future research can focus on intelligent cross-system feature analysis frameworks, translational application of AI-driven pediatric ultrasound in multi-disease diagnosis, and fine-tuned models for personalized treatment based on large-scale randomized controlled trials.

This review provides an up-to-date reference for clinicians, ultrasound technicians, researchers, and biomedical engineers.

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, along with collaborators at Northwestern University, have developed a noninvasive approach to treat one of the most aggressive and deadly brain cancers. Their technology uses precisely engineered structures assembled from nano-size materials to deliver potent tumor-fighting medicine to the brain through nasal drops. The novel delivery method is less invasive than similar treatments in development and was shown in mice to effectively treat glioblastoma by boosting the brain's immune response.

The findings were published this month in PNAS.

Glioblastoma tumors form from brain cells called astrocytes and are the most common kind of brain cancer, affecting roughly three in 100,000 people in the U.S. Glioblastoma generally progresses very quickly and is almost always fatal. There are no curative treatments for the disease, in part because delivering medicines to the brain remains extremely challenging

We wanted to change this reality and develop a noninvasive treatment that activates the immune response to attack glioblastoma. With this research, we've shown that precisely engineered nanostructures, called spherical nucleic acids, can safely and effectively activate powerful immune pathways within the brain. This redefines how cancer immunotherapy can be achieved in otherwise difficult-to-access tumors.""

Alexander H. Stegh, PhD, aprofessor and vice chair of research in the WashU Medicine Taylor Family Department of Neurosurgery and co-corresponding author of the study. 

Stegh also is research director of The Brain Tumor Center at Siteman Cancer Center, based at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and WashU Medicine

Glioblastoma tumors are known as ""cold tumors"" because they do not induce the body's natural immune response as do so-called ""hot tumors"" that are easier to treat with immunotherapies. Researchers have developed ways to spark an immune reaction against tumors by stimulating a pathway within cells called STING, which stands for stimulator of interferon genes. STING is triggered when a cell detects foreign DNA and activates the immune system to respond to the threat.

Past studies have shown that drugs activating STING in glioblastoma tumors can prime the body's immune system to better fight the cancer. However, these agents break down quickly in the body and must be delivered directly into the tumor to work. Because repeated dosing is required for sustained benefit, relying on direct intratumoral administration requires highly invasive procedures.

""We really wanted to minimize patients having to go through that when they are already ill, and I thought that we could use the spherical nucleic acid platforms to deliver these drugs in a noninvasive way,"" said Akanksha Mahajan, PhD, a postdoctoral research associate in Stegh's lab and the first author on the study.

To overcome the problem, the Stegh team collaborated with co-corresponding author Chad A. Mirkin, PhD, director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology and the Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern University, and his team. Mirkin invented spherical nucleic acids, a class of nanostructures that arrange DNA or RNA densely around a nanoparticle core, and he has shown that they have greater therapeutic potency compared to the standard delivery methods. The WashU Medicine and Northwestern researchers prepared a new class of spherical nucleic acids with gold cores studded with short snippets of DNA to trigger activation of the STING pathway in specific immune cells. To deliver these drugs to the brain, the team turned to the nose.

Intranasal therapy has been explored as a potential delivery method for medications targeting the brain, but no nanoscale therapies had yet been developed using this method to activate immune responses against brain cancers.

""This is the first time that it has been shown that we can increase immune cell activation in glioblastoma tumors when we deliver nanoscale therapeutics from the nose to the brain,"" Mahajan said.

The team wanted to show that this approach could be used to deliver the medicine selectively to the brain, and that it would act on the appropriate cells once it got there. For the first objective, they used a molecular tag on the spherical nucleic acid that was visible under near-infrared light. They found that the nanomedicine, when delivered as droplets into the nasal passages of mice with glioblastoma, traveled along the path of the main nerve that connects facial muscles to the brain. The immune response evoked in the brain by the medicine was concentrated in the specific immune cells, especially those in the tumor itself, and triggered some helpful responses in the lymph nodes. The medicine did not spread to other parts of the body where it might cause unwanted side effects.

Examinations of immune cells in and near the tumor showed that the therapy successfully activated the STING pathway and armed the immune system to fight the tumor.

When applied in combination with drugs designed to help activate T lymphocytes, another type of immune cell, the new therapy eradicated the tumors with just one or two doses and induced long-term immunity against their recurrence. Taken together, the results were much better than those of current STING-activating immune therapies.

Stegh cautioned that firing up the STING pathway isn't capable of curing glioblastomas without reinforcement from other therapeutic approaches. Turning on the STING pathway by itself isn't enough to fight glioblastoma, because the tumor has many ways to block or shut down the immune response that STING is meant to activate. His team is looking to add capabilities to their nanostructure that activate other immune responses. This could allow physicians to double or triple the therapeutic targets all in a single therapy.

""This is an approach that offers hope for safer, more effective treatments for glioblastoma and potentially other immune treatment-resistant cancers, and it marks a critical step toward clinical application,"" said Stegh.

Improving diet and increasing physical activity levels together may be more effective at preventing weight gain – particularly harmful fat inside the abdomen – than just changing one of these behaviours, new research from the University of Cambridge suggests.

An analysis of changes in physical activity and diet quality in UK adults found that while improved diet quality and increased physical activity were each independently associated with lower increases in body fat, the greatest benefits were achieved by combining both.

Body fat is stored in different locations, some of which are more harmful than others. Subcutaneous fat is stored under the skin and can be considered relatively healthy. In contrast, visceral fat stored around the organs in the abdomen is linked to a higher risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and heart disease.

In a study published today in JAMA Network Open, researchers from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge followed 7,256 adults from the Fenland Study over seven years.

The mean age of the study participants was 49 years at baseline, and 56 years at follow-up. At baseline, and again after an average of around seven years, the researchers measured Fenland study participants' physical activity energy expenditure for at least 72 hours using wearable heart rate and movement sensors.

The researchers also assessed participants' diet quality by the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern using a food frequency questionnaire. The Mediterranean diet focuses on eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and olive oil, with moderate amounts of fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy, while limiting consumption of red meat and sweets.

On both occasions, the researchers also measured the quantity and distribution of body fat using DEXA, a low-intensity X-ray scan that can distinguish body fat, bone composition, muscle and lean mass across the whole body, and used ultrasound to identify the occurrence of fatty liver disease.

The researchers found that improvements in diet quality and physical activity energy expenditure over time were independently associated with reductions or less gain in weight, overall body fat, and subcutaneous and visceral fat, and a lower incidence of fatty liver disease.

Simultaneous improvements in both diet and physical activity were associated with the greatest reduction in body fat, while improvement in only one of the two behaviours was associated with relatively modest changes.

For example, Fenland Study participants who improved both their diet and activity gained on average about 1.9 kg less total body fat and 150g less visceral fat over the follow-up period compared with those who did not improve their behaviors. This difference is equivalent to approximately 7% of the baseline total body fat and 16% of the baseline visceral fat in the population.

The researchers found that after adjusting for body mass index, the association of changes in diet and physical activity with changes in visceral fat remained significant, while the association with subcutaneous fat did not, indicating that visceral fat was particularly responsive to the changes in health behaviours.

When people talk about changes in body weight, they often refer to a single number on the scale. But not all weight loss or gain is the same. First of all, we need to focus on fat mass when considering the risk of metabolic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Second, body fat is stored in different places, and some types are more harmful than others. So, when we gain or lose weight, it matters where these changes happen.

We found that combining a better diet with more physical activity is an effective way to improve not just weight, but how much and where fat is stored in the body. It's particularly effective at reducing the build-up of harmful fat around organs.""

Dr. Shayan Aryannezhad, first author from the MRC Epidemiology Unit

Senior author Professor Nita Forouhi, also from the MRC Epidemiology, said: ""Our research shows that improvements in diet with more physical activity in middle-age don't just result in weight loss, but can potentially help prevent disease and support healthier ageing.

""Despite the challenges of living in environments that promote unhealthy eating and inactivity, there is benefit from making small, sustained changes that lead to both healthier diets and increased energy expenditure.

""To address the epidemic of obesity and its huge social, psychological and health service costs, policy makers should seek to alter the food and physical activity environments to make healthier choices more accessible for all.""

The research was funded by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, with support from the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

Despite recommendations for posttreatment surveillance in lung cancer patients, there is wide variability in the follow-up care that lung cancer patients receive. A recent study, led by senior author Leah Backhus, MD, MPH, Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery (Thoracic Surgery) in the Stanford Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, offers new insights on patient care and lung cancer surveillance rates.

The study, titled, Adherence to Posttreatment Surveillance Guidelines in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): Retrospective Cohort Study, was published October 2025 in the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) Cancer. Its objective was to examine posttreatment surveillance to estimate the true surveillance rates and predictors of guideline-concordant care in patients with early-stage NSCLC. 

The retrospective study examined 1,888 Veterans with stage I to III non-small cell lung cancer who survived for ≥ 6 months following curative treatment. As Chief of Thoracic Surgery at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Dr. Backhus utilized robust data sources at the VA to inform her studies. The database of oncology data includes comprehensive cancer variables, clinical data, and radiology text reports. Radiology reports were examined using a novel hybrid approach for clinical abstraction which combines both computerized search methods and manual review for strict clinical validation.

In the study, we estimated the cumulative probability of receiving guideline-concordant surveillance, defined as chest computed tomography imaging within 4 to 9 months after treatment, accounting for competing risks and censoring.""

Dr. Leah Backhus, MD, MPH, Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery (Thoracic Surgery), Stanford Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery

The team developed a competing risk framework to describe the patterns and predictors of imaging surveillance for NSCLC. This approach allowed researchers to use a multivariable cause-specific Cox regression to estimate associations between patient factors and guideline-concordant surveillance and to distinguish between imaging ordered for surveillance versus imaging ordered for symptoms of recurrence.

""By applying this unique use of a competing risk framework, we discovered the rate of guideline concordant surveillance in this national cohort was lower than what has been reported in many previous studies,"" said Dr. Backhus. She further noted that there is a need to develop efficient strategies to monitor the rate of guideline-concordant surveillance as well as a need to improve patient education and health care professional advocacy to improve posttreatment care.

These findings reveal a potentially substantial gap in surveillance among asymptomatic lung cancer survivors. While more research is needed, it could help future generations of NSCLC patients receive better surveillance after cancer treatment.

Dr. Backhus recently presented findings related to this work on surveillance after lung cancer treatment, discussing the current state of surveillance, roadblocks, and next steps in lung cancer surveillance research.

Dr. Backhus is the Thelma and Henry Doelger Professor of Cardiovascular Surgery at Stanford. She co-directs the Stanford Thoracic Surgery Clinical Research Program, which uses a variety of health services research methodologies geared towards assessing the quality and effectiveness of thoracic surgical interventions for individual patients as well as population-based research.

The paper features several authors affiliated with the department, including first author Ryan Randle, MD, and co-author Nicole Lin, MD, who are both previous fellows in the division's Thoracic Surgery Clinical Research Program. The publication is a collaboration with researchers from the Stanford Departments of Radiology and Medicine, the University of Washington, the VA Palo Alto Health Care System, and the VA Puget Sound Health Care System.

Targeting and treating diseases first requires being able to find specific cells-which is challenging because they travel within the body and can ""hide."" 

Now, a new round of funding will support advancing technology invented at Case Western Reserve University that enhances the ability to locate therapeutic cells or diseased cells like cancer.

Right now, we don't know where all the cells go when tracking cancer cells or cell-based therapies, so we are not sure what type of processes to target or how therapies might be improved.""

Susann Brady-Kalnay, the Sally S. Morley Designated Professor of Brain Tumor Research and professor of molecular biology and microbiology, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine

Toward that goal, the National Institutes of Health awarded a $2.5 million Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant jointly to Brady-Kalnay and BioInVision Inc.

The Cleveland-based, Case Western Reserve spinout company was co-founded by double-alumni and Chief Executive Officer Debashish Roy and David Wilson, the Robert J. Herbold Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Radiology and the company's chief technology officer. Madhu Gargesha, BioInVision's principal investigator for this research grant, is a former post-doc from the CWRU biomedical engineering department.

The technology is intended to serve various applications, such as testing cancer therapeutics, cell-based therapies including immunotherapy and drug delivery. The technology can also be used to evaluate imaging agents and gene expression, Brady-Kalnay said.

SBIR grants support small businesses that collaborate with universities for continued research and commercialization, bringing revenue to both the company and university while boosting regional economic development.

More specifically, the new grant will fund research that advances the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and ""machine learning"" software to identify healthy and diseased tissue and organs from three-dimensional volumes of various models. The CryoViz cryo-imaging device is a highly automated system that uses a microscope, robotics, imaging and advanced software to create high-resolution, three-dimensional images of biological samples with single-cell sensitivity.

""If you wanted to do this with traditional methods, it might take millions of tissue sections,"" Brady-Kalnay said. ""Using a new AI algorithm BioInVision is developing, imaging an entire mouse-including identifying all its organs-could take a matter of hours.""

The researchers will also employ an AI-based ""virtual staining"" approach to evaluate the body's tissue at a single-cell level. The new techniques allow them to track individual cells-like migrating and metastatic cancer cells or T-cells-to evaluate cell-based treatments like immunotherapy.

""The computer can decide when it has detected some ""glowing"" fluorescent cells, like metastatic tumor cells in the lung,"" Brady-Kalnay said. ""It will automatically save tissue sections in that region so I can go back and study the tissue in detail at the cellular and molecular level.""

David Wald, co-investigator on the grant and professor of pathology at CWRU, is studying where T-cells end up in various organs during novel treatments like immunotherapy. Doing so would improve the ability to target diseased cells.

More broadly, the grant represents the importance of academic-industrial partnerships in supporting technology development and commercialization in Ohio. It also demonstrates the success of spin-out companies and Case Western Reserve's role in training STEM professionals for the biotech industry. Companies started by Case Western Reserve students, postdocs and faculty members are often run by former university postdocs and graduate students.

BioInVision has been selling its CryoViz technology as an instrument and service to academic institutions, hospitals, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies globally for over a decade, raising Ohio's visibility internationally.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Comprehensive antibody map reveals how SARS-CoV-2 mutations evade immunity","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251121/Comprehensive-antibody-map-reveals-how-SARS-CoV-2-mutations-evade-immunity.aspx","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 01:47:00 GMT","

Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and collaborators have created the most comprehensive map to date showing how antibodies attach to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and how viral mutations weaken that attachment. The findings, published in the November 21 online issue of Cell Systems, a Cell Press journal, explain why variants like Omicron can evade immune defenses and suggest new strategies for building longer-lasting antibody therapies and vaccines.

The team analyzed more than a thousand three-dimensional structures of antibodies bound to the virus's spike protein, the main target for immune recognition, and compiled them into a structural atlas of COVID-19 antibodies. By studying these structures together for the first time, the researchers revealed a detailed picture of how the immune system targets the virus and how the virus evolves to evade it.

Scientists around the world have solved thousands of individual antibody-virus structures, but until now, no one had looked at them together. By uniting all these data, we were able to see the bigger picture-how fully antibodies cover the virus's surface and how mutations in newer variants like Omicron can undermine that protection. It gives us a clearer view of both the strengths and limits of our immune system.""

Yi Shi, PhD, Senior Author, Associate Professor of Pharmacological Sciences, and Director of the Center for Protein Engineering and Therapeutics, Icahn School of Medicine

The researchers found that antibodies, including many used in clinical treatments, recognize nearly every exposed region of the spike protein's receptor-binding domain, a critical region of the virus. Despite this broad coverage, mutations in newer variants have weakened the binding of almost all antibodies to some degree. Many antibodies, though different in sequence, bind to the virus in strikingly similar ways, suggesting that there are only a few effective structural ways to neutralize it. That convergence, say the investigators, helps explain why the virus can mutate around immunity so efficiently.

The study also highlights the potential of nanobodies-tiny, highly stable antibody fragments that can reach parts of the virus that standard antibodies often miss. Because they can recognize deeply buried regions of the spike protein that tend to remain unchanged as the virus evolves, nanobodies could serve as powerful starting points for developing next-generation antiviral drugs.

""Our findings highlight the limits of the antibodies we currently rely on,"" Dr. Shi says. ""While these antibodies have been remarkably effective, the virus keeps finding ways to escape them.""

""To stay ahead, we'll need to design next-generation antibodies that can recognize and latch onto multiple regions of the virus at once, making it much harder for the virus to evade our defenses as it continues to evolve,"" adds Frank (Zirui) Feng, the study's first author and a master's student in the Biomedical Data Science and AI program at Mount Sinai.

Although the study focused on one key part of the spike-the receptor-binding domain-the researchers note that similar patterns of immune escape are likely occurring elsewhere in the virus. They emphasize that the results do not mean the immune system or vaccines no longer work. Vaccination and natural immunity still provide vital protection through a wide range of immune responses, even when certain antibodies lose potency.

Next, the team plans to apply this large-scale structural approach to other viruses to uncover shared principles of antibody recognition. Ultimately, they hope these insights will guide the development of durable antibody treatments capable of withstanding viral evolution and improving preparedness for future pandemics.

""The immune system is remarkably adaptable, but the virus is clever,"" says co-author Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, PhD, Irene and Dr. Arthur M. Fishberg Professor of Medicine, and Director of the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine. ""By analyzing how antibodies attach to the virus and where they fall short, we gain a detailed map of the virus's vulnerabilities. This insight not only helps us understand why some antibodies stop working as the virus evolves but also guides the design of next-generation therapies that can stay one step ahead, potentially improving how we prevent and treat COVID-19 and other viral infections.""

As a part of this research, the team has created an open-access data set and interactive web tool that allows scientists to explore antibody structures in detail, providing a powerful resource to collectively accelerate research on COVID-19 and other viruses.

Two of Pitt women's soccer program's most prominent players in recent years, Sarah Schupansky and Deborah Abiodun, will be meeting up on the biggest stage in women's professional soccer on Saturday, when their respective teams, Gotham City FC faces Washington Spirit in the NWSL Championship match in San Jose, CA. (8 p.m. ET Saturday | CBS/Paramount+)

While the match features USWNT stars such as Rose Lavelle and Trinity Rodman, both Schupansky and Abiodun have been key contributors, helping each squad get to the League Final.

Schupansky, who attended and starred at North Allegheny High School, has made 23 appearances, with 16 starts, as she's scored one goal along with five assists in her rookie campaign, after being drafted last Winter by Gotham.  Playing at this level has also elevated Schupansky into the USWNT player pool, as she's been called up to the US U-23 squad multiple times this year.

Schupansky, who has played mostly in winger or attacking midfielder role, started in the Gotham's quarterfinal round upset of Kansas City.

Ironically, Schupansky's lone goal this season came against Washington.

Nigerian international, Abiodun, also a midfielder, has been well-traveled this season, signed a three-year contract with the Spirit to end her collegiate career  Pitt, immediately sent on loan to USL Super League side Dallas Trinity FC.

In July, she was celebrating Nigeria's triumph at the Women's Africa Cup of Nations and making her mark on loan. But by the end of August, the Washington Spirit had recalled her for the final push of their National Women's Soccer League season.

Her first start came against Seattle Reign on September 7, and within 90 minutes — had an impact.

Altogether, Abiodun has played eight matches with the Spirit, amassing 581 minutes and one assist.

In last week's semifinal win vs Portland, Abiodun came off the bench in the 73rd minute.

“Pitt's helped me in ways I could not imagine because you know, in college it was quite fast, a different pace,” Abiodun told Equalizer Soccer this week.

“I feel like the staff, everyone there—academically, soccer wise—everyone was really, really great and the coaches at Pitt were really, really intense coaches that played different types of patterns.”

John Krysinsky has covered soccer and other sports for many years for various publications and media outlets. He is also author of 'Miracle on the Mon' -- a book about the Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC, which chronicles the club, particularly the early years of Highmark Stadium with the narrative leading up to and centered around a remarkable match that helped provide a spark for the franchise. John has covered sports for Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, DK Pittsburgh Sports, Pittsburgh Sports Report, has served as color commentator on Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC broadcasts, and worked with OPTA Stats and broadcast teams for US Open Cup and International Champions Cup matches held in the US. Krysinsky also served as the Head Men's Soccer Coach at his alma mater, Point Park University, where he led the Pioneers to the first-ever winning seasons and playoff berths (1996-98); head coach of North Catholic boys (2007-08), associate head coach of Shady Side Academy boys (2009-2014).

TAMPA, Fla. – Alex Freeman made his international debut for the U.S. Men's National Team just six months ago on June 7 in the team's match against Türkiye.

And just 13 caps later, the defensive standout is scoring his first international brace.

Freeman shined on the big stage in the U.S. Men's National Team's emphatic 5-1 win over 15th-ranked Uruguay on Tuesday, Nov. 18 in Tampa, Florida. Making his 10th overall start, Freeman finished the night with two goals 11 minutes apart.

His first goal arrived in the 20th minute when Freeman connected on excellent service from midfielder Sebastian Berhalter for a header goal following a corner kick. Freeman's second goal of the night was even more impressive. The 6-foot-2 defender played the part of striker, deftly dribbling inside a congested box and splitting Uruguayan defenders Ronald Araujo of FC Barcelona and Manuel Ugarte of Manchester United to finish with a sure-footed strike in the 31st minute.

“It's something that I've been working for,” Freeman said of scoring his first international goals. “I think it was coming, maybe Gold Cup or in previous camps, but to finally get it and finish with a brace as well is something I'm really proud of. Hopefully, I can build off that going into next year.” 

If 2025 is a building block for what's to come, the 21-year-old is bound to reach great heights in his blossoming career. Freeman has had an incredible run this year, starting with the U.S. Men's National Team. The fullback earned his first call-up and made his debut against Türkiye, becoming the youngest player to earn his first cap under head coach Mauricio Pochettino at 20 years, 303 days. He then went on to start every match in the United States' run to the Cocacaf Gold Cup Final, developing into a consistent presence for Pochettino and teammates.

“When he has the ball, the team is like ‘phew.' It's a relief,” Pochettino said.





Freeman achieved breakout success this year for his club, Orlando City SC in Major League Soccer. He was recently named the MLS 2025 Young Player of the Year, taking up the mantle from U.S. teammate Diego Luna, who received the honor in 2024. Freeman finished his 2025 MLS campaign with a career-high nine goal contributions plus was named an MLS All-Star and to the MLS Best XI.

“He's an incredible player,” Berhalter said. “The year he's had this year is insane. He deserves all that. He's such a great guy, and I'm so happy for him.”

Against Uruguay, Freeman put on a show in front of the fans in Florida, and one in particular – his father Antonio, a Super Bowl winner and retired NFL star. His brace earned the fullback his first Man of the Match honors with the USMNT and contributed to the program's 10th win of the year.

This year, Freeman has been making a name for himself and seen tremendous growth. Among his many feats, he's proud to add his first international goals with the Stars and Stripes.

“It's unbelievable. It's hard to describe it,” he said. “It's something that you dream of. To do it back in Florida as well, it's something I'm very proud of doing, especially for my family, so it's an important moment for me.”","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

Eight U.S. men's national team players enter the spotlight this weekend as the MLS Cup playoff conference semifinals take place.

While superstars like Lionel Messi, Thomas Müller, and Son Heung-min headline the weekend, key USMNT contributors rejoin their teams on the road to MLS Cup in December.

Names that have stood out on the international stage like Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten might be out of the postseason, but there are still players looking to fight for a 2026 World Cup roster spot and the ultimate North American prize.

Sebastian Berhalter is coming off a performance that may have carved him out a spot on the 2026 World Cup roster. After a brilliant set-piece goal and assist in the 5–1 win over Uruguay to end 2025, Berhalter heads into the Western Conference semifinal against Son's LAFC with plenty of confidence. 

Whitecaps leading scorer Brian White and MLS Defender of the Year Tristan Blackmon are both set to return from injury.

Berhalter could link up with Müller in midfield, who he has formed a tight-knit friendship with since August.

“I think honestly we both have ... a very competitive spirit,” Berhalter told MLS. “We just kind of get each other going, and it's fun. Someone like that, coming in and wanting to win everything in training and wanting to be the best, it sets the tone for everyone around you. It's awesome having him in the locker room.”

Timothy Tillman comes into the match off a start in the standout performance against Uruguay. He played 75 minutes and created two chances in a box-to-box role.

He has been one of the most consistent LAFC players this season, starting 29 of his 32 appearances.

Matt Freese wasn't able to keep every shot out of the net with the USMNT in the November window, surrendering goals in wins against Paraguay and Uruguay. Yet, he looks to be the favorite for the starting job heading into a World Cup year. 

Freese has been one of the best goalkeepers in the Eastern Conference this season, and gives No. 5 seed NYCFC a legitimate chance to upset the Supporters' Shield-winning Philadelphia Union.

FC Cincinnati turn to USMNT defender Miles Robinson and goalkeeper Roman Celentano as they look to stifle Inter Miami.

Robinson played 90 minutes in the 2–1 win over Paraguay in the penultimate USMNT match of 2025, amassing eight caps with manager Mauricio Pochettino's squad over the year. 

With 29 starts in 29 appearances at the club level, he has been a critical part of the Knifey Lions' defensive efforts. He should start at the back alongside Alvas Powell and Teenage Hadebe. 

Celentano, meanwhile, had several call-ups this year and looks to be a 2026 backup contender.

In the last meeting between these two sides at TQL Stadium, Robinson record seven defensive contributions and Celentano had two saves as Cincinnati dominated Miami 3–0.

San Diego FC enjoyed a stellar inaugural season in MLS and will look to qualify for the Western Conference final when they take on Minnesota United at Snapdragon Stadium. 

Luca de la Torre was not part of the most recent USMNT camp, but accrued eight caps in 2025. His last came in October in a 2–0 win against Japan. A victory that jumpstarted the Mauricio Pochettino era. 

De la Torre has scored five goals and two assists in 30 MLS games. 

He started on the bench in each of San Diego's three games in the first round against the Portland Timbers recording 54 minutes in total.

Celebrations to McLean's jaw-dropping goal picked up by seismic activity monitors at Glasgow Geothermal Observatory 

When Scotland qualified for the men's football World Cup for the first time in 28 years, supporters were propelled into wild celebration – and even made the earth move in the process.

According to the British Geological Survey (BGS), when Kenny McLean scored from the halfway line to seal a breathtaking 4-2 win over Denmark, which are ranked 18 places higher in the world than Scotland, the reaction at Hampden Park was equivalent to a very small earthquake.

The celebrations to McLean's jaw-dropping goal was picked up by seismic activity monitors at the Glasgow Geothermal Observatory in Dalmarnock, about 2km from the ground, the BGS said.

A reading taken between 21:48 and 21:50 – when McLean's audacious shot hit the net, shortly followed by the final whistle – was measured as a surge of between -1 and zero on the Richter scale and produced the equivalent of 200kW, enough to power between 25 and 40 car batteries.

Kieran Tierney's strike in stoppage time, which gave Scotland a 3-2 lead, also produced a reading, although not as strong as McLean's.

“Every year, as many as 300 naturally occurring earthquakes are detected in the UK, but only around 30 are of a high enough magnitude to be felt by people,” a spokesperson for the BGS said, adding that induced seismic events, such as those caused by human activity such as sonic booms, are also recorded. Most earthquakes in the UK are very small and cause no damage.

A 3.3 magnitude earthquake could be felt in homes across Perthshire last month.

Stadium events have set seismographs twitching in Scotland before, but none more so than Oasis. The band's 2009 Murrayfield gig produced the strongest tremors in two decades of monitoring, outshaking even Taylor Swift's Edinburgh concerts last year and Harry Styles's in 2023.

World Cup

As with all youth-level football, the ongoing Under-17 World Cup provides an exciting glimpse into the future of the game.

Previous Golden Ball winners, the award for this tournament's best player, include Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas, and Victor Osimhen scored 10 goals — the most in one World Cup in the competition's 40-year history — in the 2015 edition. Two years later, an England side starring Phil Foden, Morgan Gibbs-White and Marc Guehi cruised to the title of world champions. It's an event that, unsurprisingly, can act as an invaluable springboard to launch successful playing careers.

There is even more reason to pay attention to this year's edition, being played in the Gulf state of Qatar, given that it is the first of FIFA's 48-team international tournaments, before the senior men's World Cup having that many sides in Canada, Mexico and the United States next year. In little over two weeks of action, we have already seen 96 games played — 50 per cent more than we usually see in an entire tournament — and the 300-goal barrier was broken before the quarter-final stage.

Five teams have made their Under-17 World Cup debuts — from El Salvador to Fiji, the Republic of Ireland to Zambia and Uganda — while Morocco, one of the eight sides still standing, have lost a game by six goals and won another by 16.

It all leaves quite the job for world football governing body FIFA's Technical Study Group (TSG), a team of eight performance analysts and ex-professional players who are on hand to observe and digest each and every game. But when team leader Pascal Zuberbuhler, study group member Louis Carey and analyst Arron Ackerman sat down with The Athletic, there was little sense of football fatigue.

“The level of technical quality that I've seen from most teams at this tournament has been excellent,” beams Carey from the TSG's office at the Aspire Zone in Qatar. “There have been so many outstanding sides; Senegal have tried to build up really well, some of the South American nations… wow, they play the random moments and fast breaks so well.

“The Italians, Portugal, they open up teams with rotations and deep runs, and there is a clear understanding throughout the team. The way they take the ball, body positioning and decision-making, when to move out of space or play an ‘up, set and through' — even Uzbekistan, there are probably a couple of sides from each confederation who have tried to play the right way.”

As well as selecting player of the match winners and deciding tournament-wide awards, the TSG team are keen to share a more holistic, stylistic analysis of the football being played in this tournament.

“We have Arron, whose team have built our own data source in-house here at FIFA,” says Zuberbuhler, a former goalkeeper who played 51 times for Switzerland and made more than 400 first-team club appearances during a 19-year senior career. “They work very closely with people like myself, from the field, we smell the grass and know exactly what it means to be on the pitch — this mix is the crucial thing.”

So, what are some of the trends that the experts have picked out? And how could they inform the kind of football we are likely to see on the international stage in the years to come?

One of the most fascinating takeaways from the TSG's findings is just how quickly modern tactical approaches from senior level trickle down through the age groups.

The Athletic has reported on the changing landscape of top-flight European football over the past five seasons, with data from SkillCorner, illustrated below, suggesting that players are covering more ground and at higher speeds to implement more aggressive, man-to-man pressing schemes.



It seems to be no different in the age-group game, where FIFA's research suggests that not only has the number of sprints completed by under-17 players increased from their previous World Cup two years ago but that these rates are fast approaching those observed in the under-20s version this September and October.

“There is a growing trend that these players are fitter than they have ever been,” says Ackerman. “Their capacity is massive. The ability to do things at speed is also there. The speed at which some teams press is phenomenal. We've witnessed some sides being able to press at 10 metres per second — 100-metre sprinting speed. It's seriously impressive.”

“The energy and discipline in the setup against the ball has been outstanding,” says Carey. “Considering the weather conditions and volume of games in such a short space of time, it's unbelievable. And it's not something that is easy to teach young players to do.”

As we can see from the data below, compiled by FIFA, teams are showing a wide range of pressing identities.

The three remaining tournament favourites, Brazil, Portugal and Italy, all defend high, with close to one in three of their pressures arriving in the attacking third. Senegal were extremely effective in their high-press, while Ivory Coast complete an eclectic, cross-confederational group of teams looking to use their physicality and athletic conditioning to cause opponents problems up the pitch.



As professionalism sweeps through the under-17 game, expect this significant global diversity of off-ball tactics to increase, and players to appear fitter, faster and stronger as they make their first steps into senior football.

Another notable spillover from the evolution of the senior game surrounds set pieces, with many of the tournament's 48 sides looking to squeeze every last drop of attacking potential from throw-ins and dead-ball crossing opportunities.

FIFA's research shows that the rate of throw-ins taken from the attacking quarter of the pitch that have travelled straight into the penalty area has more than tripled since that Under-17 World Cup in 2023, with close to one in five flying straight towards the box.

“Many teams appear to have worked on these attacking throw-ins in preparation for this tournament, and the distances we are seeing the ball being thrown are quite incredible for such young players,” writes former Netherlands international Aron Winter on FIFA's Training Centre website. “Generating this distance clearly shows these players have worked on their technique and body strength to be able to propel the ball so far.”

Take a look at the following clip, from Zambia's 5-2 win against Honduras in the group stage. Honduras full-back Darell Oliva hurls the ball straight into the six-yard box for David Flores to score their team's second goal of the match.

“There's been such a variety in techniques,” says Carey. “Some have been flat and with pace, others have looked to loop it into the box and play off the second phases, while teams like Switzerland and Austria have looked to play it into a striker's feet. They haven't got the size (to be more direct), but they work to separate the defence and have wingers run off them.”

Incredibly, teams at this tournament are so far scoring an average of 0.93 goals per 100 throw-ins, a rate over three times greater than that of the 20 Premier League sides so far this season.

There are certain height imbalances inherent to youth football, along with varying degrees of defensive skill across the 48 sides, but the point still stands: the next generation of players are training to ensure that throw-ins stay on the map.

As Carey alluded to at the start of our conversation, a wide variety of teams at the Under-17 World Cup have looked to embrace an intricate, positional game, with a surprising number of highly technical players leaving their mark throughout the tournament.

Looking at goal kicks, for example, around 22 per cent have been taken by outfield players, compared to around seven per cent in the previous edition two years ago — another trend that has taken hold across senior European football in recent seasons.

“There are teams who clearly know that their goalkeeper is able to play; pick out a striker in behind, play it to feet,” says Zuberbuhler. “It's modern goalkeeping, and even at this age, we are seeing goalkeepers who can do it all.”

Advertisement

More generally, while some teams — Qatar, Paraguay, Uganda — look to move up the pitch quickly with fewer passes, Senegal once again stand out as the most patient, pass-heavy side with the ball at their feet.



The United States also left an impression on the TSG's experts before their loss to Morocco in the round of 32, with special praise for one player in particular.

“Their way of building would be a sort of 4-3-3, with high and wide wingers,” says Carey, “with the aim to get people like Cavan Sullivan on the ball as quickly as possible. He is an outstanding footballer. I gave him man of the match after he came on for 30 minutes against Burkina Faso (in their opening group match) — he totally changed the game with the way he got hold of possession and how he tried to bring team-mates into play.”

Ackerman is also eager to add his thoughts: “Even though they went out, it took a good (90th-minute) goal from Morocco to take the U.S. into a penalty shootout, where anything is possible. They looked to play structured football and managed to do it pretty well.”

Not just the quality on display, but the variety of approaches to the game — 48 national teams from across the globe all bringing distinct ideas to a festival of football; it all bodes well next summer.

·22 November 2025

MIAMI – The Concacaf Qualifiers to the 2026 FIFA World Cup concluded with three teams booking their spots in the tournament and two others advancing to the FIFA Play-Off Tournament, including Jamaica who remains in the hunt for a World Cup berth.

The Reggae Boyz came close to earning the direct qualification in the Final Round, finishing second in Group B. 

Jamaica began its campaign in the Second Round by finishing first in Group E with a 4-0-0 record, earning wins over Dominican Republic, Dominica, the British Virgin Islands and Guatemala. 

With consecutive shutout wins over Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica began the Final Round in first place. A 2-nil loss to Curaçao in the October window made the race a bit tighter approaching the final matchdays. 

After a shocking 1-1 draw against Trinidad in Tobago, thanks to a late goal from the Soca Warriors, Jamaica's fate would come down to the final matchday. 

With the home fans backing them in Kingston, Jamaica played to a scoreless draw against Curaçao in the final qualifier, which sent the Blue Wave directly into the World Cup and the Reggae Boyz into the six-team Play-Off tournament.

Jamaica was drawn into Pathway 1 of the FIFA Play-Off Tournament. The Concacaf side will meet New Caledonia, with the winner advancing to face DR Congo for the World Cup ticket.

What's the only thing worse than being at American Dream mall on Black Friday? For some, it's not being at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which is taking place right next door at MetLife Stadium this summer.

Which is why hundreds of people are expected at the shopping center bright and early the Friday after Thanksgiving — where two tickets to the world's biggest sporting event will be up for grabs at New Jersey's biggest mall.

As part of American Dream's “Black Friday Dream Grab” event, 100 soccer fans will have a chance to win two tickets to a FIFA World Cup group stage game at MetLife Stadium — an estimated $3,000 value.

What's the catch? You have to catch them. Well, grab them. The tickets will be available in the mall's “Human Crane” game, in which people are strapped into a harness and lowered into a pit of prizes to grab. Yep, like a classic boardwalk crane game. But with people instead of cranes.

To enter, contestants must check in starting at 5 a.m. outside the JD Sports store in American Dream. The first 100 people will be taken to the “Human Crane” for a chance at the tickets, with other prizes available including tickets to a New York Yankee game, a New York Red Bulls game, the Radio City Christmas Spectacular and more. The next 150 fans will play the “Spin-to-Win” game with a slew of gift cards available as prizes — but no soccer tickets. 

The 2026 FIFA World Cup takes place this summer across North America. MetLife Stadium will host eight games, including the final. Tickets are expected to be difficult to get, and very expensive.

A brief explainer tracing the origins of the Haitian Creole phrase “grenadye, alaso,” its connection to the French command “Grenadiers, à l'assaut,” and how Haitians transformed it into a rallying cry for courage, unity and collective struggle – from the Battle of Vertieres to the FIFA World Cup pitch.

‘Grenadye, alaso!'

Few phrases stir Haitian pride and collective memory the way this short rally cry does. Rooted in Haiti's revolutionary era, it means, sportingly, “Warriors, let's go.”

Chanted in moments of combat and celebration, the phrase derives from “Grenadiers, à l'assaut,” a French military command that translates to “Troops, attack!” Colonial French officers used the call to signal special forces infantry units to advance on the enemy during battle. Enslaved ancestors who served in France's armies made the phrase theirs—just as they claimed the land and turned Saint-Domingue into the First Black Republic.

As the nation's heroes of independence went on the attack against their enslavers, they repeated the phrase to rally the troops and keep morale high, merging ‘à l'assaut' into one word as they marched toward liberation.

In Haiti, schoolchildren learned the phrase as part of a song the freedom fighters sang in unison. Its call-and-response style echoes the rhythm of African culture, making it easy for children to remember as they took turns calling out and repeating the lines together.

Grenadye, alaso.

Sa ki mouri zafè a yo.

Nanpwen Manman, nanpwen Papa

Sa ki mouri zafè a yo. 

Loosely translated, the war song calls for soldiers to attack, to march on past those who've perished behind and forget about loved ones in the march.

In many retellings of the Haitian revolution inside classrooms and living rooms, children also learn that when troops were tired, they refused to give up and would respond to the call with ‘Nou la toujou' — meaning “We're still here.”

Over time, “Grenadye, alaso” has become a symbol of unity, shared struggle and anticipated victory. It appears in political speeches, konpa lyrics, diaspora gatherings and everyday conversations. 

Sometimes it simply means “stay strong.” Other times, it means “let's move together.” Or, “Nou nan konba,” another phrase meaning we're in a fight. 

When Haiti established its national football team in 1904, one of the earliest in the Caribbean, it aptly chose the name “Les Grenadiers.” It embodies resistance, unity and defiance in the face of overwhelming odds—qualities that have become inseparable from Haiti's identity. 

The women's national team carries the parallel name “Les Grenadières,” a feminized form that upholds French grammatical convention. Together, the two teams represent a modern evolution of a centuries-old ethos: Haitians advancing despite adversity.

More than a nickname, players often shout the phrase before each match, just like soldiers charging into battle. 

Now, for Haitians across the globe — whether in Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haïtien, Brooklyn, Willemstad (Curaçao), Provinciales (Turks and Caicos), Rio de Janeiro, Santiago (Chile), Santo Domingo, Mexico City, Paris or Doha (Qatar) — “grenadye, alaso” is an affirmation of identity and anticipated victory. 

Grenadye, alaso.

Nou la toujou.

Cristiano Ronaldo's sisters have hit back at the Portugal icon's critics following his meeting with US president Donald Trump at the White House earlier this week. Ronaldo was invited to a formal dinner party organised by the US president in honour of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Al-Nassr star's White House visit divided opinion which saw plenty of criticism aimed at Ronaldo online.

Ronaldo attended the high-profile event in the US alongside a host of world business and technology leaders, including Tesla and X boss Elon Musk. FIFA president Gianni Infantino was also present at the event. The black-tie affair was organised to deepen ties between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, and it was Ronaldo's first known appearance on American soil since 2016. 

His attendance with the Saudi delegation highlights his role as a public face for the kingdom's recent diplomatic and sports investments. During dinner, president Trump had said: ""You know, my son is a big fan of Ronaldo, wherever Ronaldo is here. And Barron got to meet him, and I think he respects his father a little bit more now, just the fact that I introduced you. So I just want to thank you both for being here. Really an honour.""

The 40-year-old received criticism for some quarters for attending the dinner party at White House, however, his sisters, Elma and Katia Aveiro have now defended their elder brother, while slamming his critics on social media. 

On her Instagram story, Elma wrote: ""Haven't these clowns realized yet that he doesn't give a damn about their opinions? This isn't for those who want it, it's for those who can handle it. They have nothing else to say, damn it.""

Katia, on the other hand, posted a video where she said: ""All it took was work, something many critics have only heard about. A visit to the White House, and that's it, an emotional nuclear explosion. Hypocrites. Such a huge hysteria has taken hold that it's frightening. It's as if Cristiano had announced the end of the world.""

Hours after attending the party, Ronaldo took to social media to thank the US president and sent out a message which read: ""Thank you Mr. President for your invitation and for the warm welcome you and the First Lady gave me and my future wife, @georginagio. Each of us has something meaningful to give, and I stand ready to do my part as we inspire new generations to build a future defined by courage, responsibility and lasting peace.""

At the party, Ronaldo gifted Trump a signed jersey with the inscription, ""To President Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace"". He then said: ""He is one of the guys who can help to change the world. One of the most important guys is the U.S. President. If we can help each other to make this happen… He is one of the guys I wish to meet to sit and have a nice talk. If it is here, or in the U.S., wherever he wants, I know he was here in Saudi Arabia with our boss, MBS. I wish one day to meet him.""

Despite missing their final qualifying game against Armenia due to a red card, Portugal comfortably booked their berth in the World Cup next year as they thrashed the minnows 9-1. Ronaldo has long maintained that the 2026 World Cup, when he will be 41, will be the final chapter of his storied international career. With Portugal now officially qualified, the countdown begins for what promises to be his last bow on football's grandest stage.

However, the forward is likely to miss a couple of games at the start of the tournament as he will have to serve the suspension for two more matches, although Portugal will file an appeal to reduce the punishment.

Awful Alexander Isak goes completely missing as pressure mounts on Arne Slot after Reds rumbled yet again","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/liverpool-player-ratings-nottingham-forest-awful-alexander-isak-pressure-arne-slot/blt57be53cf224a836f","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 17:26:15 GMT","

Liverpool's nightmare defence of their Premier League title took a turn for the worse on Saturday as Nottingham Forest ripped the Reds apart at Anfield. In a game that saw more than one moment of VAR controversy, Forest struck three times, courtesy of efforts from Murillo, Nicolo Savona and Morgan Gibbs-White, to leave a shellshocked Arne Slot potentially fearing for his job.

After Alexis Mac Allister and Milos Kerkez probably both should've scored, disaster struck for the hosts as Murillo slotted home after Liverpool failed to clear from a corner. It was a controversial moment in a first-half that was full of them, with VAR ruling that Dan Ndoye wasn't interfering with Alisson depsite being very close to the Brazilian goalkeeper's eyeline. Moments later it could've easily been two - Igor Jesus somewhat harshly being adjudged to have handled the ball after controlling Ibrahima Konate's hopeless attempt to clear, with referee Andy Madley blowing to penalise the Forest forward and chalk off his goal.

If Slot had given his side a rollicking at the half-time break it didn't seem to have an impact as Forest came racing out of the blocks and found a second - Savona getting on the scoresheet this time after some suspect defending allowed Neco Williams to escape in the box and find the Italian completely free. It would get worse before the end too, with Gibbs-White making it 3-0 after 78 minutes to stun Anfield into silence and leave Slot wondering what on earth he needs do to get the Reds back on track.

GOAL rates Liverpool's players from Anfield...

Alisson Becker (5/10):

His first outing since September and could do nothing to stop any of the goals.

Dominik Szoboszlai (3/10):

Stationed at right-back but drifted inside and further forward to create the extra man. Should've got a lot tighter to Murillo for the first Forest goal.

Ibrahima Konate (3/10):

VAR saved him after he was caught out by Igor Jesus for the controversial handball incident. Sacrificed soon after half-time when Liverpool fell two behind.

Virgil van Dijk (3/10):

On his heels as the ball flew past him from Anderson's corner, leading to Murillo's opening goal. A visiting side shouldn't be scoring three at Anfield on his watch.

Milos Kerkez (3/10):

Should've done far better with a huge first-half chance perfectly set-up for him by Salah. Was a bit hit-and-hope with his crossing as Liverpool looked for a way back and was eventually hooked.

Ryan Gravenberch (3/10):

Heart-in-mouth moment when the studs in his right boot somewhat inadvertently made contact with Ibrahim Sangare's calf but VAR chose not to get involved. Nowhere near as dominant and majestic in midfield as he usually is.

Alexis Mac Allister (3/10):

Thought he'd scored in the first half only for Elliot Anderson's head to deny him a certain goal. Was weak in the challenge as Williams somehow escaped him to create Forest's second.

Curtis Jones (3/10):

Didn't contribute nearly enough. Caught in possession and at one point in the first half was turned all ends up by Anderson, an emblematic moment showing where both are in the England World Cup squad stakes.

Mohamed Salah (5/10):

Flashes of brilliance at times, including the mazy run that set-up the Kerkez chance but had very few opportunities to cut in and shoot on that lethal left foot as Forest defenders gobbled him up.

Alexander Isak (2/10): 

Hardly had a kick. Still without a Premier League goal for Liverpool and he wasn't even close to breaking his duck here, with Slot deciding enough was enough after 68 minutes.

Cody Gakpo (5/10):

Looked a constant threat in the first-half with his driving runs but faded in the second. Fell asleep as Savona ran off him to score the visitors' second.

Hugo Ekitike (5/10):

Brought on for Konate but had little impact.

Federico Chiesa (5/10):

Replaced Isak but couldn't turn the tide, smashing one presentable chance over the bar.

Andy Robertson (4/10):

On for Kerkez with a little over 20 minutes left and couldn't get anywhere near Omari Hutchinson as he cut inside and shot to force the third goal.

Rio Ngumoha (N/A):

On late on and it was game over by that point.

Arne Slot (3/10):

An absolute shocker of a result. He would've expected to beat Forest at home to try to get things moving back in the right direction but this was truly the stuff of nightmares. The heat's now really on and things will need to change, and quickly. Dropping Isak wouldn't be the worst place to start...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester City have been fined £3 million by the Premier League over the last two seasons for delaying kick-offs to 30 matches after half-time. The club were forced to pay £2m at the end of the 2023-24 campaign and £1m last term for taking too long to emerge after the break following Pep Guardiola's lengthy team talks. The coach has also been warned about holding press conferences too late in the day.

The Telegraph has reported that 22 of City's 38 Premier League games in 2023-24 were delayed City, with eight of their matches in 2024-25 falling foul of the league's guidelines on half-time breaks. The league states that kicking off on time helps ""ensure the organisation of the competition is set at the highest possible professional standard"" as well as assisting broadcasters. 

Guardiola, however, was unapologetic about the delays and said that musicians performing at matches such as the Champions League should be fined when causing a delay to kick off, as happened when Burna Boy appeared before City met Inter in the 2023 final in Istanbul. He also said that the Premier League's rules on press conferences led to him holding his latest briefing ahead of the next match against Newcastle on Friday at 9am.

Guardiola told a press conference: ""We paid a lot of money as I'm late at half-time, but when we played in the Champions League final they had a show before the game and they are always late. They have to fine the singers! That is why I decided 9am and the journalists have had their breakfast and will need to take a coffee. I arrive one minute later but the rules are the rules. We are training later and if we train at 12 until 1.30, I cannot be here [at the press conference] in time. The Premier League don't allow me at 2pm. The club said if I don't start by 2pm they will fine me or fine the club.""

Guardiola extended his congratulations to Erling Haaland after Norway secured qualification for the 2026 World Cup, their first time reaching the tournament since 1998. ""He's incredible this season, he's breaking all the records, personal and individual records, Premier League records, for Norway,"" Guardiola said. ""Happy for him, his national team, many of the squad for Norway weren't even born the last time Norway were in the World Cup. For the country it's incredible, an incredible qualification scoring a lot of goals. As a football player, world-class player, he deserves to play a World Cup and live the experience. I'm so happy for him.""

Haaland scored his 99th Premier League goal in City's last game against Liverpool and he can hit his century of goals in England's top flight against Newcastle on Saturday at St James' Park. Haaland is being tipped to go on and beat Magpies' legend Alan Shearer as the league's all-time top scorer if he sees out his 10-year contract with City. Guardiola - who declared his admiration for Shearer's goal tally for Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle - believes he has a good chance of toppling the former England striker.

He said: ""His [Shearer's] quality to score goals in big teams. He won the Premier League, but not in the teams that everybody knows. The guys who have been making numbers for a long time, not just one or two seasons, I always admire them because it means resilience and being there every season.

""They don't score goals for one season. They do it over a lot of seasons and that means being incredibly focused, professional and you have to love the game. For Erling to be there with Alan Shearer is really good for both of them. You don't have to know mathematics to realise that if he [Haaland] stays a long, long time and continues this average, he will be close to Harry Kane and close to Alan Shearer.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","HUGE drama at Anfield! Why controversial Nottingham Forest goal was given despite Liverpool fans going crazy as Igor Jesus is then left absolutely fuming by VAR handball call","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/huge-drama-anfield-controversial-nottingham-forest-goal-given-despite-liverpool-fans-going-crazy-igor-jesus/blt8b5a1563c7205f27","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 16:59:25 GMT","

Two contentious first half refereeing decisions made headlines at Anfield on Saturday. The VAR first saw no reason to chalk off Murillo's opener, despite Liverpool's players protesting that an offside player interfered with Alisson's line of sight. Moments later, Igor Jesus' effort was disallowed for handball, despite replays showing the ball did not touch the striker's arm. 

The Brazilian centre back opened the scoring with a low driven effort after Liverpool failed to clear their lines from a corner. Forest forward Dan Ndoye appeared to obscure Alisson's view of the shot while in an offside position, triggering protests from the Liverpool players.

However, a post from the official Premier League Match Centre account said the goal stood, as Ndoye was not considered to be impeding the Liverpool shot stopper. 

The tweet read: ""#LIVNFO – 33'

The referee's call of goal was checked and confirmed by VAR – with it deemed that Ndoye was not in the line of vision of Alisson and did not make an action that impacted an opponent."" 

The decision will anger Liverpool fans, after Virgil van Dijk's goal during their 3-0 defeat to Manchester City earlier this month was ruled out, after Andry Roberston was adjudged to have interfered with Gianluigi Donnarumma.

Just moments later, the VABR was called into action once again. This time, with Forest on the attack, Ibrahim Konate's clearance struck Igor Jesus, allowing the Brazillian to turn the ball past his compatriot in the host's goal. However, the goal was ruled out as the on-field referee ruled the ball had struck the striker's arm. Despite the replau showing the ball did not clearly strikeIgor Jesus' arm, the on-field decision stood. Again, the Premier League Match Centre account shared an immediate message. Their post read: 

“#LIVNFO – 35' The referee's call of no goal was checked and confirmed by VAR – with it deemed that Jesus accidentally handled the ball before scoring.”

Speaking in the aftermath of Murillo's goal, former Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""If you follow the mantra of last time when Robertson ducked out the way of the ball (against Man City), and here the ball goes through the legs of the player in front of Alisson. Why did that go against us last week and the opposite against us this week?"" 

John Bennett, the BBC's Final Score reporter at Anfield for the game, said: ""The Liverpool fans around me can't believe Murillo's goal wasn't disallowed due to Dan Ndoye being offside in front of Alisson when the ball went in. But the VAR felt he wasn't in the keeper's line of vision, which is a huge talking point.

""Then Igor Jesus had a goal disallowed for handball but it's very hard to see if he did handle it on the replay. Both managers have been unhappy with the referee & Forest coach Ian Woan was booked. The second half will be intense for both teams and the officials.""

Despite the VAR officials ruling in their favour later in the half, the Liverpool fans will feel especially hard done-by in light of the controversy in their recent defeat at the Etihad. 

The high-spirited debate around the quality of officiating in the Premier League will only intensify in light of this latest drama at Anfield. The Reds went on to lose the game 3-0, as goals from Murillo, Nicolo Savona, and Morgan Gibbs-White gave Sean Dyche's side one of the most impressive wins of his Premier League career. Now, Slot and his men will be looking to find a way to put a chastening defeat behind them. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'Players weren't serious'","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/jose-mourinho-says-wanted-nine-substitutions-in-explosive-rant-benfica/blt53e7f7a93fee8271","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 12:57:49 GMT","

Jose Mourinho was far from happy with his Benfica side, as they scraped through the fourth round of the Taca de Portugal with a 2-0 win over minnows Atletico CP. The Special One unleashed an explosive post-match rant against his starting eleven, claiming he would have made nine substitutions at half time, if allowed. He went on to call some of his players' attitudes ""unacceptable"".

The fourth round tie pitted one of Portugal's most vaunted clubs against relative minnows; Atletico are currently plying their trade in the third tier of the country's league pyramid. Despite the gulf in stature, the minnows frustrated a lacklustre Benfica side for the opening 45 minutes, keeping the game scoreless going into the break. 

That prompted Mourinho into a change of formation and four changes at the break. Benfica's superiority eventually told, with the record 26-time cup winners taking the spoils thanks to a 73rd minute header from Ricard Rios and a Vangelis Pavlidis penalty a few minutes later. 

Despite their progress in the competition, Mourinho gave his players both barrels in his post-match interview, lambasting their first half performance and questioning their commitment. 

The two-time Champions League winning manager, who started his second spell as the Lisbon club's boss in September 2025, was frank in his response when questioned if his message was getting through to his players. While he did not shirk his responsibility in getting a tune out of the squad, he suggested his players were falling short in their duty towards him and the club's fanbase. 

Mourinho said: ""Atlético did an extraordinary job. I saw them play in Mafra in a league game, they played an extraordinary game and I realized they had the qualities to make the game difficult for us. But our first half was poor. And it was poor in the sense that it hurts me the most, which is the attitude. The attitude was poor. 

""There were many players who weren't serious and didn't approach things as they should have. At halftime I made four substitutions, but I wanted to make nine. With the players at halftime, I told the two who were taking the game seriously that I wanted to keep on the field. The other nine weren't. 

""In the second half we improved a lot, Atlético couldn't get out with the same quality anymore and it was only a matter of time before we scored. I was pleased with the second half because the attitude improved."" 

When asked how he changed things tactically to accomodate the switch in personnel, he commented: ""One thing has nothing to do with the other. What didn't work was the players who were on the field. I didn't want to single anyone out because that's something that should be done internally, but to remove some of the players I wanted to remove, it was necessary to change the system. And we had players who, from the first minute, weren't there. And that, to me, is unacceptable. I've already told some of them not to come knocking on my door asking why they aren't playing.""

In response to questions about his message failing to reach his new charges, the ex-Chelsea coach said: ""I think the message isn't just mine, it's a general one. From Benfica fans. In my case, I'm the coach and the one responsible. The players have a responsibility to me and to Benfica fans. And there are things regarding their attitude that are unacceptable.""

Mourinho took over at the Portuguese giants after the sacking of Bruno Lage. While Benfica have yet to lose a league game this season, a spate of draws, including three under Mourinho, have left them six points adrift of Porto in the Liga Portugal. 

Lage's dismissal came after they opened their Champions League campaign with a chastening 3-2 home defeat to Azerbaijani outfit Qarabag. Mouinrho has failed to engender a turnaround in European competition, with Benfica losing all three of their league phase games, most recently falling to a 1-0 defeat to Leverkusen at the Estadio da Luz.

Th ex-Real Madrid and Inter manager will hope his players react positively to his post-match comments, as they prepare for a crucial run of fixtures over the coming fortnight. Next Tuesday, the Eagles face off against Ajax in the Champions League. A Lisbon derby against Sporting on December 5 could determine who will mount a title challenge against Porto, while the arrival of Antonio Conte's Napoli on December 10 will present another stiff challenge in Europe.

Gianluigi Donnarumma has revealed how Erling Haaland convinced him to move from Paris Saint-Germain to Manchester City in the summer transfer window. The Italian goalkeeper left the European champions on deadline day to sign for the Premier League giants after falling out of favour under Luis Enrique, who had already signed Lucas Chevalier from Lille.

Since his move to City from Paris on deadline day, Donnarumma has built a close friendship with the club's star forward Haaland. In an interaction with the Daily Mail, the Italy international opened up on his close bond with the Norwegian goal machine as he said: ""I'd say we just got on well immediately. We have always respected each other, even before we met. We make a lot of banter about playing against each other in the national teams. I'd say they are in a better situation than us now, they have much more peace of mind. But there are still two games left to play. It will be difficult to face each other, as it will be difficult to play against him. I know how strong he is and what chances he can create. It will be hard to face him both as a player and as a friend.""

He also rated Haaland as a better player than former PSG team-mate Kylian Mbappe as he added: ""I think Erling does [have the hardest shot]. He is left-footed, so he is different from Kylian (Mbappe). They are both hard to play against. So it's complicated. But I would rather have Erling playing for my side.""

Speaking about Haaland and his move to City, Donnarumma told Sky Sports: ""He's a fantastic guy, so calm and he loves his family and being with them. We hit it off. There's that synergy there where there's just a natural feeling. Even when we played against each other, we were in touch and after the games we even spoke often.

""Then I had the opportunity to come here, he wrote to me. He pushed hard for me to come and I think him so much for that. He's truly a great friend - and it's a good thing I play with him because it's so difficult to be against him! He's an alien!""

The Italian custodian also thanked every member of the City squad for making him feel at home and helping him to adjust to the new conditions in the Premier League. Donnarumma has featured for Pep Guardiola's side in 12 matches across all competitions this season and has kept six clean sheets.

When asked about his performances, Donnarumma said: ""I'm a bit angry because I could have kept more. I didn't expect to have such a positive impact on the Premier League. But the team helped me a lot because the moment I arrived, they welcome me very well. They helped me a lot in the first games, especially the first one which was just three days in. In the first training session, it felt like I had been there for two years. The league is very different, there's a lot of running, a lot of intensity so I had to adapt immediately. But the team has been fundamental for me in these first few months.""

After a forgettable outing in the 2024-25 campaign, Guardiola's men are back in form in the current season. They had a minor setback at the start of the season, where they lost back-to-back league games against Tottenham and Brighton but have now bounced back in style and are just four points behind league leaders Arsenal. 

City will be back in action in the league on Saturday as they take on Newcastle United away from home. They would aim to win the clash and reduce their gap with the Gunners at the top of the table.

Check out our soccer expert's Paris Saint Germain vs Le Havre predictions, prior to Saturday's 3:05 pm ET Ligue 1 clash (11/22).

PSG are currently dealing with plenty of injury concerns, but they are still expected to get the job done against Le Havre.

PSG are likely to be without both of their fullbacks, as Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes, who are recovering from injuries. On top of that, Desire Doue and Ousmane Dembele are also unavailable. So, the hosts are far from full strength, but they still have plenty of quality players.

Clean sheets haven't been a regular occurrence lately, with just three in their last seven league games, but they could secure one here. So far, Le Havre have scored more than once in only three of their 12 games, and PSG will be confident of preventing them from doing so again. Despite missing some defenders, the home side are a strong outfit.

Meanwhile, the visitors have Andy Logbo and Mbwana Samatta, who are uncertain to play due to injury. With only 13 goals scored in 12 games, Les Ciel et Marine are amongst the lowest-scoring teams in the division. They'll have to be at their best to find a way to score against Luis Enrique's men.

This season, PSG have taken a more business efficient approach. They've scored 3+ goals six times across their 17 games in all competitions, and 4+ just three times. They've also lost only twice, though, and one of those was against Bayern Munich.

So, given the players missing, we may not see the Parisiens put Le Havre to the sword - but we are expecting them to win. They still have more than enough attacking quality to defeat Didier Digard's men, even if they have to spend time breaching their defence. 

Les Rouge-et-Bleu average two goals per game in Ligue 1 after 12 matches and are likely to maintain that average.

Enrique may be without Ballon d'Or winner Dembele and the exciting talent of Doue, but he's not short of options. Goncalo Ramos has five goals this season, and Bradley Barcola has four - the latter could return this weekend, too, after being rested against Lyon. Midfielders such as Joao Neves and Vitinha have seven goals between them as well.

Ramos is seen as the bookies' favourite to get on the scoresheet here, but we're looking at Khvicha Kvaratskhelia as a value pick. He's got nine G/A so far if the Club World Cup is included, and one of each in his last two league games. With others out, the Georgian is likely to perform well and score.

Paris Saint-Germain have not played at their best very often this season, but they still sit at the top of the table. A crucial and dramatic victory over Lyon before the break created a small gap over Marseille, and they'll want to maintain that distance. They're unbeaten in seven Ligue 1 games ahead of this tie.

Le Havre, meanwhile, are in decent form, having gone unbeaten in their last four matches ahead of their visit to the Parc des Princes. They're not scoring plenty, but have lost just twice since the start of September, and only once in their last eight. They aim to frustrate PSG, but have lost every time they've faced one of the current top six this season.

PSG expected lineup: Chevalier, Zaire-Emery, Marquinhos, Pacho, Hernandez, Vitinha, Neves, Ruiz, Barcola, Ramos, Kvaratskhelia

Le Havre expected lineup: Diaw, Nego, Sangante, Lloris, Zouaoui, Seko, Toure, Ndiaye, Khadra, Mambimbi, Soumare","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Mason Greenwood told he's ‘becoming a complete player' after firing brace against Nice to send Marseille back to top of Ligue 1","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/mason-greenwood-complete-player-brace-against-nice-send-marseille-back-to-top-of-ligue-1/blt21c9cfb3f5ac7bd9","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 10:11:03 GMT","

Former Manchester United star Mason Greenwood has been told he is 'becoming a complete player' after starring with a brace in Marseille's 5-1 demolition of Nice in Ligue 1 on Friday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Timothy Weah and Igor Paixao were also on target as Robert De Zerbi's side registered a thumping victory and climbed up to the top of the table, overtaking Paris Saint-Germain. 

Greenwood has been in prolific form for Marseille since joining the club from Manchester United. After ending his maiden campaign in France with 22 goals in 36 appearances across all competitions, the former Red Devils star picked up where he left off last season. The 24-year-old has already scored 10 goals in Ligue 1 this season and 11 in all competitions. He also recently won the Ligue 1 Player of the Month award for October, marking the second time he has received the accolade since his move to the French league. 

On Friday, Greenwood hit the target twice as Marseille leapfrogged PSG in the Ligue 1 table to clinch the top position after a magnificent 5-1 win over Nice away from home. 

Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi was understandably elated after the brilliant result as he hailed Greenwood's performance by saying: ""We played well against a tough team, Nice. For them, it's a derby. It was a very tense match; we needed to play better in the second half. Everything's fine, we scored 5 goals and we're provisionally top of Ligue 1. We need to get some injured players back (Aguerd, Medina). That shouldn't be an excuse. We have to see what we can do in these circumstances. Greenwood? He's doing a good job. He's scoring goals, providing assists. He's more involved in the game. He's becoming a complete player.""

The former Brighton manager added: ""I was hoping for this result. It was a tough match, a derby. Both teams wanted to do well. We can still play better. I'm not satisfied with the quality of our play. Even though we won 5-1, we can do better. I'm certain this team can and must play better because it has more quality than it showed tonight. Despite the 5-1 scoreline, I expect even more. I'm thinking about the number of people we made happy. We have strong players; the only thing that worries me is the injury list. It's a real morale booster, we're top of the league tonight. We need to put that aside, there's Newcastle on Tuesday, Toulouse this weekend. We need to remember how we can improve. We need to maintain this momentum. We can't always play at the same level with the succession of matches. It's up to me and the physical staff to manage it. Weah? We missed him against Atalanta; he's a unique player, with a different profile than Murillo. We have a lot of respect for him; he needs to play with more courage and personality.""

Greenwood doubled his team's lead just past the half-hour mark after Aubameyang opened the scoring in derby. Following his first goal, the entire Marseille team celebrated in front of Nice Ultras, which triggered an extreme action. According to Ligue 1+, Marseille defender Emerson Palmieri was struck with a lighter that was thrown by a Nice supporter.

The violence at the stand soon entered the pitch as a melee broke out involving Marseille goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli and Nice defender Ali Al-Abdi. The two substitutes were then cautioned. 

Earlier this month, the Daily Mail reported that Greenwood still dreams of making a comeback for the England national team despite being blacklisted by the FA and head coach Thomas Tuchel from selection. The winger's last and only appearance for the Three Lions came in 2020 in a Nations League clash against Iceland.

However, with only months left before the 2026 World Cup, Greenwood's comeback into the national team looks improbable currently, with Tuchel having said back in September he is not being considered for selection.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Las Vegas Grand Prix

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Lando Norris took his third consecutive pole position after overcoming wet conditions in Qualifying for the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

Lando Norris claimed pole position for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, the McLaren driver and Drivers' Championship leader mastering wet conditions to finish ahead of Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz while title rival Oscar Piastri settled for fifth.

It marks three consecutive pole positions for Norris, whose 1m 47.934s was nearly three-tenths faster than Verstappen during a Qualifying session which remained wet throughout.

Williams' Sainz put in another strong Qualifying performance and finished ahead of George Russell, the Mercedes driver having topped both Q1 and Q2 sessions in the worst of the conditions.

Piastri was left in fifth having gone into the run-off area at Turn 12 on his final effort after going wheel-to-wheel with Isack Hadjar's Racing Bulls.

The second Racing Bulls machine of Liam Lawson finished P6, as the top-10 was completed by Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin, Hadjar, Charles Leclerc's Ferrari, which also ran deep at Turn 12 on his final effort, and Pierre Gasly's Alpine.

Qualifying results

FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN LAS VEGAS GRAND PRIX 2025

Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg missed the cut for Q3 after finishing P11 in the middle segment of Qualifying, ahead of Lance Stroll (Aston Martin), the two Haas' of Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman, as well as Alpine's Franco Colapinto.

Alex Albon was eliminated in Q1 after hitting the barrier on the exit of Turn 16 in the final minutes which broke the front-right suspension on his Williams.

He was joined in the drop zone by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda, as Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton finished last of the 20 runners, the seven-time World Champion unable to extract performance on the wet tyre.

Free Practice 3 earlier in the day had given drivers and teams a glimpse of what running might be like in the wet around the high-speed street circuit, but a damp track surface was replaced by much worse conditions for Qualifying due to persistent rain fall prior to the session.

The majority of drivers immediately headed out at the green light to explore the treacherous conditions, the Aston Martins of Alonso and Stroll fitted with the full wet tyre compared with many on the intermediate rubber.

But the high level of standing water meant those on the intermediate tyre were soon in the pit lane for the full wet compound as drivers started to run deep into the run-off area at Turn 14, which would continue throughout Qualifying.

Lap times tumbled throughout the 18-minute segment as drivers explored the limits and track conditions marginally improved, Russell eventually finishing fastest on a 1m 53.144s – more than 19 seconds slower than his time-topping effort in FP3.

It left the Mercedes driver three-tenths clear of Verstappen, with Alonso, Stroll, Gasly and Piastri completing the top-six as the conditions produced a mixed-up order, with Norris down in P13.

Bearman just made it through to Q2 in P15 despite having run deep at Turn 14 on his final lap and made head-on contact with the barrier in the run-off area before rejoining.

In the drop zone, Albon was unable to progress after clouting the wall on the exit of Turn 16 in the final minutes which broke the front-right suspension on his Williams as he recovered into the pit lane.

Antonelli, Bortoleto and Tsunoda also missed the cut, as did Hamilton, who complained over the radio that he ""couldn't get the tyres to work"" as he finished nearly four seconds adrift of Russell's benchmark.

Knocked out: Albon, Antonelli, Bortoleto, Tsunoda, Hamilton

All cars remained on the wet tyre at the start of Q2 as Norris, Stroll, Verstappen and Piastri all occupied top spot in the opening minutes, with drivers putting in continuous laps in the tricky conditions.

Russell once again topped another session, lowering the best time to a 1m 50.935 which left him less than two-tenths clear of Hadjar, with Sainz, Norris, Verstappen and Lawson completing the top-six.

Gasly jumped up to P7 with his final effort and led Alonso and Leclerc, with Piastri pivotally just making it through to the final part of Qualifying in P10.

Hulkenberg was the first driver to miss the cut for Q3 by six-tenths and was joined by Stroll, who with three minutes remaining was the only driver to switch to the intermediate tyre.

The Haas duo of Ocon and Bearman were also eliminated, as well as Colapinto, the Argentinian saving a huge moment of oversteer through the left-right-left of Turns 14/15/16.

Knocked out: Hulkenberg, Stroll, Ocon, Bearman, Colapinto

Conditions had improved enough in the final 12-minute segment for all 10 drivers to head out on the intermediate tyre, with it becoming clear that the best of the conditions would be at the very end of proceedings.

Sainz led the way initially after the opening fastest laps, with Leclerc running deep at Turn 14 on his second flying effort as Piastri went quickest with a 1m 49.136s.

Norris responded with a faster lap of his own, which was usurped by Sainz and then Verstappen in the final minute as Piastri was the last of the runners to cross the line for their final lap, giving the title protagonist the best of the conditions in theory.

Norris jumped back to the top with a 1m 47.934s, despite nearly dropping it into the barrier on the exit of Turn 16, and that would prove good enough for his third consecutive pole position.

Verstappen was left nearly three-tenths in arrears from Sainz and Russell, with Piastri only P5 after being held up by a yellow flag ahead before running deep at Turn 12 on his final effort, appearing to go wheel-to-wheel with Hadjar's Racing Bulls.

The second Racing Bulls of Lawson finished P6 as the top-10 was completed by Alonso, Hadjar, Leclerc and Gasly.

It was stressful, stressful as hell!,"" said polesitter Norris. ""I didn't know no-one else was going to get a lap after me.

""I knew I felt like the first two sectors were good but it's so slippery out there. As soon as you hit the kerb a little bit wrong like I did, you snap one way, you lose the car the other way, close to hitting the wall but good enough for P1 today. Not the nicest of conditions but I'm happy it stopped raining and we could get a good Qualifying.""

The 2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix is set to begin at 2000 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from the Las Vegas Strip Circuit.

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Lawrence Barretto combs through the data after Thursday's practice sessions at the Las Vegas Strip Circuit.

McLaren have never finished higher than sixth in either Qualifying or the Grand Prix in Las Vegas – but Lando Norris' strong pace in Friday practice suggested they have the speed to significantly improve on that record this weekend. Is it enough to fight for the win, though?

Lando Norris was quickest in second free practice, and while most of his main rivals – including team mate Oscar Piastri – didn't manage to get a soft tyre run because of a red flag for a comparison, it's clear the papaya cars are very much in the fight.

""We have a better feeling in the car than what we had last year, so that's a positive,"" said Norris. ""I felt that from lap one. Of course, not a lot of running in the end, and not really any high-fuel running – but the pace is clearly there.""

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Lewis Hamilton qualified slowest on outright pace for the first time in his F1 career at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton conceded it “can't get much worse than that” after qualifying slowest on outright pace for the first time in his Formula 1 career at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

Hamilton recently described his maiden season with Ferrari as a “nightmare” after the Scuderia suffered a double DNF in the Sao Paulo Grand Prix last time out, but things took a further turn in Las Vegas.

Having looked strong throughout practice, subsequent rain and a wet track for Qualifying threw a spanner in the works for the drivers with Hamilton unable to extract any pace, leaving him last on the grid.

""I just don't really have words for it,” said Hamilton following his Q1 exit. “It's obviously not good enough and I didn't have any - I couldn't get any temperature into the tyres. I just had a lot of understeer and then I think one of my front brakes was glazed, so I was really struggling to stop in the corners.""

Hamilton's result marks not only an unwanted career first for the seven-time World Champion, but also the first time a Ferrari has been slowest in Qualifying since the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009.

In the drier conditions in final practice, Hamilton had shown strong pace, ending that session fifth fastest.

Of the drop off in the wet, he added: ""It's very annoying, of course, because I felt in [FP3] that the car was feeling awesome. Honestly, I thought it was going to be a great day, but it's turned out to be the worst. So it obviously can't get much worse than that.""

At the end of Q1, there was also confusion as to whether Hamilton had crossed the line in time to continue for another final effort, with the seven-time champion telling Sky Sports F1: “I had to have a lift, and when I came to the line, it was red.”

The Ferrari driver also appeared to hit a dislodged cone in Q1, which may have unwittingly hampered his progress in the session.

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Amid mixed conditions, George Russell led the way for Mercedes during the third and final practice session at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

George Russell set the pace during third and final practice at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, the Mercedes driver leading the way in a session that featured tricky conditions – while both McLarens ended the hour at the bottom of the timesheets.

After some disruption during Thursday's second practice session amid two red flags for track maintenance, Friday's final hour offered a crucial opportunity for the drivers to prepare ahead of Qualifying – and it was Oscar Piastri that was the first to venture out on intermediate tyres, the track still damp following earlier rainfall.

Amid the low grip conditions, it was a steady start to FP3 as more drivers started to head out on the green-walled Pirelli compound. There was a moment for Alex Albon, the Williams heading into the run-off area at Turn 5 before making his way back onto the track.

While some cars remained in their garages, Piastri had put himself at the top of the timesheets by the 15-minute mark – but he was soon displaced by the other McLaren of Lando Norris, the Briton setting a lap of 1m 43.078s.

Carlos Sainz, meanwhile, suggested over the radio that the time for slick tyres was getting near, but nobody had yet made the switch. Elsewhere, Yuki Tsunoda – who finished ahead of Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen in Thursday's FP1 – was asked to box due to an issue with the car.

With just over half an hour left on the clock, Verstappen was warned that rain could be on the way in 10 minutes. Conditions certainly still appeared difficult, but championship leader Norris was the first to take a gamble by bolting on the soft tyres.

Practice 3 results

FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN LAS VEGAS GRAND PRIX 2025

There were a few dicey moments for the Briton as he navigated the still drying track. Kimi Antonelli's race engineer Pete Bonnington commented that “the soft tyre looks a million miles off at the moment” – but that did not seem to deter Piastri from also running the C5 rubber.

As others started to make the switch to slicks, Lewis Hamilton headed the timesheets via an effort of 1m 42.809s. It was not entirely smooth sailing for the seven-time World Champion, however, with the Ferrari racer having a close call after narrowly avoiding running into the rear of Liam Lawson's Racing Bulls at Turn 14 – an incident that was later noted by Race Control before it was decided that no further investigation was needed.

With 20 minutes remaining, four drivers – that being Fernando Alonso, Lance Stroll, Pierre Gasly and Nico Hulkenberg – had yet to put a lap on the board, while the times continued to rapidly tumble at the front.

The track became busy as the session entered its final segment, with all of the pack heading out on the soft tyres. Verstappen headed the board as the last 10 minutes ticked down, the Red Bull driver pumping in a 1m 35.646s.

Lawson was a surprise name to slot in at the top in the dying minutes – going just 0.009s faster than Verstappen – but that did not last long, the order again quickly evolving in the last moments. While Verstappen soon returned to P1, he was displaced by Russell, the Briton leading the way via his effort of 1m 34.054s.

Meanwhile, Verstappen – who was 0.227s off Russell's time – voiced his frustrations about the traffic ahead after running wide, while Albon followed in third on the timesheets following a frenetic end to the session that saw more than one hairy moment.

Isack Hadjar was fourth for Racing Bulls, followed by Hamilton, Antonelli, Lawson and the Aston Martins of Stroll and Alonso, with Alpine's Gasly completing the top 10. Ollie Bearman claimed P11 in the Haas from the Williams of Sainz, Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, the other Haas of Esteban Ocon and Charles Leclerc for Ferrari.

Franco Colapinto classified 16th in the Alpine, ahead of Hulkenberg for Kick Sauber and Tsunoda. The McLarens of Piastri and Norris, meanwhile, ended the session at the bottom of the pack in 19th and 20th respectively, both cars having seemingly experienced technical issues that left them unable to set a clean lap in the latter stages of the session.

Focus will now switch to the all-important Qualifying, which is set to get underway at 2000 local time.

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

George Russell topped final practice at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with Max Verstappen second while his McLaren title rivals sat at the foot of the time sheet.

George Russell led the way in Free Practice 3 at the Las Vegas Grand Prix as McLaren hit technical trouble in the final running before Qualifying.

The session got under way on a drying track with drivers all utilizing the intermediate tyres in the early stages. As slick tyres became the order of the day, the times tumbled at a rate of knots, the fastest times coming as the chequered flag was taken.

Max Verstappen looked set to go to the top of the timesheets, but traffic forced him onto the wet surface with a trip into the run off the result, moments after Russell had set his session-best 1m 34.054s.

Alex Albon and Isack Hadjar continued to show pace in the top four, with Lewis Hamilton fifth.

Telemetry issues for Oscar Piastri and a separate problem for Lando Norris left the title-chasing McLaren pair 19th and 20th.

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

The drivers and team report back on all the action from Qualifying for the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

McLaren saw their cars prop up the order in FP3, with Piastri 19th and Norris 20th. That was thanks to twin issues on both cars, Norris suffering an electrical problem while Piastri's car lost telemetry. Going into Qualifying somewhat on the back foot, Norris then excelled and looked in the mix from word go. Piastri had to work harder to escape Q1 and Q2, only making it into the top 10 by the skin of his teeth. Once into Q3, both cars looked competitive on the inters but it was Norris who nailed his final lap to grab yet another pole. Piastri had to abort his last run due to yellow flags and was only fifth.

Lando Norris, 1st, 1:47.934

“P1! Very pleased with the result from Quali today. Pole in such tricky conditions was definitely not easy, but that makes the result even better. We certainly weren't expecting this coming into the weekend, but we've definitely taken a step forward from last year and the confidence has been building as the weekend has gone on. Full focus now turns to the race and delivering another strong performance.”

Oscar Piastri, 5th, 1:48.961

""Tough end to the session with the Yellow Flag on the final lap. I felt like we had really good pace, so it's disappointing, but at least we can say we were fast. There should be a few overtaking opportunities tomorrow and it's Vegas, so anything can happen. Let's see what we can do.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“First of all, let me acknowledge the general standard of driving in today's Qualifying session. Competing in such conditions, with a wet track and very low temperatures, on a tricky circuit like this, with a few interruptions, and putting on a show like tonight's demonstrates the calibre of this group of drivers.

“Lando can be very proud of his Pole position. He drove extraordinarily well throughout the session, adapting perfectly to the grip conditions that changed lap after lap. The result today is particularly significant because it comes on a track that has certainly not been kind to us in the past. It means that the preparation work we have done is paying off, well done to the team for their efforts.

“It is a shame for Oscar, who, without the Yellow Flags on his last flying lap in Q3, could probably have qualified third. However, Qualifying is only the first step this weekend - the points will be awarded tomorrow evening, and we are well aware that our opponents are very strong, especially on this track.""

Tsunoda was pushing Verstappen hard in final practice, but come Qualifying, the Japanese racer struggled in the wet conditions and exited at the first time of asking. Verstappen looked exceptionally quick on the full wets, but admitted the car lacked slightly on the inters, which were bolted on in Q3. Nonetheless, he did enough to grab a spot on the front row, and is well placed to attack his McLaren rival for the win in Vegas.

Max Verstappen, 2nd, 1;48.257

”I think we executed Qualifying quite well today. The conditions weren't fun, it was really slippery on the track and it felt like driving on ice. I love driving in the wet but this was too much and you had to be super careful. It was very low grip and you had to be consistent and make no mistakes, but you just trust your instinct and feeling within the car and need to trust what you are doing. Despite this, we maximised the potential of the car and we did everything as best we could, so that was all positive. Q1 and Q2 is always tricky to get right but we did well and in Q3 I think we just lacked a bit of grip to fight further up and we weren't in contention for Pole. Second is good and the focus is, of course, on tomorrow and it will be about who can keep the tyres alive, which we haven't been the best at. We will see how we perform on the Hard compound as we have no information on it yet. The biggest concern is making sure we have the race pace: it will be difficult but if we have the opportunity we will go for it.""

Yuki Tsunoda, 19th, 1:56.798

”I just didn't have any grip throughout the session, it felt like complete ice underneath me and I was wheel spinning. I knew it was weird, and I wasn't sure what had happened with the tyre set but it felt very strange. Last time I used the extreme tyre it didn't feel like that and I was super quick, this time I was three seconds off everyone else, so I didn't understand. Clearly something wasn't right and wasn't working properly, I could feel that. Now I know my pressures were way off where they should have been, which explains the issues I had throughout Q1, but I did whatever I could in the circumstances. It's tough and it's a shame because up until Quali we have had amazing pace all weekend, probably the best pace I have had since joining the Team. I have to try tomorrow to get something out of the race.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

""Once again, Max had a very strong Qualifying and in super tricky conditions as well. He got into the right tempo in Q1 and Q2 on a very wet track and he was strong on the Inters in Q3 when it cleared up a little. He put himself in a position to fight for Pole, which we unfortunately missed out on tonight, but the front row is a still a very significant showing of the pace we have in the car. P2 certainly gives us something to play with tomorrow.  With Yuki, it is on us. We made a big mistake with his tyre pressure which meant that he was out there with a setting that basically gave him no chance to be competitive, so we as a Team, apologise to him for that. This sort of thing should not happen, but it did, so the best we can do is learn from it and come back stronger. He's been in a really good rhythm all weekend, so it is painful to have taken his chance away. Tomorrow should make for an interesting race day.""

Albon impressed throughout practice and looked the pick of the two Williams drivers. But he was the only one to properly crash in the treacherous Q1 conditions, losing control out of the corner to hit the walls with his front tyre. He did limp back to the pits, but exited in P16 and left the team a rebuild job with the suspension and floor likely taking on some damage.

That left Sainz to fly the flag for the team which he did brilliantly, making Q3 and once there nailing his last lap to grab a slot in the top three. But during Q2, he had run off track and rejoined in front of Stroll. The stewards had a look at that, but opted to take no further action, much to the relief of the Grove-based team.

Alex Albon, 16th, 1:56.220

""A frustrating qualifying result as we have been quick all weekend. The conditions were tricky out there and I was experiencing some random aquaplaning across different laps. The laps I was able to do in clean air I was happy with, but unfortunately, we never really got a clean lap without a yellow flag. There was a lot going on through the last few corners with various flags and to get to the line on time, and I had a snap and we ultimately got caught out. It is frustrating as we should've been in Q3 today as well. Hopefully it is dry tomorrow, but I'm confident that we have a good car and can fight back in the race.""

Carlos Sainz, 3rd, 1:48.296

""Very happy after one of the trickiest qualifying's of the year! From my first lap today, I've felt at home with the car. Every time I was closing in on my lap we were at the top of the field and I was enjoying myself out there in these conditions. Despite opening my last attempt a bit early, I knew I had a shot at pole and for a moment I thought I had it! But two very quick cars behind me were able to improve and edge us out. Still, P3 is an amazing result for the team and we have to feel proud of the job done. Our target for tomorrow will be to remain in position, whilst being conscious we have some very quick cars behind us and it's easy to overtake here. We'll make ourselves as wide as possible and give it our all. Vamos!""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""What a fantastic qualifying from Carlos – really, really impressive in quite difficult conditions. And yet it wasn't just one lap, he was able to put the car consistently in the top three throughout most of the sessions. Great work by the team, getting the car working across a range of slick, intermediate and extreme wet tyres this weekend and it bodes well for the race tomorrow whatever conditions come our way. With Alex, it's bitterly disappointing because he has been quick all weekend. He made a small mistake but small mistakes get punished in Vegas. The incident could have been prevented with improved communications, and information from the team – we win and lose as a team and will come back stronger with Alex tomorrow. Looking forward to tomorrow's race, clearly we can't predict whether it's going to rain or not but given our performance so far we look competitive across a range of conditions – I'm just looking forward to racing.""

It was a mixed bag for Mercedes in Las Vegas. Both drivers looked quick and expected to challenge for the front rows if not pole. But Antonelli's Qualifying ended early, the youngster unable to extract enough grip in the wet Q1 segment to move forward. Russell did make Q3 and flirted with P1 throughout Qualifying, but when it came to it, he just did not have the pace for the front row. Starting fourth with a tow off the line is still a handy place to be for last year's winner here.

George Russell, 4th, 1;48.803

""Unfortunately I suffered a power steering issue midway through Q3 and that cost us a shot at the front row. Looking at the pace of Lando (Norris) in the McLaren, I'm not convinced that we had the pace to match him and take pole, but we could definitely have been best of the rest. That is particularly true as we had been fastest in Q1 and Q2, so we had good speed in the car.

""Starting P4 isn't the ideal place to be lining up but we've seen in the first two editions of the race here that plenty can happen. I think we can fight with those ahead and be in the mix for the podium. The weather is expected to be dry tomorrow and warmer than we've seen over Thursday and Friday. That will definitely have an effect and adds another unknown to what is likely to be an intriguing Grand Prix.""

Kimi Antonelli, 17th, 1:56.314

""That was a tough qualifying session. It was incredibly tricky for everyone out there with very little grip. The circuit was improving lap-by-lap and it was crucial to just keep pushing to maintain temperature in the tyres. My last lap of Q1 was looking strong but I locked up at the end of the straight and that was my session done. It is a big shame as our pace has been good all weekend and we could have been fighting at the front.

""Whilst it puts us on the back foot for Saturday's race, we looked to have good pace in practice on Thursday. Hopefully we can put that to use and gain as many positions as possible. We're in a tight battle for P2 in the Constructors' and several of our competitors are also out of position. I'm still confident we can fight for decent points and that is certainly going to be our aim.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""We entered qualifying with plenty of promise but unfortunately couldn't turn that into as strong a result as our pace suggested. The conditions were difficult for all, and we certainly weren't the only ones to get caught out, but it is nevertheless frustrating.

""The final lap of each segment of qualifying, as the track improved, was key. Whilst George improved and went quickest in Q1, Kimi suffered a lock-up on that critical effort and his session was over. George then used the same set of Wet tyres he ran in that first 18 minutes to go fastest in Q2 and we looked set to be in the fight for pole. Unfortunately, just as he was getting into the critical final efforts on the Intermediate tyre, he suffered a power steering issue and that cost him a shot at pole. Whilst he was able to continue, he could only manage P4 which was a valiant effort in the circumstances.

""Despite not starting from the best positions, we know there will be plenty of opportunities tomorrow. There are lots of unknowns given the Hard tyre has been seen very little so far, nobody has had the chance to complete much long running, and the track will have another reset overnight. Our pace in the mini long run we completed in FP1 on Thursday looked competitive so we can be hopeful of moving forward and fighting for good points and a decent result.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""We had the pace today to do much better than P4 and P17. The final practice session went well; George finished top of the time sheets and Kimi would have been close behind had it not been for a yellow flag.

""Going into qualifying it was much wetter than we had seen in FP3, and it was not possible to get the Intermediates into the working window in the early sessions. That caused us to bring both cars straight back in to take the full Wet. For George the pace was good, although it was difficult to get a clean lap in with yellow and the tricky conditions. Kimi had similar challenges with the yellow flags and was on a lap good enough to progress at the end of the first session when he locked at turn 12 and went straight on. He's obviously disappointed but it was his first wet qualifying and his first ever use of the extreme Wet tyres; he had very good pace in the dry so we're hoping to still score points tomorrow.

""George continued to show good pace in the second session and his final lap put him back on top. Unfortunately, we weren't able to repeat that when it really mattered. We had an issue with his power steering half way through the session where it was providing inconsistent levels of assistance. Fearing that the car wouldn't make it to the finish, George continued to push on the penultimate lap, which meant the tyres were too hot starting his final attempt. A frustrating day but we've hopefully got a car with good pace in the dry and both our drivers are looking to move forward tomorrow.""

Racing Bulls were the only team bar McLaren to get both cars into Q3, with Hadjar and Lawson impressing through the difficult conditions. In the end it was the Kiwi racer who grabbed the intra-team honours with sixth, two places above his team mate. While both look on for points, perhaps most importantly it continues Lawson's recent run of good form, as he attempts to convince the Red Bull management that he deserves a place on the grid for next season.

Isack Hadjar, 8th, 1:49.554

""I think in today's Qualifying we did everything perfectly in terms of timings and outings. I felt comfortable straight away in the wet from Q1 and was able to bring the performance into Q2. It's just very frustrating finishing P8 as my last attempt in Q3 was fast. I think I was the last driver on track starting the lap and the track evolution was simply at its peak, but unfortunately the yellow flag came out and it didn't work in our favour. I don't know what to expect tomorrow race-pace wise as we haven't done any long runs in the practices', so we'll need to use previous data to build our strategy and race to get those important points!”

Liam Lawson, 6th, 1:49.062

""It was a wild Qualifying session today but I'm very happy with P6. For us to be using an extreme tyre throughout two of the sessions shows just how slippery it was, as we rarely use this tyre. The car has been really fast, but we still missed the last lap by a small margin. I think we had more speed in the car and the opportunity to be higher up, however to have both cars in Q3 is a great result.”

Claudio Balestri, Chief Engineer - Vehicle Performance

“This morning wasn't an easy FP3 session with the track neither completely wet nor completely dry, and in Quali, we found conditions difficult as well. We decided to start on the Inter tyres on both cars, similar to the majority of others, but grip was very low, which was evident as soon as we came out of the pitlane. For these reasons we decided to change our plan by pitting immediately for the Wets and maximize the track time. In Q2 we elected to follow a similar plan, with the Wet tyre being the best for the low level of grip and stay out the whole session; the two drivers were able to set very competitive lap times and we ended up P2 with Isack and P6 with Liam. The track improved with the rain stopping, so we went onto the Inters for the last session, which was the right call. Both drivers did a really good job improving lap on lap, finishing in P6 and P8. Now we need switch our focus to the race where the target is to get in the points.”

Aston Martin called Q1 correctly, one of just two teams to come straight out on the full wets. Both drivers made Q2 comfortably, and once there looked very quick. Stroll was impressing hugely, the faster of the duo but then the team's strategy calls went awry. The Canadian was put onto inters late in Q2, the only car to run that compound. Reportedly it was a 'collective decision', but it was the wrong one and he exited. Alonso did make Q3, and grabbed a very decent P7 on the grid.

Fernando Alonso, 7th, 1:49.466

""I think P7 was unthinkable two hours ago and it was more fun than what I thought it was going to be out there tonight. I thought we could be in for a very long evening with a lot of red flags, but I'm happy with P7 in the end. The team did a good job to make sure we were on the right tyres and we maximised the session. The wet conditions have helped our performance, so let's see what we can do tomorrow.""

Lance Stroll, 12th, 1:52.850

""We were leading in Q1 and at the beginning of Q2 for some time and then made a collective decision to go on Intermediates. We thought it was going to be dry enough and we tried it but it wasn't the right call. We planned for three push laps but could only do two in the end and missed an opportunity. It's a shame because I think we could've fought for a strong result today.""

Andy Cowell, Team Principal

""Incredibly challenging conditions in Las Vegas this evening with cold temperatures and initially heavy rain creating a difficult session. The team's decision to run on Wets from the start of Q1 helped Lance and Fernando perform well in the very wet conditions, ending the session in third and fourth place respectively. In Q2 with the track drying we felt there was a chance to try Intermediates with Lance, but it proved a lap too soon and cost him a place in Q3. We need to review our 'decision tree' and timings in these situations and learn for the future. With Fernando starting from P7 and Lance in P12 there's every chance to score some points tomorrow, which will be the target.""

Both Ferrari cars looked quick in practice, but come Qualifying it all went wrong for the team in red. First Hamilton ran wide and hit a cone, which seemed to lodge under his front wing. Whether that remained there or not is unknown, but he had no grip and unusually aborted his final run despite making it across the line in time amid confusion over whether he could continue. All in all, he wound up last in conditions he normally excels in. As for Leclerc, he did make Q3 just about despite several adventures off track and one moment where his car stalled. But once there, he lacked pace on the inters and could only qualify ninth.

Charles Leclerc, 9th, 1;49.872

""It was a really tricky qualifying today, with low grip on the wet track. Our car struggles in these conditions and it's really difficult to find a way to maintain a large enough window of good grip to fight with our rivals. It's frustrating, but we will continue doing everything we can to find a solution.

""The race should be dry tomorrow, so the conditions will be different again. We had quite a high downforce setup for today, so this could impact our straight-line speed in the race. We will make the most of it and I hope we can have a good start and move forward during the race.""

Lewis Hamilton, 20th, 1;57.115

""That was a really disappointing qualifying session. After FP3 I felt we had good pace in the car, but the wet conditions didn't work in our favour today. Visibility was poor and we were unfortunate to be hampered by a few yellow flags, which meant I couldn't put a proper lap together in my last three attempts. We'll regroup tonight and aim to move back into the points tomorrow.""

Alpine managed to get both cars out of Q1, with their drivers handling the difficult conditions well. Colapinto pulled off the save of the day through the chicane, holding his car in a straight line despite it trying to go in both directions at once. But it was Gasly who made Q3, the Frenchman continuing his strong Qualifying form at this track. On the inters his pace faded, but P10 is still a strong result for a team rooted to the bottom of the Championship.

Pierre Gasly, 10th, 1:51.540

“That was such an enjoyable Qualifying session and it is another Q3 appearance for us, which I am very pleased with. The conditions were extremely tough, one of the hardest I've ever experienced in Formula One, with the rain and cold temperatures. We seemed to be fast in the wet straight away and we were up there lap after lap right from Q1. We were competitive on the Extreme Wets but in Q3, on the Intermediates, we seemed to struggle to bring the tyres up to temperature, so we have some things to review there. Tomorrow we are going into the unknown a little bit after limited high fuel running in Practice yesterday. That will make things interesting and we will give it our all to be in the points and hopefully put right what has happened over the last two years for me at this track.”

Franco Colapinto, 15th, 1:53.683

“Since yesterday we made a lot of improvements, and I felt like we were in the mix in those conditions. I think if it wasn't for the moment I had on my final push lap, we could have been close to getting into Q3. I was on a pretty good lap, up on my delta time, until I touched the kerb and lost the car at Turn 15. I had a massive slide and almost lost the car and managed to keep it out the wall thankfully, but I lost a lot of time. I think we were improving a lot, it was just tricky conditions out there. The amount of rain and standing water was a lot, but the grip with the asphalt and white lines, which you couldn't really touch, meant it maybe felt worse. But it was the same for everyone out there. Hopefully it remains dry tomorrow, and we can improve on our position and race towards the points.”

Steve Nielsen, Managing Director

“Today's Qualifying really underlines the high-quality skill level of all drivers in Formula One at the moment. The conditions were extremely tough with the rainfall during the session matched with the cold temperatures and the slippery road surfaces on the lap, which made driving particularly treacherous. Credit to both Pierre and Franco for doing a really solid job throughout, especially to advance through Q1 when the conditions were most extreme. Pierre managed to push on from there and into Q3 for the second consecutive race, such is his level of confidence at the moment and his ability to adapt to low grip conditions. As a team there are plenty of things for us to reflect on and improve for next time and we will line up on tomorrow's grid in a competitive position with our eyes firmly fixed on securing some more points.”

Not to be for Kick Sauber, despite starting Qualifying well. Along with Aston Martin, they were the only team to start Q1 on the full wets and thus steal a march on their rivals. But Bortoleto just could not find the speed to make Q2. Hulkenberg did and was hanging on to P10 at the end of the segment, pipped by Gasly once the chequered flag fell. He starts 11th, which is not a bad grid slot here although it did make Kick Sauber just one of two teams not to get a car into Q3 in Vegas.

Nico Hulkenberg, 11th, 1:52.781

“It was one of the most challenging qualifying sessions I've experienced - especially in Q1, with some incredibly low grip conditions. Vegas is already tricky by itself, with its low-downforce setup and slippery tarmac, and once the rain came, it became even more unpredictable.

“I think we managed the session well overall, but Q3 just slipped through our fingers at the very end. I had an issue in the last corner on my final lap and lost some time, which was frustrating because it would've been close. Still, no major mistakes, and we kept it clean - that was important today.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 18th, 1:56.674

“I was actually feeling quite comfortable at the beginning of the session, and the pace felt good, but in those last two or three laps it kind of slipped away from me. This was effectively my first qualifying session fully in the wet: visibility was really tough, everything felt pretty intense and I struggled with grip. We will need to analyse the reason why everything fell off as Q1 progressed, because I just couldn't extract what I felt I could in those final laps. Tomorrow won't be an easy job, starting towards the back, but we'll aim to make the most of every chance in the race.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“Track conditions were tricky in qualifying today, but I'm pleased with the team's performance as starting both cars on extreme wet tyres was the right call and set us up well. Nico was consistent throughout Q1 and progressed to Q2 where, despite a solid session, he just missed the cut for Q3 and ended up in a respectable P11.

“For Gabi, this was his first qualifying at this circuit and his first time running on the extreme wet tyres. He did a good job considering the conditions, built his pace sensibly but didn't manage to deliver a fully clean lap. Overall, there's plenty to be positive about and we're looking ahead to the race tomorrow.”

Bearman had a lucky escape late in Q1, as he locked up and aquaplaned into the barriers. Luckily he had managed to scrub enough speed to go in slowly and only broke his front wing, which the team were able to replace between Q1 and Q2. Thus, Haas had both cars on track in Q2, but they could go no further as Bearman's run of four straight Q3 appearances came to an end.

Esteban Ocon, 13th, 1:52.987

“I don't think we really made the most out of it, which is clearly disappointing as we had much more pace. I had to back off in the penultimate lap, and when I went to push again, I lost tyre temperature and locked up going into Turn 1. I didn't improve in my last two laps, but we clearly had Q3 pace which is disappointing, but it's positive as the conditions out there were very hard and we showed we're still there. We've been struggling lately, but that session still felt good, and although we didn't get the maximum out of it, we still looked very competitive.”

Oliver Bearman, 14th, 1:53.094

“It was nice to get into Q2 as I made a mistake in Q1, but I got away with it because I had a good lap on the board from earlier on. For me, the fact that we were so far off in Q2 can be only down to one thing, which is the tyres. I did every lap pushing, and in Q1 that was working well as it was a much wetter track, and every degree was helping. In Q2, I think it got to the point where the tyres started to overheat a bit. I'm disappointed over our qualifying as there was more to get out there, but I'm still excited for the race as there's every possibility for a good result tomorrow.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“It was a very tricky qualifying session. This track, with low temperatures and low grip when it's wet, is obviously very challenging. Operationally, I think we did a good job – which is a positive. In Q1, when there was lots of standing water, we seemed to be competitive, but in Q2, when the water levels were lower and we were still on the full-wet tyres, our competitiveness dropped. I think tomorrow starting in P13 and P14, but in dry conditions at this circuit, we still have a chance. We'll do our best to get both cars into the points.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“One would never have expected to witness a wet qualifying in the middle of a desert, but Las Vegas continues to surprise us. This afternoon's free practice provided information that would prove useful for the teams, as over 30% of the laps were run on rain tyres, but clearly it was not enough to have an immediate understanding of what would be the best compound with which to start qualifying. After a first run on Intermediates, it soon became clear that conditions required the use of Full Wets. The extreme rain tyres ensured the drivers had good grip for their first flying laps before the track began to dry, allowing for a switch to the Intermediates. The crossover time between these and the Full Wets established in today's Free Practice is important information if the same conditions are repeated for the start of the Grand Prix. Looking at possible strategies, obviously we have to assume it will be a dry race, basing the options on drastically reduced available data.

“Given the level of graining encountered on the Soft, this compound seems hardly suitable for an effective race strategy tomorrow. On paper, the quickest combination is based on a one-stop: start on the Medium, then switch to the Hard between laps 20 and 26, to then go for a long final stint. Fitting the yellow-banded tyres for the grid also opens up other competitive options. Teams that have kept two sets of Hards could attempt a two-stopper, Medium-Hard-Hard, switching between laps 12 and 18 and again between laps 27 and 33. A similar alternative for the few left with two sets of the yellow-banded tyres would be to run two initial stints on Medium and then Hard, with a final return to the Medium between laps 32 and 38. Use of the Soft would inevitably involve two stops. The way to make the most out of the qualifying compound could be at the start, until a window between laps 8 and 14 to change onto Mediums for a middle stint before returning to the softest compound, fitting it between laps 34 and 40.”

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Max Verstappen might have missed out on pole position during a rain-affected Qualifying at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, but the Red Bull driver was satisifed with his result.

Max Verstappen hailed his P2 result in Qualifying at the Las Vegas Grand Prix as “good for us”, with the Red Bull driver pleased to manage the “super difficult” conditions en route to a front row start.

Amid varied weather throughout the practice hours during the weekend, Qualifying got underway in the wet as the drivers struggled for grip and visibility.

While the pack were able to switch from the full wet tyres to the intermediates in the final segment, Verstappen could not quite beat Lando Norris in Q3, the Dutchman ending up some three-tenths adrift in second place.

Reflecting back on the session after jumping out of the car, Verstappen spoke about the challenges posed by the tricky conditions.

“It was really, really slippery out there,” the four-time World Champion said. “It's already slippery in the dry but in the wet… it's not fun, I can tell you that.

“I like to drive in the wet – this felt more like driving on ice, so it took a long time to get the tyres to work a bit.""

“I did feel that we were a little bit more competitive on the extreme tyre, but the track is improving so we have to move on to the inter. I struggled a lot just to have any kind of grip, and the final lap of course you risk a little bit more, but it was still by far not enough to fight for first.

“But still to be on the front row I think is good for us. The lap felt alright, it's just super difficult out there to get all the braking zones right and be on the limit of the tyres as well, but we did it. Excited for tomorrow, I hope the inside is okay in terms of grip, but we will see.”

Asked about the gapping required during Q1 amid particularly poor visibility, Verstappen conceded: “The visibility was also very tough. In these cars as well, the ground effect era, there's a lot of weight that gets picked up from the floor, so when it rains there's a lot of water and spray.

“That's why you always want at least eight seconds, and I know it's a lot, otherwise you don't really see what's happening in front of you.”

Lando Norris mastered the treacherous conditions to take pole position at the Las Vegas Grand Prix from Max Verstappen.

Norris maintained his championship charge with a stunning last gasp effort to go 0.323s faster than Verstappen, creating the margin despite suffering a significant snap of oversteer at Turn 14.

Carlos Sainz was third fastest for Williams, bringing some good news to the team after Alex Albon crashed in Q1.

Lewis Hamilton was unable to repeat some of his former heroics in the wet, and was slowest of the 20 drivers.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Las Vegas Grand Prix

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

It was a tricky day for Ferrari in Qualifying at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with Charles Leclerc ending the session in ninth place amid difficult conditions.

Charles Leclerc was left to rue the “unpredictable” nature of his car after Qualifying at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with the Monegasque taking P9 in his Ferrari amid challenging mixed conditions.

A wet track made for a difficult Qualifying at the Las Vegas Strip Circuit and Leclerc was amongst those to face struggles during the session, leaving him to reflect on how his car appears to find such conditions particularly tricky.

“Unfortunately it's not [just] today,” the 28-year-old said afterwards. “It's been like that since I… since I joined the team we've been struggling massively at finding the grip in those kinds of conditions.

“It's hugely frustrating because it's probably been my biggest strength in the junior categories, and then… We are doing something wrong – I have no idea what that is because we've turned the car upside down.

“We've had Lewis [Hamilton] and obviously Carlos [Sainz] before that also join from other teams that will tell us the feelings they had with the other cars. It's just extremely difficult to find the grip with our car, and very, very unpredictable as well which causes us to do a lot of mistakes.

“It's not that we are not trying because with the team we've tried absolutely everything, but for some reason we haven't found our way yet.”

Asked if this means that he always expects a difficult time when faced with conditions like those seen in Las Vegas on Friday night, Leclerc responded: “You always go in the car with the most neutral mind as possible, without thinking too much about what could go.

“We've had some few positive surprises sometimes, but for some reason whenever we thought we had understood something we were proved wrong the session after in the wet.

“I don't think about it, but as a matter of fact when you finish the sessions and do a step back on the overall picture in those conditions, it's not a bright one.”

It was a tough day all round for Ferrari, with Hamilton exiting at the back of the field in Q1.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Las Vegas Grand Prix

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Lando Norris will start from pole for the Las Vegas Grand Prix after a wet Qualifying session.

Lando Norris admits that achieving pole position for the Las Vegas Grand Prix was ""stressful as hell"" after overcoming treacherous conditions in Qualifying and moving one step closer to a maiden Drivers' World Championship.

The achievement marks Norris' third consecutive pole position, having previously gone on to take victory in both Mexico City and Sao Paulo which has helped the Briton to a 24-point lead over McLaren team mate and title rival Oscar Piastri in the standings.

Drivers were faced with their first wet running at the Las Vegas street circuit since it was introduced on the calendar in 2023, with Norris only finishing P13 in the opening Q1 segment when conditions were at their worst.

But Norris came to the fore when it mattered most, posting a 1m 47.934s which left him three-tenths clear of Red Bull's Max Verstappen ahead of the 50-lap race.

""It was stressful, stressful as hell! I didn't know no-one else was going to get a lap after me,"" said Norris.

""I felt like the first two sectors were good but it's so slippery out there. As soon as you hit the kerb a little bit wrong like I did, you snap one way, you lose the car the other way, close to hitting the wall but good enough for P1 today.

""Not the nicest of conditions but I'm happy it stopped raining and we could get a good Qualifying.

""You need a good car to do it first of all. The team did a good job. To be honest I was having a little nap before Quali and I was expecting it to be dry.

""I woke up and I saw it was raining and I thought, ‘Oh c***, this is not going to go well!'.

""No-one's ever driven around here in the rain before, it's difficult to know what to expect, and after Q1 every corner you felt like you could crash and it could easily be over.

""One step at a time – Q1, Q2, Q3, all tough, so more rewarding a day like this because it was a tricky one.""

Las Vegas has been a venue where McLaren has struggled previously and disrupted running for all teams in Free Practice 2 due to stoppages means race pace throughout the field remains far from certain.

Despite generally being the dominant package in 2025, Norris is wary of his chances in the race even if conditions are expected to be dry.

""The pace has been good all weekend. I think it was going to be good in the dry, I honestly didn't expect to be as good as I was then in the wet,"" added Norris.

""Very happy with that, but there's a lot of unknowns tomorrow. No-one's really done much high-fuel running, no-one's really done more than a 10-lap stint. I'm sure it's going to be an interesting race, especially with Max up there.""

The Thanksgiving tentpole — starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo — is headed for the biggest debut ever for a Broadway adaptation and the third-best among any musical. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The Witches of Oz are making magic at the box office.


	Universal's Thanksgiving tentpole Wicked: For Good is now on course to open to a record-smashing $151 million-plus in North America and $228 million worldwide after topping Friday's North American chart with a massive $68.7 million from 4,115 theaters (that number includes $30.8 million in previews). Audiences are more than embracing the pic, giving it an A CinemaScore and a glowing 96 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.




Wicked: For Good is the second title in filmmaker Jon M. Chu‘s ambitious big-screen adaptation of the iconic Broadway musical and book about the untold story of the witches of Oz. Ariana Grande stars as Glinda the Good Witch and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West.

	If it hits its target, the female-fueled movie will shatter numerous opening records. Domestically, it will boast the biggest start ever for a Broadway musical adaptation — as of now, last year's Wicked is the record-holder at $112.5 million — and the third-biggest of all time among any musical behind 2019's The Lion King and 2017's Beauty and the Beast. It would also be the second-biggest North American opening ever for a Universal title, behind Jurassic World ($208.8 million); the second-best for the weekend before Thanksgiving behind The Hunger Games: Catching Fire; and the second-best launch of 2025 to date behind A Minecraft Movie ($208.9 million).

	











	Globally, Chu's film will likewise pass up Wicked to rank as the top launch ever for a Broadway adaptation. It would also be the fifth-biggest opening of all time for any musical, behind The Lion King (2019), Moana 2, Frozen 2 and Beauty and the Beast. Lastly, it would pass up Superman to become the fourth-biggest opening of the year to date behind Jurassic World Rebirth, Minecraft and Lilo & Stitch.


Wicked: For Good is a needed jolt for the struggling North American box office, which has suffered the worst fall in decades due to a glut of male-skewing pics and a lack of product for females and families. The movie's better-than-expected performance more than proves the buying power of girls and women; nearly 70 percent of Friday's audience were females. 


	On the same weekend a year ago, the first Wicked likewise made history in its debut on its way to grossing nearly $750 million globally, a record showing for a Broadway musical adaptation. Such adaptations have been a tough genre for Hollywood to crack, but NBCUniversal entertainment chief and longtime movie studio head Donna Langley has remained intent on doing just that, even after Cats bombed. She's succeeded.

Jim Mickle, who wrote and showran Netlfix's 'Sweet Tooth' series, is directing the adaptation of the classic anime. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


Noah Centineo is doing it Gundam style.


	The actor, who is already shooting Street Fighter for Legendary, is in talks to reteam with the company for its live-action, big budget adaptation of Gundam, the anime centered on giant robots known as mechas.




	If a deal makes, the actor would join Sydney Sweeney to topline the sci-fi feature that is being directed by Jim Mickle, who is perhaps best known as the creator of Netflix's Sweet Tooth. That series adapted the acclaimed Vertigo series by Jeff Lemire.

	Mickle also wrote the script for the Gundam feature, which is currently untitled.

	










			Popular on THR		







Gundam was originally an anime that began airing in 1979. The story is set in the Universal Century, an era in which people have emigrated to space colonies because of a growing population on Earth. Eventually, the people living in the colonies seek their autonomy and launch a war of independence against the people on Earth. Battles are fought by piloting robots known as mechas.


	Legendary declined to comment on the dealmaking due to sensitivities. The company was previously in talks with Outer Banks star Drew Starkey for the male lead but those talks never closed.


	The project is a centered on a character played by Sweeney and sources say the actress is very much involved in the casting of those opposite her. In Gundam, her character and the male lead are, in the vein of Romeo & Juliet, on opposite sides of a war between planets who find a connection. 

	











	Centineo made hearts all a flutter with To All the Boys I've Loved Before, Netlfix's romantic drama that launched a franchise for the streamer. He also played the superhero Atom Smasher in New Line's Black Adam and earlier this year was part of the ensemble for A24's war movie Warfare.


	Legendary could be getting the actor on the upswing as Centineo is in prep to shoot a prequel to Rambo early in the new year. Street Fighter is being distributed by Paramount and has a Oct. 16, 2026 release date.

""The prices at which you're allowing tickets to be re-sold is vile and completely against our wishes,"" the British singer said.

	Jessica Lynch



Olivia Dean has criticized major ticketing companies after fans flagged steep resale prices for seats on her newly announced Art of Loving Live tour.


	The British singer addressed the issue directly on Instagram soon after general on-sale opened. In her first post, she told fans her team was “looking into” unexpected resale activity and warned followers to be cautious of comment-section sellers, calling many of them potential scams.

	“I'm sorry that there seems to be an issue with ticket re-selling and pricing,” she wrote. “My team are currently looking into it. It is extremely frustrating as the last thing I want is for anyone to be scammed or overcharged for our sho. Please be wary of buying tickets in the comment sections as it is most likely a scam.”


	She continued, “@ticketmaster @livenation @aegpresents you are providing a disgusting service. The prices at which you're allowing tickets to be re-sold is vile and completely against our wishes. Live music should be affordable and accessible and we need to find a new way of making that possible. BE BETTER.”


	Fans on social media reported long virtual queues and verified tickets appearing at significantly higher prices on secondary-market sites shortly after on-sale. Listings varied by city, with some resale amounts reaching several hundred dollars above face value.

	











	Ticketmaster acknowledged Dean's comments by reposting her Instagram story and stating it would cap resale on its platform at face value. “We support artists' ability to set the terms of how their tickets are sold and resold. @oliviadeano, we will cap resale prices on our site at face value and hope other resale sites will follow,” they added.


	The U.K. singer-songwriter and BRIT School alum currently holds four songs on the Billboard Hot 100 — her first four career entries — including the breakout “Man I Need,” which reached the top five on the chart dated Nov. 8. Her sophomore album The Art of Loving debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 earlier this month, marking her highest entry on the tally to date.


	Dean announced her 2026 tour last week, celebrating a major career milestone that includes her first headlining date at Madison Square Garden, as well as performing at Australia's 2025 ARIA Awards. The North American leg begins in July in San Francisco before continuing through major U.S. markets and wrapping in Austin.

A judge dismissed the claims, which focused on the rapper's 2024 bonus track ""Never Find,"" based on geographical technicalities.  


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



GloRilla has defeated a lawsuit that accused her of stealing a social media personality's viral catchphrase “all natural, no BBL” for her 2024 song “Never Find.”


	The federal copyright case was filed this summer by Natalie Henderson, aka @slimdabodylast on Instagram, who claims she coined the catchphrase referencing “Brazilian butt lift” surgery. Henderson says GloRilla (Gloria Woods) stole the phrase for her lyric “All natural, no BBL/ Mad hoes go to hell” on “Never Find,” a bonus track off her debut album Glorious.


	GloRilla's lawyers denied any infringement and argued that nobody can copyright a “cliched” expression like “all natural, no BBL.” But it doesn't look like a court will have to decide these substantive questions; Judge Lance M. Africk dismissed Henderson's lawsuit on Friday (Nov. 21) based on geographical technicalities.


	The suit was brought in Henderson's home state of Louisiana, but the judge ruled that wasn't enough to establish jurisdiction over GloRilla, a Georgia resident, or the various label defendants also named in the lawsuit — California-based Universal Music Group and Warner Chappell, Tennessee-based CMG and New York-based BMG.


	Henderson tried to argue that jurisdiction was established by GloRilla doing business in New Orleans, including by attending the 2025 Super Bowl and performing at the city's Smoothie King Center when she opened for Lil Baby's It's Only Us tour in 2023 and Megan Thee Stallion's Hot Girl Summer tour in 2024. But Judge Africk was not convinced.


	“Plaintiff's claims do not arise out of or result from defendant Woods's concerts or personal appearances in Louisiana, particularly when plaintiff has not made any allegations that ‘Never Find' was ever performed in Louisiana,” wrote the judge.


	Judge Africk similarly rejected Henderson's contention that the case could be brought in Louisiana because “Never Find” was distributed in the state. He noted that the song was available worldwide — and also pointed out a major hole in Henderson's argument.


	“Plaintiff relies on her counsel's purchase of a copy of defendant Woods's album Glorious on vinyl at a New Orleans record store as evidence that defendants ‘specifically targeted consumers in Louisiana,'” wrote the judge. “However, ‘Never Find' was not included on the vinyl that plaintiff's counsel purchased, as it was only released as a bonus track on an exclusive digital version of the album Glorious.”


	The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, meaning Henderson can attempt to refile the lawsuit in a different state if she so chooses. Her lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday, and neither did GloRilla's reps.


	This isn't GloRilla's first time defeating a copyright infringement lawsuit. Another case, which alleged her hit songs “Tomorrow” and “Tomorrow 2” sampled a decades-old hip-hop track without permission, was also dismissed out of New Orleans federal court last year for jurisdictional reasons.


	GloRilla was sued again a year ago alongside Megan Thee Stallion, Cardi B and Soulja Boy for supposedly sampling the 2008 Plies song “Me & My Goons” without clearance on their collaboration “Wanna Be.” That case was voluntarily dropped in March.

EXCLUSIVE: Audiences looking forward to the upcoming untitled Kendrick Lamar, Matt Stone and Trey Parker movie are going to have to wait a little longer as sources tell Deadline the film is moving off its March 20, 2026 date. No new date has been set at this time but the filmmakers say they are working hard to finish the movie. Producers are Stone and Parker for Park County, and Lamar and Dave Free for pgLang


	““It's true – we're moving (again). We're working hard at finishing the movie,” Park County & pgLang partners said in a joint statement.


	Insiders say Lamar has been on a global tour since April and is still on tour till next month while Parker and Stone have been working on the new season of South Park and insiders say both parties needed more time to focus on the movie given their busy schedules.

	This will mark the second time the film has moved dates as it was originally suppose to open this past July but just like with that decision, the move was made due to the Lamar's tour and the South Park schedule. The plot is under wraps, but it's billed as an original live-action comedy.

	With the film movie off that date, Amazon MGM Studios' Project Hail Mary starring Ryan Gosling will now be that only major release set to bow that weekend.


	Even with the release date moving, ties remain strong between Paramount and the talent especially Stone and Parker who got a shout out on a recent earnings call with the South Park returning with strong ratings for its 29th season.

Weekend Editor


	Two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey said he “literally” has no “home,” and is living out of his suitcase in various hotels and Airbnbs while working as a lounge singer in Cyprus. The embattled actor, whose work in Hollywood has dried up following numerous allegations of sexual misconduct and assault that first surfaced in 2017, also noted his belief that powerful filmmakers' public support for him will bring him back into the public's good graces.


	In an interview published by The Telegraph U.K., Spacey classified his financial situation as “not great,” adding, “I'm living in hotels, I'm living in Airbnbs, I'm going where the work is. I literally have no home, that's what I'm attempting to explain.”

	The House of Cards alum, who last year appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored to discuss his debts, including the foreclosure of his Baltimore abode, said, “The costs over these last seven years have been astronomical. I've had very little coming in and everything going out.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Spacey likened his predicament to the experiences of actors of yore, who were swept into the Hollywood blacklist as a result of McCarthyism. He cited Kirk Douglas' willingness to work with screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, then blacklisted, as the type of strategic allyship that could help him right the ship.


	“So, my feeling is if Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino call Evan [Lowenstein, Spacey's manager] tomorrow, it will be over,” he posited. “I will be incredibly honored and delighted when that level of talent picks up the phone. And I believe it's going to happen.”


	Most recently, Spacey wrapped production in the U.K. on an under-the-radar sci-fi thriller called The Tenth Planet. Having appeared on the festival circuit in both Venice and Cannes, where he was honored and made similar comments invoking Trumbo's name, earlier this year, Spacey has been vocal about eyeing a comeback. 


	Spacey was acquitted of the sexual assault of four men in the U.K. two years ago, and was found not liable in a U.S. civil case brought by actor Anthony Rapp, who alleged Spacey molested him when he was 14. A spate of men alleged similar abuse by the actor during his time working in the U.K. theater scene and on House Of Cards. 

	











	The American Beauty star is now facing a U.K. suit from an anonymous complainant, who alleged sexual assault; news of that civil case, which will go to trial this year, came shortly after the airing of a 2024 documentary about Spacey on Channel 4 and Investigation Discovery, which unearthed more allegations of wrongdoing, including from actor Ruari Cannon. After Guy Pearce noted earlier this year he was “made to feel uncomfortable” by Spacey on the set of 1997's L.A. Confidential, the latter responded by telling the Oscar-nominated actor of The Brutalist to “grow up.” 


	Spacey has said in the past that he may have behaved inappropriately during his career, but denies that he behaved illegally. The likes of Brian Cox, Liam Neeson and Sharon Stone have defended the veteran actor.

Despite his innocence in court, his persecution continues. A shame to think of all the great film performances he could have delivered, if it wasn't for his unjust cancelation. We stand with you, Mr. Spacey!

Baltimore's median household income is under $40,000, with property values around $220,000. Losing a home in that context reflects how deeply his life unraveled. Bankruptcy protection might have offered relief, and he could have sought legal costs in cases he won. It's painful to see someone of such talent fall so far. Yet the allegations of predatory behavior cannot be ignored, and accountability remains his burden. If he has sought professional help, perhaps his story can serve both as a warning and as a reminder that redemption requires responsibility.

Kevin is amazing. Sick of the hate. I need him back in movies and making good money.

Good.

He is not homeless. If you live in an Airbnb or hotel, you have somewhere to live. Homeless means you sleep on a park bench, an alley or someone's couch for a little while. No sympathy here.

To All the Boys I've Loved Before and The Recruit alum Noah Centineo is in talks to board Legendary‘s live-action adaptation of Gundam, the sprawling Japanese military sci-fi franchise, opposite Sydney Sweeney.


	As Deadline previously reported in late 2024, Sweet Tooth showrunner Jim Mickle is set to direct the new Gundam, co-developed between Legendary and franchise owner Bandai Namco Filmworks, from his own script. Mickle will also produce with his partner Linda Moran through their production company Nightshade.


	Earlier this year, it was announced Christy star Sweeney was in final negotiations to board the project. The plot is currently under wraps, but the film — which will mark the first live-action entry into the world — is looking to start production in early 2025.

	One of the most revered animé, Gundam pioneered the sci-fi subgenre known as mecha, IP that centers on giant fighting robots. Gundam is set in the Universal Century, a future where humanity has colonized space. When a rebellion erupts between Earth and its colonies, the ensuing conflict is fought by pilots in massive mechanized contraptions known as mobile suits. The long-running multimedia franchise first launched with series Mobile Suit Gundam in 1979. Since then, the internationally renowned Yoshiyuki Tomino-created endeavor has spanned 83 animated series and movies, in addition to a lucrative merchandising arm that generates $600 million annually. 

	











	Legendary Entertainment initially announced its development of a Gundam film with Netflix in the spring of 2021, with Jordan Vogt-Roberts attached to direct the pic following his work with the studio on its hit Monterverse installment Kong: Skull Island. However, the streamer and Vogt-Roberts are no longer involved.


	Following his breakout in Netflix's beloved film adaptation of Jenny Han's trilogy romance series, Centineo has also appeared in Black Adam, Warfare, The Perfect Date and The Fosters. Having just wrapped production on another Legendary movie, 2026's Street Fighter, he will also soon appear in a Rambo prequel from Lionsgate and Gabriel Basso's directorial debut Iconoclast.

I believe this would be the 2nd Gundam live action movie.  The first is 1999's G-Saviour.

This would be a big theatrical get for Centineo. He's always been a popular streaming star but he's never been afforded a theatrical opportunity. I think this is a good get for him.  t

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: BBC director general Tim Davie has been quietly drawing up plans to save up to £100M ($131M) a year by radically reimaging the UK national broadcaster's operations, Deadline can reveal. 


	Davie and a small team of executives have been working on Project Ada, a transformation plan that will shrink the BBC's workforce so that the corporation can invest in digital resources and content. It is at the heart of Davie's vision to reinvent the BBC so it can better compete with YouTube, Netflix, and AI giants, per multiple sources briefed on the proposals.

	Named after Ada Lovelace, the pioneering 19th-century British mathematician, the project could result in thousands of non-content jobs — including HR, finance, legal, and operations — being outsourced to private sector companies. Although Project Ada is well advanced and has board support, no final decisions have been made on redundancies. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Under the plans, the BBC is also exploring spinning off a potential commercial unit housing the digital teams that power services including iPlayer and the BBC Sounds app. Details are sketchy, but the unit is being referred to internally as BBC Media Tech, with sources suggesting that investment could be unlocked if it were unleashed on the private sector. 


	News of the transformation strategy will likely heighten unease among BBC staff at a turbulent time following the shock resignation of Davie earlier this month. The BBC is facing pressure to put Project Ada on ice, but those close to Davie said he will continue to pursue the vision vigorously in his final months because he believes the alternative is existential for the corporation. 

	











	Detractors have described Project Ada as “privatization by stealth” and complained that the work has soaked up so much of Davie's time that he has taken his eye off editorial crises, including the Donald Trump Panorama edit, which led to his resignation. This was strongly refuted by the BBC. 


	There is also a feeling that the BBC should be focused on charter renewal talks with the government instead of contemplating a radical reorganization. Others said the two are inextricably linked. “We can't ask for more public money if we are not getting our own house in order,” said a source. 


	Davie has already gone further than many of his predecessors in reducing the BBC's public service workforce. He has cut 2,000 employees (roughly 10% of the workforce) over the past five years, with savings worth hundreds of millions being reinvested into higher-paid jobs with a digital focus. Davie's allies said this was a notable part of his legacy, and Project Ada is another step in the same direction. 


	The BBC has not outlined the transformation proposals to employees in any meaningful way, but work has been ongoing for many months. Alongside Davie, chief operating officer Leigh Tavaziva is driving the change. Those familiar with the plans said clues to the corporation's thinking have made their way into the public domain, not least a report in The Guardian newspaper in July, which detailed outsourcing proposals. The Guardian said offshoring jobs was being considered, but BBC chiefs have been rowing back from this notion in talks with unions, saying jobs will be kept in the UK.


	In April, the BBC board considered an agenda item titled “Consolidated Group Business Services,” which was pitched as a “significant opportunity” to “transform” the broadcaster's “operating model and cost base” and allow it to deliver “future strategic goals.” Board members approved the plans in principle, per published minutes.


	Then in September, the BBC published a “market engagement notice,” through which it sought input from potential suppliers who have helped companies “modernise core business services at pace” using “cloud, automation, data, and AI.” The notice, a step towards a formal procurement process, added: “We want to learn from those who've navigated digital disruption, built smarter operations, and reimagined services to meet changing audience and workforce needs using new technology, streamlining processes, and forming new partnerships.”


	Davie himself also gestured at the plans in a speech in May, saying the BBC is looking to partner with tech players to improve the “media supply chain” that gets content from camera to screen. 


Union Wants Project Ada Paused 


	Sources said Davie's vision has faced opposition internally amid fears that the changes are high risk and low reward. The BBC's CTO Peter O'Kane unexpectedly quit over the summer, raising eyebrows internally. One person told Deadline that O'Kane had concerns about the proposals, though a second person said there can be multiple reasons why people leave a job. O'Kane referred Deadline to the BBC press office when contacted for comment.


	Bectu, the UK's biggest television industry union, wants the plans to be parked. Philippa Childs, head of Bectu, said: “With charter renewal about to start and a power vacuum at the top of the organisation the last thing the BBC should be doing is looking at outsourcing. Especially as many of its recent problems can be traced back to work carried out by third parties.

	











	“The BBC is at the heart of the government's creative industry strategy – outsourcing and potentially offshoring large numbers of jobs runs totally counter to the growth agenda. It would also negatively impact the many opportunities the BBC provides for the creative workforce to develop world-class skills.


	“Outsourcing large functions of the BBC, with the inevitable job cuts, would run counter to the public interest and could be hugely damaging to the unique role the BBC plays in UK PLC. At the very least, the BBC should pause this process until there is a new director general in place and the charter has been renewed.”


	Davie's message to staff this week appeared unambiguous: pedal to the floor. “I wanted to confirm that we will continue to deliver our current plans during this period. We have a clear strategy and should not slow down. We need to keep the BBC relevant in this new age,” he said in an email seen by Deadline.


	A BBC spokesperson said: “While we wouldn't comment on any speculation, we have made clear our ambition to innovate and transform to be able to invest in the content and services audiences love. To do this, we must accelerate our transformation and take advantage of opportunities in technology or with partners to strengthen our capabilities.  Like many organisations, it's routine to assess different options that could deliver these changes and it would be wrong to suggest decisions have been taken.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Matthew McConaughey details the wild ‘wet dream' he had that led him to wife Camila Alves","https://pagesix.com/2025/11/21/celebrity-news/matthew-mcconaughey-details-wet-dream-that-led-him-to-wife-camila-alves/","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 03:10:00 GMT","

Matthew McConaughey revealed that an erotic dream ultimately led him to the love of a lifetime in wife Camila Alves. 

“In my mid-30s, I was looking for a lifetime lover, a best friend, and a mother-to-be,” the “Dallas Buyers Club” star wrote in his newsletter “Lyrics of Living” on Friday, per Us Weekly.

“I was looking for more, I was looking for the one, I was looking for her,” he continued, adding, “Then I had a wet dream.” 

The “Magic Mike” actor, 56, divulged that in the dream, he saw an aged version of himself in a rocking chair on the porch of his home, where there were 22 women, 22 vehicles and 88 children.

McConaughey recalled that he had fathered the 88 children, each representing a year of his life, as they gathered to celebrate his 88th birthday — though he hadn't married any of the 22 women.

“Each woman was serene and satisfied,” he wrote, per the outlet. “Every child was smiling, laughing, and healthy. We all knew one another very well.” 

“Each mother and I shared an idyllic memory, the children roosted upon my lap,” the “Interstellar” star wrote.  

“We hugged, we kissed, we laughed and joked, we cried tears of happiness,” he continued. 

“They all gathered around me on the porch for a family photograph, and we looked toward a large-format box camera on a tripod at the top of the driveway. Three! Two! One! Then I came.”

The Oscar winner said the “beautiful dream” reminded him that his goal in life was to become a father — but also helped him see he'd be fine without taking the plunge. 

“The red light vision of being a lifelong bachelor had come to me in a greenlight wet dream,” he wrote.  

“It was a spiritual sign, a message to surrender, to quit trying so intentionally to find the perfect woman for me, and, rather, concede to the natural selection process of finding her, her finding me, or not.”

He added, “So I quit looking for her.”

It was after he gave up the dedicated search that wife Camila Alves, 42, came into his life, he wrote. 

“Three months later, I met Camila,” he divulged. “Twenty years later she's still the only woman I've ever wanted to take on a date, sleep with, or wake up next to.”

The longtime couple were first linked in 2006 after meeting at West Hollywood nightclub Hyde.

They welcomed son Levi in 2008, daughter Vida in 2010, and son Livingston in 2012 — the same year they tied the knot. 

In September, McConaughey revealed that it was actually his eldest son — then four — who helped convince the “How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days” star to marry Alves. 

McConaughey shared during an episode of Chris Williamson's “Modern Wisdom” podcast that Levi questioned why his mom and dad didn't share a last name. “I'm going through my head, ‘You're f–king 4, dude,'” the actor recalled. 

“I sat there. I was like, ‘It's a great question, but I mean, we're not married. When you get married, you switch your name,'” he said. 

McConaughey said his son asked if he was “scared” to make the commitment, and admitted to himself that he was. 

McConaughey ultimately married Alves after seeking advice from a pastor and other “elder men” who were “married for decades,” he shared.

Porsha Williams has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the FBI's investigation into her Nov. 16 Delta Flight incident. 

“We just received word from the United States Attorney's Office that they have determined that ‘no crime has been committed,' and that the FBI ‘will not pursue any further investigative actions regarding this matter,'” her rep told Page Six on Friday.

“While Ms Williams is certainly pleased to have received this news today, we cannot say that we are surprised given that there was never a physical encounter and given that the allegations made against Ms. Williams by this unhinged passenger were blatantly false from the beginning.”

“Ms. Williams offers her sincere thanks to the many witnesses who took time from their schedules to come forward and provide statements to law enforcement and to the Agents who worked so hard to uncover the truth,” the statement closed.

Page Six has reached out to the Atlanta FBI, but did not receive an immediate response. 

Williams, 44, made headlines earlier this week after it was reported that she was involved in an altercation during her flight from Las Vegas to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport following her BravoCon 2025 appearance. 

The “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star was accused of getting physical with a fellow passenger after their verbal disagreement escalated on the plane.  

A statement previously obtained by Page Six from the Atlanta Police Department read, “Preliminary investigation indicated that both parties may have been involved in a verbal dispute that reportedly escalated into a physical dispute during an inbound flight to Atlanta.”

Body cam footage of the incident obtained by Page Six on Thursday showed Williams telling authorities inside the airport that the incident was prompted after a woman on the flight called her a “bitch.”

“I was on my phone and the volume was up,” the “Real Housewives” star, 44, said. “She turned to me out of nowhere and she said, ‘So you gonna make me listen to that the whole flight?'”

Williams allegedly replied, “Do you want to?” Then, the woman allegedly told her no. “I said, ‘Well, there's a nicer way to say that.' And she said, ‘Bitch, you don't tell me.”

The footage also showed several other passengers come to Williams' defense, asserting that the reality star was not the aggressor in the situation.

The other woman involved in the interaction alleged to police that Williams “assaulted” her on the flight, leaving her “afraid for my life.”

“She had her hands in my face, screaming, calling me crazy, on and on,” the woman claimed, adding that she then attempted to protect herself by recording the incident. However, Williams allegedly threw her phone out of her hand.

After the ordeal, the FBI announced that an investigation had been launched into the case.

Jeremy Renner is brushing off his recent harassment scandal with a smile. 

The Marvel star was spotted flashing a big grin while attending amfAR's second annual Las Vegas gala on Friday.

He was photographed sporting a traditional black suit and tie for the charity event where he was honored with the Philanthropic Leadership Award. 

The “Hurt Locker” actor, 54, was joined by his sister, Kym Renner — who serves as president and CEO of their RennerVation foundation, per Forbes — as they walked the red carpet together.

The event, which was held at the Wynn hotel, marks the actor's first public appearance since Renner hit back at his former business partner Yi Zhou's harassment claims, calling them “inaccurate and untrue” in a statement given exclusively to Page Six.

His lawyer Marty Singer went on to claim that Zhou was retaliating against his client after he “rejected her romantic advances” and did not promote her projects on social media.

Singer claimed the two shared a “brief consensual encounter.” However, the actor has not spoken to her since Oct. 24 and has ignored her alleged “sexually explicit messages expressing her love.”

He also sent Zhou a cease and desist letter, threatening further legal action for her “false, fabricated and salacious lies.”

Earlier this month, Zhou came forward with claims that the “Hawkeye” star started sending her “personal and intimate photographs of himself” after the two began messaging each other in June. 

“He convinced me of his sincerity, saying he had been single for a long time and open to a long-term relationship,” she claimed. “I believed in him, in the power of love and in the possibility of redemption.”

When Renner later agreed to collaborate with her on her “Chronicles of Disney” documentary, she claims they “entered into written agreements” with her production company but he later denied having “any personal relation or professional collaboration.”

“When I called him out privately about his past misconduct and asked him to behave properly, to respect me as a woman and as a filmmaker, he threatened to call immigration/ICE on me, an act that deeply shocked and frightened me,” Zhou claimed.

The filmmaker also claimed to have “a collection” of explicit images and “porn gifs” that Renner allegedly sent her via WhatsApp. 

Zhou contended that the pair engaged in a brief romance, which she previously gushed about to the Daily Mail in October.

She told the outlet that Renner “found new love” with her after his near-fatal snow plow accident in 2023.

The two have yet to come to a “peaceful” agreement, according to Renner's attorney.

Cardi B's boyfriend Stefon Diggs has been accused of sexual battery by influencer Christopher Blake Griffith.

Griffith alleges Diggs drugged and attempted to sexually assault him at Diggs' Maryland home on May 22, 2023, and then conspired to kill him.

Griffith originally made the claims on Instagram in August, and the NFL player, who welcomed a son with “Bodak Yellow” rapper Cardi B earlier this month, subsequently filed a libel lawsuit against Griffith, accusing him of concocting a fake story.

Griffith filed his counterclaims on Friday.

“Chris Griffith is going to have his say and is looking forward to getting justice for the sexual and physical attacks perpetrated against him,” the stylist's attorney, Jake Lebowitz of Posey Lebowitz PLLC, told Page Six exclusively.

In the suit, the influencer claims the alleged incident took place “while in Mr. Diggs's car and at his house in Maryland, after events in the Washington, DC, area that Mr. Griffith attended as Mr. Diggs's guest.”

Additionally, Griffith accuses the New England Patriots wide receiver of alleged “coordination of a violent attack” on May 29, 2023, in Los Angeles, involving Diggs' brother, Darez Diggs, and two additional “associates.”

“This attack came as a direct result of Mr. Diggs's rebuffed sexual advances toward Mr. Griffith,” the docs further allege.

Griffith's legal team goes on to claim that Diggs took to social media with “defamatory statements” about the stylist, accusing him of stealing “articles of clothing” from Diggs' home.

The attorneys called the claims “unequivocally false” and “highly damaging to Mr. Griffith's professional and personal reputation.”

In documents filed on Oct. 1 and originally obtained by TMZ, Diggs alleged that “would-be social media influencer” Griffith created a false narrative about the alleged May 2023 incident. 

Diggs claimed in documents that he and Griffith, along with other other social media personalities, attended a club following a charity basketball game in Washington, DC. 

According to the docs, everyone returned to the wide receiver's home, where Diggs claimed he retreated to his bedroom and requested that Griffith leave the residence.

Diggs, 31, alleged that Griffith took to social media two years later to claim the athlete “drugged and attempted to sexually assault” him before allegedly conspiring to end his life. 

Diggs' lawsuit also claimed that Griffith shared the allegations — contained in a police report — with nearly 100,00 followers in August, and additionally tagged Sarah Jessica Parker and Ugg, who posed with the NFL star for a footwear campaign.

In the lawsuit, Diggs is seeking an undisclosed amount in damages and attorneys fees.

At the time, Griffith's attorney Jake Lebowitz denied Diggs' claims. 

“Mr. Griffith is looking forward to showing the world in Court that regardless of the fairy tale fabricated by Mr. Diggs' high-priced New York Lawyers, he is the victim of Mr. Diggs' unwanted sexual advances and his brother's violent attacks,” he told us. 

“Not only will we defend against these false allegations but our counterclaims for sexual battery will be filed shortly.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Lena Dunham confirms you've gotten enough of her Netflix show Too Much","https://www.avclub.com/lena-dunham-confirms-too-much-single-season","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 02:05:00 GMT","

Declaring that “Part of the job is knowing when to park it,” Lena Dunham has confirmed that the single season of her recent Netflix romantic comedy Too Much will be the show's only installment. Per Deadline, Dunham was at a For Your Consideration event for the Meg Stalter and Will Sharpe-starring series when she confirmed that she and husband/co-creator Luis Felber have no intention of trying to extend the story for another run.

“Our intention was always to make Too Much as a limited series,” Dunham told press, even though the last decade or so of TV production has made a pretty definitive case for “limited series” being code for “standalone thing that we'll try to milk more from if executives think we can get away with it.” Dunham, though, sounds a lot more definitive, noting that she and Felber very deliberately viewed the one season afforded them as a chance to explain a single story in full: “It was meant to feel like a classic transatlantic love story but with time to really dig into the complexities that a film doesn't have the space for.”

The series starred rising comedy star Stalter as a fairly obvious Dunham stand-in—the show having reportedly been based on her relationship with Felber—who winds up moving to London and falling in what will turn out to be pretty complicated love with a musician played by Sharpe. Dunham notes that she's not immune to the lure of thinking about what might come next for the characters—”Felix and Jess have a baby! Felix and Jess are on the first ship to populate Mars!”—but, ultimately, “As Luis and I sat with what we made, we realized we had told the story.”

We enjoyed Too Much, as it happens, with our review praising Stalter and Sharpe's performances, and that same relaxed pacing that Dunham says she was specifically hoping to deploy. The series aired its entire 10-episode run back in July of this year.

It's a basic fact of TV production that it usually takes a lot longer to film events than it does for the time being depicted in your show to pass—something that's usually neither here nor there when working with adults, whose appearances tend to stay pretty static. (Give or take some catastrophic baldness as your cast members cruise toward 40.) But the existence of both time and puberty can be a lot trickier when you're working with kids, and especially kids like the cast of Stranger Things, who are supposed to be rooted at very particular points of the coming-of-age spectrum. At least, that's our assumption as outsiders; series showrunners Matt and Ross Duffer swear that managing their cast members' rapidly evolving appearances hasn't been nearly as fraught as you might think.

The Duffers were talking to Variety about the show as it heads toward the premiere of the first part of its final season, a conversation that's largely about how the pair have gone from being two total introverts who frequently needed executive producer Shawn Levy (who they apparently refer to in their groupchat as “Warlock”) to solve problems for them, to experienced TV vets. But that does include figuring out, some time around the show's third season, that time was slipping away from them. “Coming to shoot Season 3 was shocking to me and Ross,” Matt Duffer notes, “And we had to quickly adjust the writing, because we had been writing them too young.”

But, the pair assert, they'd largely gotten through these literal growing pains by the show's fourth season (filmed around the time several of the show's cast members had already turned 18, circa 2020). “It's not as dramatic as people think,” Matt Duffer claims. “There was a scene in Season 4 in Episode 4, the ‘Dear Billy' episode. Sadie [Sink] is in the basement, writing her letters, and then she walks out of the basement outside, and a year has passed for her, because we shot the two scenes at the beginning and the end of production. And you can't tell. No one's ever, ever noticed that. That's a full year.” (The fact that these 22 year-olds are still in high school, even after the 18-month timeskip that opens season 5, is obviously a little weirder, but that's working with child stars for you.)

In one of the more interesting Sliding Doors moments in modern Hollywood history, one that intersects with another one, Christopher Nolan tells Empire magazine that, before he signed on to direct Batman Begins, Warner Bros. hired him to direct Troy. However, when Warner Bros. pulled the plug on director Wolfgang Petersen's Batman Vs. Superman movie, and wanted Petersen on Troy, according to Nolan, they needed a “consolation prize” for him. That's when Batman began.

“I was originally hired by Warner Bros. to direct Troy. Wolfgang had developed it, and so when the studio decided not to proceed with his superhero movie, he wanted it back,” Nolan said. “At the end of the day, it was a world that I was very interested to explore. So it's been at the back of my mind for a very long time. Certain images, particularly. How I wanted to handle the Trojan horse, things like that.”

Though it had previously been reported that Nolan had been hired to direct Troy, why he dropped out remained unclear. A 2013 Nikki Finke article for Deadline, reported that he left because “he wasn't feeling it,” which led him to Batman. Still, when he was first hired to direct the reboot, he made no hints that it was a “consolation prize.”

“All I can say is that I grew up with Batman, I've been fascinated by him and I'm excited to contribute to the lore surrounding the character,” Nolan said in 2003. “He is the most credible and realistic of the superheroes, and has the most complex human psychology. His superhero qualities come from within. He's not a magical character. I had a fantastic experience with the studio on Insomnia, and I'm keen to repeat that experience.”

At the time and in hindsight, this was obviously the right decision. Petersen had just made The Perfect Storm for Warner Bros., and his Troy turned out to be a bigger hit for the studio than Batman Begins. Meanwhile, that “consolation prize” launched Nolan's Hollywood career in earnest. It put him on the path to becoming the most recognizable filmmaker on the planet. Now, he finally gets to do to stage the Trojan Horse sequence of his dreams in The Odyssey.

We're starting to suspect that Netflix star Noah Centineo might be the adult acting equivalent of that one kid who was always a little bit of a problem when you were just trying to hang out and play with action figures. You know the one: He could never just be He-Man, or Donatello, or the one Thundercat whose head got chewed on by the dog too much to be any kind of recognizable: He also had to be whichever new action figure or toy had most recently hoved into view.

How else to explain news that Centineo—whose previous castings in the IP space have included (a since discarded) leading role in Masters Of The Universe, and a Rambo prequel that's currently in the works, and that bizarre Street Fighter movie that's coming out in less than a year—is now circling a role in a live-action Gundam movie? How much poseable plastic does one guy need?

This is per Deadline, which reports that Centineo (who made the transition from Nickelodeon actor to teen heartthrob with his work in Netflix's To All The Boys franchise) is being eyed to star in Legendary's live-action version of the long-running, ridiculously prolific Japanese mecha series. Said casting would put him hypothetically opposite Sydney Sweeney, whose name has been listed as being linked to the project for a few months now, and was supposedly in final negotiations at the time. No word on what specific plot points the film would take from the wider Gundam canon, which typically focuses on giant space-set robot fights that blend animated action with a healthy dose of melodrama, but god knows there's plenty to choose from. This film, specifically, has been in loose development since the early 2020s, originally with Centineo's old bosses at Netflix attached, but is currently being worked on solely at Legendary. No director or writer has been announced, but the studio is supposedly hoping to get production off the ground some time early in 2026.

Kenneth Branagh is all set to be a nasty, weird little goblin man, Deadline reports, as news breaks that the actor and director is set to voice the title role in A24's upcoming fantasy comedy Goblin. Written and directed by newcomer David Mikalson, the film will focus on an “anatomically correct” mythological creature, brought to life by practical puppet effects and now, apparently, voiced by the same tones were once lent, with an abundance of classically trained dignity, to Hamlet, Hercule Poirot, and that one cackling, racist bad guy from Wild Wild West.

Branagh joins the film shortly after A24 decided to bet heavy on Mikalson, who's made his name as a short film creator operating outside the Hollywood system. (He was apparently working in Kentucky on a proof-of-concept short for the film, which picked up attention after his representatives started circulating the script, when A24 decided to say screw it and jump the line by tossing $6 million his way to get the thing made.)

Goblin is being described as a “raunchy” buddy comedy that pairs its title character up with a human companion. (Skyler Gisondo, lately of The Righteous Gemstones and his stint as Superman‘s affable fuckboy take on Jimmy Olsen, is reportedly in talks to play said human foil for Branagh's character.) The film has been described as “Ted meets E.T.,” which is the sort of mash-up thinking we might generally find repulsive. But the idea of seeing a little green puppet dude crawling around with his tackle out, while being voiced by an Oscar winner (for writing, but still), does carry some degree of perverse appeal. (Also, we're just a sucker for anything that traffics in practical puppet effects and nasty lil' dudes, and especially when it comes from someone who's a general outsider to the usual—and more usually restrained— apparatus of making movies.)

The music industry and fans alike are mourning the loss of legendary drummer Jellybean Johnson, real name Garry George Johnson. He was best known for being a founding member of The Time, a band closely associated with Prince. He was 69. Following his sudden passing, tributes are pouring in. 

Johnson's family confirmed the sad news that he had passed away on the night of November 21 to TMZ. He leaves behind a wife and a daughter. 

Johnson has a strong legacy with The Time. Because of this, many are flocking to social media to pay tribute to the beloved drummer's life and career. 

One account on X wrote, “We are shocked & saddened to hear of Jellybean Johnson's sudden passing. To know that this amazing personality will no longer randomly show up (like here on @recordstoreday 2023) to light up the store & talk music and life and Minneapolis Sound Museum with us is heartbreaking.💔”

Someone else wrote, “R.I.P. Jellybean Johnson, drummer for The Time and The Family, who also appeared on and produced tracks by Alexander O'Neal, Cherelle, Janet Jackson, Nona Hendryx, Mint Condition, New Edition, and Karyn White.”

Another fan reminisced on his legacy, saying, “Man, I was just revisiting some of my Morris Day and The Time favorites last weekend. The first time I saw them live still holds up as one of the funkiest shows I've had the pleasure of attending. RIP Jellybean Johnson.”

Another person stated, “Wow, this really hurts to post this about my big brother Jellybean from Morris Day and The Time…Rest In Peace Garry “Jellybean” Johnson.”

The tributes continued as someone else posted on X with photos of Johnson. They wrote, “So sad to hear of the passing of the legendary Jellybean Johnson. This huge smile is how I remember him. I also remember him sitting by the bar at Bunkers. RIP Jellybean. Keeping his family in my prayers.”

Johnson began playing the drums at 13 and later learned to play the guitar. Fast forward several years, and Prince and Morris Day formed The Time. The members included Day as the lead singer, Jesse Johnson on guitar, Jimmy Jam on keyboard, Terry Lewis on bass, Monte Moir on keyboard, and, of course, Johnson on drums. 

In additon to being a founding member of The Time, he is also known for being a part of the foundation of the Minneapolis Sound, which was a fusion of rock, funk, and soul in the 1970s and 80s.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Melissa Peterman's Heartfelt Tribute to Reba McEntire's Fiancé: ‘One of the Best'","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/melissa-petermans-tribute-to-reba-mcentires-fiance/","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 14:09:57 GMT","

Hallmark star Melissa Peterman has repeatedly made it clear how much she loves seeing her best friend, “The Voice” coach Reba McEntire, happy. For the past four years, Rex Linn has been a source of much of that joy. 

“I just have never seen her happier, more at ease, more comfortable,” Peterman told People earlier this month about McEntire's fiancé. “It's lovely to watch.”

Along with being an integral part of the “Haul Out the Holly” franchise and Jonathan Bennett's “Finding Christmas” co-host, she stars with McEntire and Linn in “Happy Place.” On November 21, Peterman posted a “Rex Linn appreciation post” on Instagram, and her sincere words were heartfelt.

“Tonight's episode of Happy's Place was a favorite of mine because of this moment with [Rex Linn],” she captioned a photo of Linn and her in a warm embrace. “This is a Rex Linn appreciation post. Rex is one of the best actors I know. He has the greatest work ethic, he loves the work. He has been doing it well and been successful for a long time but his excitement and interest in every aspect of this business is genuine. He remains interested in the process and the people he meets every day.”

“I feel really lucky to work with him and call him friend,” she continued. “I hope you liked tonight's episode. Thank you Rex.”

Peterman has had a front-row seat to the couple's relationship since their first date. Nine months into their relationship, she knew her friend had found someone special.

“He lets her be her. You know?” she told Closer Weekly at the time. “I think that's what we all want. We want someone that will let us be who we really are.”

McEntire and Peterson first met on the set of “Reba” in 2001, and the two became fast friends. Since then, any opportunity to work together, they've taken it, with Peterman even going on tour with her.

“When I was out on tour, she'd come with me, open the show, do a bit in the middle of the concert,” McEntire told NBC. “And the crowd — their cheering for her was four times louder than it was for me at any time. Because they loved you to pieces.” 

While Peterman's eye roll was a good indication that McEntire was fibbing, the two women have always gushed about how rare and special their friendship is.

“She's one of my best friends, I just will always love her forever and ever,” McEntire told “Entertainment Tonight” in 2024. “She'll always have my back and I'll always have hers.”

Miranda Lambert is grieving the loss of two of her most cherished animals on her Tennessee farm. On November 20, the country music icon revealed that her miniature horses, Sugar Pie and Adrianna, had passed away on the same day. She summed up the heartbreak of pet loss with one sentence, calling the worst part of being “an animal mom” the moment you have to “say goodbye.”

Lambert shared a montage of photos of the minis she had raised for nearly 20 years. “My sweet little nuggets Sugar Pie and Adrianna crossed over the rainbow bridge today,” she wrote. “I've had 18 years with these littles and I can't tell you how much joy they brought me.”

She candidly reflected on the grief of losing them, adding, “The best part about being an animal mom is the joy. The worst part is when the time comes to say goodbye.”

The singer also expressed gratitude to the people who helped care for the minis while she was away on tour. “Full of gratitude for them and for Tommy, Julia and Sarah and everyone who helped take care of them and give them the best life when I was on the road all these years,” Lambert wrote. She and her husband, Brendan McLoughlin, live on a 400-acre farm with many other animals.

In her closing message, she addressed Sugar Pie and Adrianna directly. “Godspeed little bitty's. I know you are both in greener pastures as I type this. I'll see y'all again one day. Big love.”

After the country music icon shared the heartbreaking update on Instagram, fans and fellow musicians quickly flooded the comments with condolences and support. One fan wrote, “All horses go to heaven. So sorry Ran.” Fellow country artist Julianna Rankin added, “I'm so sorry, sister. May they run fast and free up there.” Another follower commented, “I am sure you gave them the best life ever.”

Lambert did not share further details about their passing, but her emotional tribute showed how deeply she is grieving. As she holds on to memories and the bond she built with Sugar Pie and Adrianna, fans continue to surround her with support through what she called the hardest part of loving animals is ALWAYS having to say goodbye.

“Survivor” legend Boston Rob Mariano is calling on his fans to lend a helping hand after receiving devastating news concerning his close friend's newborn daughter. 

The five-time player and former “Sole Survivor” took to Instagram earlier this week to share the message, “My friend [Caroline Miller King] needs our help for her baby girl Tala. Please donate if you are able to.” 

The message was followed by a link directing fans to a GoFundMe page supporting newborn Tala Liliana King, who was recently diagnosed with a rare and life-threatening form of leukemia. 

Tala's parents – Victoria's Secret model Caroline Miller King and former college football star Deion King – provided additional information about their daughter's extraordinarily rare illness on the GoFundMe page, titled “Support Baby Tala's Fight Against Leukemia.” 

“Meet Tala Liliana King, the definition of hope and strength. Baby Tala was delivered a month early by emergency C-section and to our shock, a 1 in 5 million chance of being newborn with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Everyday she is fighting in the PICU, not only cancer but the risk of other infections, as well as a brain hemorrhage. She is the strongest person we've ever known,” they wrote. 

While baby Tala's illness – which targets the blood and bone marrow – is common in adults, it's rarity in children, especially newborns, is undeniable. 

In addition to helping pay for the costs of medical care, the King family have explained that donations will also go towards providing baby supplies and other urgent expenses for Tala. 

“We have received such an out pour of love, for that we are truly grateful. The biggest thing we ask above all else is for love and strength,” they added. 

Following Mariano's call-to-action earlier this week, Tala's GoFundMe earnings have risen from $14,000 to $25,000 (as of this writing) in just two days. While there's still a long way to go towards the King family's $90,000 goal, Boston Rob himself personally contributed $300 to the efforts, though it remains possible that he is supporting the family behind the scenes as well. 

Mariano, who shares four daughters with his longtime wife Amber Brkich, was undoubtedly moved by his close friend's unimaginable struggle, and continues to call on fans of his appearances on reality series like “Survivor,” “The Amazing Race,” “Deal or No Deal Island” and “The Traitors,” to lend a helping hand if they're able. 

Since sharing the GoFundMe page to his social media accounts, other “Survivor” alumni, including Season 47's John Lovett and “Survivor: Samoa” star John Fincher, have also made donations in aid of Tala and the entire King family.

On Friday nights, IndieWire After Dark honors fringe cinema in the streaming age with midnight movies from any moment in film history.

First, the BAIT: a weird genre pick, and why we're exploring its specific niche right now. Then, the BITE: a spoiler-filled answer to the all-important question, “Is this old cult film actually worth recommending?” 

When “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein” debuted on Netflix in July 2019, plenty of people had no idea what it was. Legend has it that star and executive producer David Harbour wanted it to come out that way. The actor parodies himself twice in this baffling 32-minute mockumentary, born from a Twitter conversation with writer John Levenstein, about a tortured man (Harbour), his late father (Harbour), and a made-for-TV play that holds the key to their relationship. Maybe. Sort of. Probably not. 

 








Related Stories How the ‘Andor' Team Essentially Made Four Movies at Once for Season 2 ‘Hazbin Hotel' Is Thinking About the Future 

“I don't know if it's risen to cult status yet, but I think it has minor cult status because the people who are fans of it are so passionate,” Levenstein told IndieWire in a recent interview. “There's never been a physical screening of this, and I don't even have a copy. It's possible it'll just vanish and be a memory.”

 










“Stranger Things” Season 3 arrived on the platform two weeks before “Frankenstein‘s Monster's Monster, Frankenstein,” and the sci-fi series' return immediately broke records at Netflix. Harbour wasn't quite the nuclear box-office engine we know today. But the jovial actor also known as Chief Hopper was so popular with subscribers that a soft press push and a mysterious thumbnail bearing his face was a solid PR strategy. In Mashable's short history of the project, Harbour gets credit for putting the comedy special's core team together, drumming up support for the idea at Netflix, and even authoring the film's absurdly genius title — a joke so outlandish it might not get greenlit now.

“There was something about doing something purely for the joy of it, for no money, exactly the way I wanted to,” Levenstein said. “It took the edge off some of the compromises I've made on other projects.”

Directed by Daniel Gray Longino, “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein” is the sort of passion project you'd associate with the pandemic today. It's low-budget, uses only a few locations, and despite the involvement of Alfred Molina (whom Harbour just… asked to be there?), boasts a lesser-known cast that's wonderfully committed to the bit. Set in the 1970s, the play portion sees the real Harbour appear as David Harbour Jr. — a pompous theater performer, who can't wait to tell you he went to Juilliard. 

 










The story he's putting on — for a network sponsored by Beef Wellington and a Russian lit joke you'll repeat for the rest of your life — contorts Mary Shelley's classic horror novel about a mad scientist and his creation into a wildly contrived academic research scam. Opposite the real Harbour's David Harbour Jr., Canadian actor Alex Ozerov appears as young Hollywood heartthrob Joey Vallejo. The scene-stealing thespian plays a frustrated guy named Sal in the context of the production, but the line between reality and fantasy gets blurred as Harbour Jr.'s jealousy comes to a head. 

An experimental treasure unto herself, real actress Kate Berlant portrays fake actress Monica Fulton, and in turn takes up the hilarious part of the mark, Miss Macbeth, in the show. She'll come across Molina, who plays sea captain and faux British acting legend Aubrey Fields; or David Harbour Jr.'s ailing mother (O-Lan Jones), who loves morphine and might actually be dying; a useless, nameless doctor (Heather Lawless) with one of the funniest lines in the special; and a young girl (Marion Van Cuyck) you'll only know as “THE NIECE.”

That's the outrageous heart of the project being presented to us in 2019 by mockumentarian David Harbour III. A traumatized boy masquerading as a curious man, the second character played by the real Harbour needs a hug more than the services provided to him by the private investigator (Lidia Porto), forensic accountant (Randolph Thompson), and personal assistant/dramaturge (Graham Wagner) he hired to interrogate his father's legacy. But interviewing a couple of Hollywood folks on camera — the play's producer (Mary Woronov) and David Harbour Jr.'s old agent (the late Michael Lerner in his last role) — David Harbour III can't find the facts he needs to feel relief. 

 










With Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein” streaming on Netflix now, and “Stranger Things” Season 5 bringing the sci-fi series to a close next week, there's never been a better time to meet or reheat “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein.” It's only been six years since this delightful oddity was unleashed on the world — but so much has changed since 2019 that it already feels like a rare piece of pop culture history. If you still miss the streaming service's golden era, then you should let David Harbour take you back. After all, he went to JUILLIARD! 

“Frankenstein's Monster's Monster Frankenstein” is now streaming on Netflix. 

So, he didn't go to Juilliard, huh? A quick search will tell you the real David Harbour is an Ivy League man. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1997 with a double major in drama and Italian, which explains not only the actor's palpable smarts on screen but his unending appreciation for autumnal wear in life. (Please note, however, that it does not account for the allegations made by Harbour's ex-wife Lily Allen in her new album, “West End Girl,” which I'd be remiss not to mention in fall 2025.) 

 










John Levenstein — the 66-year-old veteran comedy writer known for “Arrested Development,” “Silicon Valley,” and more — considers himself retired. In an interview, he's friendly and enthusiastic. You can't wrangle jokes this deranged without your brilliance showing.

“I always try to make it not reliant on knowing what's being parodied, but I'm still a little afraid people won't get it,” Levenstein said. He considers “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein” personally important to his development as an artist, but he hasn't revisited it in a few years.

“I don't watch it by myself, and it makes me a little nervous when I show it to people,” he said. “There's always a little bit of a fear with comedy that you might realize, ‘Oh, it wasn't really as funny as I thought.'”

In my experience, talking to profoundly funny people can sometimes feel like contending with the lion and the den — all at once. Truly skilled comedians lure you into their gaping maw with a great premise, chew you up joke after joke, and spit back whatever's left as a puddle of giggles they'll forget. But you won't. There's never been a midnight screening of “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein,” despite the project continuing to thrive almost exclusively on word of mouth.

 










“I'm always a little bit afraid that if I remind Netflix it exists, they'll be like, ‘Oh yeah, that was a mistake. We meant to take it off,'” Levenstein said. But asked if he would still like to explore the concept of a “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein” anthology — an idea he detailed for Mashable in 2019 — Levenstein said yes.

“Comedy's a young man's game, and I'm pretty much just doing my own thing right now,” he said. “But I would still love to do the anthology. I would come out of retirement for it.”

In “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein,” Harbour delivers grief and fury with a subtle casualness that makes the whole affair feel strangely comfortable. Levenstein is the same. His semi-surreal comedy stylings — again, he just fucking kills it here — might seem more like a Tim Robinson or Nathan Fielder sketch if it weren't for the writer's megawatt self-awareness. 

Placing a more reasonable request than, “Hey, let me make another one of these crazy things,” he said he still wants to see his beloved “Kroll Show,” which he executive-produced, on Netflix. That's what spurred Harbour to want to work with Levenstein in the first place, and a new streaming spot could give the Comedy Central sketch program the renaissance it deserves. “I don't know why Netflix has never taken that step,” he said.

In the wake of his 2023 album An Inbuilt Fault, Will Westerman lost his booking agent, his manager, and his momentum. The record represented a dramatic departure from the low-key sophisti-pop of his 2018 breakthrough “Confirmation” and 2020 debut album, Your Hero Is Not Dead; co-produced by Big Thief drummer James Krivchenia, it was instead a dense, meticulously recorded collection of labyrinthine folk whittled down from a series of improvisational jams. Luckily, Westerman was already working on a new batch of songs with engineer and producer Marta Salogni, who had mixed Inbuilt Fault. Going into the new material, the goal was not to overthink anything. They spent five weeks recording on the Greek island of Hydra—Westerman, born in England, lived in Athens before moving to Milan—and seeking a balance between his poppier debut and headier followup. The result, A Jackal's Wedding, is his most distinctive release to date. While he initially garnered attention for his pastiches of '80s art-rock, he's channeled his influences into a record that's both more expansive and more intimate.

These are heady songs, but with Salogni at the helm, they're the most polished Westerman's music has ever sounded. He listened to Brian Eno and John Cale's Wrong Way Up while making the album, and recreating that record's spaciousness with the occasional contemporary flourish places him alongside other oddballs like Mk.gee or King Krule. The upbeat synths of the arpeggio-heavy “PSFN” (which stands for “Pop Song, For Now”) sound like an old instructional video, but the way the drums lightly pump the entire mix is a distinctly modern touch. “Spring,” a love song to his wife, is so straightforward that he joked about offering it to Adele. That directness—the pop half of sophisti-pop—is a big part of the record's charm.

Some of the wooziness of Westerman's early work is still here. Intro “S. Machine” teases a more off-kilter album, with erratic synthetic horns that land somewhere between 22, a Million and an Animusic DVD. What follows is more soothing, but with added complexity from Warpaint and Kurt Vile drummer Stella Mozgawa. Her layers of drums and percussion capture Westerman's restlessness on “Adriatic,” while her subtle dropped beats on “Mosquito” lend a sense of dread to the song's serenity. Westerman's lyrics are often difficult to interpret, but his singing sounds clearer than ever: Unlike the last two records, he frequently dips into his lower range, exchanging the Bon Iver-esque falsetto for something closer to the range of Stephen Merritt. That shift helps land a genuinely funny moment on “Adriatic” where he announces, “I head back to Ithaca,” then dramatically intones, “not New York.”

It all comes together on“Weak Hands,” the first track Westerman worked on with Salogni and his best since “Confirmation.” It's an existential crisis of a song, musing on an unnamed figure's impending mortality: “Look at you running, my friend, to that desert in the sky… My dear, my hologram, my lord of mirrors/It's coming.” The rudimentary synths of Your Hero Is Not Dead return, now treated like the ornate arrangements of Inbuilt Fault, a surreal wall of sound grounded by Ben Reed's lightly overdriven bass. “Weak Hands” still calls back to Talk Talk, Peter Gabriel, and all the other art-rock totems Westerman has been compared to. But in its unconventional collection of those influences, and in his unvarnished delivery of the song's esoteric lyrics, it feels like something new.

Tom DeLonge stays vindicated. UFO doc The Age of Disclosure got a special screening on Capitol Hill ahead of its streaming premiere. The film by Dan Farah played in a committee room Monday, according to the New York Times. The Age of Disclosure premiered at SXSW this year, and comes to theaters and VOD Friday. In it, 34 current and former “senior members of government, military and intelligence groups” speak on what the film claims is a 80-year conspiracy to hide evidence of nonhuman intelligence. You know, aliens. The doc says there has been an “80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse-engineer advanced technology of non-human origin.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is one of the more prominent officials who participated in The Age of Disclosure. He discusses the repeated phenomena of something flying over nuclear facilities, “and it's not ours. And we don't know whose it is.” Other talking heads in the doc include former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Senator Kristen Gillibrand. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, director Farah says it's only a matter of time before a sitting president blows the lid off the whole thing. “I think it's only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, ‘We're not alone in the universe,'” he says. “It's the most significant moment a leader could possibly have.” Considering all the UAP disclosures we've seen in the last few years, would it really be that significant? As NBC News put it, “People online don't seem to care either way.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=uap","‘The public has been lied to': secretly made documentary insists that aliens exist","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/22/age-of-disclosure-documentary-aliens","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 15:59:00 GMT","

The Age of Disclosure is a new film featuring high-ranking government officials who claim proof of extraterrestrial life has been covered up

Director Dan Farah grew up with aliens. As a child of the 80s and 90s, pop culture was awash with extra-terrestrial sightings. “How can you be a kid watching movies like ET and Close Encounters, TV shows like The X Files, and not end up curious about whether or not we're alone in the universe?” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “And whether or not the US government does, in fact, hold secrets from the public.”

Farah's exposure to otherworldly beings in fiction kickstarted an interest that's now morphed into a professional quest, and the subject of his documentary debut The Age of Disclosure. Here, Farah makes the case that the United States has been hiding, for decades, a fount of information related to UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomena) – the acronym rebrand of the stigma-ridden UFO.

It would be easy to assume this is the stuff of tin-foil hats and Reddit forums, and in some ways the documentary's pseudo-narrator, Luis Elizondo, could come across as a type of conspiracy theorist at first glance. He's armed with a blackboard and piece of chalk, working to sell the viewer, running through a lot of overwhelming military and intelligence jargon, like “hypersonic velocity” and “trans medium travel” with undeniable passion.

But there's a reason why Farah gravitated towards Elizondo (who also serves as an executive producer on the film). He's got genuine credentials. A former Pentagon official, who helped lead the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), Elizondo eventually left his role in 2017, claiming the department was hiding vital information from the public. He also claims there was a “powerful disinformation campaign” from the Department of Defense to discredit his work.

Making a point to “only interview people who have direct knowledge” of these programs from working within the US government was a north star for Farah – who has served as a producer on several films, including Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One. While filming The Age of Disclosure, as more former officials and experts got on board, it helped to convince others to take part.

But Farah ran a tight ship over the three years it took to make the film. “Everyone's names would be kept silent until it was done,” he said, noting that he only told documentary subjects about who had agreed to take part in order to make them comfortable. “We would make the movie in secrecy, so this information of who's in it would not get out there until we were done with this film, and these people I was approaching would have safety in numbers.”

Farah also opted to make the film independently, unattached from a studio or streamer. “None of them would ever want to participate in a big commercial documentary,” Farah explained. “They would be afraid of it being sensationalized. They would be afraid of being intercut with someone who was not on their level, who would undermine them.”

His first big commitment came from Jay Stratton, one of the defense officials who started AATIP. He had an established career investigating UAP and non-human intelligence life on behalf of the government, and was responsible for briefing senior lawmakers in Congress and the White House. “I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings,” Stratton says plainly at the beginning of the film.

After Stratton agreed to “break his silence” it had tremendous “ripple effects” on the rest of the film, and convinced others to come forward. When the current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, agreed to take part, that escalated things. “Then next thing you know, general Jim Clapper was participating,” Farah said of the former director of national intelligence under Barack Obama, who sat for an interview.

The sheer wealth of contributions, 34 to be exact, from members of Congress across the political spectrum, as well as people with rich national security experience – many of whom might balk at the prospect of a cable news hit let-alone an independent documentary – certainly lends a veneer of credibility. Off the bat you're confronted with a propulsive string score, and a supercut of former military and intelligence officials ensconced in armchairs. They all offer brief summaries of their CVs, spell out that we are not alone, and why the American public ought to know more about it.

“This [UAP] technology does stuff that we can't do, and if we can't figure out what it is or what it wants, or what it's being used for,” says a former director of aviation security at the National Security Council. The former chief scientist for AATIP claims that those who are tasked with ensuring information about UAPs doesn't leak “will use whatever tool they can find to try to convince people they shouldn't come forward”. Meanwhile a former defense official notes that if we're able to understand the technology that we're observing, it opens the door to so many “potentially beneficial impacts, including clean energy”.

In many ways, Rubio offers one of the more convincing arguments. He says that much of the research and intelligence about UAPs is on a need-to-know basis, with incoming administrations being left out of the loop on the details. “But that begins to ramp out of control,” he notes, leading to a lack of transparency that might give US adversaries a head start by analyzing UAP technology. It's a theory that sounds all the more convincing coming from the noted foreign policy hawk, who spent time in the senate spearheading a bipartisan effort to understand more about UAPs.

The geopolitical arms race to reverse engineer UAP technology is, what Farah came to see, one of the biggest reasons behind the alleged cover-up. “You can't tell your friends without telling your enemies,” Farah says in our interview, reciting one of Stratton's lines in the documentary. He traces a line from the debunked 1947 Roswell “alien crash retrieval” (generally considered the genesis of modern UAP conspiracies) to what he sees as the ongoing effort to withhold information – for fear of enemies getting wind of how much the US knows about extraterrestrial life.

“Put yourself in the shoes of US government and military officials in the 40s,” Farah said, explaining that, fresh off a second world war victory, the Truman administration couldn't tell the American people that “we're in another conflict that we can't protect anyone from, because we don't even know anything about it”.

He says this race escalated when the US found out that other countries, like Russia, were capturing and retrieving UAP technology. “Here we are now where the people who run our country are not aware of the facts,” he added. “Those people are supposed to be aware of significant information like this that has high stakes for us. And at a base level, the public deserves to know the truth about fundamental facts, like we're not alone in the universe.”

In The Age of Disclosure, it's clear that there is little room for pushback or skepticism, particularly since there's not a single detractor in the film to serve as a foil to the plethora of resolute interviewees. And Farah, for his part, doesn't see the need for those voices to cloud the documentary's throughline. “I think when people watch this movie, one of the realizations will be that the stigma around this topic is completely illogical and makes no sense and is not good for humanity,” he said. “We need the scientific community, not only in the United States, but in every nation, accepting the fact that this is a real situation, this is a valid area of inquiry, and that they should put their brain power towards learning about this and answering a lot of the big questions that remain.”

Testimony is ultimately what film hinges on, and it's really the only “proof” it can offer. This, for Farah, is more compelling. He believes that “the strongest evidence” is “credible people putting their name and reputation on the line to tell you what they know at great risk”. When it comes to video and photos, the director notes that it would do little to quieten claims that it's all a hoax. “You could put a picture or a video of the most extraordinary thing on the cover of a major news publication or on major plants on TV, and half the human population would tell you they think it's AI or they think it's visual effects,” he said.

As more people, like Elizondo and Stratton, speak out about their experiences, Farah hopes it will encourage more people who have been silenced in the past to attempt to reveal the truth. “For way too long, the public has been lied to, kept in the dark, completely misled by a heavily financed and very sophisticated disinformation campaign,” Farah said.

“I think it is only a matter of time before a sitting US president steps to the podium, and tells the world that we are not the only intelligent life in the universe, and that the United States government intends to lead in this new chapter by ending the era of secrecy and beginning the era of transparency.”

The development team at HoYoverse has officially unveiled Varsapura, a new project that departs from its usual fantasy-gacha formula and embraces an open-world action-stealth thriller built on Unreal Engine 5. The announcement, made on November 20, revealed a 31-minute gameplay demo that introduces early mechanics, narrative structure and atmosphere.

In Varsapura, the player steps into the role of a newly recruited operative for the agency known as SEAL (Shadow Emergency Alliance) tasked with investigating and containing anomalous phenomena within a city inspired by Singapore. The narrative leans heavily into psychological thriller territory: the player enters a world where reality warps, appearance adapts to each viewer and the code name “Cognosea disruption events” hints at mind-bending consequences.

The demo footage shows a blend of stealth, investigation and open-world traversal rather than the character swap gacha mechanics familiar from HoYoverse's previous titles, although they might still be present on the full release. There are moments of exploration inside the SEAL headquarters, driving segments, city-street sequences and combat with shadowy entities. One distinctive detail is the protagonist's umbrella-weapon, which can function both as a melee tool and glider-style traversal device. Visually, the game presents a more realistic aesthetic compared to HoYoverse's anime-inspired works: cityscapes, lighting and architecture were praised, though some critics pointed to character models as needing polish.

Since platforms and release date are still unconfirmed, interested players should treat this as a long-term watch rather than an immediate pick-up. The gameplay demo is promising but highlights areas for refinement, especially in character fidelity. As HoYoverse builds this title, expectations are high for how they will deliver on the shift in tone and scope.

Varsapura represents a bold move into something new for its developer and for players seeking a story-driven open world with mystery, stealth and evolving reality. However, the gacha style and free to play model might still be present, so it remains to be seen how much of a departure the title is.

Supernatural released two Valentine's Day-themed episodes — ""My Bloody Valentine"" and ""Love Hurts"" — during its time on the air. Now, Dynamite Comics is releasing Valentine's Day-inspired comics that allow Supernatural to celebrate the holiday once again.

""LOVE IS STRONGER THAN DEATH — AND JUST AS TERRIFYING!,"" The official synopsis from Dynamite Comics reads, ""Sam and Dean Winchester know a thing or two about love and loss. But just because something is understandable doesn't make it advisable — and it certainly doesn't make it safe! Trying to command a minor minion of the underworld has resulted in the summoning of an ancient and uncontrollable goddess of desire. The rampage that ensues embodies the true power of love — and only Sam and Dean can stop it!""

From Sam and Dean Winchester's hilarious quips to Castiel's iconic lines, Supernatural is full of great dialogue.

The solicit continues: ""acclaimed comics and prose author Preeti Chhibber (Marvel's Avengers Assembly, Spider-Man's Social Dilemma) joins forces with hopelessly romantic artist Pasquale Qualano for this special 40-page love letter from the Winchester Brothers' early years - featuring unrequited cover art from Qualano, Cat Staggs, Reese Hannigan, and Meghan Hetrick, as well as a special PREMIUM MYSTERY OF LOVE BLIND BAG!"" Dynamite Comics specifies that the ""Blind Bag contains three limited editions of the issue selected randomly from a range of covers exclusive to this offering - including virgin variants, colored blanks, and more!""

Dynamite Comics' Supernatural #1 first released in October 2025, and has since retold the adventures of the Winchester brothers as they take on small-town America in search of the most unsettling creatures. Supernatural takes place between the television series' first and second seasons, offering fans a bit more insight on Sam and Dean's whereabouts during the show's early years. For those who miss The CW's smash horror hit, the comics allow them to re-live the iconic title's first romps onto the small screen.

Could Supernatural's Sam and Dean Winchester start a trend of iconic duos leading their own comic books?

Upon its initial debut, Supernatural took The CW by storm and became a phenomenon in pop culture. The 2005 ""monster-of-the-week"" series quickly amassed a fandom of overwhelming scale, and Supernatural became more than just the five-season series it was intended to be. Helmed by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, Supernatural's prominence thrived across social media, especially on social media blogging platform Tumblr. The surge in Supernatural's popularity resulted in Creation Entertainment dedicating fan conventions to ""saluting"" the series, which still draws in a significant crowd today. In addition to Supernatural earning a comic book spin-off from Dynamite Comics, The CW previously did try to introduce a Supernatural spin-off television series that ran for a single season.

Dynamite Comics' Supernatural can be purchased online or at comic book stores; Supernatural Valentine's Day Special 2026 #1 Blind Bag goes on sale on Feb. 4., 2026.

Kim Kardashian is slamming psychics for reportedly incorrectly predicting her performance on the bar exam.

The entertainer-turned-aspiring lawyer recently revealed she had fallen short on the exam, which prospective candidates take before being admitted to practice law in the U.S.

Kardashian recently unleashed on some of the psychics she had reportedly consulted on the matter.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”



“I'm just letting you guys know that all of the … psychics that we have met with and that we're obsessed with are all … full of s***,” she said in a TikTok video.

Jenn Nizza, an ex-psychic who is now a Christian, told CBN News Kardashian is off-base and failing to understand the true issues unfolding in the psychic world.

“She sees them as a pathological liar because the prediction didn't come true,” Nizza said. “But they're also lying when they're pretending to be her deceased father, and that's what I don't think that she understands.”

Nizza said Kardashian and others don't realize that psychics get their information from demons.

“She's just looking at this result of a prediction, which is made by a demon,” she said. “And demons do not know the future. So she's kind of throwing the baby out with the bathwater in a sense here, and she's failing still to see the truth of the matter. And she's going up in arms and contributing to the deception.”



Nizza also addressed the fact that psychics are many times wrong, despite some predictions coming to fruition.

“The predictions will not always be correct,” she said. “Does it happen sometimes? Yes, just from the planting of seeds and self-fulfilling counterfeit prophecy, but demons are not God. … They don't have the power of God to know the future.”

Nizza continued, “So what happens is these demons will lie … they're lying spirits, and they'll pretend to be Robert Kardashian to hook Kim.”

She said demons know information because they have long observed human beings and know people's patterns. Their predictions are, thus, educated guesses.

“You and I can make predictions, and I talk about this all the time with a high rate of accuracy, but we're not God,” Nizza said. “So we're not going to know the future. Only God knows the future.”

The former medium warned that those who seek psychics so diligently end up finding themselves kept away from “the only way, truth and life, and his name is Jesus Christ.” Rather than walking in truth, she said these people end up “walking in the false light.”

“You're trying to hold to the standards of the world, which is run by the devil, which is subjective, and you start overlapping sin after sin after sin, more New Age practices,” she said, warning that these practices can lead people to spiritual oppression or even possession.

Ultimately, such chaos can harm relationships and stunt people mentally, emotionally, and physically. Watch above for more from Nizza.

Have you ever thought about the science and history of… wind?

In this episode, Simon Winchester explains why eastbound flights are usually faster than flying west, and how the discovery of the jet stream was almost missed because the original research was published in Esperanto. He also talks about the debate over the Great Terrestrial Stilling—the idea that global wind speeds may be decreasing—and why newer measurements suggest the trend may be reversing.

Winchester describes how and where the highest wind speed ever recorded was measured, the increasing frequency of clear-air turbulence (the kind that causes sudden drops during flights), why only one flag placed on the Moon fell, the techniques used by Polynesian navigators to cross vast stretches of ocean without instruments, and the challenges faced by early wartime pilots who unintentionally flew into the jet stream.

Simon Winchester is the acclaimed author of many books, including The Professor and the Madman, which was adapted into a film starring Mel Gibson and Sean Penn, as well as The Men Who United the United States, The Map That Changed the World, The Man Who Loved China, A Crack in the Edge of the World, and Krakatoa. His books have been New York Times bestsellers and have appeared on numerous best-of-the-year lists. In 2006 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Her Majesty the Queen. His new book is The Breath of the Gods: The History and Future of the Wind.

Sean Walton, an attorney for the Young family, called the outcome “an American tragedy.”

This story was originally published by Capital B.   


The Ohio police officer who shot and killed Ta'Kiya Young was acquitted Friday on all counts, including murder.

Young was an excited mom of two little boys, and pregnant with her first daughter, when she encountered Connor Grubb at a Kroger supermarket parking lot on Aug. 24, 2023. She was accused of shoplifting by a store employee and tried to flee the parking lot in her car, according to police body camera footage. A single shot was fired.

On Friday, Young's grandmother, Nadine Young, collapsed into sobs at the decision, shouting “It's not right! This is not right!”

Sean Walton, an attorney for the Young family, called the outcome “an American tragedy,” lamenting what he said is a dual system of justice in the U.S., according to the Associated Press. The family's legal team vowed to continue its fight in civil court, where her estate sued the township and police chief over department practices in August.

Young was gunned down by Grubb 23 days after her 21st birthday. Her unborn baby was due that November 2023. 

Last year, a Franklin County grand jury indicted Grubb on four counts of murder, four counts of felonious assault, and two counts of involuntary manslaughter after evaluating evidence for two days, prosecutors said. Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford said in a video statement that his “disciplinary process” began.

Montgomery County Prosecuting Attorney Mat Heck Jr.'s office was called in by Franklin County's outgoing chief prosecutor, Anthony Pierson, to handle Young's case. Blendon Township is a northeast suburb of Columbus and is located in Franklin County. 

Grubb was the fourth Franklin County law enforcement officer to be indicted in the death of a Black person since 2020, and the second prosecuted by a special prosecutor — an increased effort in recent years to avoid potential biases between police officers and prosecutors. 

“We thank the grand jury, but we insist that this is but a step, not the conclusion, of our collective journey towards justice for Ta'Kiya and her unborn daughter,” Sean Walton, the attorney for Young's family, wrote in a statement at the time of the indictment.

The announcement gave advocates like Karla White Carey, whose hometown is Columbus, hope for other counties to follow their lead with holding police officers accountable. But she was concerned that with terms like “federal immunity” floating around, police accountability may look completely different after Nov. 5. Federal immunity is a term misused by President Donald Trump when referring to “qualified immunity” — a civil liability protection for law enforcement officers — to which he has said police should be “immune from prosecution.”

“But I hope that what we are doing here, there is a light that we can shine on it, and show people that it is possible to indict these officers. It is possible to hold them accountable,” Carey told Capital B last year. “When you look at it nationwide, this is a drop in the bucket because we really don't see this. We see more payouts to the families than we actually see accountability of the officers.”

On a national scale, there have been 3,898 Black people killed during an encounter with law enforcement since 2013, and nearly 80% of those cases have not had any charges filed, according to the database. 

“The actions that led to the death of Ta'Kiya — the unnecessary aggression, the chilling commands that amounted to ‘comply or die' — were there for us all to witness in dreadful clarity,” Walton's 2024 statement read. “Ta'Kiya's life and that of her daughter were extinguished in an act of brutality, becoming yet another symbol of the urgent need for reform in police conduct and accountability.”

Carey said she was “overjoyed” for Young's grandmothers, Danielle Rivers and Nadine Young, when they learned about the grand jury's decision. Ta'Kiya Young's sons are in their great-grandmothers' custody — Young's mother passed away a year prior, the Associated Press reported.

“It's disheartening to speak to families across the country who go through this process and never see an ounce of accountability,” Carey said. “This decision is a step in the right direction. I think it is sending a very strong message to our police officers here in Franklin County.”

While the families of Young, Casey Goodson, 23; Andre Hill, 47; and Donovan Lewis, 20, have received a small degree of justice with grand jury indictments, there have been 17 other Black people killed by a law enforcement officer in Franklin County since 2020, according to the Mapping Police Violence database. That consists of 11 heartbroken families who learned that  “no known charges” were filed, and six waiting for their loved one's investigation to conclude, hopefully, with positive results.

Residents previously told Capital B that they didn't support Pierson because of his own failure as a special prosecutor to land an indictment against eight Akron police officers who killed Jayland Walker in June 2022 during an alleged traffic violation. Police fired 94 bullets at Walker, hitting him nearly 50 times. The residents were also not keen on Pierson passing high-profile cases to other prosecutor offices to handle. 

Pierson lost in the Democratic primaries in March to Shayla Favors, who went on to defeat Republican John Rutan in the general election last November.

“The families say, ‘We want justice,'” Carey said. “For me, you'll never get justice, because that would mean bringing your loved one back. The next best thing is to hold these officers accountable for their actions.”

Live Updates


            • Peace proposal deadline: President Donald Trump has given Ukraine less than a week to accept his 28-point proposal to end the war with Russia, which is widely seen as favoring Moscow, though he suggested today that the plan is still open for negotiation.
    


            • Geneva meetings: Top US diplomats will meet with senior Ukrainian officials and European national security advisers tomorrow in Switzerland. The US proposal needs “additional work,” Kyiv's European allies said today, after discussing the plan on the sidelines of the G20 summit.
    


• Plans for NYC: Meanwhile, Trump has indicated that New York City is not a priority for deploying National Guard troops, as he's done in other cities during the administration's immigration and law enforcement crackdown. It follows a notably cordial appearance alongside NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House yesterday.
    


            Kira Rudik, a member of Ukraine's parliament, spoke with CNN last night about the pressure Kyiv is facing to accept the terms of President Donald Trump's proposal for ending the war with Russia, which is widely viewed as favoring Moscow.
    


            Rudik also shared her response to Trump's comment yesterday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will “have to like” the peace plan.
    


Watch a clip from the interview below:



            We're hearing from two Republican senators on President Donald Trump's proposal to end the war in Ukraine.
    


Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former Senate GOP leader, strongly criticized the Trump administration for its plan, suggesting that officials are trying to appease Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            “Putin has spent the entire year trying to play President Trump for a fool,” McConnell said in a statement yesterday. “If Administration officials are more concerned with appeasing Putin than securing real peace, then the President ought to find new advisors.
    


                    He continued: “Rewarding Russian butchery would be disastrous to America's interests. And a capitulation like Biden's abandonment of Afghanistan would be catastrophic to a legacy of peace through strength.”
                





South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, also weighed in on the proposed plan, calling parts of it “problematic.”
    


            “While there are many good ideas in the proposed Russia-Ukraine peace plan, there are several areas that are very problematic and can be made better,” Graham said Saturday in a post on X. “The goal of any peace deal is to end the war honorably and justly - and not create new conflict.”
    


            Trump has given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until Thursday to accept the plan. But Trump said a short while ago that the plan is not his final offer to end the war.
    


            President Donald Trump said today that recent economic numbers are “incredible,” likely referring to the September jobs report released yesterday.
    


            The report, which was originally scheduled for October 3 but released late due to the government shutdown, showed stronger-than-expected job growth.
    


            “The economy, as you saw, some incredible numbers came in,” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House a short time ago. “Investment in our country is bigger than ever before, by a factor of two or three, and that means a lot of things are being built and a lot of plants will be opening very soon.”
    


            However, new figures released by the Department of Labor yesterday for the week ending November 1 showed the number of people receiving unemployment benefits hit a four-year high.
    


            While the president has been projecting a positive message on the state of the economy, polling shows Americans' views of the president's economic stewardship are getting worse in the face of a persistent affordability crisis.
    


CNN's Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.



            President Donald Trump suggested today that New York City is not a priority for deploying National Guard troops, following a cordial Oval Office meeting with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani yesterday.
    


            Asked if he plans to send the National Guard to New York, Trump said, “If they need it.”
    


                    “Right now, other places need it more,” the president told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. “We had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that. But if they need it, I would do it.”
                





            Yesterday, Trump said he and Mamdani discussed crime in New York City and that they appeared to be on the same page in their efforts to combat it.
    


            “He doesn't want to see crime, and I don't want to see crime, and I have very little doubt that we're not going to get along on that issue,” the president said.
    


Remember: Trump has made extraordinary use of the military during his second term, including deploying the National Guard to cities where his administration is carrying out immigration raids and other law enforcement efforts. The deployments have prompted a slew of legal challenges and condemnation from Democrats.
    


            President Donald Trump expressed today he was open to reconciliation with Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene shortly after she announced her plans to resign from Congress amid a falling-out she had with the president.
    


                    “Sure, why not? I mean, I get along with everybody,” Trump told reporters.
                





            Trump recently rescinded his endorsement of Greene and attacked her in personal terms.
    


            “I just disagreed with her philosophy. She started backing perhaps the worst Republican congressman in our history,” Trump said to reporters a short time ago. The president made it clear he was referencing Greene's support of GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky.
    


For context: Massie helped lead a bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill to get the Department of Justice to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Greene was one of a handful of Republicans in the House who signed on to his petition to force a vote in the chamber.
    


            After a monthslong political pivot that catapulted Greene from one of Trump's closest allies to a critic on various issues, Greene announced yesterday that she will be resigning from office in January.
    


                    “I said go your own way and once I left her, she resigned,” Trump said today. “She would never have survived the primary, but I think she's a nice person.”
                





            President Donald Trump said the US peace plan presented to Ukraine is not the final offer to end the war with Russia.
    


            “No, not my final offer,” Trump told reporters just now. “We'd like to get to peace. It should've happened a long time ago.”
    


            “The Ukraine war with Russia should have never happened. If I were president, it never would have happened. We're trying to get it ended. One way or the other we have to get it ended,” he added.
    


            Asked by CNN's Kevin Liptak what happens if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky doesn't accept the plan by his deadline Thursday, Trump replied:
    


                    “Then he can continue to fight his little heart out.”
                





            Trump made the remarks as he said he was heading to meet with former professional golfer Jack Nicklaus at the Joint Base Andrews golf course.
    


CNN's Kaanita Iyer contributed to this post. 



            Democratic Rep. Maggie Goodlander's district office in Concord, New Hampshire, was the target of a bomb threat yesterday, according to her spokesperson.
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday accused Goodlander and five other Democrats, who had urged service members and intelligence officials in a video to disobey illegal orders, of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”
    


            “Tonight, the office of Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander was targeted with a bomb threat. Law enforcement responded swiftly and confirmed that no credible threat is present at this time,” Annie Lentz, a spokesperson for Goodlander, said in a statement.
    


            The district offices of three other Democratic lawmakers who appeared in the video — Reps. Chris Deluzio, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow — were also targeted by bomb threats yesterday.
    


            The home of Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who was also featured in the video, was the target of a bomb threat, according to her spokesperson.
    


            President Donald Trump said early this morning that Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation from Congress is due to poor polling numbers and fear of a potential primary challenge against a Trump-endorsed candidate.
    


                    “Marjorie ‘Traitor' Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it ‘quits,'” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
                





            That was the president's first public reaction to Greene's resignation, which she announced on social media yesterday evening.
    


How we got here: It came after a months-long political pivot that catapulted Greene from one of Trump's closest allies to one of his top antagonists.
    


            And it caps a turbulent five-year career in Washington, during which she was publicly condemned for violent rhetoric on the House floor and booted from the Freedom Caucus over a feud with a fellow Republican — while wielding extraordinary influence in her party as one of Trump's most trusted political allies.
    


Ripple effects: Greene, who just months earlier had been discussed as a potential candidate for her state's Senate race, currently has no plans to run for any office, according to a person close to her.
    


            The Republican's exit is likely to be quickly felt in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson must navigate a razor-thin majority.
    


            The speaker already faces the tall order in the new year of corralling his fractious conference to move on major legislation and further the president's priorities.
    


            Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and his team landed in Geneva this morning, where he will hold meetings with senior Ukrainian officials to discuss next steps for peace, a US official said.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will join the talks tomorrow in Geneva, the official said. The goal is to iron out language before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meets with President Donald Trump.
    


            A meeting between a Russian delegation and the US to discuss the proposed peace plan is also planned and “will happen quickly,” the official said, but not in Geneva. The official declined to elaborate further on where or when that meeting would take place.
    


            National security advisers from Germany, France and the United Kingdom are also going to the Geneva meeting, a diplomatic source told CNN Saturday.
    


What Ukraine is saying: Senior Ukrainian defense official Rustem Umerov confirmed on X that senior US and Ukrainian officials will go over “possible parameters of a future peace agreement” in Switzerland.
    


            Zelensky made a presidential decree approving a delegation of top Ukrainian security officials for talks with the US, Ukrainian allies and Russian representatives, his office said on X today.
    


            It comes as Zelensky's government grapples with a US peace plan that backs key Russian demands. 



                    “Ukraine will never be an obstacle to peace, and representatives of the Ukrainian state will defend the legitimate interests of the Ukrainian people and the foundations of European security,” Zelensky's office said.
                





CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.



This post has been updated with information about additional allies attending the meeting.



            Ukrainians spoke to CNN today about their reaction to a US proposal for ending the war with Russia, which President Donald Trump has given Kyiv less than a week to accept.
    


            Vira Semenova, a Kyiv resident and mother of three, told CNN she feels as scared as she has been since Moscow first launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            She said the talks are “definitely not heading in the right direction” and that she may need to flee Ukraine if the plan is adopted:
    


            Valerii Moroz, a builder who spoke with CNN in Kyiv, said the country risks losing its identity and its independence if it agrees to a deal that's favorable to Russia:
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to spend this weekend in Washington, DC.
    


            We've seen the White House schedule, which states the president will leave at 11:35 a.m. ET today en route to Joint Base Andrews to visit the golf courses at The Courses at Andrews at 12 p.m. ET. His departure will take place from the South Lawn and will be open to the press.
    


            Trump is then due to return to the South Lawn at the White House at 2:40 p.m. ET. This will again be open to press.
    


            He has no public events scheduled tomorrow.
    


            As we keep a close eye on the diplomacy surrounding Russia's war in Ukraine during our coverage of the Trump administration today, here's what to know about how we got here.
    


Looming deadline: President Donald Trump has given Kyiv until Thursday to accept his 28-point plan to end the war, which lays out commitments each side would make to finally end the conflict that began with Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


What's in the plan: The proposal calls on Kyiv to cede territory, limit the size of its military and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war. It calls for a halt to fighting, global funding for reconstruction and a board overseeing the commitments led by the US president.
    


Reaction to the proposal: European powers have been caught off guard by the plan, with the European Council saying in a statement today that it needs “additional work.” US and Ukrainian officials will meet tomorrow in Geneva to discuss next steps.
    


It looks like a win for Moscow: The proposal is widely seen as favoring Russia. Trump appears to be giving Moscow almost everything it wants, largely resembling the Kremlin's maximalist positions from talks in Istanbul shortly after the invasion, when its forces held more of Ukraine.
    


What Ukraine is saying: President Volodymyr Zelensky said yesterday that Ukraine faces a choice between losing its dignity or a key ally in the US. He vowed to “work calmly” and quickly with the US and its partners toward an end to the war.
    


What Russia is saying: President Vladimir Putin earlier told a security council briefing he had received the US proposal and that he believed it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement.”
    


Here's a deeper dive for subscribers: CNN annotated the 28-point proposal.
    


            The US plan for peace in Ukraine needs “additional work,” the European Council said in a statement today, as leaders on the continent scramble to find a coordinated response to the proposal.
    


            While welcoming the US efforts, the leaders expressed concern over “proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces.”
    


            “We reiterate that the implementation of elements relating to the European Union and relating to NATO would need the consent of EU and NATO members respectively,” the statement added.
    


Remember: European powers have been caught off guard by the plan, which contains major concessions to Russia and was drawn up with little input from Ukraine or Europe.
    


            One of the stipulations includes a commitment by Kyiv not to join NATO, a long-standing Kremlin demand.
    


            Ukraine's allies will discuss the US-drafted peace plan on the sidelines of the G20 summit today amid alarm over the proposals, which are widely seen as favoring Russia, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.
    


            “Ukraine's friends and partners will meet in the margins of the G20 summit to discuss how we can secure a full ceasefire and create the space for meaningful peace negotiations,” Starmer said in a statement released by the UK government ahead of the talks.
    


                    “We will discuss the current proposal on the table, and in support of President Trump's push for peace, look at how we can strengthen this plan for the next phase of negotiations.”
                





            We'll bring you any significant developments from these meetings when we get them.
    


            President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said on X that she sat down for talks with Starmer ahead of the summit.
    


            “The situation regarding Ukraine right now a clear reminder of why that matters,” von der Leyen said.
    


For context: The summit, which is being held today and Sunday, marks the first taking place in Africa. It will be attended by leaders including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva but the US will be absent.
    


            Trump wrote in a social media post on Friday that the US would boycott the event due to South African “human rights abuses” against Afrikaners, an ethnic group descended mostly from Dutch settlers, as well as German, French and British immigrants to South Africa, claims strongly disputed by the South African government.
    


            Welcome to today's coverage of the latest developments from the Trump administration.
    


            We'll keep you updated on President Donald Trump's movements in Washington, as well as reaction to the United States' 28-point proposal to end the war in Ukraine. The US will be absent from the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa today, where world leaders are expected to discuss the proposal.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — On a recent day at Sacramento native Lecho Lopez's comic shop in the city, his 5-year-old nephew read his first word aloud: “bad.” It was from a graphic novel.

There was irony in that being his first word, because Lopez credits comic books with many positive things in his life. That's why he supports repealing a city ordinance dating back to 1949 that bars the distribution of many comic books to kids and teens. It's not enforced today.

“It's a silly law,” said Lopez, who has a red-and-black tattoo of the Superman logo on his forearm, in an interview at his store, JLA Comics. “A lot of good things come out of comic books.”

A City Council committee unanimously voted this week to advance the repeal and designate the third week of September as “Sacramento Comic Book Week.” It now heads to the full council for a vote. The ban applies to comic books prominently featuring an account of crime that show images of illegal acts such as arson, murder or rape.

In the mid-20th century, as comic books were on the rise, fears spread over their impact on children, with some arguing they could lead to illiteracy or inspire violent crime. The industry decided to regulate itself, and local governments — from Los Angeles County to Lafayette, Louisiana — passed bans to shield certain comics from young people. While some cities like Sacramento still have those laws on the books, they are rarely if ever enforced.

Now, proponents of repealing the Sacramento law say it's necessary to reflect the value of comics and help protect against a modern wave of book bans.

Comic book author Eben Burgoon, who started a petition to overturn Sacramento's ban, said comics “have this really valuable ability to speak truth to power.”

“These antiquated laws kind of set up this jeopardy where bad actors could work hard to make this medium imperiled,” he said at a hearing Tuesday held by the city council's Law and Legislation Committee.

Sacramento is a great place to devote a week to celebrating comics, Burgoon said. The city has a “wonderful” comic book community, he said, and hosts CrockerCon, a comics showcase at a local art museum, every year.

Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, said “there is no good reason” to have a ban such as Sacramento's on the books, saying it “flies in the face of modern First Amendment norms.”

The movement to censor comics decades ago was not an aberration in U.S. history, said Jeff Trexler, interim director of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, which fights to protect the free-speech rights of people who read or make comics.

New York, for example, created a commission in the 1920s dedicated to reviewing films to determine whether they should be licensed for public viewing, based on whether they were “obscene” or “sacrilegious” and could “corrupt morals” or “incite crime,” according to the state archives.

“Every time there's a new medium or a new way of distributing a medium, there is an outrage and an attempt to suppress it,” Trexler said.

The California Supreme Court ruled in 1959 that a Los Angeles County policy banning the sale of so-called “crime” comic books to minors was unconstitutional because it was too broad. Sacramento's ban probably doesn't pass muster for the same reason, Trexler said.

There's not a lot of recent research on whether there's a link between comic books and violent behavior, said Christopher Ferguson, a professor of psychology at Stetson University in Florida. But, he said, similar research into television and video games has not shown a link to “clinically relevant changes in youth aggression or violent behavior.”

Leafing through comics like EC Comics' “Epitaphs from the Abyss” and DC's and Marvel's collaboration “Batman/Deadpool,” Lopez showed an Associated Press reporter images of characters smashing the windshield of a car, smacking someone across the face and attacking Batman using bows and arrows — the kinds of scenes that might be regulated if Sacramento's ban were enforced.

But comics with plot lines that include violence can contain positive messages, said Benjamin Morse, a media studies lecturer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

“Spider-Man is a very mature concept,” said Morse, who became an “X-Men” fan as a kid and later worked at Marvel for 10 years. “It's a kid who's lost his parents, his uncle dies to violence and he vows to basically be responsible.”

Lopez's mother bought him his first comic book, “Ultimate Spider-Man #1,” when he was around 9 years old, he said. But it was “Kingdom Come,” a comic featuring DC's Justice League, that changed his life at a young age, with its “hyper-realistic” art that looked like nothing he'd ever seen before, he said.

He said his interest in comic books helped him avoid getting involved with gangs growing up. They also improved his reading skills as someone with dyslexia.

“The only thing that I was really able to read that helped me absorb the information was comic books because you had a visual aid to help you explain what was going on in the book,” Lopez said.

And a comic book can offer so much more, Burgoon said at this week's hearing.

“It makes imaginative thinkers,” he said. “It does not make widespread delinquency. It does not make societal harm.”

Two Texas men have been charged in an alleged plot to invade a Haitian island, kill its male residents and enslave the women and children as their ""sex slaves,"" federal prosecutors announced Thursday.

Gavin Rivers Weisenburg, 21, of Allen, and Tanner Christopher Thomas, 20, of Argyle, were indicted on charges of conspiracy to murder, maim or kidnap in a foreign country and production of child pornography, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Texas.

""Weisenburg and Thomas intended to murder all of the men on the island so that they could then turn all of the women and children into their sex slaves,"" federal prosecutors allege.

Between August 2024 and July 2025, Weisenburg and Thomas allegedly planned to take over Gonave Island ""to carry out their rape fantasies,"" court documents state.

They intended to buy a sailboat, guns and ammunition and recruit members from Washington, D.C.'s homeless community to ""serve as a mercenary force as they invaded Gonave Island and staged a coup d'état,"" prosecutors said.

Authorities allege the pair took steps to prepare for the invasion, including learning Haitian Creole, attempting to recruit others and enrolling in schools to gain skills that would help them carry out the invasion.

Thomas even joined the U.S. Air Force to receive relevant military training, according to prosecutors.

In addition to the alleged invasion plan, both men are accused of producing child pornography.

Gonave Island, located in the Gulf of Gonave, has a population of roughly 100,000, according to La Gonave Haiti Partners.

The former teen beau of 18-year-old Florida cheerleader Anna Kepner says he witnessed her 16-year-old stepbrother climb ‘on top of her' during a 3 a.m. FaceTime call after she fell asleep. The 16-year-old's parents have called him a 'suspect.'

They're supposed to be lifesavers, but, in this case, the best they may do is point investigators toward a killer.

The life jackets found covering 18-year-old Anna Kepner's body on a Carnival Horizon cruise ship when staff discovered her dead two weeks ago may be key, according to a veteran detective who is following the case. 

""They're gonna test the life jackets, blankets, whatever else they found in the room, plus Anna's body,"" said Pat Diaz, a former Miami-Dade County homicide detective and now a private investigator.

And everything could contain important clues. 

STEPMOTHER IN CRUISE SHIP DEATH MYSTERY FEARS CHILD COULD BE INCRIMINATED: COURT DOCS

Anna Kepner, 18, was found dead aboard a Carnival cruise ship Nov. 7 during a vacation with her family.  (Anna Kepner/Instagram)

A preliminary investigation found evidence Anna had been asphyxiated in a chokehold, ABC News reported Friday. 

Fox News Digital has not independently verified the report. An official cause and manner of death have not yet been determined, according to the medical examiner's office. But a source with knowledge of the case said toxicology and other lab testing had not yet been completed but said bruises had been found on the body.

But if someone worked up a sweat during a murder, that person would have left DNA all over the room, the victim and anything used to cover the body, according to Diaz. 

As the FBI continues its investigation into Kepner's mysterious death aboard a cruise ship, forensic experts are likely still analyzing DNA and other evidence for clues that could determine whether foul play was involved, experts say.

NO CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHEERLEADER FOUND DEAD ON CRUISE SHIP AS REPORT REVEALS REMAINS FOUND HIDDEN UNDER BED

Friday marked two weeks since the aspiring Navy sailor was discovered dead in her cabin around 11 a.m. Nov. 7.

Her remains were transferred to the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner's Office after the vessel returned to port the following day. But the forensic pathologist in her case has not yet revealed a cause and manner of death.

Diaz said, at this point, it's too early for results from toxicology and other lab testing. 

""Not only are they doing DNA to try and match the 16-year-old, they're probably also trying to rule out the 14-year-old,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""And nothing's happening fast because they'll show what they get to a grand jury.""

Kepner came from a large blended family with eight siblings.

No one has been charged with a crime in Kepner's death, but her 16-year-old stepbrother's parents have both said in court filings that he is being eyed as a ""suspect"" by the FBI.

CHEERLEADER'S CRUISE SHIP DEATH UNRAVELS AMID BITTER FAMILY STRIFE AND QUESTIONS AT SEA

The FBI declined to comment, citing the active investigation.

But others close to Anna have accused the 16-year-old of inappropriate behavior, ranging from climbing ""on top of her"" in the middle of the night as she slept to reportedly scaring her with a knife.

Her ex-boyfriend, speaking to reporters outside her memorial service Thursday night, said he was on a 3 a.m. FaceTime call with her when she fell asleep. Then, he claims, he caught her stepbrother slide into the frame.

""I was like, ‘What the hell are you doing in her room?'"" he said. ""Then he got scared and ran away, and I heard his footsteps running through the house 'cause he got caught.""

If investigators are really eying him as a suspect as his parents suggested, they're going to focus on the evidence in the cabin, Diaz said.

The stepsiblings were staying in the room together, Anna's step-grandfather, Chris Donohue, told Fox News Digital previously.

CRUISE SHIP DEATH: CHEERLEADER'S STEPMOM COULD BE FORCED TO TESTIFY AGAINST HER OWN SON

""They're not going to rush this one,"" said Nicole Parker, a former Miami-based FBI agent who worked in the same office investigating Kepner's death.

And they don't need to, because if the juvenile is indeed the suspect, as his parents have claimed in court filings in a bitter custody battle, minors are less of a flight risk, Parker said.

""[Juveniles] can absolutely be charged, but the federal Bureau of Prisons, they can't house minors,"" she said. ""So, if I'm gonna charge a juvenile, they have to be put in a special housing system. For that reason, sometimes the feds will give it to the locals.""

That's unlikely in a case of this magnitude, however, she said.

""They could charge him federally, and they could potentially charge him as an adult,"" she said.

Easily popping the lid off a jar can mean you'll live longer — but not for the reasons you think.

Great grip strength is regarded as a key indicator of longevity, with one 2019 study linking stronger grip strength with lower rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment.

The iron-gripped among us also experience day-to-day health benefits. ""Those same people tend to have just better metabolism as well,"" Sarah Crawford, a physical therapist and owner of Anchor Wellness in Cincinnati, told Business Insider. ""So better blood sugar regulation, better hormonal balance, reduced inflammation.""

What do these people all have in common (besides giving firm handshakes)? Staying very active, she said. Grip strength is formed by building small muscles in the hands and forearms, which is harder to do than building larger muscles like your hamstrings or quadriceps.

""So if you're keeping smaller, deeper muscles strong, you have to be keeping bigger muscles strong, too,"" she said.

This is why squeezing a stress ball throughout an otherwise sedentary day won't do anything for grip strength.

""Grip strength is really a by-product of living an active lifestyle,"" W. Zach Smith, a physical therapist and owner of HIDEF Physical Therapy in Seattle, told Business Insider. He compared it to a person's walking speed, another sign of longevity: ""It's based on all of the things they do in their life to stay healthy.""

The relationship to grip strength and strength training is fairly simple: grip strength is vital to progressing in pull-ups or heavy deadlifts, Crawford said. As you challenge yourself in those exercises, your grip strength improves over time.

Smith said popular exercises like bent-over rows, kettlebell swings, or sled pulls (where you hold a handle instead of tying the sled around your waist) all naturally build your grip strength because they involve pulling or carrying motions.

""Even rowing on a machine is going to take quite a bit of grip strength, having to pull,"" he said.

Crawford said farmer's carries — holding a heavy kettlebell in each hand and walking — ""build grip endurance, shoulder stability, and core control all at once.""

Similar exercises, such as a suitcase carry (holding only one weight) or using a trap bar (a hexagonal barbell that you can grip on its sides), also boost grip strength, Smith said.

""Even a simple dead hang from a bar is a great grip-builder,"" he said, which involves simply holding on to a pull-up bar for as long as you can. 

If weight-training isn't your thing, Smith said other workouts, like bouldering or gymnastics, also build your strength — including your grip.

Because of the grip strength longevity buzz over the past few years, Smith has seen devices like hand grippers and squeeze balls become trendier.

With his own clients, he's seen little success when using them without additional strength training in the mix. ""Building grip strength for the sake of grip strength using grip trainers rarely works, and we have had many clients try,"" he said.

However, if you're already strength training, Crawford said it doesn't hurt to do a few desk exercises in between Zoom meetings. The hand gripper ""targets the primary muscles of the hand and forearm and can be used just about anywhere,"" she said. She also recommended therapy putty, which comes in different resistance levels and ""helps strengthen the smaller, intrinsic muscles of the hand that we often neglect.""

You can also get creative in challenging your grip strength throughout the day. ""If you're parking further away in the grocery store parking lot and carrying your groceries out of the store instead of pushing them in a cart, that in and of itself will have an impact,"" Crawford said.

Even fine motor tasks, like coloring with a pencil, add up over time. ""Daily practices that are pretty easy to implement will positively impact grip strength,"" she said — as long as you're still hitting the gym.

The NFT sector is undergoing a curious transformation: while the number of buyers is climbing, both transaction counts and total sales values are falling, a pattern that reflects broader volatility in the crypto space and evolving investor sentiment. 



The drop in NFT sales echoes a 43% monthly fall in the global NFT market cap, now at $2.78 billion—the lowest since April 2025 and an 80% plunge from its $17 billion peak in 2022 







Yet, innovation continues despite the market's struggles. Projects such as RaveGods are introducing tokenized experiences that merge Web3 with real-world events, granting NFT owners both revenue-sharing and governance opportunities 



The future direction of the market remains unclear. Short-term technicals for Ethereum hint at a possible bounce from the $3,000 support level, but broader risks—like a stronger dollar and corrections in equity markets—remain significant

Strategy (MSTR) has become the go-to tool for crypto investors trying to manage risk, according to Tom Lee, chairman and CEO of Bitmine, partly explaining its 43% drop over the past month.



“[Strategy] is probably the most important stock watch right now, because that is the bitcoin proxy, it's the most liquid name,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday.



With limited options to hedge losses directly in crypto markets, institutional traders have turned to shorting Strategy shares instead. The company holds nearly 650,000 bitcoin BTC$84,706.07, making its stock price closely tied to bitcoin's performance.



“It seems to me that in the crypto world when they're trying to hedge their loss in bitcoin and ethereum they can't find any other way to hedge it except shorting the liquid stocks that it proxies and that's the MicroStrategys,” Lee said.



He added that crypto-native hedging tools, like derivatives on bitcoin and ether ETH$2,751.92, aren't liquid or deep enough for major players. “Anyone who has a sizable bitcoin long position … they have very limited ability to hedge it in crypto derivatives,” he said.



But Strategy, he explained, offers a workaround. “Somebody can use [Strategy's] option chain which is so liquid to hedge all of their crypto.”



In effect, he said, “[Strategy] is essentially absorbing all the hedging pressure that the crypto industry is trying to do to protect their longs.”



Lee also pointed to the lingering effects of the Oct. 10 market crash, which wiped out $20 billion in value and disrupted liquidity across exchanges. “It really crippled market makers,” he said, describing them as the “central bank” of crypto.



Since then, cracks in the system have remained, with liquidity still thin across altcoins, miner stocks and bitcoin proxies like Strategy. MSTR has been among the hardest hit in the current downturn, which Lee believes is partly due to it serving as a pressure valve for the rest of the market.



He believes crypto's market plumbing remains fragile, and Strategy's role as a hedge is a sign of deeper structural issues.

Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, a firm that helps wealthy individuals and their families navigate the world of cryptocurrency, recalls how one of his clients, “a gentleman from Dallas,” turned $11,000 into almost half a billion dollars, primarily from trading memecoins – culturally themed crypto tokens with no real utility whose valuations can fluctuate wildly.

The lucky investor, whom Claver got to know first as a friend, managed his own crypto. “He used a sniper bot [automated software that will buy and sell newly listed tokens in milliseconds according to certain parameters] that made him millions from memecoin trading,” Claver said.

Eventually, Claver persuaded his friend to attend one of the registered investment adviser's (RIA) family office events, which led to a portion of the trader's portfolio being rolled into XRP, the well-established native token of the Ripple network. “We saw a 6x on XRP so he did pretty well,” Claver said.

Several years before, Claver found himself searching for advice on managing his own crypto gains. Specifically, he wanted to explore how best to structure his crypto estate, handle his taxes, carry out succession planning and so on.

But none of the typical wealth advice you find in the traditional high net worth (HNW) space seemed to be available for holders of crypto. After a few useful introductions, Claver consulted with some family offices and saw a glaring advisory gap in the market. This led to the formation of Digital Ascension, and from a standing start, the firm now looks after about $1 billion in crypto assets for wealthy families.

“Asension started taking capital in October last year, and we partnered with Anchorage for institutional custody,” Claver said in an interview. “So, we've gone from zero to a billion in all crypto in about one year. We work with 10families, and we have about another 1,500 clients that have somewhere between half a million and 5 million in total portfolio value. And I can confidently say we are the largest RIA in the world for crypto.”

Ascension takes any private client services that you can think of, and does that for crypto, explained Claver. That includes estate planning, taxes, accounting, bill-pay and everything a family office would provide. This sits alongside wealth management, which includes allocating to various cryptocurrencies, setting up lines of credit and earning returns on assets, but all done in a buttoned-up and regulated fashion – “Not through DeFi [decentralized finance],” Claver said.

“We do it with institutional custody and with insurance on your assets and things like tri-party agreements to mitigate risk of loss,” he said. “It's very different from the kind of onchain stuff. You can get all the additional assurances you would get from an institution with the benefit of the additional services.”

A crucial component here is custody, courtesy of technology built by Anchorage, one of the first U.S.-regulated crypto safekeeping firms. It was recently selected by BlackRock to look after its crypto ETF assets.

“The institutional custody at Anchorage and sub accounts structure means the client is never a creditor,” Claver said. “These are always your assets. They sit in your account. Effectively, a Schwab account for your crypto is basically what it ends up being.”

This allows for a structure that's a lot more intricate and nuanced than a few people having keys to some cold wallet (a means of holding crypto assets that stays remote from the harsh winds of the internet).

“You can have beneficiaries on the account such as your spouse,” Claver said. “If you have a trustee that has to sign off — say it's an asset-protection trust or another type of structure — we can add multiple signers and governance on who gets access to the assets, when, and for what reasons.”

Trading crypto assets prone to periods of intense volatility may not be for the fainthearted, but the industry has amassed monumental wealth for investors in recent years and continues to create more wealthy individuals in each cycle. The global population of crypto millionaires increased by 40% from the previous year to 2025, according to a recent study.

That said, the lack of grown-up advice and basic crypto wealth management — which Ascension is servicing — was highlighted in a recent survey by Swiss software firm Avaloq that found the traditional wealth sector is under mounting pressure to deliver digital assets to wealthy clients. In the UAE, for instance, 63% of ultra-rich investors have switched managers or are considering doing so, according to that survey.

What often happens is the children of ultra-high-net-worth families are the ones educating their elders about digital assets. A generation that grew up with crypto, family-office kids use laptops or phones to purchase large quantities of tokens on exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.

It's mostly second- or third-generation family office members that Ascension initially speaks with, Claver said, guided via his firm's social media presence. The next step is to schedule a call with the elders.

“It's usually a conversation with the matriarch or patriarch and I kind of explain to them that this is the next iteration of the internet, and that there's certain protocols and networks that will be used for public infrastructure, and also how this is kind of a hedge against other positions that they might have,” he said.

Oftentimes, the second or third gen person that's brought the conversation will be given a couple of million dollars to invest in digital assets to see how it works out. Most of the time it's somewhere less than 1%, Claver said.

“If they want to make a large allocation to certain cryptos — bitcoin, Ethereum, SOL, Matic, chainlink, XRP, XLM, HBAR, whatever it is — we help them make that allocation. Or, if they already have those allocations in a cold wallet, and they don't have a continuity plan built around that, then they can put it in institutional custody. Then you get assurances and planning, versus having keys or words written down on a piece of paper that a few people might have and have to reconstitute a wallet every quarter to make adjustments.”

Claver admits things have evolved since the early days of Bitcoin libertarians. Apart from anything else, the demographic of these early holders has changed, with many entering the 40-plus age group. And anyone's perspective starts to change when they suddenly have a lot of capital to protect, he added.

“If you've got a couple 100 grand, or even a couple million dollars, you may feel comfortable managing the risk associated with that, like cash in your mattress. I get that,"" Claver said. “But when it becomes $20, $50, $100 million or even a billion dollars, it's a very different animal.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Hidden microglia switch helps protect the brain from Alzheimer's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251122044335.htm","Sat, 22 Nov 2025 18:29:18 GMT","

Working with Alzheimer's mouse models, human cells, and donated human brain tissue, researchers found that reducing levels of a molecule called PU.1 can shift microglia into a more protective mode. Microglia are immune cells that live in the brain and help maintain its health. When PU.1 levels drop, these cells increase the production of certain lymphoid immunoregulatory receptor proteins, which are typically involved in managing immune responses in the body.

Although these protective microglia appear in relatively small numbers, the study showed that they have a powerful influence across the brain. Their presence helps calm harmful inflammation, supports cognitive abilities, and improves survival in mice. In contrast, when the team removed CD28 from this rare group of microglia, inflammation rose sharply and plaques associated with Alzheimer's developed more quickly. This outcome demonstrated how essential CD28 is for enabling the helpful actions of these cells.

Microglia as Flexible and Protective Brain Cells

""Microglia are not simply destructive responders in Alzheimer's disease -- they can become the brain's protectors,"" explained Anne Schaefer, the senior author of the research and leader of the project. She noted that the findings build on earlier work showing that microglia can adopt a wide range of functional states, allowing them to play many different roles in brain health. According to Schaefer, the results also highlight how international scientific partnerships are crucial for making progress in complex fields like neurodegeneration.

Alexander Tarakhovsky added that it was striking to see immune-related molecules, long recognized for their roles in B and T lymphocytes, also influencing microglia. ""This discovery comes at a time when regulatory T cells have achieved major recognition as master regulators of immunity, highlighting a shared logic of immune regulation across cell types,"" he said. He also pointed out that understanding this shared system may open the door to new immunotherapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease.

Genetic Clues That Connect PU.1 to Alzheimer's Risk

The work expands on earlier genetic studies by senior co-author Alison Goate, who identified a common variant in SPI1 (the gene responsible for producing PU.1) that is associated with a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's. Goate explained, ""These results provide a mechanistic explanation for why lower PU.1 levels are linked to reduced Alzheimer's risk,"" offering a clearer picture of how genetics influence disease vulnerability.

Overall, the discovery of the PU.1-CD28 axis provides researchers with a new molecular framework for understanding how protective microglial states arise. It also emphasizes the promise of developing treatments that specifically target microglia in order to alter the course of Alzheimer's disease.

In order to accelerate the construction of new power plants needed to provide energy for its data centers, Meta is looking to get into the business of trading electricity.

Bloomberg reports that both Meta and Microsoft are asking for federal approval to trade power (Apple has already received this approval). According to Meta, this will allow it to make long-term commitments to buy electricity from new plants, while mitigating the risk by having the ability to resell some of that power on wholesale power markets.

Meta's head of global Urvi Parekh told Bloomberg that power plant developers “want to know that the consumers of power are willing to put skin in the game.”

“Without Meta taking a more active voice in the need to expand the amount of power that's on the system, it's not happening as quickly as we would like,” Parekh said.

As an example of the unprecedented energy needs underlying tech companies' ambitious AI data center plans, Bloomberg notes that at least three new gas-powered plants will need to be built to power Meta's Louisiana data center campus.

I'd venture to say contextual advertising would be more effective than whatever we've been trying to squeeze out of fingerprinting etc.  All this supposed ""data"" they are gathering feels like a scam perpetuated by ad companies about how important it is to the people who buy ads.  It's not.Even Facebook and Instagram, which pretty much should know you to a tee is completely ineffectual at advertising to me - like at all.

Would you pay per view? Most people (me included) would probably hesitate to say yes, because we're used to not paying for that. But what if it meant that ad based model is gone and everything you buy is cheaper because the price does not include the cost of running ads?

Except in practice we see the opposite.There's something interesting going on with companies when they want to get paid directly versus by ads:  they demand 3x - 4x or more for subscriptions or pay per view versus what they make from ads.Easiest place to see this is ad supported non-linear TV in the years you could get without ads, or with ads.  You pay significantly more to not see the ads, than they make from the ads.Perhaps this is justified because ad-free subscriptions reduce the audience size for ad buys, but when you look at the numbers watching with ads versus paying, it wouldn't seem like the ""no ads"" buyers make a dent in whatever pricing tier.In the 90s when we were young and naive, we imagined a library card model, with a library fee and then you have fractions of a cent cost to read a post, and using (hand waving) technology to uncouple viewing history from payables to content creators.  That, or the British TV license model, an Internet license of some kind.It's curious to me the ad networks haven't gotten together to preemptively offer this. Arguably Brave tried, but from an adversarial (to the ad companies) stance. It would work better from the inside with a simple regulation: if you serve ads for ad-supported content, you have to participate in the library card system at CPM rates no greater than you receive for ads to skip the ads for card holders.

But yes, I always thought some form of network syndication would emerge on the Web, where creators could register for their share of aggregated periodic payments made by users.Still not sure why that's not a thing.  I would pay $50/month to a syndicate in return for never having to deal with paywalls on any sites affiliated with them.  But only as long as the vast majority of sites participated, and that is probably the showstopper, I guess.  We'd end up paying 20 different 'syndicates' for absolutely no good reason, just as we now have to deal with 20 different streaming services.

With like 12 students, that's 4 bits, and it often ends up with 2-3 questions. It starts off with the obvious ones - man/woman/diverse, but then a realization comes in: An answer usually contains more information than just that one bit. If you have long hair, you're most likely a woman and/or a metalhead for example. That part will get shaken out later on.And those thoughts make these browser fingerprinting techniques all the more scary: They contain a lot of information and that quickly cuts the possible amount of people down. Like, I'm a Linux Firefox user with a screen on the left. I wouldn't be suprised if that put me in a 5-6 digit bucket of people already.

reply

That means there is less information in the question ""do they have long hair?"", not more. Asking ""long hair?"" and then ""woman?"" is probably, in most groups, roughly the same as just the first or second question alone. So the second question added much less than one bit of information because the answer is probably ""yes"". ""Long hair"" and then ""metalhead"" is the same, except that the answer to the second question is probably ""no"".Yes/no questions on average contain the most information each when they partition the remaining possibilities 50:50. Then each answer gives you exactly one more bit. The closet you get to either a 100:0 or 0:100 yes:no split, the smaller the fraction of a bit you encode in the answer.""Metalhead?"" usually gives you lots of bits of information (probably 4 in an ""average"" group of 16 containing at least one metalhead) if the answer is ""yes"", but on average that's outweighed by the very high chance that the answer will be ""no"". If there are no metalheads or only metalheads, it gives you zero information.

reply

In this case, it was often an interesting exercise in bias as well. ""Woman?"" would usually single out 1-2 persons out of the 15, so it was a terrible question. It was CompSci after all. ""Long hair?"", lumping women and metal heads into one group would often split it into half and half. That was much better, and then spurred creative thoughts like travel distance, or bus stations.

You can think of all sorts of questions and answers like this, and when you combine with the assumptions and answers from previous answers you can make even more assumptions.

This feels like a regulatory question, not a technical one.  We've repeatedly proven that with math and code alone, we can fingerprint and identify almost every unique person on the planet, given enough data points.  The long-term solution seems like it should be severe consequences for data breaches (as in, corporation-destroying penalties for disclosure of PII, including fingerprint data) such that everyone only collects the data they need to provide the service in question and not a single bit more, deleting it as soon as it's no longer necessary.  Right now there's no consequence if Google or Meta disclose huge swaths of user data, and thus no disincentive to collecting as much as they possibly can.Punish the leaking of data, and suddenly you've raised it's cost to the point that casual players will nope out entirely.  From there, it's the eternal back and forth of governments waffling between business and electorate interests.

I'm very skeptical of this claim, especially in practice. Contrary to what many fingerprinting sites claim (""you're unique of everyone we fingerprinted!!""), browser fingerprinting can't possibly uniquely identify someone. Smartphones are pretty locked down and there's very few customization options that allow for fingerprinting. In the US Apple has around 50% market share in the US, and there are 30 iPhones models that are still in support. That means if you're an iPhone user in a city of 1 million, there are, on average, approximately 16.6k (500k / 30) other people with the same exact model of iPhone (and therefore fingerprint) as you. As long as you don't do anything to stick out (eg. living in the US but setting Denmark as your locale), you'll be reasonably anonymous.

In addition, I block most known advertizing/tracking domains at the DNS level (I run my own server, and use Hagezi's blacklists).Finally, another suggestion would be to block all third party content by default using uBlock Origin and/or uMatrix. This will break a lot of websites, but automatically rules out most forms of tracking through things such as fonts hosted by Google, Adobe and others. I manually whitelist required third party domains (CDNs) for websites I frequently visit.

The ironic thing is that because of GDPR and CCPA, ad tech companies got really good at ""anonymizing"" your data. So even if you were to somehow not have an alias linking your various anonymous profiles, you will still end up quickly bucketed into a persona (and multiple audiences) that resemble you quite well. And it's not multiple days of data we're talking about (although it could be), it's minutes and in the case of contextual multi-armed bandits, your persona is likely updates ""within"" a single page load and you are targeted in ~5ms within the request/response lifecycle of that page load.The good news is that most data platforms don't keep data around for more than 90 days because then they are automatically compliant with ""right to be forgotten"" without having to service requests for removal of personal data.

However, you might also want to access HTTP and HTML, and to do so without needing to load fonts, pictures, etc; you might use a web browser that omits many of these features. However, it also can result in some problems; there are a few ways to work around some of these, such as adding your own scripts to handle some services, adding proxy services for handling some services (although some of these can use other protocols such as Gemini), and/or using the HTML/CSS commands in other ways (e.g. using ARIA to decide the formatting rather than using CSS). However, there are other issues, e.g. if the web page you download includes more junk than the actual main text.

Duralex is a beloved brand, and the French wouldn't like to see it go, but not enough to have much of an influence in the shopping aisle. The nostalgia aspect is real (ask the French about the numbers at the bottom of the glass ;) ), but it may be a negative when looking for more ""adult"" glassware. Maybe you don't want your guests or yourself feel like your are in a school canteen. School canteens also don't have a reputation for being luxurious to say the least, which may be a problem if you want to charge a premium. It may be that's the idea behind the pint glasses by the way. Show that Duralex can make glassware for grownups too.

I use only borosilicate glass vessels for cooking, for storing food, for eating and for drinking (some from France, some from Czechia).I have replaced some of them in order to have more optimized sizes and shapes for the ways I use them (even if the replaced vessels were still perfectly good), and I have some extra vessels kept in reserve for the very unlikely case when I will break a vessel (which has not happened yet).I do not expect that I would need to buy any more such vessels during my lifetime, unless I will become bored of those that I have and I would want a change.So making money from selling high-quality glassware that can last forever is much more difficult than getting free money from a software subscription.

Duralex is currently selling products at 10x the costs of what a similar product, made in China, costs on Amazon. This is not sustainable. These enormous differences in prices mean that only very people can afford their products. It is a brand which sells an everyday item at prices, which are legitimately hard to afford for most of the population.Obviously a company like this can not succeed long term. It is totally uncompetitive, except for some brand recognition and positive brand perception. These obviously help, but will do nothing for the long term success.

A fully working wood encased Enigma machine went for double the expected price in Paris earlier this week. Batteries were included.

A WWII Enigma machine with four rotors was sold at auction earlier this week, achieving double its estimated price. Christie's in Paris said the auction lot was “one of the rarest and hardest Enigma machines to decipher” (machine translation).

This auction will have drawn in WWII and computer enthusiast collectors due to this sample being fully operational, complete with lead-acid batteries. It is also thought to be one of only eight working models remaining. This might explain why it achieved double the estimate, with an unnamed bidder paying €482,600 (US$555,233).

While interesting in its own right as a primordial encryption device, the WWII German military's Enigma machines are probably most famous now for precipitating the development of computers.

Code breakers at Bletchley Park in England were tasked with deciphering Engima machine messages that were used for command and control of the German Navy, particularly the stealthy submarine fleet.

British spies enjoyed early WWII secret message deciphering success with the special-purpose The Bombe, developed by Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman. This complex electromechanical device was designed to match the three‑rotor Enigma M3, using its own three-rotor system. But this system began to fall short once the German Navy introduced the four‑rotor Enigma M4.

German Admiral Karl Dönitz had ordered the development of the M4 (like this auction piece) in 1941 to bolster U-boat communications security. Breaking the M4 cyphers could still be done using the Bombe, but required the crucial help of captured codebooks and statistical reduction techniques.

Interestingly, the German military top brass reckoned “it was impossible for the Allies to decipher Enigma communications,” noted Christie's. Allied successes in countering the U-boat fleet thanks to the application of The Bombe were apparently put down to a variety of false explanations – like espionage, radar, or simple good luck.

Meanwhile, in 1943, Tommy Flowers completed the development of Colossus MK I. This was the first programmable electronic digital computer, though it was designed specifically to attack the Lorenz cipher, as used by communications from the German High Command.

The Colossus was quickly installed at Bletchley Park to break Lorenz cipher traffic, marking a new front in the cryptographic war. A faster Colossus Mk II was even introduced a year later, while the war still raged.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a lowered mood and loss of interest, contributing not only to difficulties in academic and professional life but also as a major cause of suicide in South Korea. However, there are currently no objective biological markers that can be used for diagnosis or treatment. Amidst this, a research team from KAIST has revealed that depression is not merely a problem of the mind or brain, but is deeply connected to abnormalities in the body's overall immune response. They found that this immune abnormality affects brain function, and the 'Immune Neural Axis' imbalance is the core mechanism of depression, opening up the possibility for the discovery of new biomarkers and the development of new drugs for depression treatment.

KAIST announced on the November 20th that Professor Jinju Han's research team from the Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering (GSMSE) at KAIST, in collaboration with Professor Yangsik Kim's research team (Ph.D., KAIST GSMSE) from Inha University School of Medicine, performed a multi-omics analysis combining blood analysis, single-cell analysis, and patient-derived brain organoids (mini-brains). This study focused on female patients with MDD who exhibited 'Atypical Features' (such as hypersomnia and overeating) and 'Psychotic Symptoms' (such as auditory hallucinations, excessive guilt, and self-blame), which are contrary to typical depression symptoms, and who also had impaired reality judgment.

■ ""Immune Cells and Brain Function are Altered Together"" A New Biological Clue for Depression

The research team simultaneously examined genetic changes in immune cells in the blood and changes in nervous-system-related proteins. The results confirmed a breakdown in the balance of immune-neural interaction in patients with depression.

MDD, especially in young women, often presents with atypical symptoms (hypersomnia, overeating, mood reactivity, etc.), which increases the risk of a later diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Furthermore, about 40% of patients are classified as treatment-resistant depression, showing no response to various antidepressants.

Consequently, there has been a continuous call for the development of new therapeutic strategies and the discovery of biomarkers based on immunity and metabolism, moving beyond the traditional drug-centric approach.

■ World's First Integration of ""Leukocyte Single-Cell Analysis + Brain Organoid"" A New Paradigm for Psychiatric Research

The research team presented the world's first precision medicine approach by integrating plasma proteomics, leukocyte single-cell transcriptome analysis, and analysis of brain organoids created from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).

The results showed that patients with atypical depression exhibited high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, proteins crucial for inter-neuronal signaling (DCLK3 and CALY) were significantly elevated compared to normal levels, and Complement Protein C5, which strongly enhances the body's immune response, was also increased. This indicates that both 'brain function' and 'immune function' are excessively activated and out of balance within the body.

This finding confirms a clue that depression is not merely a mood issue but is connected to biological changes occurring throughout the entire body. Upon examining the immune cells of depression patients, genetic changes were found that make inflammatory responses in the body occur more easily and strongly than usual. This implies that the entire bodily immune system is in a state of excessive activation, and this immune/inflammatory abnormality may influence the development of depression.

The patient-derived brain organoids showed accompanying growth retardation and abnormal neural development, supporting the possibility that immune abnormalities interact with changes in brain function to exacerbate the disease.

■ ""Immune-Neural Axis Imbalance is the Core Mechanism of Atypical Depression""

This study integrated clinical data, single-cell omics, proteomics, and brain organoids to demonstrate that the 'Imbalance of the Immune-Neural Axis' is the core mechanism of MDD accompanied by atypical and psychotic symptoms.

This achievement presents a new precision medicine model for psychiatric research,"" adding, ""We anticipate that this will actively lead to biomarker discovery and new drug development.""

Center back Cameron Carter-Vickers will miss the rest of Celtic's season with a long-term achilles injury, likely dashing any possible hopes of making the U.S. men's national team's roster for next summer's World Cup on home soil.

Carter-Vickers sustained the achilles injury during Celtic's 2-1 win over Sturm Graz in the UEFA Europa League last month, an injury that was expected to keep him out until March. Celtic interim manager Martin O'Neill, though, confirmed on Friday that the 27-year-old will not play again this season.

""We will not see him,"" O'Neill said before Saturday's match at St. Mirren. ""I think it might be April before he's even on grass. Funnily enough, I did ask him yesterday, did he think he would be ready for the World Cup? And he said he thought that would be very doubtful.""

With little more than six months to go until the USMNT's opening match of the World Cup, Carter-Vickers is the first member of the national team's player pool to face the possibility of missing the tournament with an injury. Though he has not been a fixture of the team since Mauricio Pochettino became the head coach in late 2024, there was a real opportunity for Carter-Vickers to make a case for himself -- Pochettino has recently begun to deploy a back three, a formation change that paved the way for their year-ending five game unbeaten run.

Carter-Vickers was very recently on Pochettino's radar, too, joining the group for October's friendlies against Ecuador and Australia. He did not play in either match, though, and his only minutes under Pochettino came in March's 2-1 defeat to Canada in the Concacaf Nations League third place match, during which he played 90 minutes.

The center back was a member of the USMNT's 2022 World Cup squad, playing 90 minutes in the national team's group stage finale against Iran, which was a 1-0 victory.

Gonzalo García, the top scorer of the Club World Cup and one of the most intriguing figures in Real Madrid's post-Mbappé era, may be on his way to the Premier League. The report comes from the Daily Mail and fits perfectly with what's happening now: Brighton is tracking the 21-year-old forward and already open to making a move, while Leeds and Sunderland also evaluated him during the most recent transfer window. The story gained traction because, despite his shine in the intercontinental tournament, Gonzalo has basically lost his place in the 2025–26 season.

Gonzalo became a global talking point when Xabi Alonso decided to bet on him in the Club World Cup. Without Mbappé and without Endrick at the time, the coach needed an immediate alternative and saw in the kid someone who could handle pressure. And he did. He scored four goals in six matches, including the strike that knocked Juventus out in the round of 16, likely the defining moment of Real's run in the tournament. Meanwhile, Mbappé only became a starter in the semifinal, which happened to be the game where Real Madrid was crushed 4–0 by PSG.

The problem is that his international spotlight didn't translate into space once the regular season got going. With Mbappé fully fit, Gonzalo lost his spot completely in the forward hierarchy. The numbers tell the whole story: he played 449 minutes in the Club World Cup, but only 107 minutes across nine Real Madrid matches this season. And that doesn't include stoppage time. He started just once, in the 2–0 win over Espanyol, when he played 61 minutes. The rest has been short cameos late in games, something that wears down any young player who needs real minutes to grow.

This is where the Premier League comes into play, with English clubs targeting a young forward who isn't getting opportunities at a European giant. With Gonzalo, the equation is ideal: proven talent, young age, resale potential and no clear short-term path at Real Madrid.

Brighton, now known for identifying promising players and developing them at a high level, is following the situation closely. The club believes it can offer what the forward doesn't have in Madrid right now: consistent minutes, a real role and a less rigid environment to evolve. Leeds and Sunderland, mentioned in the last window, show that the interest isn't new, but the feeling is that Brighton fits his profile better at this moment.

And if the market has taught anything, it's that minutes matter more than a badge. If nothing changes in how he's used, the trend points to another Valdebebas talent finding his peak somewhere far from Madrid.

Morgan Gibbs-White has lifted the lid on what manager Sean Dyche wanted from Nottingham Forest following their thumping 3-0 win at Liverpool. Murillo fired the visitors in front from a corner after 33 minutes before Nicolas Savona scored shortly after the break. Gibbs-White put some extra gloss on the scoreline in a performance that was full of spirit and endeavour.  

Dyche replaced the sacked Ange Postecoglou at Forest in late October and he has already fired them out of the relegation zone and up the Premier League table. After their 3-1 win over Leeds United earlier this month, they backed up that victory with a superb triumph against Liverpool on Saturday. The scoreline could have been even more one-sided had Igor Jesus not had a goal controversially ruled out for handball but Gibbs-White did not seem to care too much as he praised his team-mates and manager. 

He told Premier League Productions: ""I didn't expect it but it's happened. I'm out there trying to help the team as much as possible. I thought the boys were brilliant today. Delighted we got the three points but I hope we're out of the relegation zone. We felt comfortable even though we didn't have the ball. We were defensively secure and that's credit to the boys and the manager. Delighted to get another goal but we got a clean sheet and three points at Anfield, which is an incredible thing. They're still a great team with incredible individuals. When you're in a tough patch, we know it's hard to get out of it. We knew we'd have a chance and it was about us being solid and taking our chance when we got it. When Sean Dyche came in, he made it clear the season starts now. He's been putting us to work, but we needed it to compete at the highest level. We've been running, running, running. Any game in the Premier League is difficult. We have to take it game by game."" 

Despite having just over 25 per cent possession at Anfield, Forest were deserved winners and, coupled with a strong defensive effort, earned them a hard-fought clean sheet. After the match, former Everton boss Dyche was delighted with how his team acquitted themselves on Merseyside and the timing of their second goal.   

He told PLP, ""I thought they started really fast after a tough result at Man City. The defensive unit was great. I'm really pleased with that early stage. It's really tough to dominate the ball on a ground like this. I was super pleased with that [second goal]. Half-time when you're 1-0 up at Anfield is a strange thing. I wanted them to do the basics, but we went and scored. We did a very good job of seeing the game through. We want to build that competitive mentality. I always have a team that is competitive. That is a big marker for me. I do remind them that this is another step. The fans can have that one. Timing in football can be everything. Whether it's a player, a manager or a coach. I want to look after this football club, it's important for me to do everything we can.""

The defending Premier League champions dropped to 11th in the table with this demoralising loss on home turf. This result marked their sixth defeat in their last seven games, something Reds manager Arne Slot could not hide his dismay over.  

He told BBC Match of the Day: ""Another big disappointment. We started off quite well for the first half an hour. We conceded the 1-0, and we weren't able to play the way we did in the first half hour. I don't know. I heard it wasn't offside, so if it's not offside, there's nothing to debate. We created and were waiting for us to score a goal. The set piece changed everything, and they scored two. If things go well or things go bad, it's my responsibility. We weren't able to create enough. I tried to adjust a few things, but it didn't work out. We were unable to score a goal. You never know in this stadium, if you score a goal, then things can work out.""     

Liverpool don't have long to dwell on this defeat as they host PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday, before travelling to West Ham next Sunday. They then play a further four games in 10 days as the fixtures keep coming.     

Slot added: ""In a few days, we have to play in the Champions League again and then play three Premier League games in a short space. Keep your head up and work incredibly hard. We are trying every single day. It's always helpful to have experienced and quality players. It's not working out at this moment."" ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Marcel Granollers and Pedro Martinez sent Spain to the title match at the Davis Cup Finals on Saturday, when they earned a hard-fought 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 deciding doubles rubber win against Germany's Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz.

Earlier, Alexander Zverev had levelled the tie for Germany in Bologna with a 7-6(2) 7-6(5) victory against Jaume Munar after Pablo Carreno Busta had beaten Jan-Lennard Struff 6-4 7-6(6) to give Spain the lead.

With the doubles left to decide the semi-final tie, Granollers and Martinez stepped up to send Spain through. They crucially saved one break point when serving for the match at 5-3, 30/40 in the third set, earning victory on their first match point to spark jubilant scenes of celebration among the Spanish team.

In the first match of the day, Carreno Busta saved five consecutive set points in the second set against Struff, rallying from 1/6 behind in the tie-break to give his nation the lead after one hour and 46 minutes.



The No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Zverev clubbed 32 winners, including 13 aces, past Munar but ultimately his victory was in vain. Zverev ends his season holding a 57-25 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Spain is in its first Davis Cup final since lifting the trophy in 2019. The former champion will play two-time defending champion Italy in Sunday's final.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Las Vegas Grand Prix

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Oscar Piastri will line up in fifth for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with the McLaren driver stating after Qualifying that ""things seem to not be going the way I want at the moment"".

Oscar Piastri conceded that the outcome of his Qualifying at the Las Vegas Grand Prix was “a tough one to take”, with the Australian ending up in P5 despite earlier feeling that a “good result” was on the cards.

Amid mixed conditions throughout the session, Piastri displayed good pace but had his final run in Q3 disrupted by a yellow flag, leaving the McLaren driver on the third row of the grid – four positions behind team mate and title rival Lando Norris.

Reflecting on what had gone wrong during those closing moments, the 24-year-old explained: “I got a yellow flag and that was pretty much the end of it. We were quick, there's no doubt about that – just one way or another, things seem to not be going the way I want at the moment.

“At least I can say that the pace was good out there – it felt pretty good in Q3, [but there were] things that we couldn't control.”

Piastri has faced a tough run across recent races, with the McLaren racer having finished off the podium during the last five rounds.

Pushed on how he feels about some factors being beyond his control, Piastri responded: “It's certainly not been the case for… in that session, yes, things didn't go my way, but there's been plenty of things that could have gone my way previously, so I don't feel like it's a kind of recurring theme, so to speak.

“A tough one to take when it looked like we were on for a good result. I can't do much about it unfortunately.”

Piastri will be looking to make ground on race day, which he enters with a 24-point deficit to championship leader Norris.

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Here are some of the best facts and stats from Qualifying for the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

Lando Norris took a stunning pole position for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, mastering the treacherous wet conditions that threw up a significant challenge for the 20 drivers on the F1 grid.

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams on race day in Nevada.

On a wild night in Las Vegas, with rain lashing down, it was Lando Norris who played the best hand, taking his seventh pole of the season, ahead of Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz. So what's on the cards for race day, strategy-wise? Let's take a look at the options…

The pre-race sims suggested a medium>hard one-stop was the fastest way to the chequered flag – but very few attempted it. All 20 drivers had saved two sets of hard tyres for the race, and were determined to use them.

The first nine over the line all ran a medium>hard>hard race, with Sergio Pérez in P10 mixing things up with a hard>medium>hard, in a bid to offset his strategy, and make gains from P15 on the grid.

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Formula 1 Hall of Fame journalist David Tremayne takes a look back at the first incarnation of a Grand Prix run in Las Vegas, back in the early 1980s...

Sometimes you need something badly enough that you'll put up with anything to make it happen. Even if it means that you end up having to race in a car park. Ask Bernie Ecclestone...

There used to be a place outside Las Vegas called the Stardust Raceway, but it was paved over in 1970 and in any case, by 1981, wasn't close enough to the great gambling metropolis in the Nevada desert.

So that was how, when then F1-boss Bernie Ecclestone was looking for a new F1 venue, the two US Grands Prix run at the famed Caesars Palace (note the conscious deletion of the possessive apostrophe) in 1981 and '82 came to be run where the punters usually left their cars.

Assuredly, that first event wasn't what everyone had envisaged when the news was first announced.

The Caesars Palace GP should have been the perfect way to bring F1 to the people, at a time when F1 had just lost Watkins Glen, the sport's longtime American home situated in New York State's beautiful Finger Lakes region.

Sure, there was still Long Beach, over the other side of the country, with its dubious downtown attractions, but Detroit was another year away. And Bernie did not want F1 to lose its hold in its biggest market, especially at a time when Indycars and NASCAR were at their peaks.

Many F1 people were shocked – read appalled in most cases – to discover when they arrived that the 2.26-mile concrete-walled ‘track' resembled, as John Watson put it, “three paper clips side by side” in the car park of the eponymous hotel/gambling emporium. But it was flat, its surface was smooth and it was actually quite quick.

And – wouldn't you know it? – Bernie hit the jackpot even before any of the 30 cars turned a wheel.

He was dealt the perfect hand of cards as the strong 15-race season had boiled down to a shootout for the World Championship between points leader Carlos Reutemann of Williams and Nelson Piquet of Brabham (Bernie's own man).

Carlos had 49 points, Nelson 48. Would the former be Argentina's first World Champion since the great Juan Manuel Fangio? Or would the latter be Brazil's first since trailblazer Emerson Fittipaldi?

Typically, Bernie's hand included a wild card. Gentleman Jacques Laffite, on 43 points, could become France's first champion but really needed to win with Nelson no higher than third and Carlos no higher than fourth.

But just to spice things further, if he won with Nelson third and Carlos fourth, each would have 52 points. But Jacques would rule with three wins (the same as Nelson) but two seconds to his single one.

In Friday practice, Carlos was in that absolutely imperious form he could produce every so often, lapping 0.415s faster than anyone else. And he casually pointed out that he had lost time on oil. But team mate Alan Jones got things to his liking on Saturday to join him on the front row.

Gilles Villeneuve showed his rodeo skills by taking his ill-handling Ferrari 126CK to third, from Nelson. The top 10 was completed by Alain Prost's Renault; Watson's McLaren; Patrick Tambay's Ligier Matra; Bruno Giacomelli's Alfa Romeo; Nigel Mansell's Lotus; and national hero Mario Andretti in the other Alfa.

As one might have expected given the location, race day was dry and very hot, with an ambient temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit as the grid formed for the 75-lap event. And Carlos was about to suffer what looked like one of F1's greatest bouts of stage fright.

He had missed the drivers' briefing and now sat in the cockpit complaining to Frank Williams that having been fine in the morning warm-up, his FW07C had suddenly developed understeer from nowhere in right-handers on the formation laps.

On what should have been the crowning day of his career, Miserable Carlos had shoved Majestic Carlos aside.

Jones dominated the race from start to finish, ensuring that whatever happened, Williams secured the Constructors' Championship. Gilles was his closest opposition until intolerant Clerk of the Course Bob Swenson exercised his own interesting brand of race promotion by disqualifying him failing to line up perfectly in his grid slot. The spectators loved that…

Carlos had begun his slump on the first lap, dropping from that stunning pole to sixth, and then Jacques also passed him. But Nelson had also lagged, and fallen to eighth on the first lap. But that was only temporary and by Lap 17 he overtook his fading rival, who curiously offered absolutely no resistance.

Nelson then came up trumps as he climbed to fifth, while Carlos continued to throw snake eyes, never looking like the man who had taken pole in such dominant fashion just the day before.

But as the race progressed, Nelson was in trouble. He was never the fittest driver, but he had also had a particularly harsh massage earlier in the week which hurt his back, and was now struggling badly. Perhaps the cards were falling for Carlos after all?

One more lap, and he would surely have caught and passed the Brabham, even at his strangely feeble pace. Nelson was completely done and had been sick in his helmet, and limped home fifth behind Jones, Prost, Giacomelli and Nigel Mansell, chased by Jacques, Wattie and Carlos.

He had scored those crucial two points, but had to be helped from the cockpit and it took him 15 minutes to make it to the podium. But he had done enough, he was World Champion for the first time.

And Carlos? When he had been leading the fight by a country mile at Silverstone (with 43 points to Nelson's 26) he had effectively said to journalist Alan Henry that he doubted he would win the title. Now it had finished as 50 to 49. So what had happened? Why was his best race lap 1.3s off Jonesy's?

Carlos himself never offered an explanation. Williams confirmed the corner weights and the gearbox were okay. They were completely bemused. Years later an Argentine journalist asked Carlos what on earth had happened.

“When I look back and recall that as a kid I had to go to school on horseback, and I went all the way from there to being an F1 driver… it is a pleasure that nobody can take away.”

It was an elegant response, but did nothing to solve the mystery. On his day of destiny a charismatic, complex character had simply become The Man Who Defeated Himself.

There would be another race in 1982, by which time Detroit had been added to Long Beach. The 16th round of the 1982 World Championship was scheduled to be run over 75 more laps on Saturday, October 16.

And… of course you guessed it: Bernie hit the jackpot again as it was another title decider, this time between Williams' Keke Rosberg and McLaren's John Watson, but the permutations were less clear-cut.

Keke had 42 points and needed only one to put the title beyond dispute if John, with 33, finished second or lower. Didier Pironi had 39, but his accident at Hockenheim in July had hospitalised him and he was out of racing.

The Ulsterman needed to win, with the Finn seventh or lower. That would have put both on 42, but Wattie would have had three wins to Keke's one.

The Constructors' title, meanwhile, was a three-horse race for the first time since 1964. Ferrari had 74 points to McLaren's 63 and Renault's 59.

Renault stitched up the front row courtesy of Alain Prost and Rene Arnoux. Michele Alboreto's Tyrrell 011 was the first non-turbo in third ahead of Eddie Cheever's Ligier Matra.

Riccardo Patrese's Brabham BMW; Keke's atmo Williams; Mario Andretti and Patrick Tambay in their Ferraris; Wattie's McLaren; and Derek Warwick's Toleman completed the top 10. Patrick wouldn't start as he was unwell on raceday.

Alain and Rene battled for the lead until their Michelins started picking up marbles and then both ran into engine trouble. After surviving a hefty brush with Eddie on the opening lap, Michele began closing on the yellow cars.

Meanwhile, Wattie was into a strong comeback drive after falling to 12th initially, catching and passing Nelson's Brabham-BMW on Lap 12, then went by Keke, Mario and Eddie in successive laps to climb to third behind Alain and Michele. When Mario's Ferrari broke its rear suspension on Lap 17, Keke moved into the fifth place he needed.

As Alain's Renault faded, Michele exploited Tyrrell's gamble on soft Goodyear tyres to take the lead on Lap 52. Wattie demoted Alain on 56, Eddie another 10 laps later.

And so Michele went on to score his first Grand Prix victory and Uncle Ken's first since Patrick Depailler in Monaco in 1978. He was the 11th different winner that extraordinary season, and took fastest lap to boot.

Behind Wattie and Eddie, Alain struggled to fourth and Keke led team mate Derek Daly home in fifth and sixth, the Finn becoming the first from his country to be crowned World Champion. Despite their woes, Ferrari took the Constructors' honours.

The victory icing on Tyrrell's cake. During Uncle Ken's joyful post-race leap he waved a blue slip of paper. On Friday he had taken advantage of unwise odds of 20 to 1 on a Tyrrell victory, and having put down $100 he was well rewarded by his driver's performance. The blue paper was his betting slip…

So ended the adventure at Caesars Palace. It marked the first time since the Formula 1 World Championship had been inaugurated in 1950 that any country had staged three races in the same season – and the last until 2023 when, with Austin and Miami's Grands Prix, racing once again returned to Nevada, albeit on a very different track in the very heart of ‘The Entertainment Capital of the World'.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Las Vegas Grand Prix

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Carlos Sainz will start from third place in the Las Vegas Grand Prix after a wet Qualifying session.

Carlos Sainz believes Williams are ""becoming stronger every race"" after taking an impressive third-place in a wet Qualifying for the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

The Spaniard will start on the second row for the 50-lap race having only been beaten by title challengers Lando Norris and Max Verstappen in a treacherous Qualifying session.

It marks Sainz's second best Qualifying performance of the season after he started P2 in Azerbaijan – also on a high-speed, low-downforce circuit – before taking a podium in the race.

""I'm always optimistic – dreaming is for free and I always try and think about myself doing well,"" said Sainz when asked if he expected such pace in the wet, having also avoided a penalty after being investigated for a potential unsafe rejoin in Q1.

""This track maybe suited our car in the dry, and in the wet in FP3 we didn't look very promising but we did a few changes to the car that I think helped in the wet and that allowed me to, from the first lap of Q1, every time I was finishing the lap I was P1.

""On extreme wets I was really quick, on inters I knew maybe the others would catch up a bit, but happy with P3.

Williams has proved to be best of the rest this season behind McLaren, Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes, with Sainz admitting that although they remain underdogs the team has become stronger across the campaign.

""I think the US fans love a bit of an underdog, an underdog fight, and I think they see myself with Williams as an underdog but also as an [upcoming] project,"" added Sainz.

""We are becoming stronger every race, every lap that we do together, and it's great to see them supporting us. I would have loved to give them pole today because that would have been a massive cheer then, but we were just not quite there.""

Team mate Alex Albon was unable to join Sainz in the top-10 after being eliminated in Q1 after hitting the barrier on the exit of Turn 16 and breaking the front-right suspension on his Williams.

""Just a little bit of a snap in the place you don't want to have a snap,"" said Albon.

""It was sketchy out there, sketchy for everyone, a lot of aquaplaning. I'm surprised we were driving in that weather, to be honest.

""It was fun while it lasted and I just got caught out. Nothing really to say. I think my lap was going to be good. I've been quick all weekend, and that's just how it is sometimes.""

Associate Editor


	Outside of her recent pivotal role in the final season of You, plus an upcoming appearance in Scream 7, Anna Camp is taking her onscreen career into her own hands.


	Following the premiere of her dystopian short Neo-Dome at SXSW 2024, the actress told Deadline that the team is “looking for a home” for a series adaptation of the proof-of-concept, for which they're planning to complete the first season themselves.


	“We're actually now deciding to go the independent route and just make eight episodes ourselves, which is really exciting,” she said at Friday's OUT100 celebration. “And we have a whole story and the whole bible all drawn out, and it just got so much buzz because I think the short itself is just so good. I don't know if you've seen it yet, but we're going to try to make it available for people to see it now online, so hopefully more people will get a chance to see it.”

	Camp added, “You have to create your own work, especially in this climate. It's very difficult. There's less jobs and there's more actors fighting for those jobs, so it's hard and it's scary. But if you don't do it, sometimes it's not going to get done. So, that's what we're doing right now. We're doing it ourselves.”


	Written by Matt Pfeffer and directed by Bonnie Discepolo, Neo-Dome is set in the near future, 20 years after the collapse of the American economy and events that spiraled the world into disarray. The short centers on an ensemble of characters venturing towards a distant utopian dome in quest of a new beginning. But as they soon realize, the journey to a better life is never quite as easy as it appears. 


	“We were friends with Anna and she said she wanted to get more into producing,” Pfeffer told Deadline following its SXSW debut. “She loved the script and wanted to play the lead in it, Monica, but also said that we should build this out into something bigger, as a series, so it shifted gears towards more of an episodic piece and we created the pilot.”

	











	Matt and editor brother Mark Pfeffer were previously seeking a studio deal for the pilot, expressing doubt that the season could be completed independently.


	Many filmmakers and showrunners are taking the indie route with their TV projects, with Heebuck creator Michael Polish telling Deadline the new model is “the wave of the future.”

[Editor's note: This story contains spoilers for the end of “Wicked: For Good.”]

As bad as a scene can get in a movie that would work way better if the conflict was worse, the Underground Yellow Brick Road still seems like some ham-fisted symbolism, don't you think? From Universal's “Wicked: For Good,” that ridiculous moment comes midway through the second half of director Jon M. Chu's epic musical blockbuster. It features a crowd of subjugated animals, so oppressed by their human overlords that they have been magically stripped of the ability to speak and forced to flee Oz on foot (or hoof).

 










The group uses a subterranean tunnel that's literally beneath the Yellow Brick Road for the express purpose of evading animal slavery. That adapted American history lesson plays clumsily on the big screen, and even still, “For Good” doesn't feel dramatic or important enough.

In theaters now, Chu's highly anticipated follow-up to last year's “Wicked” meets and at times even exceeds expectations when it comes to providing sparkly spectacle. But the sequel plays like a needlessly drawn-out coda, putting a bloated encore where many “Wicked” fans hoped a real fairy tale with a timely message might be.

 










The creators of “Wicked: For Good” would've done well to budget more of the time and energy they spent on the visual design to get better scripts with real stakes. A couple pick-ups could do the trick, too.

Starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande as vivid portraits of the one-dimensional witches we first met back in 1939's “Wizard of Oz,” the modern “Wicked” duology follows in the imperial footsteps of Star Wars, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and other major sci-fi and fantasy franchises to present an extraordinary world on the brink. Chu's two “Wicked” movies are based on Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman's long-running Broadway musical from 2003, which in turn loosely adapts author Gregory Maguire's bleak 1995 novel, “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.” 

Across page, stage, and screen, each version feels different from the rest. But the story of Elphaba and Glinda soars highest when its teller chooses to focus on the girls' unique friendship — a dynamic that's more sterile but still meaningful in the book. That approach paid off when “Wicked” introduced the beloved characters to the big screen last year, but “For Good” turns the narrative North Star into a tonally frustrating crutch Chu can't seem to shake in the lesser film. 

 










Presenting a menagerie of beaded costumes and belted solos in lieu of any real perspective on political discourse, the “Wicked” sequel appears aimed at giving movie-goers more of the same song-and-dance they loved in the first half. But the result is far less. “For Good” loses the taut playfulness that made the earlier “Wicked” snap by attempting to pit Elphaba and Glinda against an enemy that's often unseen and perpetually nondescript.

Both Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) and the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) leave their scariest moments back in 2024, and even the authoritarian cogs they set in motion then don't make a significant enough impact on the framing of “For Good” to motivate the story that's developing in theaters now.

Frequently compared to dystopian touchstones like Margaret Atwood's “The Handmaid's Tale,” Maguire's painstaking literary text was right there for Chu's inspiration. It's got creepy dolls hiding deep-state surveillance tech; Holocaust-like experiments performed on fluffy victims; the pervasive sense that anything and everything in Oz could be waiting to ensnare Elphaba like its Big Brother in “1984.” 

And yet, “For Good” doggedly shies away from the darkness — something these witches needed if Chu wanted their tortured connection to really sing a second time.

 










In her review, IndieWire's Kate Erbland explained how the year-long intermission between “Wicked” and “For Good” made the second movie not only more disorienting but harder to connect with emotionally. That disconnect might have been alleviated with a stronger first scene.

This alternate beginning doesn't have to be seriously “scary” but it should at least show who in Oz is being hurt by the ruling class and why. Opening on a forgettable brick-laying sequence — in which some horned cow-things, who could talk probably at one point but can't now and are having a bad time working their jobs in construction… or something? — “For Good” needed a harder rock bottom to successfully set up peril and unrest in Emerald City as tangible threats suggesting a hidden dystopia.

From the bloody sewers of “Sweeney Todd” to the storybook pages of “Into the Woods,” the overture has given countless musical filmmakers the ideal chance to show-not-tell audiences about the worlds they're entering from the start. Instead, “For Good” feels like it comes out of nowhere. Chu fails to explain the magic lurking behind those cow-things' eyes, and Elphaba makes an outsized display of riding in on her broom to save them from what looks like basically a crappy workday sans context. 

 










Not knowing what the herd's life was like before they encountered the Wicked Witch or the jerks managing their long haul down the Yellowbrick Road, their gig doesn't look great, but it's not even “Office Space” bad. What's worse, the other Ozians are effectively given a pass for doing nothing in the face of entire of species forced into slavery because the scenario is so weirdly wooden and unclear. 

The central conflict is illuminated only marginally better when Elphaba's sister Nessa (Marissa Bode), now a corrupt governor, passes a law forbidding her Munchkin prisoner, Boq (Ethan Slater), from traveling later in the movie. But even then, “For Good” flinches away from the cruelty at hand — rarely showing Nessa's angry face (was her acting too good?) and exercising more restraint than they need when Boq becomes the Tin Man. That scaredy-cat ethos carries through a number of other scenes: some that do show animals locked in cages but remain ambiguous and inoffensive enough for the idea to miss most children. 

Through that underwhelming haze, the familiar muzzle of Dr. Dillamond (previously voiced by Peter Dinklage) breaks through — just not enough. In the first half of “Wicked,” the former Shiz University professor lost his ability to speak during a horrifying classroom scene that recalls all those nightmarish Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons we saw go wrong in Harry Potter.

 










Dr. Dillamond is even more important in Maguire's book, and his political assassination (yes, that goat gets straight-up murdered, bro!) serves as an important political symbol and driving force behind Elphaba's radicalization. The live musical dropped that bit and Chu was probably right to soften the blow for the movies, too. But if you're going to bother not keeping a recognizable victim around, and routinely use him as a visual reference to explain what Elphaba and Glinda do and don't know about the plot that's unfolding, then he deserves his due. 

“For Good” already has a number of celebratory scenes showing what happens as news of Elphaba's death reverberates throughout Oz. But Chu needed to put a finer point on the societal transformation the Wicked Witch and her best friend gave up their friendship to create. Dr. Dillamond would've been the perfect way to do it, even if Dinklage cost the movie extra. 

For whatever reason, “For Good” seems hell-bent on throwing away many of its best reveals. Most painfully, Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) has his tragic Scarecrow evolution stretched over several scenes, before it concludes  in a romantic beat where body horror doesn't fit. But Dr. Dillamond doesn't even get to finish his arc between “Wicked” and “For Good,” as the duology, seemingly desperate to fill time at every other turn, makes the baffling choice to cast out the academic quadruped-like Animal. 

 










Despite Dinklage warmly promoting his small voice part in Chu's films, the “Wicked” movies ultimately decide Dr. Dillamond works better as a subplot that's seen but not heard in the back half. Amid all  the poppies and propaganda, you get a glimpse of his weary enlightened face. Of course, that could never replace the audible triumph he deserved in a scene that should have just let him speak. 

“Wicked: For Good” is in theaters now.

	Charisma Madarang



	It's fitting that Charli XCX accompanied her post on X about “the realities of being a pop star” with a photo of Lou Reed — the enigmatic frontman of the Velvet Underground. The image is a screenshot of Reed from a 1974 interview where he answers rapid-fire questions as laconically and languidly as possible, much to the chagrin of the rabid journalists huddled around him. As Charli, who once said she wants to make a “Lou Reed record,” might put it, that's art, baby.


	In her new Substack published Friday, Charli begins with a few clarifications. While she writes “being a pop star has its pros and cons like most jobs in this world,” she says, “I don't view what I do as a ‘job' and I secondly don't really view myself as purely a pop star, I'm just using that terminology specifically for this piece of writing.” Instead, she opts to describe herself “more as a ‘creative' (gross) or plain and simply put: an artist.” However, for the purposes of her essay, she focuses “purely on the the realities of being a pop star because it was my original dream, because it's the role in my life I have the most experience navigating and because it's also the most ridiculous one.”

	











	First, she addresses the obvious: being a pop star is “really fucking fun.” Charli proceeds to list off the benefits of the gig: parties in a black SUV and “all that cliche shit”; meeting interesting people and “those interesting people often actually want to meet you”; getting “free shit” such as phones, trips, clothes, and shroom gummies; entering restaurants through the back entrance with your best friends and smiling at the staff (who probably “hate you”); and hearing Addison Rae's “Diet Pepsi” before it's released. She also adds that, yes, “You get to feel special, but you also have to at points feel embarrassed by how stupid the whole thing is.”

	Still, Charli acknowledges the parts that go beyond this and nods toward her fans and how their “dedication to your work makes you feel like they will be there for you until the end of time, even though in reality they won't,” adding that performing on stage can make you “feel like a God.” She says, “You get to make people cry with happiness, you soundtrack their break ups, their recovery, their crazy nights out, their revenge, their love, their lives.”

	The Brat singer then moves on to the time spent “in transit,” likening a pop star's time spent traveling from one matter of business to another as feeling like a commodity inhabiting “strange and soulless liminal spaces.” She offers an example of when Rachel Sennott arrived to shoot a scene in Charli's upcoming mockumentary The Moment “bundled up with blankets and pillows and shipped directly to us like a package.”


	The public's perception of her a pop star has also caused Charli to “think about the person I used to be compared to the person I am now.” Old friends and family members have a way of humbling you, she points out; after asking Yung Lean whether he thought she had changed, he replied via text that while she's still the person he knew when they were younger, the “yes people” around her “blow smoke” up her ass.


	In ending her thoughts on the pop star life, she muses that while there is a “level of expectation for you to be entirely truthful all the time,” all her favorite artists are “absolutely not role models nor would I want them to be, but maybe that's just me.” 


	“I want hedonism, danger and a sense of anti establishment to come along with my artists because when I was younger I wanted to escape through them,” she adds. “To me that's the point, that's the drama, that's the fun, that's the FANTASY.”


	She offers a link to Reeds' interview from the Seventies, before asking and answering: “Is it performance? Is it truth? Is it lies? Who fucking cares? In my opinion it's just funny and cool.”

	When speaking to Vanity Fair about The Moment last month, Charli, once again subverted the line between fact and fiction, said, “It's not a tour documentary or a concert film in any way, but the seed of the idea was conceived from this idea of being pressured to make one.” She added, “It's fiction, but it's the realest depiction of the music industry that I've ever seen.”

Olivia Nuzzi is no stranger to controversy. The ex-New York magazine reporter became notorious in the 2024 scandal over her alleged sexting affair with a presidential candidate she was writing about — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the Secretary of Health. It looked like the end of her journalism career, yet she landed on her feet with her new gig at Vanity Fair and her new memoir American Canto. But now Nuzzi's story is taking an even more bizarre turn, with reports that she once had a secret life — as an aspiring teenage pop star, under the name Livvy. In 2009 when she was 16, she dropped a faux-Britney banger called “Jailbait.” 


	Subtle, it's not. “16 will get you 20,” Livvy sings. “A teenage queen right in front of you/Illegal dream, killer to pursue.” She pants about “craving sin,” over the synth-disco beats, boasting, “Bad things happen when you hear my name/Deny your attraction but I've got no shame.” In the chorus she belts, “Jailbait! You try too stay away, but you can't obey!” 

	











	Yes, the song is ghastly, much worse than you'd expect. Is it real? Too soon to tell. Is this whole story crazy? No doubt. So let's dig into the bizarre mystery of that insanely bad, quite possibly fake Olivia Nuzzi song.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	You have to take Livvy with a grain of salt, since this story is so sketchily sourced, even the New York Post had a spasm of conscience and put “apparently” in the lede. (And this from the paper that just gave us the instant-classic headline “The Red Apple” after Zohran Mamdani's election, with the tag, “On your Marx, get set, Zo!”) Nuzzi made a strangely equivocal statement to the Post, with her spokesperson saying, “This was a satirical prank from when Olivia was a child actor and was never meant to be taken seriously.”

	











	On her supposed MySpace profile, from 2009, she's glammed up in the style of an American Apparel ad: purple headband, black bracelets, tank dress, thigh-high boots. Another photo shows her in a white lace chemise over a black bra and leather pants, with a pair of handcuffs dangling from her wrist. She describes herself as “a visual, conceptual artist with an addiction to pop music.”

	Any trace of Livvy has been wiped from the internet — the only digital footprint is an item in the music blog PopJustice, from February 2010. “‘Jailbait' is about the role of the underaged, hyper-sexualized girl in society,” Livvy explains. “That girl who takes half naked photos of herself in the mirror with her camera phone. It's about pornographic ideals infiltrating our collective consciousness — this obsession with youth and beauty. I'm not saying that any of this is wrong, I'm simply stating that it is. This song is me coming to a societal realization.”


	The MySpace page is a hell of an artistic manifesto, explaining the whole Livvy concept. “Creating a multi-media character for herself, Livvy has dreamed up ‘Emockative: the Life of a Pop Object,' a short film series shot on the streets of downtown New York City.” She portrays “the life of a loyal disciple of pop culture who has given up conventional life and engulfed herself in a world made of plastic.”


	There's excellent reason to have doubts about how real this is. The recording doesn't exactly scream “2009” at you (no AutoTune!) and it sounds like a post-collegiate adult singing. The Livvy photos look more like a Real Housewife than a ninth-grader. Listen to a song made by an actual teenager in that era, like Rebecca Black's “Friday,” and it sounds out of time. 


	Nobody can say for sure how authentic this is, since it's incredibly easy to make up a hoax like this. You could invent the Livvy character in a coffee break, with an AI track and faked screen shots from a conveniently deleted MySpace. (No Livvy Twitter — in 2009? Dubious.) In a blindfold test, you'd have to admit, you would not guess “Jailbait” was by an authentic teenager. You'd figure it was a comedy-minded adult trying to do a ham-fisted sketch about sexed-up teen-pop stars. I mean, this was almost a decade after Andy Dick was on MTV with his brilliant Britney/Xtina parody character Daphne Aguilera. “Jailbait” sounds exactly like Daphne's TRL anthem, “Naughty Baby Did a No-No.”

	“Jailbait” is purportedly from late 2009 or early 2010, taking a ride on a disco stick, heavily influenced by Lady Gaga (the year's big breakout artist, with hits like “Poker Face” and “LoveGame”) and Britney (in her Circus era, with “Womanizer,” “3,” and “If U Seek Amy”). PopJustice quips that she “makes Ke$ha sound sentient. If this were a NYC wanna-be club kid making her own single at the end of the 2000s, you might expect to hear the influence of LaRoux (“Bulletproof”) or the Ting Tings (“That's Not My Name”) or the Knife (“Heartbeat”), the music playing in the parties she was fantasizing about getting into, though there's no trace on “Jailbait.” The music sounds like a terrible Brooklyn electro indie-sleaze band opening for Crystal Castles or Yachts at Studio B, then rushing home to make sure the Tivo caught Gossip Girl.


	The PopJustice piece doesn't interview Livvy, and makes no claim to verify her identity. It just quotes the email she sent them. “‘Offensive,' ‘vapid,' ‘frothy,' ‘bubblegum,' ‘outrageous,' ‘morally bankrupt' and ‘undeniably infectious',” she wrote. “These are just some of the words that have been used to describe ‘Jailbait,' and the not-yet-legal mind behind it, sixteen year old singer/songwriter, Livvy.”


	 “Jailbait” seems to prophesize her future persona, which has been well-documented in the gossip columns. Nuzzi was profiling Kennedy for New York when their alleged sextingship began, during his ridiculous presidential campaign, which led to his current gig as Secretary of Health, at which he sucks. She was 31, he was 71 and married to Cheryl Hines (yes, Larry David's ex). Kennedy denied the whole thing, but Hines has a new memoir discussing the scandal. Meanwhile, Nuzzi has her own memoir American Canto, with her poetic musings on their bad romance. “He desired,” she writes. “He desired desiring. He desired being desired. He desired desire itself.” Oh, it goes on. 


	“Jailbait” also seems to prefigure her alleged relationships with TV journalist Keith Olbermann, who met her in her teens and put her through college, and disgraced South Carolina governor Mark Sanford, most famous for disappearing on the job and showing up a week later in Buenos Aires with his side squeeze. “Jailbait” seems to foreshadow the gossip when Livvy sings, “Bad things happen to those who prey/A basic instinct to die another day/16 will get you 20, lust criminally/Irresistible, that's whey they call me…jailbait!”

	











	On her MySpace page, she compares herself to legends from all over pop history. “The day that Madonna released ‘Erotica.' The day that Andy Warhol made his first film. The day that Freddie Mercury sang his last note. The day that Judy Garland conceived Liza Minnelli. The day that Britney Spears told you to hit it one more time. The day that Cher first met a sequin. The day that Candy Darling took her last breath. The day that Mick Jagger first strut across a stage. The day that Pamela Anderson was introduced to silicone. The day that David Bowie sang ‘Lady Stardust.' The day that Michael Jackson first slipped on a white glove… was the day that Livvy was born.”


	So who is she? “Livvy is a sixteen year old singer, songwriter and actress. A former Wilhelmina model, she has appeared in various commercials, films, television programs and print ads since her start in the business at the age of five. Influenced by pop stars, rock stars, rap stars, movie stars and tabloid stars – Livvy is prepared to explode onto the music scene and dominate the pop world.”

Manifest expansionist ambitions of the three most powerful countries in the world — China, the United States, and Russia — are undermining the current world order.

Since its founding, the People's Republic has expressed interest in Taiwan; Beijing may now be on the verge of attempting to conquer the island. In 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to incorporate Canada and Greenland into the United States.

The most consequential development that has led to the erosion of the post-war order over the past eleven years, however, has been Russia — like China and the U.S. — a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a nuclear-weapon state under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

Since 2014, Moscow has been engaged in demonstrative land grabbing and, since 2022, a full-scale expansionist invasion with signs of genocide on the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine.

As a Soviet republic, Ukraine was a founding member of the UN in 1945. Kyiv has been an official non-nuclear-weapon state under the NPT since 1996, when it gave up its chunk of the Soviet nuclear arsenal to the state it is now defending against.

Relatively weaker countries are learning from Ukraine's experience that one cannot rely on international law, organizations, and solidarity. One should not make the mistake, as Kyiv did, of trusting in ""security assurances"" or ""guarantees,"" ""friendship treaties,"" ""strategic partnerships,"" and the like — even if they are provided by the world's most powerful states.

Such agreements are of little significance, as demonstrated by the irrelevance of Ukraine's respective agreements with Russia (1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, 1997 Friendship Treaty), China (2013 Friendship Treaty), and the United States (2008 Strategic Partnership).

The standard solution to the security dilemma of smaller powers is to join defense alliances, ideally ones that include at least one nuclear-weapon state. But as Tbilisi and Kyiv, among others, have learned the hard way, gaining full membership in a powerful defense alliance is neither easy nor risk-free.

In response to Georgia and Ukraine's applications for NATO membership in April 2008, the alliance told them that they ""will become members."" Instead, Georgia has been dismembered by Russia since 2008 and Ukraine since February 2014.

(Although one should also mention that Moldova, a post-Soviet republic with no ambitions to join NATO, has seen parts of its territory occupied by Russia for more than 30 years, too. In contrast, when Finland, which has a long border with Russia, applied for NATO membership in 2022, Moscow did not invade it, but instead withdrew troops from the Finnish-Russian border. A former Russian colony's wish for NATO membership is thus neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a dismemberment by Russia.)

Today's transformation of the world order may seem unproblematic from the perspective of Beijing, Washington, and Moscow. However, it is likely to cause concern among non-nuclear-weapon states with little international integration.

Countries that have potentially revisionist neighbors and operate outside NATO or other relevant defense alliances must now rethink their national security strategies. The leaders of China, the U.S., and Russia can ignore, dismiss, or take seriously the new fears of third countries in reaction to their expansionist ambitions. If they do not act to counteract such worries, a backlash is only a matter of time.

One reaction of relatively weaker countries to the possible end of the postwar rules-based order could be to acquire weapons of mass destruction for deterrence and defense purposes. Such decisions by some states could, in turn, trigger similar steps by their neighbors, who distrust the exclusively defensive motives behind an accumulation of weapons of mass destruction on their borders.

This could trigger regional arms races and a domino-like proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The influx of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons into state arsenals, in turn, increases the likelihood that such weapons will also fall into the hands of non-state actors.

The seriousness of such a subversion of future international security should not lead to its dismissal as an unlikely doomsday scenario. Russia's expansionism since 2014 and the recent escalation in the foreign rhetoric of China and the United States represent a turning point in world politics.

For observers from countries that possess weapons of mass destruction and/or are full members of alliances possessing such weapons, these may be regrettable but secondary phenomena.

For states that have neither, Russia's expansion and genocide on the territory of Ukraine, as well as the ambivalent response of other major powers to Moscow's escalation, cannot simply be ignored.

If Russia were to achieve a military victory or impose an unjust Siegfrieden (victorious peace) on Ukraine, the concerns of other non-nuclear-weapon states outside powerful defense alliances will increase further.

            Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former President John F. Kennedy, revealed on Saturday she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, with a doctor telling her she has less than a year to live.
    


            In an essay in The New Yorker, the 35-year-old wrote that she was diagnosed last year with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation known as Inversion 3, a genetic anomaly found in less than 2% of AML cases.
    


            Doctors discovered the cancer shortly after Schlossberg gave birth to her daughter in May 2024.
    


            “I did not — could not — believe that they were talking about me,” Schlossberg wrote. “I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.”
    


            In the essay, Schlossberg documents the grueling treatment process, which included several rounds of chemotherapy, two bone-marrow transplants and participation in two clinical trials. Schlossberg said she was also diagnosed with a form of Epstein-Barr virus in September, which “blasted my kidneys,” and had to learn to walk again.
    


            “During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,” she wrote.
    


            Schlossberg, an environmental journalist, is the second daughter of former US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and designer Edwin Schlossberg. Tatiana Schlossberg and her husband, George Moran, have a 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter.
    


            Schlossberg said her siblings — Rose, a filmmaker, and Jack, who earlier this month announced a run for Congress — have been helping raise her children and “have held my hand unflinchingly while I have suffered, trying not to show their pain and sadness in order to protect me from it.”
    


            Schlossberg described going through treatment as her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was confirmed as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after “running for President as an Independent, but mostly as an embarrassment to me and the rest of my immediate family.”
    


            She said the doctors at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, where she was treated, didn't know whether they would be affected after the Trump administration stripped Columbia University of federal funding. “Suddenly, the health-care system on which I relied felt strained, shaky,” Schlossberg wrote. The university later agreed a deal with the Trump administration to restore the funding.
    


            Schlossberg said she regrets adding to her family's history of tragedy, which includes John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963 and the assassination of her great-uncle, former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, in 1968.
    


            “For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,” she writes. “Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.”

            The world struck a new climate deal at the COP30 summit in Brazil Saturday, which calls for a tripling of funding to help countries adapt to increasingly severe climate impacts. But countries failed to agree to a roadmap away from fossil fuels, after entrenched divisions threatened to collapse the talks.
    


            The agreement came after more than two weeks of increasingly fraught negotiations between representatives of more than 190 countries in the port city of Belém, known as the gateway to the Amazon. Disagreements reached such fever pitch there were fears the summit would collapse with no deal. Talks stretched overtime as dozens of nations pushed back against an outcome that didn't explicitly mention a transition away from oil, coal and gas — the drivers of the climate crisis.
    


            But just after midday local time Saturday, the COP30 president André Corrêa do Lago gaveled through a deal.
    


            The final text contained no mention of fossil fuels, signaling a retreat from consensus agreements only two years old. It included only a general agreement on deforestation, rather than more explicit commitments, which had been another key issue in the negotiations.
    


            More than 80 countries, including Colombia, the UK and France, supported the concept of a “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, building on a commitment made at COP28 in Dubai in 2023. However, intense opposition from petrostates — including Saudi Arabia and Russia — and other heavy fossil fuels users prevented consensus.
    


            As part of reaching the deal, Corrêa do Lago instead said the COP presidency in Brazil would produce side texts detailing a global roadmap for moving away from fossil fuels and addressing deforestation that not all countries signed off on.
    


            This unorthodox move was intended to demonstrate that all countries' issues were heard at the summit, and allow COP to potentially build off the language in future negotiations.
    


            After the agreement was gaveled through, multiple developing countries spoke out against it, including Colombia, which formally objected to the lack of inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels.
    


            There was some progress at COP30. Wealthier countries agreed to work toward tripling the money available to help climate-vulnerable countries adapt to the ravages of global warming — a potential goal of $120 billion a year by 2035, to come out of the $300 billion pot of funding they agreed to at last year's COP.
    


            The summit deal also included an agreement to a plan for a “just transition” — the idea that as the world moves away from fossil fuels, workers in these industries must not be left behind but instead are helped into cleaner jobs. However, this included no specific funding.
    


            There was also disappointment from some that more was not done to strengthen countries' national climate plans, which set out how much climate pollution they'll cut over the next decade.
    


            An analysis of these plans by the UN found that collectively they would only achieve around a 12% reduction in planet-heating pollution, far below the 60% needed for any chance of keeping alive the internationally agreed target to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
    


            This is “the first COP at which the prospect of surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming has now become acknowledged,” said Joeri Rogelj, director of research at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London.
    


            The reaction from global climate experts to the final agreement was mixed.
    


            This summit was in many ways seen as a test of multilateralism, especially as the US was absent from the process, with the Trump administration declining to send a delegation. For some experts, the fact an agreement was reached at all shows global climate diplomacy is still alive.
    


            A decade after the landmark Paris agreement, the Brazil summit proved the process “is working,” said former German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan.
    


            “While far from what's needed, the outcome in Belém is meaningful progress,” Morgan said in a statement. “Despite the efforts of major oil producing states to slow down the green transition, multilateralism continues to support the interests of the whole world in tackling the climate crisis.”
    


            Sierra Leone's minister of environment and climate change Jiwoh Abdulai said this year's summit had “moved the needle” in terms of richer, developed nations accepting more financial responsibility to help the rest of the world adapt to climate change.
    


            But where some saw cautious forward progress, others identified a much darker trend. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, Panama's special representative for climate change. “A ‘Forest COP' with no commitment on forests is a very bad joke. A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels' is not neutrality, it is complicity. And what is happening here transcends incompetence.”
    


            Harjeet Singh, COP veteran and founding director of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, agreed. “The hypocrisy of the Global North has been laid bare,” he said. “They offer us endless new ‘dialogues' that cannot pay for adaptation or rebuild homes destroyed by climate disasters.”

There's too much news. We help you understand what you really need to know. Vox delivers the depth, context, and clarity you need to understand what's happening and why it matters.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

Seven questions about that unusual Mamdani-Trump meeting, answered.

In a triumphant election-night speech earlier this month, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani addressed Donald Trump directly, telling the president to “Turn the volume up.” Trump has repeatedly called Mamdani a “Communist” and questioned his citizenship status.

But when the two met in the Oval Office on Friday, it was all strikingly cordial — almost affectionate. “Hopefully, you'll have a really great mayor,” Trump told reporters. “The better he does, the happier I am.”

To break down what happened in their meeting, why it wasn't entirely surprising, and what it could mean for New York City and the GOP, I turned to my colleague Astead Herndon, who has covered Trump and recently wrote a definitive profile of Mamdani. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.

So Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani had this strikingly friendly appearance in the Oval. What happened? Is this a big deal?

I certainly think it's a big deal. It reflects the intention that Mamdani approached his entire campaign with, and particularly the general election — his consistent ability to turn skeptics into supporters. That was consistently happening in such a way that it was built into his strategy, and I think we saw that on the biggest stage yesterday.

In some ways it reflects a lot of the meetings that he's had already, but in some ways it's so much more extraordinary considering what Trump has said, and considering the way Trump was really coming to him. Trump's the one throwing up the thumbs-up in the photos, not Mamdani. And I think that is reflective of an approach where Mamdani and his team come to these [meetings] and try to focus on areas of agreement and shared values. They identified affordability as one that they think Donald Trump shared and so they came with that intention in mind. That's the same strategy they've used for meetings of all sorts.

He has this playbook that's worked really well. He's won over a lot of folks in New York City politics, in business. Even given that, were you surprised at how well Friday went? 

I thought that Trump would like him, but I didn't know that Trump would shower praise on him. I didn't think that Trump would look at him kind of like an uncle and nephew. He's smiling in ways I haven't seen him smile even with political allies.

I do think that it reflects two politicians whose visions overlap. These are people who have both overcome political establishments and who both engage in a kind of movement-based politics, not relying on transactional old-guard endorsement machines. I do think there is a kind of New York, Queens respect for one another, and the ladder that Mamdani had to climb to become mayor. These are also two people who see politics as a collective action rather than an individual game, and that's not true of everybody.

When I was at a Mamdani rally and the crowd can do call-and-response to his to his top policies — freeze the rent, make buses fast and free, make child care free — the only other time I've heard that, where people are able to call back the signature policy, is with “build the wall.” So it's not just showmanship, it's showmanship plus a value that people trust and engaging with it beyond the traditional political structures.

Trump entered the political scene as this New York guy, and that has faded a little bit over time. He's moved to Florida, he's down at Mar-a-Lago all the time. But he's still kind of charmed by getting back to his Queens roots, right?

I think he cares deeply about New York. The traditional Republican playbook is to let cities fail, or to even revel in some cities' failure, as they've done with Chicago. I don't think Trump feels the same way about New York because he's invested his life in the place, and so I believe him when he says he wants the city to thrive.

Donald Trump felt so rejected by certain classes of New York, by certain kinds of ways that elite New York Democratic liberalism had shut him out. But those same structures have shut out Zohran Mamdani too. There's an element of Queens outsider in this that does bond them.

Trump, in his early days in New York City, was very flexible about working with and donating to Democrats and Republicans. He was very practical, coming up as a builder in the New York political scene.

I think that that is required, and that practicality is reflected in Mamdani. When people were seeing him as ideologically rigid because of things like DSA and his political history, one thing that was very clear to me during that campaign was he was not seeing being mayor the same way he was seeing his job as a member of the New York State Assembly.

He understood that it is a role where he would have to compromise, he would have to put DSA at a distance, he would have to excite his base. I think there was a recognition that there would need to be flexibility. These are all of the same things Donald Trump rises in and that jack-of-all-trades, “be who you need to be” kind of mindset.

Why did this meeting happen in the first place, after the very contentious back and forth Trump and Mamdani had during the campaign?

Mamdani's team reached out, and I think there was a real sense that it was in the city's interest not to provoke Donald Trump, considering all of the rhetoric going back and forth that Trump could impose a disaster on New York, even as soon as Inauguration Day.

Mamdani's election-night speech was directed at Trump in their moment of triumph, but it did not seem to me as if they would take a fully oppositional tone, at least from the start. It seems to me to be in line with the strategy they've taken with opponents of all sorts — a willingness to engage, given an initial belief of good faith. I don't think that that's where all Democrats have been, but I do think it's a quality that is sort of baseline if you want to be successful, particularly in the role of mayor.

Do you think there is anything here resembling a playbook for other Democrats or other mayors? 

I don't think it's different from the lesson that Mamdani has already shown. Donald Trump has always rewarded someone who engaged with him directly about their beliefs and came from that place. I think that was true in Nancy Pelosi, just as true as it is in Zohran.

But there are a lot of other factors happening here that matter. I think the New Yorkness matters. I think Mamdani as a communicator and his comfort in those spaces matters. Just coming from a place of values allows you to move on a podcast easier, move in the Oval Office easier, move an opponent or allies. That comfort is coming from the fact that Mamdani knows he's not trying to triangulate. That's not where Democrats have always been.

Where do you think the Mamdani-Trump relationship goes from here?

There are Republicans who are trying to run the straight jihadist fear-mongering playbook. Things can change. They might be back to calling him Mamdani the Commie by next week, and I think we kind of can expect that. But I think these images were so searing that it's going to be hard.

They're not only searing, they follow a pattern, which is that when people have engaged with Mamdani, he has not matched the radical that Republicans and some Democrats were trying to paint him as. That's the reason he was successful in the mayoral race, and it's a reason why the Republican boogeyman strategy was always threatening to be exposed. In this moment, I think Trump actually has exposed it.
