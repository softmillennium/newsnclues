Center back Cameron Carter-Vickers will miss the rest of Celtic's season with a long-term achilles injury, likely dashing any possible hopes of making the U.S. men's national team's roster for next summer's World Cup on home soil. Carter-Vickers sustained the achilles injury during Celtic's 2-1 win over Sturm Graz in the UEFA Europa League last month, an injury that was expected to keep him out until March. Celtic interim manager Martin O'Neill, though, confirmed on Friday that the 27-year-old will not play again this season. "We will not see him," O'Neill said before Saturday's match at St. Mirren. "I think it might be April before he's even on grass. Funnily enough, I did ask him yesterday, did he think he would be ready for the World Cup? Though he has not been a fixture of the team since Mauricio Pochettino became the head coach in late 2024, there was a real opportunity for Carter-Vickers to make a case for himself -- Pochettino has recently begun to deploy a back three, a formation change that paved the way for their year-ending five game unbeaten run. Carter-Vickers was very recently on Pochettino's radar, too, joining the group for October's friendlies against Ecuador and Australia. He did not play in either match, though, and his only minutes under Pochettino came in March's 2-1 defeat to Canada in the Concacaf Nations League third place match, during which he played 90 minutes. The center back was a member of the USMNT's 2022 World Cup squad, playing 90 minutes in the national team's group stage finale against Iran, which was a 1-0 victory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The report comes from the Daily Mail and fits perfectly with what's happening now: Brighton is tracking the 21-year-old forward and already open to making a move, while Leeds and Sunderland also evaluated him during the most recent transfer window. Gonzalo became a global talking point when Xabi Alonso decided to bet on him in the Club World Cup. Meanwhile, Mbappé only became a starter in the semifinal, which happened to be the game where Real Madrid was crushed 4–0 by PSG. The problem is that his international spotlight didn't translate into space once the regular season got going. With Mbappé fully fit, Gonzalo lost his spot completely in the forward hierarchy. The rest has been short cameos late in games, something that wears down any young player who needs real minutes to grow. This is where the Premier League comes into play, with English clubs targeting a young forward who isn't getting opportunities at a European giant. With Gonzalo, the equation is ideal: proven talent, young age, resale potential and no clear short-term path at Real Madrid. Brighton, now known for identifying promising players and developing them at a high level, is following the situation closely. The club believes it can offer what the forward doesn't have in Madrid right now: consistent minutes, a real role and a less rigid environment to evolve. Leeds and Sunderland, mentioned in the last window, show that the interest isn't new, but the feeling is that Brighton fits his profile better at this moment. And if the market has taught anything, it's that minutes matter more than a badge. If nothing changes in how he's used, the trend points to another Valdebebas talent finding his peak somewhere far from Madrid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool's nightmare defence of their Premier League title took a turn for the worse on Saturday as Nottingham Forest ripped the Reds apart at Anfield. In a game that saw more than one moment of VAR controversy, Forest struck three times, courtesy of efforts from Murillo, Nicolo Savona and Morgan Gibbs-White, to leave a shellshocked Arne Slot potentially fearing for his job. After Alexis Mac Allister and Milos Kerkez probably both should've scored, disaster struck for the hosts as Murillo slotted home after Liverpool failed to clear from a corner. Moments later it could've easily been two - Igor Jesus somewhat harshly being adjudged to have handled the ball after controlling Ibrahima Konate's hopeless attempt to clear, with referee Andy Madley blowing to penalise the Forest forward and chalk off his goal. It would get worse before the end too, with Gibbs-White making it 3-0 after 78 minutes to stun Anfield into silence and leave Slot wondering what on earth he needs do to get the Reds back on track. His first outing since September and could do nothing to stop any of the goals. Stationed at right-back but drifted inside and further forward to create the extra man. Should've got a lot tighter to Murillo for the first Forest goal. VAR saved him after he was caught out by Igor Jesus for the controversial handball incident. Sacrificed soon after half-time when Liverpool fell two behind. On his heels as the ball flew past him from Anderson's corner, leading to Murillo's opening goal. A visiting side shouldn't be scoring three at Anfield on his watch. Should've done far better with a huge first-half chance perfectly set-up for him by Salah. Heart-in-mouth moment when the studs in his right boot somewhat inadvertently made contact with Ibrahim Sangare's calf but VAR chose not to get involved. Thought he'd scored in the first half only for Elliot Anderson's head to deny him a certain goal. Was weak in the challenge as Williams somehow escaped him to create Forest's second. Flashes of brilliance at times, including the mazy run that set-up the Kerkez chance but had very few opportunities to cut in and shoot on that lethal left foot as Forest defenders gobbled him up. Still without a Premier League goal for Liverpool and he wasn't even close to breaking his duck here, with Slot deciding enough was enough after 68 minutes. Fell asleep as Savona ran off him to score the visitors' second. On for Kerkez with a little over 20 minutes left and couldn't get anywhere near Omari Hutchinson as he cut inside and shot to force the third goal. Dropping Isak wouldn't be the worst place to start...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City have been fined £3 million by the Premier League over the last two seasons for delaying kick-offs to 30 matches after half-time. The Telegraph has reported that 22 of City's 38 Premier League games in 2023-24 were delayed City, with eight of their matches in 2024-25 falling foul of the league's guidelines on half-time breaks. Guardiola, however, was unapologetic about the delays and said that musicians performing at matches such as the Champions League should be fined when causing a delay to kick off, as happened when Burna Boy appeared before City met Inter in the 2023 final in Istanbul. He also said that the Premier League's rules on press conferences led to him holding his latest briefing ahead of the next match against Newcastle on Friday at 9am. Guardiola told a press conference: "We paid a lot of money as I'm late at half-time, but when we played in the Champions League final they had a show before the game and they are always late. That is why I decided 9am and the journalists have had their breakfast and will need to take a coffee. We are training later and if we train at 12 until 1.30, I cannot be here [at the press conference] in time. The Premier League don't allow me at 2pm. The club said if I don't start by 2pm they will fine me or fine the club." Guardiola extended his congratulations to Erling Haaland after Norway secured qualification for the 2026 World Cup, their first time reaching the tournament since 1998. As a football player, world-class player, he deserves to play a World Cup and live the experience. Haaland scored his 99th Premier League goal in City's last game against Liverpool and he can hit his century of goals in England's top flight against Newcastle on Saturday at St James' Park. Haaland is being tipped to go on and beat Magpies' legend Alan Shearer as the league's all-time top scorer if he sees out his 10-year contract with City. Guardiola - who declared his admiration for Shearer's goal tally for Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle - believes he has a good chance of toppling the former England striker. He said: "His [Shearer's] quality to score goals in big teams. The guys who have been making numbers for a long time, not just one or two seasons, I always admire them because it means resilience and being there every season. "They don't score goals for one season. They do it over a lot of seasons and that means being incredibly focused, professional and you have to love the game.</p>

For some, it's not being at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which is taking place right next door at MetLife Stadium this summer. Which is why hundreds of people are expected at the shopping center bright and early the Friday after Thanksgiving — where two tickets to the world's biggest sporting event will be up for grabs at New Jersey's biggest mall. As part of American Dream's “Black Friday Dream Grab” event, 100 soccer fans will have a chance to win two tickets to a FIFA World Cup group stage game at MetLife Stadium — an estimated $3,000 value. The tickets will be available in the mall's “Human Crane” game, in which people are strapped into a harness and lowered into a pit of prizes to grab. Yep, like a classic boardwalk crane game. To enter, contestants must check in starting at 5 a.m. outside the JD Sports store in American Dream. The first 100 people will be taken to the “Human Crane” for a chance at the tickets, with other prizes available including tickets to a New York Yankee game, a New York Red Bulls game, the Radio City Christmas Spectacular and more. The next 150 fans will play the “Spin-to-Win” game with a slew of gift cards available as prizes — but no soccer tickets. The 2026 FIFA World Cup takes place this summer across North America. MetLife Stadium will host eight games, including the final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Celebrations to McLean's jaw-dropping goal picked up by seismic activity monitors at Glasgow Geothermal Observatory According to the British Geological Survey (BGS), when Kenny McLean scored from the halfway line to seal a breathtaking 4-2 win over Denmark, which are ranked 18 places higher in the world than Scotland, the reaction at Hampden Park was equivalent to a very small earthquake. A reading taken between 21:48 and 21:50 – when McLean's audacious shot hit the net, shortly followed by the final whistle – was measured as a surge of between -1 and zero on the Richter scale and produced the equivalent of 200kW, enough to power between 25 and 40 car batteries. Kieran Tierney's strike in stoppage time, which gave Scotland a 3-2 lead, also produced a reading, although not as strong as McLean's. “Every year, as many as 300 naturally occurring earthquakes are detected in the UK, but only around 30 are of a high enough magnitude to be felt by people,” a spokesperson for the BGS said, adding that induced seismic events, such as those caused by human activity such as sonic booms, are also recorded. Most earthquakes in the UK are very small and cause no damage. A 3.3 magnitude earthquake could be felt in homes across Perthshire last month. Stadium events have set seismographs twitching in Scotland before, but none more so than Oasis. The band's 2009 Murrayfield gig produced the strongest tremors in two decades of monitoring, outshaking even Taylor Swift's Edinburgh concerts last year and Harry Styles's in 2023. The official attendance was 49,587 as Scotland finished top of group C and booked their spot at the 2026 World Cup alongside England.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two years later, an England side starring Phil Foden, Morgan Gibbs-White and Marc Guehi cruised to the title of world champions. There is even more reason to pay attention to this year's edition, being played in the Gulf state of Qatar, given that it is the first of FIFA's 48-team international tournaments, before the senior men's World Cup having that many sides in Canada, Mexico and the United States next year. In little over two weeks of action, we have already seen 96 games played — 50 per cent more than we usually see in an entire tournament — and the 300-goal barrier was broken before the quarter-final stage. Five teams have made their Under-17 World Cup debuts — from El Salvador to Fiji, the Republic of Ireland to Zambia and Uganda — while Morocco, one of the eight sides still standing, have lost a game by six goals and won another by 16. It all leaves quite the job for world football governing body FIFA's Technical Study Group (TSG), a team of eight performance analysts and ex-professional players who are on hand to observe and digest each and every game. But when team leader Pascal Zuberbuhler, study group member Louis Carey and analyst Arron Ackerman sat down with The Athletic, there was little sense of football fatigue. “There have been so many outstanding sides; Senegal have tried to build up really well, some of the South American nations… wow, they play the random moments and fast breaks so well. The way they take the ball, body positioning and decision-making, when to move out of space or play an ‘up, set and through' — even Uzbekistan, there are probably a couple of sides from each confederation who have tried to play the right way.” “We have Arron, whose team have built our own data source in-house here at FIFA,” says Zuberbuhler, a former goalkeeper who played 51 times for Switzerland and made more than 400 first-team club appearances during a 19-year senior career. The Athletic has reported on the changing landscape of top-flight European football over the past five seasons, with data from SkillCorner, illustrated below, suggesting that players are covering more ground and at higher speeds to implement more aggressive, man-to-man pressing schemes. It seems to be no different in the age-group game, where FIFA's research suggests that not only has the number of sprints completed by under-17 players increased from their previous World Cup two years ago but that these rates are fast approaching those observed in the under-20s version this September and October. “There is a growing trend that these players are fitter than they have ever been,” says Ackerman. The ability to do things at speed is also there. The speed at which some teams press is phenomenal. We've witnessed some sides being able to press at 10 metres per second — 100-metre sprinting speed. As we can see from the data below, compiled by FIFA, teams are showing a wide range of pressing identities. The three remaining tournament favourites, Brazil, Portugal and Italy, all defend high, with close to one in three of their pressures arriving in the attacking third. Senegal were extremely effective in their high-press, while Ivory Coast complete an eclectic, cross-confederational group of teams looking to use their physicality and athletic conditioning to cause opponents problems up the pitch. As professionalism sweeps through the under-17 game, expect this significant global diversity of off-ball tactics to increase, and players to appear fitter, faster and stronger as they make their first steps into senior football. Another notable spillover from the evolution of the senior game surrounds set pieces, with many of the tournament's 48 sides looking to squeeze every last drop of attacking potential from throw-ins and dead-ball crossing opportunities. “Many teams appear to have worked on these attacking throw-ins in preparation for this tournament, and the distances we are seeing the ball being thrown are quite incredible for such young players,” writes former Netherlands international Aron Winter on FIFA's Training Centre website. “Generating this distance clearly shows these players have worked on their technique and body strength to be able to propel the ball so far.” “There's been such a variety in techniques,” says Carey. “Some have been flat and with pace, others have looked to loop it into the box and play off the second phases, while teams like Switzerland and Austria have looked to play it into a striker's feet. They haven't got the size (to be more direct), but they work to separate the defence and have wingers run off them.” Incredibly, teams at this tournament are so far scoring an average of 0.93 goals per 100 throw-ins, a rate over three times greater than that of the 20 Premier League sides so far this season. As Carey alluded to at the start of our conversation, a wide variety of teams at the Under-17 World Cup have looked to embrace an intricate, positional game, with a surprising number of highly technical players leaving their mark throughout the tournament. Looking at goal kicks, for example, around 22 per cent have been taken by outfield players, compared to around seven per cent in the previous edition two years ago — another trend that has taken hold across senior European football in recent seasons. “There are teams who clearly know that their goalkeeper is able to play; pick out a striker in behind, play it to feet,” says Zuberbuhler. “Their way of building would be a sort of 4-3-3, with high and wide wingers,” says Carey, “with the aim to get people like Cavan Sullivan on the ball as quickly as possible. Ackerman is also eager to add his thoughts: “Even though they went out, it took a good (90th-minute) goal from Morocco to take the U.S. into a penalty shootout, where anything is possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the match features USWNT stars such as Rose Lavelle and Trinity Rodman, both Schupansky and Abiodun have been key contributors, helping each squad get to the League Final. Schupansky, who attended and starred at North Allegheny High School, has made 23 appearances, with 16 starts, as she's scored one goal along with five assists in her rookie campaign, after being drafted last Winter by Gotham. Playing at this level has also elevated Schupansky into the USWNT player pool, as she's been called up to the US U-23 squad multiple times this year. Sarah Schupansky scores first pro goal in Gotham FC's rout of Washington Nigerian international, Abiodun, also a midfielder, has been well-traveled this season, signed a three-year contract with the Spirit to end her collegiate career  Pitt, immediately sent on loan to USL Super League side Dallas Trinity FC. In July, she was celebrating Nigeria's triumph at the Women's Africa Cup of Nations and making her mark on loan. Her first start came against Seattle Reign on September 7, and within 90 minutes — had an impact. Altogether, Abiodun has played eight matches with the Spirit, amassing 581 minutes and one assist. “Pitt's helped me in ways I could not imagine because you know, in college it was quite fast, a different pace,” Abiodun told Equalizer Soccer this week. Krysinsky also served as the Head Men's Soccer Coach at his alma mater, Point Park University, where he led the Pioneers to the first-ever winning seasons and playoff berths (1996-98); head coach of North Catholic boys (2007-08), associate head coach of Shady Side Academy boys (2009-2014).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eight U.S. men's national team players enter the spotlight this weekend as the MLS Cup playoff conference semifinals take place. While superstars like Lionel Messi, Thomas Müller, and Son Heung-min headline the weekend, key USMNT contributors rejoin their teams on the road to MLS Cup in December. Names that have stood out on the international stage like Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten might be out of the postseason, but there are still players looking to fight for a 2026 World Cup roster spot and the ultimate North American prize. Sports Illustrated takes you through the USMNT players to watch in MLS postseason action. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. Sebastian Berhalter is coming off a performance that may have carved him out a spot on the 2026 World Cup roster. After a brilliant set-piece goal and assist in the 5–1 win over Uruguay to end 2025, Berhalter heads into the Western Conference semifinal against Son's LAFC with plenty of confidence. Whitecaps leading scorer Brian White and MLS Defender of the Year Tristan Blackmon are both set to return from injury. Berhalter could link up with Müller in midfield, who he has formed a tight-knit friendship with since August. “I think honestly we both have ... a very competitive spirit,” Berhalter told MLS. “We just kind of get each other going, and it's fun. Someone like that, coming in and wanting to win everything in training and wanting to be the best, it sets the tone for everyone around you. It's awesome having him in the locker room.” He played 75 minutes and created two chances in a box-to-box role. 5 seed NYCFC a legitimate chance to upset the Supporters' Shield-winning Philadelphia Union. FC Cincinnati turn to USMNT defender Miles Robinson and goalkeeper Roman Celentano as they look to stifle Inter Miami. With 29 starts in 29 appearances at the club level, he has been a critical part of the Knifey Lions' defensive efforts. He should start at the back alongside Alvas Powell and Teenage Hadebe. Celentano, meanwhile, had several call-ups this year and looks to be a 2026 backup contender. In the last meeting between these two sides at TQL Stadium, Robinson record seven defensive contributions and Celentano had two saves as Cincinnati dominated Miami 3–0. The Ultimate MLS Cup Playoff Conference Semifinal Preview. San Diego FC enjoyed a stellar inaugural season in MLS and will look to qualify for the Western Conference final when they take on Minnesota United at Snapdragon Stadium. Luca de la Torre was not part of the most recent USMNT camp, but accrued eight caps in 2025. A victory that jumpstarted the Mauricio Pochettino era. De la Torre has scored five goals and two assists in 30 MLS games.
