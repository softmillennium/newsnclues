The Ohio police officer who shot and killed Ta'Kiya Young was acquitted Friday on all counts, including murder. Young was an excited mom of two little boys, and pregnant with her first daughter, when she encountered Connor Grubb at a Kroger supermarket parking lot on Aug. 24, 2023. She was accused of shoplifting by a store employee and tried to flee the parking lot in her car, according to police body camera footage. The family's legal team vowed to continue its fight in civil court, where her estate sued the township and police chief over department practices in August. Young was gunned down by Grubb 23 days after her 21st birthday. Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford said in a video statement that his “disciplinary process” began. Grubb was the fourth Franklin County law enforcement officer to be indicted in the death of a Black person since 2020, and the second prosecuted by a special prosecutor — an increased effort in recent years to avoid potential biases between police officers and prosecutors. The announcement gave advocates like Karla White Carey, whose hometown is Columbus, hope for other counties to follow their lead with holding police officers accountable. But she was concerned that with terms like “federal immunity” floating around, police accountability may look completely different after Nov. 5. Federal immunity is a term misused by President Donald Trump when referring to “qualified immunity” — a civil liability protection for law enforcement officers — to which he has said police should be “immune from prosecution.” It is possible to hold them accountable,” Carey told Capital B last year. On a national scale, there have been 3,898 Black people killed during an encounter with law enforcement since 2013, and nearly 80% of those cases have not had any charges filed, according to the database. “It's disheartening to speak to families across the country who go through this process and never see an ounce of accountability,” Carey said. I think it is sending a very strong message to our police officers here in Franklin County.” While the families of Young, Casey Goodson, 23; Andre Hill, 47; and Donovan Lewis, 20, have received a small degree of justice with grand jury indictments, there have been 17 other Black people killed by a law enforcement officer in Franklin County since 2020, according to the Mapping Police Violence database. That consists of 11 heartbroken families who learned that  “no known charges” were filed, and six waiting for their loved one's investigation to conclude, hopefully, with positive results. Residents previously told Capital B that they didn't support Pierson because of his own failure as a special prosecutor to land an indictment against eight Akron police officers who killed Jayland Walker in June 2022 during an alleged traffic violation. “For me, you'll never get justice, because that would mean bringing your loved one back. The next best thing is to hold these officers accountable for their actions.” Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power, cut against the mainstream narrative and uplift the movements resisting fascism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa during a plenary session of the G20 leaders' summit in Johannesburg on Saturday. Refusing to bow to pressure from the Trump administration, G20 leaders have approved a declaration on climate change, debt relief and other priorities that the United States has rejected. South African officials on Saturday shared a video showing dozens of negotiators applauding loudly and cheering in celebration after they reached the agreement in closed-door talks a day earlier. G20 summit in South Africa overshadowed by eleventh-hour dispute over U.S. participation Argentina, a strong ally of Mr. Trump, later questioned the announcement. The final declaration, released to journalists on Saturday, does not describe its text as a formal G20 commitment. The declaration includes several paragraphs on fighting climate change, promoting a transition to renewable energy and providing debt relief to low-income countries – issues that the Trump administration has largely rejected. When it became clear that the G20 negotiators were still working on a final declaration despite the U.S. boycott, the White House issued its objections and said it was “shameful” to announce a declaration without U.S. agreement. It said the G20 should merely issue a closing statement by its host country, which would carry no official weight. G20 envoys agree on draft leaders' declaration despite U.S. boycott, sources say “There is overwhelming support for every paragraph in the final declaration, which was reached by consensus,” said Zane Dangor, director-general of South Africa's foreign ministry and one of the negotiators who struck the deal. Mr. Trump announced the U.S. boycott earlier this month after falsely accusing South Africa of “slaughtering” its white minority and illegally seizing the farmland of white farmers. By Saturday, there was still no agreement on U.S. participation. Mr. Ramaphosa speaks with Prime Minister Mark Carney at the G20 leaders' summit.Misper Apawu/Reuters Prime Minister Mark Carney and Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand, who attended the summit, did not comment publicly on the G20 declaration on Saturday, but Ms. Anand said the federal government agreed with South Africa's official summit themes of solidarity, equality and sustainability. “The bottom line is, yes, it's a great day for multilateralism,” Ms. Anand told journalists on Saturday afternoon after the G20's opening session.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The case of Edgemere reflects a wider trend among coastal resiliency efforts currently underway across US cities. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! This article was produced in partnership between   Floodlight and New York Focus. Baba Ndanani has lived in one of New York City's most flood-prone neighborhoods for more than 20 years, and he knows the risks all too well. His two-story home in the coastal community of Edgemere sits directly beside Jamaica Bay. During high tides, he often watches with concern as the bay creeps into his backyard and climbs the steps to his back porch. In 2012, during Superstorm Sandy, over 5 feet of water rushed into Ndanani's house. “I just wanted to get out, and that was it.” After the storm, he returned to his decimated home and spent two weeks sleeping atop an overturned refrigerator. “There was nothing else for me to sleep on. Despite his harrowing experience and a city-run voluntary buyout program designed to relocate residents of Edgemere, he says he has no intention of leaving his coastal home. “In the other neighborhood(s) they've done that, so why is Edgemere different?” Ndanani asked, referring to the city's efforts to raise shorelines around Lower Manhattan. The lack of flood protections in Edgemere, combined with a largely ineffective attempt to relocate residents in the working class minority neighborhood, reflects a wider trend among coastal resiliency efforts currently underway across America's cities. In Charleston and Miami and Norfolk, city officials are planning billion-dollar seawalls to protect their wealthy core, but not the vulnerable communities beyond it. Olivotto is a New School researcher who spent months studying flood risk mitigation efforts in the community. She says Edgemere illustrates how managed retreat from an increasingly uninhabitable coastal America “will have to confront the fact that some people cannot move either because they don't have the financial means or because they feel that this is the place they have always lived.” Olivotto stressed: “We need to think way more about the land that's left behind, and the people that are left behind after retreat than we are right now.” About 1.3 million New Yorkers live within or directly adjacent to a floodplain, and a recent report estimates more than 80,000 homes could be lost to flooding in the next 15 years. By 2050, city officials estimate that at least 800,000 residents will be living in a high risk floodplain. By 2080, nearly a third of the city's landmass could face significant flooding. New Yorkers got a terrifying glimpse of what's to come in 2012, when Superstorm Sandy flooded 17% of the city's landmass, killing 43 people and causing more than $19 billion in damage. The city has begun raising shorelines and installing massive floodgates around Lower Manhattan as part of the so-called Big U, a 10-mile-long U-shaped system that also includes mitigation features aimed to protect the island's southern tip from future floods. But for many of New York's working class coastal residents, is just another city service they aren't seeing in their neighborhood. “Everybody deserves the same amount of protection,” Edgemere resident Jackie Rogers told Floodlight. Unlike Lower Manhattan, Edgemere was among the hardest hit communities during Superstorm Sandy. Yet more than a decade after city officials pledged to fortify Edgemere, critics say little has been done to protect the community from flooding. “If a superstorm were to happen next month, the same exact issues would occur in Edgemere as they occurred in Superstorm Sandy.” But a decade later, the plan's major resiliency project has yet to break ground. “It's 13 years since Superstorm Sandy, and yet still no flood mitigation on the bayside,” Rogers said. We want our shoreline to be raised,” Rogers said. “I understand the frustration of Edgemere residents and I think that what we're talking about with this plan is really challenging compromises,” Michael Sandler, associate commissioner at the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development, told Floodlight. “I don't consider the plan to be complete. And I think the plan has taken much longer to implement than we would have preferred.” Still, Sandler recognizes that Edgemere remains far too vulnerable. “We're coming up on the peak of hurricane season right now, and there isn't a coastal protection feature, and I think that residents in the neighborhood are right to be concerned about what the future looks like,” Sandler said in a September interview. He added, “I think that we have invested a lot in the community. The city now relies on a federal Army Corps of Engineers project to protect Edgemere's bayside. “It's not happening,” Edgemere resident Rogers said of the Army Corps project. “And we have a partner in the federal government who is overall pulling back from this work and from their financial commitment to resiliency. And so it is a really big challenge for New York City.” One building is completed, and several other towers are slated for construction. All are in or adjacent to floodplains; sea level rise projections show they could be partially underwater by 2100. Officials stress the city's need for affordable housing and that apartment towers in Edgemere will be less flood-prone than one- and two- story homes. Bringing more affordable housing to Edgemere continues a nearly century-old tradition of trying to concentrate low-income residents in public housing along the city's perimeter. Under Moses, New York City bought swaths of land in Edgemere and bulldozed homes to make way for public housing towers. “So many people moved in the area and were able to access some of this housing, but none of the schools or health care services that a community needs.” Rogers moved to Edgemere in 2007 through a city-run affordable housing initiative under the administration of then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. “Seeing these lots vacant is very depressing to me,” Rogers added. “Why does everything have to be a fight in this community? All we want is to live a decent quality of life.” “They're developing the whole neighborhood, but I don't think they're building for the people that already live here,” said Webber-Bey, who has lived in Edgemere for nearly 50 years. “I think people feel they just want our land and then they're going to build something that's three or four times as expensive and build a whole new community on the coast.” Another goal of the 2015 Resilient Edgemere Community Planning Initiative was to relocate some of the community's most vulnerable residents through a voluntary buyout program. “We were really pulling back and trying for the first time in New York City some form of managed retreat from the shoreline,” Sandler said. The city established a Hazard Mitigation Zone in Edgemere along Jamaica Bay where it limited development and offered to buy people's homes in exchange for moving elsewhere. We had homeowners who were not interested in leaving. And I think you see (that) in most buyout communities around the country,” Sandler said. “They've been neglected in the past and they see retreat as a new sign that the city just doesn't want to invest in this neighborhood,” Olivotto said. Despite Edgemere's vulnerability to flooding and the lack of coastal protections, few of the residents interviewed for this report expressed any interest in leaving. You can hear yourself think at night,” Rogers said. For most, it's simply too difficult to leave the economic, social and cultural networks they've built their lives around. Those who move generally do so only after the economic outlook has deteriorated so much — due to rising insurance costs or the loss of jobs — that they feel they have no other choice. When these wealthier residents leave, research shows their departure can lower the community's tax base, leaving the older, lower income households behind with fewer resources to recover and guard against future flooding. “But by the grace of God, I ain't going no place.” Rogers has fortified the garden by installing raised metal beds, but she dreams of a day when her community finally gets the protection it's been promised.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Temporary hold on lower court ruling will remain in place while supreme court considers whether to allow new map The US supreme court on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that found Texas's 2026 congressional redistricting plan pushed by Donald Trump likely discriminated on the basis of race. The court's conservative majority has blocked similar lower court rulings because they have come too close to elections. The justices have blocked past lower-court rulings in congressional redistricting cases, most recently in Alabama and Louisiana, that came several months before elections. Texas redrew its congressional map in the summer as part of Trump's efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year's elections, touching off a nationwide redistricting battle. The new redistricting map was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats, but a panel of federal judges in El Paso ruled 2-1 on Tuesday that the civil rights groups that challenged the map on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters were likely to win their case. Texas was the first state to meet Trump's demands in what has become an expanding national battle over redistricting. Republicans drew the state's new map to give the GOP five additional seats, and Missouri and North Carolina followed with new maps adding an additional Republican seat each. The redrawn maps are facing court challenges in California, Missouri and North Carolina. The supreme court is separately considering a case from Louisiana which could further limit race-based districts under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president calls resignation ‘great news' as Ms Greene blasts him in scathing video exit Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced her resignation from Congress after a bitter falling out with Donald Trump. In a fiery statement published days after the US president called her a “traitor”, the 51-year-old Republican congresswoman said she was quitting after Mr Trump had “tried to destroy” her. “I refuse to be a battered wife, hoping it all goes away and gets better,” Ms Greene said in a lengthy video posted to her X account on Friday evening. Ms Greene said her last day in office would be Jan 5 next year. Mr Trump suggested Ms Greene had quit because she didn't want to face a primary election “she would have no chance of winning” because whoever challenged her would have had the US president's backing. Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social network: “For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went bad. She also vowed to read a list of Epstein's powerful clients on the House floor, should his victims compile one. Sharing Mr Trump's Truth Social post on Ms Greene's departure, Mr Massie wrote: “I'm sad to see one of my best friends Marjorie Taylor Greene leave Congress. The former Trump loyalist also became critical of what she called the US president's lack of focus on domestic policy, claiming that “all our country does is fund foreign countries and foreign wars, and never does anything to help the American people”. He also called her a “ranting lunatic” who had “gone far-Left”. On Friday evening, Ms Greene said she had decided to leave to avoid a “hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president that we all fought for”, adding that the Republican party was likely to lose the midterm elections in 2026. Ms Greene was elected to Congress in 2020 and, for five years, was one of the US president's strongest backers, defending him through numerous scandals and enduring what she characterised as “never-ending personal attacks” from her opponents. Mr Trump has vociferously denied wrongdoing and has called the files a “hoax”, while claiming without evidence that Epstein had deep ties with Democrats. Ms Greene hit back, accusing the president she once loyally defended of inciting death threats against her. “Loyalty should be a two-way street,” she said in the video announcing her resignation. “Standing up for American women who were raped at 14 years old, trafficked and used by rich, powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, who I fought for.” The dramatic falling out should not be seen in isolation. A growing number within Mr Trump's base have become disillusioned with the president's foreign policy, economic priorities, freedom of speech and position on foreign visas. “I ran for Congress in 2020, and have fought every single day believing that Make America Great Again meant America First,” Ms Greene said in her nearly 11-minute-long message. Ms Greene ended her video with the message that it is up to “common American people” to understand that Washington is “gradually destroying our country”. “I'll be here by their side to rebuild it,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Orleanians are bracing for a major deployment of US border patrol officers to the city, as Donald Trump forges on with his mass deportation agenda and sweeping federal immigration crackdown in Democrat-led cities. Despite falling crime, as many as 250 federal agents are expected to descend on New Orleans imminently to begin laying the groundwork for “Operation Swamp Sweep”, which the Associated Press reported is due to launch in south-east Louisiana and Mississippi on 1 December with the stated aim of arresting 5,000 people. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operation will be led by Gregory Bovino, a senior border patrol commander. Activists in Charlotte have already looked to their actions as a blueprint and now, following weeks of reports of raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) circulating across the greater metro area, New Orleans residents are preparing to resist also. Both border patrol officers from the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency and ICE agents come under the umbrella of DHS. They are also rallying around neighbors believed to be under threat – often because they are undocumented or the Trump administration no longer recognizes a temporary status granted under the Biden administration – using community text threads, social media and whistleblowing – literally blowing whistles in the street if officers are believed to be approaching. There were reports of construction workers being instructed to stay home on Friday, in case border patrol arrived that early, and businesses such as restaurants and gas stations are being urged not to serve ICE agents. New Orleans' Mexican-American mayor-elect, Helena Moreno, told the AP there is “a lot of fear” in the city and that she's working to ensure those who could be targeted by federal agents know their legal rights. Local immigrant advocacy group Unión Migrante already posts about ICE sightings and shares resources in English and Spanish on its social media pages. It also holds regular “Know Your Rights” workshops where people learn what protections they have during a immigration investigation, what to do if they get pulled over in the car by an agent, how to legally film ICE agents and police, and hear legal advice from immigration lawyers. “It's not just me, but thousands of us here that look Latino. The city is known for its rich blend of French, Spanish, African, Native American and Asian cultures, and 14% of its foreign-born metro population are Latino. Rachel Taber, also an advocate and organizer with Unión Migrante, told the news site NOLA.com that immigrants and their family members have been contacting lawyers, giving people power-of-attorney in case they are detained, and locating passports in the event they need to travel to reunite with relatives. The mission has the enthusiastic backing of Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry, a staunch Trump ally, who has made a vigorous push to align state policy with sweeping federal immigration efforts and has targeted New Orleans' immigration policies to make enforcement a priority. Another more bans city policies that prohibit cooperation with federal immigration agencies. In September, Landry had also requested a national guard deployment to New Orleans even though violent crime is down and the city's elected leaders maintained that violent crime is down and federal troops are unnecessary. Landry's office has been approached by the Guardian for comment. Meanwhile, the New Orleans police department (NOPD) was released from a federal reform pact on Wednesday that has long shielded its officers from having to participate in immigration enforcement. Anne Kirkpatrick, NOPD's superintendent, told WBOK radio earlier this week that officers would collaborate with federal agents, but not on raids or deportations. “They're coming, so I am going to be a collaborator.</p>

Co-owners John Cote and Barb Stefanyshyn-Cote are fifth-generation farmers who expanded their focus from grain farming to distilling in 2015, growing 95 per cent of their own grains and producing a range of small-batch whisky, gins and liqueurs with ingredients harvested on the property. “Canadian whisky has traditionally been led by massive brands, so it's nice to see a craft element coming through,” Judge Joel Harrison explains in a release from the London-based competition. Fifth-generation farmers John Cote, right, and Barb Stefanyshyn-Cote started distilling 10 years ago.Black Fox Farm & Distillery/Supplied Black Fox's recognition in the whisky category was merited by gold medal awards granted to a limited release Blended Canadian Whisky from 2024 and Single Grain Canadian Whisky, produced from triticosecale, a hybrid of wheat and rye propagated in the 19th century. The distillery also received a near-perfect 99-point score for its Haskap Gin, a result achieved by only three other gins since the competition was founded in 1970. “It's nice to have this spotlight on the interesting things happening in this country and our distillery in particular,” says John Cote, who promotes the authenticity of each bottle produced with an individual serial number that can be used online to receive a certificate of provenance outlining production dates and details. The information sheet for Black Fox whisky outlines specifics about grain type as well as fun facts stating minimum and maximum temperatures experienced during barrel aging and the number of days with 20-degree temperature swings. “It is a good news story, but you also get a sense of where Canada fits in on the world stage and what we specifically bring to the table.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. U.S. politicians have sent a sharp warning that U.S. President Donald Trump's new peace proposal rewards "Russian butchery" and undermines international security. "Rewarding Russian butchery would be disastrous to America's interests," U.S. Trump set Kyiv a Nov. 27 deadline to decide whether to accept the demands or lose the support of its most powerful ally. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine faces "an extremely difficult choice," which would lead to either losing its dignity or risking the loss of a key ally. Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick said on Nov. 21 that he and his allies have launched a discharge petition "to force a vote on crushing Russian sanctions immediately upon our return." "Today, we have officially notified both the Clerk of the House and House leadership," Fitzpatrick said on X, stressing that "Russian-drafted propaganda must be rejected." Republican representative Don Bacon said on Nov. 21 that he would be signing the petition, adding that "Congress needs to inject itself into this appeasement by the Administration towards Russia." "Ukraine should not be forced to give up its lands to one of the world's most flagrant war criminals in Vladimir Putin," Wicker said, adding that "the size and disposition of Ukraine's armed forces is a sovereign choice for its government and people." "In particular, any suggestion that we can pursue arms control with a serial liar and killer like Putin should be treated with great skepticism." Democrat Senator Jeanne Shaheen also said in an interview with CNN that the U.S. should be putting more pressure on Moscow, such as by putting secondary sanctions on companies helping Russia's war efforts, and providing Ukraine's long-awaited long-range weapons to Kyiv. Asami Terajima is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent covering Ukrainian military issues, front-line developments, and politics. She previously worked as a business reporter for the Kyiv Post focusing on international trade, infrastructure, investment, and energy. Originally from Japan, Terajima moved to Ukraine during childhood and completed her bachelor's degree in Business Administration in the U.S. She is the winner of the Thomson Reuters Foundation's Kurt Schork Award in International Journalism 2023 (Local Reporter category) and the George Weidenfeld Prize, awarded as part of Germany's Axel Springer Prize 2023. If President Volodymyr Zelensky refuses to accept the terms of the 28-point-plan, "then he can continue to fight his little heart out," Trump added. Search and rescue operations in the western Ukrainian city continue into their fourth day, officials reported on Nov. 22. The decision was made following an agreement reached by Lukashenko with U.S. President Donald Trump, at Ukraine's request. The Kyiv Independent keeps reporting from Ukraine freely, without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise — thanks to our community. Now, we're aiming for 25,000 members before 2025 ends to strengthen our newsroom and expand coverage where it's needed most. "Rewarding Russian butchery would be disastrous to America's interests," U.S. The Russian advance in Zaporizhzhia Oblast comes as Russian troops also intensify their offensives in other hot spots of the war. Russian troops launched one ballistic missile and 104 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported on Nov. 22. The Yany Kapu electric substation in northern Crimea was targeted by drones overnight on Nov. 22, Telegram channel Astra reported.

MOSCOW, November 22. /TASS/. Washington has a clear understanding of Russia's approach to arranging a Moscow-Washington summit, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with International Affairs magazine.

When asked about the current stage of negotiations with the US regarding a meeting between the two leaders, the senior diplomat stressed: "We need to ensure that such a meeting has substantive content. We cannot allow ourselves to deviate from the framework agreed by the leaders in Anchorage. The Americans understand our approach very well. We have repeatedly explained the logic behind it through various channels and at all levels."

"We certainly hope that the US administration will make the necessary efforts to ensure the required conditions for the leaders' meeting that will undoubtedly be productive," the deputy foreign minister added.

On October 16, following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, US leader Donald Trump announced that the two had agreed to meet soon in the Hungarian capital. The summit was later postponed, with both Moscow and Washington stating that it would take place once the appropriate conditions are in place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Federal Aviation Administration warned major airlines on Friday of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela and urged them to exercise caution. The FAA notice cited the “worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela” and said threats could pose risks for aircraft at all altitudes. There has been a massive American military buildup in the region in recent months, including the US Navy's largest aircraft carrier, at least eight other warships, and F-35 aircraft. The administration of US President Donald Trump has bombed boats allegedly carrying drugs that have departed from the shoreline of Venezuela and other Latin American countries. Direct flights by US passenger or cargo carriers to Venezuela have been suspended since 2019, but some US airlines fly over the country for some South American flights. Days ahead of terrorism designation for Maduro, US military performs large ‘attack demo' near Venezuela American Airlines said on Friday it had stopped overflying Venezuela in October. Delta Air Lines said it had stopped flying over Venezuela “a while ago.” United Airlines did not immediately comment. The FAA said since September there has been an increase in Global Navigation Satellite System interference in Venezuela, which in some cases caused lingering effects throughout a flight, as well as “activity associated with increasing Venezuela military readiness.” “Venezuela has conducted multiple military exercises and directed the mass mobilization of thousands of military and reserve forces,” the FAA said, adding that at no point had Venezuela expressed an intent to target civil aviation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She was once cast as a secular heroine, the daughter of a revolutionary leader, whose brutal assassination in the 1970s defined her political ascent. The ousted leader was found guilty of crimes against humanity for the violent suppression of student protests that toppled her regime in 2024. “Hiding in India and handed down a death penalty. But it was a single, bloody night in August 1975 that truly forged her path. Hasina and her sister survived as they were visiting West Germany at the time. In the chaotic aftermath, Gen. Ziaur Rahman – the husband of her future arch-nemesis, Khaleda Zia – rose to power, his regime passing a law that would protect Mujibur's assassins for decades. Overnight, Hasina's life was transformed, and she was forced into six years of exile in India, which imprinted a deep respect for the Indian state on the future leader. But she also entered a political arena about to be defined by another woman pushed into tragedy: Zia, whose husband had himself been assassinated. Taking the helm of her father's Awami League, Hasina embarked on a long journey through the political wilderness, navigating house arrests and crackdowns amid a growing rivalry with Zia. In 1996, Hasina led her party to electoral victory, becoming Prime Minister for the first time. Her first act in office was to announce the prosecution of those involved in the 1975 coup and murders of her family, finally beginning a quest for justice. A secular Muslim, Hasina served for one term, losing the next election to Zia. But when she returned to power in 2008, she was seen as a changed leader – someone more resolute, less trusting and determined to permanently secure her position. At the same time, she gave India crucial support, bolstering New Delhi through economic and security deals in a neighborhood that includes adversaries Pakistan and China. But Bangladesh's developmental success came at a steep price: human rights organizations warned that she and her government were headed toward a one-party system. As the pressure mounted, Hasina “could bank on India for full-fledged, no questions asked support,” The Indian Express newspaper reflected in a recent editorial. At home, however, her image became associated with an aggressive crackdown. “She committed so much bloodshed to be in power,” the political scientist Hasan said. She had proven adept at surviving storms of popular protest, arrests and assassination attempts, but the youth-led uprising that erupted last year was different. What began as student demonstrations over civil service job quotas quickly swelled into a nationwide roar for her resignation. The regime's response was a brutal crackdown that, according to the UN human rights office, left as many as 1,400 people dead. But the bloodshed did not crush the movement – it galvanized it, turning public anger into an unstoppable force that ultimately toppled her government. She killed, her order was to kill so many.” Hasina's life as a political refugee in New Delhi brings her story full circle, returning her to the same state of exile she endured nearly half a century ago. Hasina was tried in absentia and sentenced to death by the International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh's domestic war crimes court – a judicial body that she helped set up. “It pacified us a bit,” Abdur Rab, the father of one victim, told Reuters. India, which also has the death penalty, adopted a neutral stance, noting the verdict and vowing to “engage constructively with all stakeholders.” Hasina's family has praised New Delhi for giving her refuge. “India has always been a good friend,” Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, told local news agency ANI. “In the crisis, India has essentially saved my mother's life.” For more than a decade, Hasina was one of India's most steadfast regional allies. Her government was instrumental in cracking down on anti-India insurgent groups that used Bangladeshi territory as a safe haven. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had previously lauded Hasina for keeping their countries' extensive border secure. Now her government's downfall has raised significant security concerns in New Delhi that radical Islamist groups could re-emerge. Anil Trigunayat, an Indian diplomat who has served in Bangladesh, said he “doubts very much” that New Delhi will send Hasina home to face prison or death. “India will have to look at it (as a) political crime, not the crimes against humanity for which she has been charged there,” he said. But Trigunayat noted that Hasina hasn't exhausted all legal remedies. The day Hasina was sentenced, Bangladesh's foreign ministry called on India to hand her over “without delay.” With her Awami League now banned and its leadership scattered, the interim government led by former Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus faces the monumental task of steering the nation out of its deeply polarized political culture. The Awami League's absence leaves the political field open for its chief rival, Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and dozens of other smaller parties, to contest any future election, though experts warn the deep-seated divisions may not be easily resolved. “Bangladesh is far from reconciliation at this stage,” said the political scientist Hasan. He says the Awami League may attempt to stage a political comeback, albeit not under Hasina's leadership.</p>
