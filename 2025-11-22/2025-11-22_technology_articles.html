                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week on the GeekWire Podcast: Jeff Bezos is back in startup mode (sort of) with Project Prometheus — a $6.2 billion AI-for-the-physical-world venture that instantly became one of the most talked-about new companies in tech. We dig into what this really means, why the company's location is still a mystery, and how this echoes the era when Bezos was regularly launching big bets from Seattle. Then we look at Amazon's latest real-world experiment: package-return kiosks popping up inside Goodwill stores around the Seattle region. And finally…Todd tries to justify his scheme to upgrade his beloved 2007 Toyota Camry with CarPlay, Android Auto, and a backup camera — while John questions the logic of sinking thousands of dollars into an old car.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Delaware bankruptcy judge issued a default judgment after finding that Raveendran had repeatedly ignored court orders and provided “evasive, incomplete” responses regarding about $533 million that Byju's U.S. unit allegedly transferred in 2022 and never recovered. The judge also cited issues with a separate limited-partnership stake later valued at roughly $540.6 million. They later said they planned to pursue a $2.5 billion lawsuit against GLAS Trust and others in India and other jurisdictions, though no such filing has publicly surfaced. “We consider that the U.S. Court erred in its judgment of this matter and will be filing the necessary appeals and other contestations related to this judgment and related orders,” said J. Michael McNutt, senior litigation advisor at Lazareff Le Bars, representing Raveendran, in a prepared statement to TechCrunch. Raveendran's legal counsel argued that the court issued the judgment without giving him an opportunity to present a defense and instead relied on an earlier contempt order. The counsel said Byju's founders are preparing claims against GLAS Trust and others in multiple jurisdictions, expected to seek at least $2.5 billion in damages and, absent a settlement, to be filed before the end of 2025. Nonetheless, the default judgment marks a stunning fall for Raveendran and his eponymous company, once India's most valuable startup with a $22 billion valuation and backed by global investors including Tiger Global, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Prosus. The company is now mired in lawsuits, funding droughts, mass layoffs, and a battle for control as lenders and creditors race to recover what they can. Raveendran previously challenged the Delaware court's jurisdiction, but the judge rejected that argument in an earlier ruling, writing that “Raveendran's conduct that gives rise to the litigation here relates to his activities … in the United States fundraising and serving as a director, officer, or manager of a United States corporation.” Meanwhile in India, Byju's is undergoing a court-supervised sale process after insolvency proceedings began last year, with early bidders including Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG) and Ronnie Screwvala's UpGrad.

Part of the reason it's not included in GDP is just that it's not reliable to measure precisely so it's not as valuable as a statistic for making monetary and fiscal policy decisions. I mean what, 10ish% of our entire GDP in the US, and IIRC that's generously low, is being throwing in a fire from excessive spending on healthcare for effectively no actual benefit, versus peer states. But our GDP would drop if we fixed that! Spending on childcare means we need to offset those debts with other revenues.We have close to full employment, so I'd argue that freeing up labor isn't as strategic as other categories of spending.It all depends on what you want to prioritize. For the long term health of the nation, these areas seem key for continued economic resiliency:- pay down the debt so it doesn't spiral out of control (lots of strategies here, some good, some bad: higher taxes, lower spending, wanton imperialism, inflation, etc. )- remain competitive in key industries, including some catch-up: robotics, batteries, solar, chip manufacture- if we're going for a multipolar world / self-sufficiency play, we need to rebuild the supply chain by onshoring and friendshoring.

The government does not need to be run like a fucking business. If the economy stops growing, or worse, degrades, everyone will suffer incredibly. Orders of magnitude cheaper than private childcare because they already have the infrastructure for it. But there are entirely affordable options if you're not being choosey.

I'm an atheist, but some of the cheapest childcare is at churches. Orders of magnitude cheaper than private childcare because they already have the infrastructure for it. But there are entirely affordable options if you're not being choosey. Taking the risk was one of the best decisions I've made, but if I had a chronic health condition/higher healthcare costs, probably would not have been comfortable. Though the studies seem to show roughly zero net effect so perhaps these cancel out. A lot of the UBI trials have actually had disappointing results. The arguments usually claim that it's not a valid test because it wasn't guaranteed for life, or the goalposts move to claim that UBI shouldn't be about anything other than improving safety nets.Unfortunately I think the UBI that many people imagine is a lot higher than any UBI that would be mathematically feasible. Any UBI system that provided even poverty level wages would require significant tax increases to pay for it, far beyond what you could collect from the stereotypical “just tax billionaires” ideal. In practice, anyone starting a business would probably end up paying more in taxes under a UBI scheme than they'd collect from the UBI payments.

In practice, anyone starting a business would probably end up paying more in taxes under a UBI scheme than they'd collect from the UBI payments. And the costs go down once it's bootstrapped long enough to obtain the long-term economic benefits that grow the economy (which will take a while to materialize).Honestly, my biggest concern with it is that people will (rightfully) worry that it won't last more than 4-8 years because the subsequent administration will attack it with everything they have, and thus treat it as temporary. Instead, what I wonder is how many new businesses wouldn't be viable under a tax structure that provides ubi and health care. Americans really should be asking why we're paying a significantly higher tax burden than New Zealand and not getting similar services as part of the bargain.Put another way: the US is incredibly rich compared to other countries. Our poorest states have higher GDP per capita than most rich countries. The good thing is we can always choose to make different choices.

The good thing is we can always choose to make different choices. Not everything is measured in "economic output", not to mention that metric itself doesn't make any sense when comparing countries of vastly different size, population etc. However, this only works in a high trust society, which we no longer have. The same is true of quality public education etc, however creating US vs THEM narratives are politically powerful even if they don't actually reflect reality. Having 1% fraudulent recipients despite having very thorough and deep vetting processes should be a clue that fraud is a big problem.The fallacy is assuming that the fraud rate would stay the same if we removed the checks. Most people won't commit fraud in an honest system, but that flips rapidly when they see fraud being tolerated. Just look at what happened with the PPP program during covid. Weird how people seem to think democracy only works when their side is winning. I'm actually wondering if the program will make a big dent though. One issue with formal childcare arrangements is that the hours tend to not be flexible. Parents who have to work til 6 some nights, or who have nontraditional work schedules in general may not be better served by the state's option. Also, I'm not even against state support for parents needing childcare, but giving $500 a month to each parent who needs it to find childcare in an informal system will actually be much better than a state run system that spends $2000 per kid. btw analogy is not a good way to win arguments. I guess you can make a malthusian argument that the poors will just replicate indefinitely as resources are made available, but I don't think that's believable at all. You should be focused on making sure those future citizens are properly educated and socialized. https://www.kunm.org/local-news/2025-10-13/childcare-univers...> The state has spent years building early childhood funding — In 2020 it created a $10 billion trust fund using revenue from its booming oil and gas industry.

The government spending too much and the debt being large is an extremely popular talking point, at least half of everyone would say "the federal government should spend less than they do" much less million dollar checks for every person. OTOH, very few children have enough individual income to be disqualified from Medicaid, but it's based on household income.My handwavey plan for universal federalized healthcare includes using the child's income as a qualifier for Medicaid, phased in so the system will hopefully adjust over time rather than get overloaded to collapse. Also reduce the Medicare eligibility age over time.

That's another issue, but when they get sick they more than deserve treatment.And finally, the vast majority of illnesses can be treated cheaply if irregularly do your checkups. It can cost society $200 today for a doctor visit , or 30k for an ER stay in 3 years.That said, I think this should be handled on a state by state basis.

This isn't entirely true, there are entire industries catering to the worried well, eg expensive precautionary full-body MRIs with unclear scientific backing, whatever it is Bryan Johnson is doing and selling these days, etc.And exactly what counts as need flexes and changes depending on circumstance and who is asking. What stops someone from saying “I'm an undocumented provider with 500 kids. Pay me 500 x AMOUNT”.Public schools have residence and identity requirements. I routinely go to specialists for things I don't need to, because I make enough money that it's better than waiting for the issue to go away on its own.Now imagine expanding that to the entire country, when they don't have skin in the game. There are a huge number of people who would bitterly fight against providing health care to children. It's the same mentality that bitterly fights against free school lunch for children. Everyone should get those, and for anyone with health insurance they're covered at zero out of pocket cost.https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits...The majority of healthcare spending goes to chronic conditions caused primarily by lifestyle factors such as substance abuse, over eating, poor sleep, and lack of exercise.

We can argue about what to do with the parents but in the mean time we're going to let children suffer? Neither of them were struggling before they retired and I'll put it this way, they bought a second home in retirement. So Medicare as-is for kids wouldn't be significantly cheaper than ACA for kids.To make it cheaper, you'd need to either substantially increase the subsidy on Medicare, or decrease US medical costs (administration costs, drug costs, doctor salaries, etc) Otherwise, any welfare program will just get some of its value captured by landlords. Putting the land to its most efficient use isn't possible if all you're allowed to build is a two-story detached single family house. It has to rely on a third party that acts without due haste and with great reluctance. Governments buying goods for people with tax money turns them into dependents, sometimes permanently. And had all sorts of negative outcomes for the kids: https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/long-term-study-of-... Of course, nothing is truly “free.” It comes at a significant cost that must be carefully understood and balanced for the future. It hinders market dynamism and credit flow, which can easily stifle innovation over time. It's no wonder that business in Europe, despite being more regulated and restrained than any other part of the world, is so vilified by the youth. Unfortunately, I have found that such framings are mostly associated with a set of beliefs which I feel profoundly at odds with (e.g. unlimited wealth inequality is fine). So I find myself aligned with the "health care is a human right" crowd despite my discomfort with the ideological underpinnings. Anyone could use Google to look up the US population and multiply it by their imagined UBI payment amount to see how much it would cost. Yet 9 times out of 10 when I hear someone talking about UBI they have some fanciful ideas about everyone getting $30-40K per year without realizing that the total cost of such a program would be far higher than even our total tax revenues currently. Even if you cut all other social programs and only offered UBI it wouldn't make a difference. I disagree that it's a recipe for disaster - there are many valid kinds of holistic experiences of how a product is priced / sold, that don't change the positivist economics of what is happening.As long as childcare is economically positive, I think it is, it doesn't really matter whatever you call it. And perhaps, it's free in a way that matters most: redistribution from the very rich, that makes more customers with bigger budgets to spend on shit made by the firms they own. And perhaps, it's free in a way that matters most: redistribution from the very rich, that makes more customers with bigger budgets to spend on shit made by the firms they own. Any kind of "funded by the rich" program will mostly come from that group. That's why it's hard to pass these thing. Although, you could also say the "product" are additional parents that can work. Saving people and a local healthcare force are fringe benefits, accounting wise.</p>

Serves as a useful reminder that just because someone may not care if these companies collect this data now, they are storing it, sometimes indefinitely, and as technology advances, will be able to make more use of it than they were at the time you agreed to share it with them.It's like all the ransomware gangs hoarding the encrypted data they stole, waiting for a quantum computing breakthrough to be able to decrypt it.Not sure what to do about it, if anything, but the average person is severely under-equipped and undereducated to deal with this and protect themselves from the levels of surveillance that are soon to come.

Do people not realize we're beyond 1984? In 1984 the tech wasn't always listening, rather it had the capacity to. Much of it was about how not knowing meant you'd act as if you were just in case. It was making reference to totalitarian states where you don't know if you can freely talk to your neighbor or if they'd turn you in, where people end up creating a double speak

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This space has seen increased competition since Elon Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it as X in October 2022, as Musk's changes to the platform's content moderation policies and the site's rightward political shift sent some users looking for alternatives. In addition to the growth seen by decentralized, open source networks like Mastodon and Bluesky, other startups launched would-be Twitter rivals like Spill, Post, T2 (Pebble), and Hive. Pew's data indicates how hard X's grip on the market remains. For instance, Pew's report on U.S. adults' social media use published at the beginning of last year found that X was then used by 22% of U.S. adults. In other words, if X is declining, it's been a long, slow drop. This year's report also found that YouTube and Facebook continue to be the most widely used platforms by U.S. adults, with 84% and 71% saying they used them, respectively. Many of these services have seen their adoption grow over time, Pew noted. Around a third of adults now use WhatsApp, up from 23% in 2021. Reddit, which has become a darling of the AI era thanks to numerous content licensing deals, was used by only 18% of U.S. adults in 2021, compared with 26% today. Of course, all these figures look very different from U.S. teens' social media use, where YouTube remains No. 1, but is then followed by a different set of top apps, including TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat.

Some rendering issues I saw in classic vector games also take some shine off this handheld, which should be better for its price. Atari officially launched the Gamestation Go handheld retro gaming console a couple of months ago, and we were lucky enough to acquire one recently. This is quite a departure from the best PC gaming handhelds we usually test, but it still packs in buckets of fun for those with a taste for retro. Fuelling the Gamestation Go's potential success are several special features. The combination of a bumper selection of classic console and arcade titles, alongside those unique for its form factor controls, should make this product a winner. Once you take a little more time to absorb what you are seeing, though, some interesting differences will catch your eye. Scanning beyond the now familiar 7-inch landscape form factor, several things become obvious. From top to bottom, you will see an integrated paddle/dial/spinner; below that, there's a more familiar D-pad, and below that a trackball. Atari and My Arcade have produced some excellent packaging for this device. Inside the box, we see everything is very well padded for protection in transit. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. In my hands, the Gamestation Go feels plastic but very solid. Twisting it, there is a little give, but nothing dramatic, and there was no easily induced creaking heard, or threat of panels buckling observed. Settings, credit (coin), select, start, volume rocker, home, and power buttons 7,200mAh 3.7W battery pack offers four to five hours gaming time per charge SmartGlow control lighting system, battery charging and status LED Atari and My Arcade don't disclose the components used inside the Gamestation Go, so I was more than curious to open up this handheld up to take a look at the PCB. It was simple enough to unplug the battery, as the two adhesive strips fixing it in place just needed some gentle persuasion. This battery is attached to the PCB via a small 3-wire removable connector. I could find no more screws and couldn't pry apart the console by levering any of its seams with my tools. Stumped, I went along to my local smart device repair emporium, and they thought the screen would need to be heated up, and the PCB would be uncovered by pulling this up and away, like one might open up a tablet. However, they couldn't guarantee the device would still work after such an operation, so I decided not to sacrifice this handheld. We have seen no other teardown online, but Atari enthusiasts buzzing around forums generally think that the innards of the new Gamestation Go are closely related to the non-portable Gamestation Pro, released two years prior. If the assumption that these consoles have a very similar set of inner components is correct, the new Gamestation Go will be Rockchip RK3032-powered. This is a very modest SoC, with dual Arm Cortex-A7 cores, supported by Mali-400MP graphics and up to 512MB of DDR3 RAM. For software support, an RK3032 retro gaming device maker will usually look to Linux SpectralElec 3.0 and EmuELEC v9.0 builds. It will also struggle with any games newer than the 16-bit era, which tallies with my experience of this system (as we'll discuss later). Once there, you will be presented with a colorful interface where the D-Pad is used to scroll horizontally between ‘systems.' After a system has been selected, there are usually subcategories to flick through vertically, followed by a cascading list of actual games. It can take a while to get to a game you like, and (perhaps obviously) the Atari family contains a long list of consoles and platforms, each with rather long game lists inside. Thankfully, you can favorite/bookmark titles, and there is a recent list, too, but these shortcut lists aren't global. Moreover, smaller main categories like Atari Recharged, Balls of Steel (pinball), and Pac-Man titles are offered up in a horizontally scrolling format, like the home screen. As you scroll through the list of games in your chosen category, the console UI shows a picture of the cartridge or cabinet, plus an animation showing gameplay, and beneath that, there's a more-info section. In your chosen game, it is quick and easy to head to the settings menu to adjust brightness, screen aspect ratio, load and save states, and view (but not adjust) the controls available. Moreover, the Home button works quickly for getting straight back to the game selection UI and picking something else to enjoy. Some of these titles ate through quite a few coins in my time. Thus, it was exciting to see Asteroids, Berzerk, Breakout, Millipede, Missile Command, Space Duel, Breakout, and Tempest among the roster of titles. Quite a few of my favorite old arcade titles are ‘vector' style, and I enjoyed playing them. However, bear in mind that many arcade games get hard and frantic quite quickly. Remember, these titles were designed to hook people in and extract cash as quickly and efficiently as possible – not for lengthy gaming sessions. I also enjoyed using the rotational paddle dial in Super Breakout and Tempest. Some fun trackball games that got me playing were Millipede and Missile Command. It's also important to note the Gamestation Go ahs many duplicate games. Sometimes I wondered why there were so many duplicates, especially in the Atari library. While control method authenticity is something of a star attraction for Gamestation Go gamers, there are some clear issues with it, in my experience. One of the first things you may notice when gaming on this handheld is that you can't change the controller configuration. The pre-defined SmartGlow indicated controller configuration is what you have to live with. If a game is configured to use the D-pad for movement by Atari / My Arcade, then trying the paddle or trackball will be futile. There's no way to change this in any of the firmwares I had during testing (v 1.0 and v1.1). This control method is really overly sensitive, with no way to tone it down. I'd say the most processor-intensive (newest) titles available in the pre-installed list all worked without a hitch, without slowdowns, glitching, or audio pops or crackling. Thus, this handheld, with its underlying hardware, is fit for purpose. Though not documented by Atari or My Arcade on the official product pages, Gamestation Go users can expand their playable games library using the system's microSD card slot. ROMs for particular systems need to use pre-set extensions. Just before the UI settles down and is ready for user interaction, you then select between the 'Local Storage' or 'Micro SD card' options (see above gallery). It is easy to press the Home button and get back to the basic folders and files SD card list. From here, I didn't find a way to get back to the SD card contents, except via a system restart. I successfully tested and enjoyed some games from the Sega Genesis (AKA Mega Drive), Super Nintendo (SNES), Atari Lynx, and NeoGeo Pocket Color (NGPC) systems. All the titles I tried from these systems played nicely, albeit with just the D-Pad and ABXY buttons usable during play. Perhaps some SNES games pushed the system a little too far, as I heard a bit of audio crackling in some of these classic titles. It is clever to differentiate this device by having a paddle and trackball built-in, and this will surely exert a gravitational pull on retro gamers in its orbit. While the Gamestation Go largely works as intended, its appeal is dulled by the lack of user-configuration options, rendering quirks in classic vector games, and a price point that feels misaligned with its level of hardware and software polish. We remain hopeful that further firmware updates can improve matters, but canny customers don't buy on a promise. Another thorn in the Gamestation Go's sides is that nearly everyone owns a smartphone, with a screen approaching the 7-inch diagonal of this handheld. Many more will have access to a portable in the form of a tablet, laptop, or handheld - often with even larger, more immersive, screens. Add a nice game controller to the powerful mobile device you already own, and you can probably enjoy playing emulated consoles from eras much more recent than the Gamestation Go can hope to support. Last but not least, there are dozens of gaming handhelds on Amazon, AliExpress and other marketplaces that are designed primarily for playing retro console and arcade ROMs. These platforms may have fewer legitimately licensed game collection options, but that won't bother some. While I haven't seen any rivals with the trackball or paddle that the Atari offers, they often come with analog joysticks - and enough processing power to make later generations of console and arcade games playable. Moreover, there are lots of options around $50, if a 4-inch screen is enough for your retro gaming fix. Among these alternatives, to be fair, is the My Arcade Atari Pocket Player Pro at just $39.99 on Amazon at 11% off right now. It has a small screen at just 2.75-inches, and relatively limited controls. However, it still has a decent 100+ licensed games built in and similar cool styling to the newer and more substantial Gamestation Go. That alternative Atari-branded product might just be enough for an enjoyable blast from the past. We'd also expect the larger new console to have some attractive price cuts in due course, rewarding those who are patient. During my testing, the Gamestation Go's firmware received an update from version 1.0 to 1.1. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

The Small Capacity Memory Card Championship (Japan), in which participants submitted their smallest memory cards, has been a tightly run race, but now the results are in. Without further ado, the full list of tiny-capacity winners was as follows (machine translation): If I were to join in this low-capacity competition, the best entrant from my drawers of detritus would be the 1GB xD-Picture card I found (see top picture). I also remember spending far too much on a 64MB CF card (and PCMCIA adaptor) back when digital cameras were cutting-edge tech objects of desire. Even that, though, seems massive compared to the 0.5MB SmartMedia card found by X68PRO-HD and their social media acquaintances. The competition poster tipped a hat to other interesting small-capacity flash storage card entrants, but several were disqualified from the final list. Nevertheless, the rejects pile offered up some very interesting artifacts from earlier computing eras. Last but not least, it was interesting to see pictures and information about a 1.44MB ‘Flash FDD' stick.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lake Issyk-Kul sits in the northeast of the Kyrgyz Republic, also known as Kyrgyzstan. It's the country's biggest lake and the second-largest high mountain lake in the world, and beneath its surface hides a centuries-old watery grave. Researchers recently conducted an underwater archaeological expedition in Issyk-Kul's northwest to investigate the remains of a city that used to sit along the iconic Silk Road. In the first spot, they discovered the brick buildings with a millstone, one of a pair that together would have ground grain into flour or grits. In a second area, Kolchenko and colleagues identified a 13th- to 14th-century Muslim necropolis, or burial ground. The documented skeletons faced north in the direction of Mecca, the holiest place in Islam, now in modern-day Saudi Arabia. People here practiced various religions: pagan Tengrianism, Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity. The ruling elite often turned to Islam throughout their rule, but this religion became widespread in Central Asia only in the 13th century,” Menshikov added. “Prior to that, Islam was primarily the religion of the nobility and the population involved in active economic activity.” The recently discovered Muslim necropolis is likely associated with this period. Since the region is mentioned in medieval Chinese sources, the researchers hope to connect their findings with historical materials. At a third location, the team identified three other likely earlier burials, medieval ceramics, and a large vessel. Because the vessel is buried deep under the lakebed, the team wasn't able to retrieve it and plans to try again next archaeological season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The promise of interoperability for your smart home gadgets that Matter was supposed to bring has been a slow process, but it is starting to deliver, and the addition of cameras in the 1.5 release may be its biggest win yet. This could vastly improve a seriously fractured landscape, enabling you to easily add and access your cameras on whatever platform you choose. It's also something that can potentially be delivered in a software update, so some of the cameras you already own might get Matter support. Here's more you may have missed this week: What it won't handle is how that storage is managed, meaning some camera manufacturers will still require you to use their cloud-based subscription models. Matter is using WebRTC technology, with remote access handled via the STUN and TURN protocols, meaning that manufacturers can choose to implement end-to-end encryption for footage. TCP transport support is designed to allow more efficient and reliable transmission of lots of data, like video cameras produce, which should reduce the load on your Wi-Fi and the impact on camera battery life. While this is very exciting news and the potential backwards compatibility is laudable, there's no telling when you'll see it in a camera in your home. The big trio: Apple, Amazon, and Google have yet to announce any plans to adopt Matter in their cameras. Matter 1.5 isn't just about cameras, though—it also revamps support for closures, from garage doors to smart window shades, allowing for different motion types and configurations. Enhanced energy management features are the final addition. Matter 1.5 enables devices to exchange data on energy pricing, tariffs, and grid operation, enabling you to potentially get a picture of the true cost of your gadgets in energy usage, cost, and carbon impact. EV charging has also been bolstered, with state-of-charge reporting and bi-directional charging that could enable vehicle-to-grid schemes in the future. While the Matter 1.5 spec is now available, it will take developers a while to adopt it and get their devices certified by the CSA. Google has been gradually replacing its long-lived Google Assistant with the souped-up Gemini AI chatbot on all its platforms for the past year. Google says the rollout will take place over the coming months for any Android Auto users who have upgraded from Google Assistant to Gemini on their phones. The main highlight is that you can speak with Gemini naturally, whereas Google Assistant often relied on more rigid commands. Sending messages is much more of a conversational process, with the option to translate the message before it's sent, and you can easily ask to share your ETA with a spouse without fiddling with the screen. The implementation also includes Gemini Live, which enables a back-and-forth conversational mode that lets you dig deeper into any topic. The matte black dial has rhodium-plated hands and indexes with white Super-LumiNova, while the Co-Axial Master Chronometer Calibre 8912 self-winding movement boasts 60 hours of power reserve. The Action 6 features a new, larger, square, 1/1.1-inch sensor, but perhaps more interesting is its variable aperture, which can stop down from f/2.0 to f/4.0. Two stops of aperture control isn't going to eliminate the need for ND filters, but it's nice to have a little more latitude in exposure control. There's also now a reversible magnetic mount system, which solves my only real gripe about the Action 5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A fully working wood encased Enigma machine went for double the expected price in Paris earlier this week. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A WWII Enigma machine with four rotors was sold at auction earlier this week, achieving double its estimated price. This auction will have drawn in WWII and computer enthusiast collectors due to this sample being fully operational, complete with lead-acid batteries. It is also thought to be one of only eight working models remaining. This might explain why it achieved double the estimate, with an unnamed bidder paying €482,600 (US$555,233). While interesting in its own right as a primordial encryption device, the WWII German military's Enigma machines are probably most famous now for precipitating the development of computers. Code breakers at Bletchley Park in England were tasked with deciphering Engima machine messages that were used for command and control of the German Navy, particularly the stealthy submarine fleet. British spies enjoyed early WWII secret message deciphering success with the special-purpose The Bombe, developed by Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman. This complex electromechanical device was designed to match the three‑rotor Enigma M3, using its own three-rotor system. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Lee Young doesn't sound like your typical Silicon Valley founder. That background has become his calling card in pitch meetings with oil and gas executives today, but it makes for more than a great conversation starter; it underscores a path that has been anything but straightforward and that Young might argue gives Interface an edge. From age 11, Young fixated on Caltech with the intensity of someone much older. He watched shows about Silicon Valley online, mesmerized by the idea that people could build “anything and everything” in America. The ploy worked – Caltech accepted him in 2020 – but then COVID-19 hit, and so did its ripple effects. At the same time, his college fund, carefully built over six or seven years to $350,000 to cover his education, “basically got hit entirely” by the abrupt market downturn in March of that year. Without a lot of time to decide his future, he chose a cheaper three-year engineering program at the University of Bristol in the UK, studying mechanical engineering, but never abandoning his Silicon Valley dreams. He says the tools many companies use to manage safety documentation are either nonexistent – pen and paper – or so siloed and poorly designed that workers hate them. Worse, the operating procedures themselves — the instruction manuals and checklists that blue-collar workers rely on to stay safe — are riddled with errors, outdated, and nearly impossible to maintain. Young pitched Jaguar on letting him build a solution, but the company wasn't interested. When he learned about Entrepreneur First (EF), a European talent incubator that recruits promising individuals before they have a co-founder or even an idea, he cold applied despite its 1% acceptance rate. “They realized, ‘Oh, so you probably weren't at a wedding,'” he laughs. At EF, Young met Aaryan Mehta, his future co-founder and CTO. Mehta, of Indian descent but born in Belgium, had his own thwarted American dream. He'd been accepted to both Georgia Tech and Penn but similarly couldn't get a visa appointment during COVID. He ended up studying math and computer science at Imperial College London, where he developed AI for fault detection before building machine learning pipelines at Amazon. He speaks five languages, very technical, amazing guy, and we got along very well.” In fact, they were the only team in their EF cohort not to break up, says Young. “Over the last week, I've seen [Aaryan] at home for maybe a combined total of 30 minutes.” As for what, exactly, they are building, Interface's pitch is straightforward: use AI to make heavy industry safer. The company autonomously audits operating procedures using large language models, cross-checking them against regulations, technical drawings, and corporate policies to catch errors that could – in a worst-case scenario – get workers killed. For one of Canada's largest energy companies, where Interface is now deployed across three sites (Young declines to name the brand), Interface's software found 10,800 errors and improvements across the company's standard operating procedures in just two and a half months. As Young tells it, the same work done manually would have cost more than $35 million and taken two to three years. One error Young found particularly troubling, he says, was a document that had been in circulation for 10 years with the wrong pressure range listed for a valve. “They're just lucky that nothing happened,” says Medha Agarwal, a partner at Defy.vc, which led Interface's $3.5 million seed round earlier this year, with participation from Precursor Ventures, Rockyard Ventures, and angel investors, including Charlie Songhurst. After initially trying outcome-based pricing (the energy company “hated it,” Young says), Interface adopted a hybrid per-seat model with overage costs. The total addressable market isn't entirely clear, but it's not small. Interestingly, Young's age and background – things that might seem like disadvantages when it comes to more established industries – have become his secret weapons. But then, he says, he delivers his “wow moment,” by explaining an understanding of their operations, their workers' daily routines, and exactly how much time and money Interface can save them. (He claims that after a recent, first site visit with operators, five workers asked when they could invest in Interface, which made him particularly proud, given the field workers typically “hate software providers.”) Indeed, though Young works from Interface's office in San Francisco's Financial District, his hard hat sits on a table not far from his desk, ready for the next site visit. (Agarwal suggests Young could use a little more down time in his life, recalling a recent call where Young told her that he hadn't seen the sun all day.) Interface's biggest challenge is hiring fast enough to keep up with demand, a problem that requires its small team to tap networks across both Europe and the US. As for what Young makes of the life in San Francisco he wanted and is now living, he marvels at how accurate the Silicon Valley stereotypes turned out to be. I mention these ideas to people back home, and they just don't believe me.” He occasionally makes time to go out in nature with friends – he says they went to Tahoe recently – and Interface hosts events like a hackathon they threw last weekend. Less than 1% of San Francisco startups work in heavy industry, he notes, and that scarcity is part of the appeal, for him and for the people he's hiring. “Over the last month or two months, I have not done much at all [outside the office], because there's just been so much intensity here, with building, hiring, selling.” But “I feel pretty strong,” he adds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following the success of New Glenn's second test flight, Blue Origin announced a super-heavy variant of its rocket that could compete with SpaceX's Starship. That's an increase of two engines for each stage from New Glenn's current design, which features seven engines on the booster and two on the upper stage. “The next chapter in New Glenn's roadmap is a new super-heavy class rocket,” Blue Origin wrote in a statement. The company recently launched New Glenn for its second mission, sending NASA's ESCAPADE mission on its way to Mars. Although Blue Origin didn't specify when it would start launching the larger variant of New Glenn, the rocket has a packed schedule for 2026 and 2027. Blue Origin debuted its New Glenn rocket in January after years of delays. Now, Blue Origin is focusing on going bigger. Outfitted with nine engines on the booster and four on the upper stage, the added thrust will allow the new New Glenn to lift more than 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, over 14 metric tons directly to geosynchronous orbit, and over 20 metric tons to trans-lunar injection. That's way below Starship's capability of carrying up to 150 metric tons to low Earth orbit, but it's a powerful launch vehicle nonetheless. The upgraded New Glenn will also feature a larger 28.5-foot (8.7-meter) fairing to allow for bigger payloads. “Both vehicles: 9×4 and our current variant, 7×2, will serve the market concurrently, giving customers more launch options for their missions, including mega-constellations, lunar and deep space exploration, and national security imperatives such as Golden Dome,” Blue Origin wrote. Dave Limp, Blue Origin's CEO, posted an illustration of the upgraded New Glenn standing taller next to the Saturn V rocket that was used to launch astronauts to the Moon as part of NASA's Apollo program. New Glenn 9×4 also appears much larger than its predecessor. With the super-heavy variant of its New Glenn rocket, Blue Origin will be able to compete with SpaceX on an even larger scale. Blue Origin achieved several key milestones during its second New Glenn test flight. The impending arrival of another coronal mass ejection upended Blue Origin's New Glenn launch on Wednesday. Both NASA and Blue Origin have a lot riding on this flight.</p>
