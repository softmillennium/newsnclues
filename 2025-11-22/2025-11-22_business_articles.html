                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.) Just one week after Berkshire Hathaway's revelation last Friday that it purchased 17.8 million Class A shares of Google's parent, Alphabet, in the third quarter (July-September), that position has increased in market value by $415 million to almost $5.35 billion. GOOGL gained 8.4% this week while its biggest tech rivals fell significantly as Nvidia's strong earnings failed to overcome fears of an "AI bubble." Alphabet shares started the week with a 3.1% boost on Monday, apparently in reaction to the news of Berkshire's purchase. Wednesday's release of Google's new Gemini 3 AI model, which is receiving positive reviews, gave the stock another push higher. (Google's AI momentum is reportedly beginning to worry Sam Altman at OpenAI.) While the full evaluation of the move obviously can't be made until months or years from now, someone in Omaha is probably smiling right now. Warren Buffett is getting the credit in a lot of headlines, as he usually does, with many publications assuming he is responsible for everything Berkshire does. We know that's not the case, however, since portfolio managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs are able to act as "free agents." As I noted last week, Alphabet doesn't feel like Buffett's "kind of stock." CNBC.com's Yun Li writes the investment "likely" was the work of Weschler or Coombs, noting they have been behind many of Berkshire's "tech-leaning" investments, including its Amazon stake, now worth $2.2 billion. (Even before that position was first disclosed in 2019, Buffett went out of his way to tell CNBC's Becky Quick it wasn't his decision and "no personality change has taken place.") Bloomberg Opinion columnist Nir Kaissar recalls Buffett's famous refusal to invest in a business he doesn't fully understand, which kept him out of the internet bubble in the late 1990s, calling AI "orders of magnitude more complicated than selling books or pet food online." He adds, "Combine opaque technology with premium valuations, and you're sure to lose Buffett." Kaissar says he has the impression CEO-designate Greg Abel may have just shown us a "very different approach than Berkshire's shareholders are used to – notably, a new willingness to pay more now for potentially higher growth down the road, a chance Buffett rarely took, if ever." The company almost never reveals who bought what. I can't imagine you not understanding something. We just don't know the economics of it 10 years from now. But if you look at a home builder and try and think where it's going to be in five or 10 years, the economics of it, that's another question.

However, his victory earlier this month may have the unintended effect of making it even more expensive for the ultrawealthy to afford their homes in favorite ex-New Yorker haunts like Greenwich, Palm Beach, and the Hamptons, top real estate agents told Business Insider. Real estate agents in these elite zip codes say that the "Mamdani effect" is already creeping into prices or causing some to pull the trigger to buy, as locals anticipate another migration wave. 2025 was already a "banner year" for Dina Goldentayer, a Miami-based real estate agent who, with more than $3 billion in sales since 2021, is the top earner at real estate firm Douglas Elliman. Even as prices are dropping in Miami at the median-home level, they're growing for ultra-luxury buyers. As of September, the median home price for Miami was down about 4% year-over-year, while it was up 8.4% for luxury homes in Miami, according to Redfin. She has not had any New York to Miami transplant clients say they were moving because of Mamdani, but she said Miamians believe the "election results will flood the market with New Yorkers." "I've had some sellers in Miami say, 'Let's raise my price,'" Goldentayer said, though she has cautioned them to wait until he actually rolls out policies before raising it. Socialist Mamdani, who will take office in 2026, has proposed raising taxes on those making more than $1 million a year, and criticized the New York Police Department. His campaign left ultrawealthy New Yorkers concerned he's going to target their wealth and make the city less safe. Nancy Batchelor, a top Miami real estate agent who heads her own group with Compass, wrote to BI that she's had "a handful of buyers mention the election," but that it's never the "sole reason." "Many are waiting it out to see if anything changes in New York City before making a decision." That might mean buying a second home in Miami for now, but not actually moving their family south in the middle of the school year, she said. South Florida has attracted a number of billionaires like legendary investor Carl Icahn and Citadel's Ken Griffin, who moved his firm's Chicago headquarters to Miami. Steven Ross, former CEO of Related, which developed the upscale Hudson Yards neighborhood in NYC, spun out the firm's Palm Beach operations to form Related Ross. Curry has heard from ex-New Yorkers who said the potential tax implications and safety concerns of Mamdani have been a reason for their searches. Right now, it's mostly "driving conversations," especially with the top tier of clients, but actual increases in taxes will really change things. While Miami and Palm Beach have become destinations for financial types, a more traditional post-Wall Street destination, Greenwich, CT, is actually seeing some post-election sales. Ultra-luxury Greenwish home sales jumped after Mamdani's June primary victory, with more homes sold in a shorter period, and at higher prices, with an average of $19.7 million per home after the nomination compared to $14.9 million before, according to the mid-November analysis by Mark Pruner, a top Greenwich agent for Compass. "We're at record highs, people are sitting at lots of unrealized profits, and there are people who are taking money out of their stock investments and putting it into high-end real estate here in Greenwich." If a Mamdani wave continues, home hunters will have slim pickings in Greenwich. Inventory is down 82% from where it was pre-COVID, according to Pruner, pushing prices higher before any Mamdani effect became part of the equation. New York's continued strength is a result of "multi-market living," said Miami's Batchelor. Now that's not to say there won't be some ultrawealthy people selling properties in New York, but many of the ultrawealthy will buy in Florida and change their domicile to shake off the tax man while keeping their pad on Billionaire's Row. "The nice thing is, if you can afford an over $10 million house, you generally can afford two, or three, or four," said Pruner.</p>

Great grip strength is regarded as a key indicator of longevity, with one 2019 study linking stronger grip strength with lower rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment. "Those same people tend to have just better metabolism as well," Sarah Crawford, a physical therapist and owner of Anchor Wellness in Cincinnati, told Business Insider. What do these people all have in common (besides giving firm handshakes)? Grip strength is formed by building small muscles in the hands and forearms, which is harder to do than building larger muscles like your hamstrings or quadriceps. This is why squeezing a stress ball throughout an otherwise sedentary day won't do anything for grip strength. "Grip strength is really a by-product of living an active lifestyle," W. Zach Smith, a physical therapist and owner of HIDEF Physical Therapy in Seattle, told Business Insider. He compared it to a person's walking speed, another sign of longevity: "It's based on all of the things they do in their life to stay healthy." As you challenge yourself in those exercises, your grip strength improves over time. Smith said popular exercises like bent-over rows, kettlebell swings, or sled pulls (where you hold a handle instead of tying the sled around your waist) all naturally build your grip strength because they involve pulling or carrying motions. Crawford said farmer's carries — holding a heavy kettlebell in each hand and walking — "build grip endurance, shoulder stability, and core control all at once." Because of the grip strength longevity buzz over the past few years, Smith has seen devices like hand grippers and squeeze balls become trendier. With his own clients, he's seen little success when using them without additional strength training in the mix. However, if you're already strength training, Crawford said it doesn't hurt to do a few desk exercises in between Zoom meetings. She also recommended therapy putty, which comes in different resistance levels and "helps strengthen the smaller, intrinsic muscles of the hand that we often neglect." You can also get creative in challenging your grip strength throughout the day. "If you're parking further away in the grocery store parking lot and carrying your groceries out of the store instead of pushing them in a cart, that in and of itself will have an impact," Crawford said. Even fine motor tasks, like coloring with a pencil, add up over time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The possibility of another meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump is on the agenda, a senior Russian diplomat has said. "I wouldn't rule anything out," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview for the state-owned International Affairs magazine, published on Saturday. "The search for a way forward continues," he said. Ryabkov said contacts between Russia and the United States had not been suspended, and channels for dialogue continued to function. A subsequent plan to meet in Budapest was suspended indefinitely. "We are working on an ongoing basis. We have well-established formats and channels. Not all of these channels are visible or audible, not all of them need to be discussed publicly, but the fact remains that everything is in working order." Ryabkov also commented on the possibility of a trilateral meeting with China and the United States on nuclear stability, saying that Moscow did not intend to push Beijing towards it. "We have no questions for China on the subject of arms control and strategic stability," Ryabkov said, adding that Russia had not received any formal proposals from the U.S. regarding such a meeting. Trump has expressed interest in getting China involved in nuclear arms reduction efforts alongside Russia and the U.S. Last month, he said Putin had raised the prospect of a bilateral nuclear de-escalation, and China could be added to that effort.

Known for his dire warnings of crashes and recessions, Burry goes by "Cassandra" on X — a reference to the priestess from Greek mythology who was cursed to speak true prophecies but never to be believed. He burst back onto X in late October after more than two years of silence, and wasted no time firing off several warnings about a dangerous bubble in AI stocks. His hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, revealed days later that at the end of September it held bearish put options on Nvidia and Palantir with a combined notional value of $1.1 billion. Palantir CEO Alex Karp called the bets "batshit crazy" in a televised interview, spurring Burry to fire back that the AI company's boss couldn't "crack a simple 13F." He also terminated Scion's SEC registration, closing it to outside cash. Most recently, he took aim at Nvidia after its third-quarter earnings beat on Wednesday. Some market watchers rushed to ridicule his bearish stance on the AI boom after Nvidia shares popped more than 5% following its earnings beat. Michael Burry trying to keep the $NVDA short narrative alive after that earnings print pic.twitter.com/k1W9zfAW7o Still others have defended Burry, saying he's many things but foolish isn't one of them. Nvidia is the world's most valuable public company with a market capitalization above $4 trillion, so its sudden downswing dragged the entire stock market lower on Thursday. The reversal led some market watchers to rally behind Burry, celebrating his surprise comeback and suggesting he may have been right to be skeptical. They also gave him kudos for cashing in on the chaos, even though Burry hasn't said whether he holds Nvidia puts or profited from Thursday's selloff. Burry also received praise for his Palantir bet, as the AI stock has tanked 25% since November 3, when it reported earnings and Burry disclosed his puts. By no means was Burry solely responsible for the market slump. Investors also soured on Nvidia after analysts flagged increases in inventories and deferred revenues, raising concerns the company's growth may have been frontloaded and could slow in future quarters. Moreover, delayed economic data showed US unemployment rose to an almost four-year high of 4.4% in September.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with entrepreneur Dagobert Renouf, 36, who lives in Lille, France, and now works in tech sales at the startup Comp AI. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity. I was an entrepreneur for seven years, bootstrapping businesses. Over the summer, I launched a solo startup, and it wasn't going very well. Almost two years ago, I met my now wife. She's Russian and I live in France. Because of visa issues, we wanted to accelerate the wedding. I could absolutely not afford any kind of wedding because of the business situation, but at the same time, I didn't want to give up on either dream — of building my startup or on the wedding. I have a community on social media talking about my journey as an entrepreneur. No idea how I'm going to do it." A friend of mine who's a famous entrepreneur in our community said, "I'm going to loan you the 4,000, but you don't have to pay me back if you can't. Then somebody joked, "If you really need help for your wedding, you just put my logo on your suit." Because it's an entrepreneur community, everybody wants to promote themselves. After all these years in business, I'm like, "You've got to get out of your comfort zone. I posted on X, and then dozens of people were like, "Yeah, I want to put my logo on your suit." When I told my fiancée, she hated it. All she saw was the reaction on X — people joking, making fun of it. What made her come around, and what was making this whole thing beautiful, was when I really connected it to the fact that it was a way to bring my community to our wedding. She said, "OK, we can do it, but only if it's nice companies that you love, mostly indie companies — people you know." I had to convince people that she loved it. I ended up selling about 10,000 euros' worth. I don't want to look like an idiot." At first, he wanted to print everything on the suit, but that takes more time because you need prototypes. So we ended up having to do embroidery. The suit is high quality and very beautiful. The fun thing is, out of the 26 entrepreneurs who supported it, I know almost all of them. A lot of them told me something like, "Just keep the money, but don't put it on your suit. It was like a wedding gift between entrepreneurs. It's the most basic thing that we hear all the time as entrepreneurs: At first, they think you're crazy, and then it seems obvious. For the first time as an entrepreneur, I had this experience. I really had to fight for this. Every time, half of the people were like, "This is so bad. That's because, for me, entrepreneurship is my life. There's nothing on the suit I don't like. I can almost see the face of every founder associated with their company. I wanted to do right by all the people who supported me. They helped me get to where I'm at now. I joked with a friend who was beating himself up because he missed putting his logo on the suit, "Don't worry, you can have dibs on the baby crib." My wife wasn't on board with that. We were only acquaintances, but he kept replying to my posts, saying to put his company's logo on my suit. At the same time, I realized that I can do sales, and he said, "Let's get you a sales job." Without the suit, I would have never gotten this job. Do you have a story to share about your career?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The declaration, using language to which Washington has been opposed, "can't be renegotiated," South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's spokesperson told reporters, reflecting strains between Pretoria and the Trump administration over the event. "We had the entire year of working towards this adoption and the past week has been quite intense," spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said. But at the last minute, Argentina, whose far-right President Javier Milei is a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, quit the negotiations right before the envoys were about to adopt the draft text, South African officials said. Ramaphosa noted this, but went ahead with it anyway. In explanation, Quirno said Argentina was concerned about how the document referred to geopolitical issues. "Specifically it addresses the longstanding Middle East conflict in a manner that fails to capture its full complexity," he said. Envoys from the G20 — which brings together the world's major economies — drew up a draft leaders' declaration on Friday without U.S. involvement, four sources familiar with the matter said. "It is a longstanding G20 tradition to issue only consensus deliverables, and it is shameful that the South African government is now trying to depart from this standard practice," a senior Trump administration official said on Friday. The mention of climate change was a snub to Trump, who doubts the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by human activities. U.S. officials had indicated they would oppose any reference to it in the declaration. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His bold tone was a striking contrast to his subdued decorum during his visit to the White House in May, in which he endured Trump repeating a false claim that there was a genocide of white farmers in South Africa, brushing aside Ramaphosa's efforts to correct his facts. Trump said U.S. officials would not attend the summit because of allegations, widely discredited, that the host country's Black majority government persecutes its white minority. The summit came at a time of heightened tensions between world powers over Russia's war in Ukraine and fraught climate negotiations at the COP30 in Brazil. "While the G20 diversity sometimes presents challenges, it also underscores the importance of finding common ground," Japan Cabinet Public Affairs Secretary Maki Kobayashi told Reuters. Commenting on Argentina's absence from the final envoy meeting to agree on the text, Magwenya said: "Argentina (had) been participating quite meaningfully ... in all the deliberations," then never showed up to endorse the declaration on Friday. The U.S. president had also rejected the host nation's agenda of promoting solidarity and helping developing nations adapt to weather disasters, transition to clean energy and cut their excessive debt costs. "This G20 is not about the U.S.", South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told public broadcaster SABC. "We are all equal members of the G20. What it means is that we need to take a decision. Those of us who are here have decided this is where the world must go." But in a sign of the many geopolitical fissures underlying the agreed text, EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen warned in a speech about the "weaponisation of dependencies," which she said "only creates losers." This was an apparent veiled reference to China's export curbs on rare earths vital for the world's energy transition, as well as defense and digital technology. It's a breach of protocol that is not going to be accommodated," Magwenya said. Lamola later said that South Africa would assign a diplomat of the same rank as a charge d'affaires to hand over the G20 presidency at the foreign affairs department.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that found Texas' 2026 congressional redistricting plan pushed by President Donald Trump likely discriminates on the basis of race. The court's conservative majority has blocked similar lower court rulings because they have come too close to elections. The order came about an hour after the state called on the high court to intervene to avoid confusion as congressional primary elections approach in March. The justices have blocked past lower-court rulings in congressional redistricting cases, most recently in Alabama and Louisiana, that came several months before elections. The order was signed by Alito because he is the justice who handles emergency appeals from Texas. Texas redrew its congressional map in the summer as part of Trump's efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year's elections, touching off a nationwide redistricting battle. The new redistricting map was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats, but a panel of federal judges in El Paso ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the civil rights groups that challenged the map on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters were likely to win their case. If that ruling eventually holds, Texas could be forced to hold elections next year using the map drawn by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2021 based on the 2020 census. Texas was the first state to meet Trump's demands in what has become an expanding national battle over redistricting. Republicans drew the state's new map to give the GOP five additional seats, and Missouri and North Carolina followed with new maps adding an additional Republican seat each. To counter those moves, California voters approved a ballot initiative to give Democrats an additional five seats there. The redrawn maps are facing court challenges in California, Missouri and North Carolina. The Supreme Court is separately considering a case from Louisiana which could further limit race-based districts under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

How he did this says a lot about the progress Google has made in generative AI. It followed that up by rolling out an upgraded image-generation tool called Nano Banana Pro, which is churning out impressive, realistic pictures, diagrams, and charts. Google proved that AI scaling laws still work, just as its rivals are being questioned. Back then, Google rolled out a cheeseburger emoji for Android smartphones. I think we need to have a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top pic.twitter.com/PgXmCkY3Yc Will drop everything else we are doing and address on Monday:) if folks can agree on the correct way to do this! Fast forward to this week with the launch of Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro. These new AI models are much better at creating and rendering images. Their understanding of 3D space and how the world works, physics-wise, has improved so much that they now absolutely nail the cheeseburger stack. "Normally, AI models struggle with spatial orientation, particularly with respect to the relative position of objects," Balaji Srinivasan, a tech investor and former Coinbase CTO, wrote on X after Pichai's latest burger post. "But this image (if rendered by Gemini 3) seems to resolve that issue, as the exact spatial positioning of the cheese is handled correctly and precisely." If AI models can know where cheese should go in a burger, they might also know where more important stuff should be in the real world. That could mean better machine decision-making in design, engineering, and other fields. One theoretical example: A safety barrier likely needs to be placed in the right spot on the corner of a road. There's another takeaway from this eight-year cheeseburger saga. Google has been criticized for being behind in generative AI, and this week's releases have finally put those questions to bed. Google has been working at this for a very long time, and Pichai has been pushing the company toward an AI-first mindset for about a decade. Now the fruits of these labors are showing through. "Google really did drop everything they were doing to truly focus on AI. "When combined with Sundar doubling Google's revenue to $100B, he's proven he can lead Google to unprecedented heights both technologically and commercially."
