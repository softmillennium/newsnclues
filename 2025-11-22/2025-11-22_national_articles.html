                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Peace proposal deadline: President Donald Trump has given Ukraine less than a week to accept his 28-point proposal to end the war with Russia, which is widely seen as favoring Moscow, though he suggested today that the plan is still open for negotiation. • Geneva meetings: Top US diplomats will meet with senior Ukrainian officials and European national security advisers tomorrow in Switzerland. • Plans for NYC: Meanwhile, Trump has indicated that New York City is not a priority for deploying National Guard troops, as he's done in other cities during the administration's immigration and law enforcement crackdown. It follows a notably cordial appearance alongside NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House yesterday. Kira Rudik, a member of Ukraine's parliament, spoke with CNN last night about the pressure Kyiv is facing to accept the terms of President Donald Trump's proposal for ending the war with Russia, which is widely viewed as favoring Moscow. Rudik also shared her response to Trump's comment yesterday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will “have to like” the peace plan. We're hearing from two Republican senators on President Donald Trump's proposal to end the war in Ukraine. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former Senate GOP leader, strongly criticized the Trump administration for its plan, suggesting that officials are trying to appease Russian President Vladimir Putin. “If Administration officials are more concerned with appeasing Putin than securing real peace, then the President ought to find new advisors. He continued: “Rewarding Russian butchery would be disastrous to America's interests. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, also weighed in on the proposed plan, calling parts of it “problematic.” Trump has given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until Thursday to accept the plan. President Donald Trump said today that recent economic numbers are “incredible,” likely referring to the September jobs report released yesterday. “Investment in our country is bigger than ever before, by a factor of two or three, and that means a lot of things are being built and a lot of plants will be opening very soon.” President Donald Trump suggested today that New York City is not a priority for deploying National Guard troops, following a cordial Oval Office meeting with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani yesterday. Yesterday, Trump said he and Mamdani discussed crime in New York City and that they appeared to be on the same page in their efforts to combat it. “He doesn't want to see crime, and I don't want to see crime, and I have very little doubt that we're not going to get along on that issue,” the president said. Remember: Trump has made extraordinary use of the military during his second term, including deploying the National Guard to cities where his administration is carrying out immigration raids and other law enforcement efforts. The deployments have prompted a slew of legal challenges and condemnation from Democrats. President Donald Trump expressed today he was open to reconciliation with Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene shortly after she announced her plans to resign from Congress amid a falling-out she had with the president. Trump recently rescinded his endorsement of Greene and attacked her in personal terms. She started backing perhaps the worst Republican congressman in our history,” Trump said to reporters a short time ago. Greene was one of a handful of Republicans in the House who signed on to his petition to force a vote in the chamber. After a monthslong political pivot that catapulted Greene from one of Trump's closest allies to a critic on various issues, Greene announced yesterday that she will be resigning from office in January. “No, not my final offer,” Trump told reporters just now. “The Ukraine war with Russia should have never happened. If I were president, it never would have happened. One way or the other we have to get it ended,” he added. Asked by CNN's Kevin Liptak what happens if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky doesn't accept the plan by his deadline Thursday, Trump replied: “Then he can continue to fight his little heart out.” Trump made the remarks as he said he was heading to meet with former professional golfer Jack Nicklaus at the Joint Base Andrews golf course. Democratic Rep. Maggie Goodlander's district office in Concord, New Hampshire, was the target of a bomb threat yesterday, according to her spokesperson. President Donald Trump on Thursday accused Goodlander and five other Democrats, who had urged service members and intelligence officials in a video to disobey illegal orders, of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” “Tonight, the office of Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander was targeted with a bomb threat. Law enforcement responded swiftly and confirmed that no credible threat is present at this time,” Annie Lentz, a spokesperson for Goodlander, said in a statement. The district offices of three other Democratic lawmakers who appeared in the video — Reps. Chris Deluzio, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow — were also targeted by bomb threats yesterday. President Donald Trump said early this morning that Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation from Congress is due to poor polling numbers and fear of a potential primary challenge against a Trump-endorsed candidate. “Marjorie ‘Traitor' Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning! ), has decided to call it ‘quits,'” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. That was the president's first public reaction to Greene's resignation, which she announced on social media yesterday evening. How we got here: It came after a months-long political pivot that catapulted Greene from one of Trump's closest allies to one of his top antagonists. And it caps a turbulent five-year career in Washington, during which she was publicly condemned for violent rhetoric on the House floor and booted from the Freedom Caucus over a feud with a fellow Republican — while wielding extraordinary influence in her party as one of Trump's most trusted political allies. Ripple effects: Greene, who just months earlier had been discussed as a potential candidate for her state's Senate race, currently has no plans to run for any office, according to a person close to her. The Republican's exit is likely to be quickly felt in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson must navigate a razor-thin majority. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and his team landed in Geneva this morning, where he will hold meetings with senior Ukrainian officials to discuss next steps for peace, a US official said. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will join the talks tomorrow in Geneva, the official said. The official declined to elaborate further on where or when that meeting would take place. National security advisers from Germany, France and the United Kingdom are also going to the Geneva meeting, a diplomatic source told CNN Saturday. What Ukraine is saying: Senior Ukrainian defense official Rustem Umerov confirmed on X that senior US and Ukrainian officials will go over “possible parameters of a future peace agreement” in Switzerland. Zelensky made a presidential decree approving a delegation of top Ukrainian security officials for talks with the US, Ukrainian allies and Russian representatives, his office said on X today. It comes as Zelensky's government grapples with a US peace plan that backs key Russian demands. This post has been updated with information about additional allies attending the meeting. Vira Semenova, a Kyiv resident and mother of three, told CNN she feels as scared as she has been since Moscow first launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Valerii Moroz, a builder who spoke with CNN in Kyiv, said the country risks losing its identity and its independence if it agrees to a deal that's favorable to Russia: President Donald Trump is expected to spend this weekend in Washington, DC. As we keep a close eye on the diplomacy surrounding Russia's war in Ukraine during our coverage of the Trump administration today, here's what to know about how we got here. Looming deadline: President Donald Trump has given Kyiv until Thursday to accept his 28-point plan to end the war, which lays out commitments each side would make to finally end the conflict that began with Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. It calls for a halt to fighting, global funding for reconstruction and a board overseeing the commitments led by the US president. Reaction to the proposal: European powers have been caught off guard by the plan, with the European Council saying in a statement today that it needs “additional work.” US and Ukrainian officials will meet tomorrow in Geneva to discuss next steps. It looks like a win for Moscow: The proposal is widely seen as favoring Russia. Trump appears to be giving Moscow almost everything it wants, largely resembling the Kremlin's maximalist positions from talks in Istanbul shortly after the invasion, when its forces held more of Ukraine. What Ukraine is saying: President Volodymyr Zelensky said yesterday that Ukraine faces a choice between losing its dignity or a key ally in the US. What Russia is saying: President Vladimir Putin earlier told a security council briefing he had received the US proposal and that he believed it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement.” Here's a deeper dive for subscribers: CNN annotated the 28-point proposal. Remember: European powers have been caught off guard by the plan, which contains major concessions to Russia and was drawn up with little input from Ukraine or Europe. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said on X that she sat down for talks with Starmer ahead of the summit. “The situation regarding Ukraine right now a clear reminder of why that matters,” von der Leyen said. It will be attended by leaders including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva but the US will be absent. Trump wrote in a social media post on Friday that the US would boycott the event due to South African “human rights abuses” against Afrikaners, an ethnic group descended mostly from Dutch settlers, as well as German, French and British immigrants to South Africa, claims strongly disputed by the South African government. We'll keep you updated on President Donald Trump's movements in Washington, as well as reaction to the United States' 28-point proposal to end the war in Ukraine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former President John F. Kennedy, revealed on Saturday she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, with a doctor telling her she has less than a year to live. In an essay in The New Yorker, the 35-year-old wrote that she was diagnosed last year with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation known as Inversion 3, a genetic anomaly found in less than 2% of AML cases. Doctors discovered the cancer shortly after Schlossberg gave birth to her daughter in May 2024. In the essay, Schlossberg documents the grueling treatment process, which included several rounds of chemotherapy, two bone-marrow transplants and participation in two clinical trials. Schlossberg said she was also diagnosed with a form of Epstein-Barr virus in September, which “blasted my kidneys,” and had to learn to walk again. “During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,” she wrote. Schlossberg, an environmental journalist, is the second daughter of former US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and designer Edwin Schlossberg. Schlossberg said her siblings — Rose, a filmmaker, and Jack, who earlier this month announced a run for Congress — have been helping raise her children and “have held my hand unflinchingly while I have suffered, trying not to show their pain and sadness in order to protect me from it.” Schlossberg described going through treatment as her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was confirmed as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after “running for President as an Independent, but mostly as an embarrassment to me and the rest of my immediate family.” She said the doctors at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, where she was treated, didn't know whether they would be affected after the Trump administration stripped Columbia University of federal funding. “Suddenly, the health-care system on which I relied felt strained, shaky,” Schlossberg wrote. Schlossberg said she regrets adding to her family's history of tragedy, which includes John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963 and the assassination of her great-uncle, former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, in 1968. “For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,” she writes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world struck a new climate deal at the COP30 summit in Brazil Saturday, which calls for a tripling of funding to help countries adapt to increasingly severe climate impacts. Disagreements reached such fever pitch there were fears the summit would collapse with no deal. Talks stretched overtime as dozens of nations pushed back against an outcome that didn't explicitly mention a transition away from oil, coal and gas — the drivers of the climate crisis. But just after midday local time Saturday, the COP30 president André Corrêa do Lago gaveled through a deal. The final text contained no mention of fossil fuels, signaling a retreat from consensus agreements only two years old. It included only a general agreement on deforestation, rather than more explicit commitments, which had been another key issue in the negotiations. More than 80 countries, including Colombia, the UK and France, supported the concept of a “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, building on a commitment made at COP28 in Dubai in 2023. However, intense opposition from petrostates — including Saudi Arabia and Russia — and other heavy fossil fuels users prevented consensus. As part of reaching the deal, Corrêa do Lago instead said the COP presidency in Brazil would produce side texts detailing a global roadmap for moving away from fossil fuels and addressing deforestation that not all countries signed off on. This unorthodox move was intended to demonstrate that all countries' issues were heard at the summit, and allow COP to potentially build off the language in future negotiations. After the agreement was gaveled through, multiple developing countries spoke out against it, including Colombia, which formally objected to the lack of inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels. The summit deal also included an agreement to a plan for a “just transition” — the idea that as the world moves away from fossil fuels, workers in these industries must not be left behind but instead are helped into cleaner jobs. There was also disappointment from some that more was not done to strengthen countries' national climate plans, which set out how much climate pollution they'll cut over the next decade. An analysis of these plans by the UN found that collectively they would only achieve around a 12% reduction in planet-heating pollution, far below the 60% needed for any chance of keeping alive the internationally agreed target to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This is “the first COP at which the prospect of surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming has now become acknowledged,” said Joeri Rogelj, director of research at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. This summit was in many ways seen as a test of multilateralism, especially as the US was absent from the process, with the Trump administration declining to send a delegation. For some experts, the fact an agreement was reached at all shows global climate diplomacy is still alive. Sierra Leone's minister of environment and climate change Jiwoh Abdulai said this year's summit had “moved the needle” in terms of richer, developed nations accepting more financial responsibility to help the rest of the world adapt to climate change. But where some saw cautious forward progress, others identified a much darker trend. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, Panama's special representative for climate change. Harjeet Singh, COP veteran and founding director of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, agreed. “They offer us endless new ‘dialogues' that cannot pay for adaptation or rebuild homes destroyed by climate disasters.”</p>

FIRST ON FOX — Two federal inmates previously on death row, one a crooked New Orleans cop and the other the man behind a multi-state killing spree, have been transferred to a notorious "supermax" prison in Colorado, the Justice Department told Fox News Digital. News of their transfers comes as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi looks to crack down on the previous administration's sweeping clemency actions, especially those against violent crime. The former death row inmates were transferred Thursday to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado, also known as "ADX," Justice Department officials confirmed. They are among the 37 death row inmates whose sentences Biden commuted shortly before leaving office last December. Eight death row inmates have already been transferred to ADX, the Justice Department told Fox News Digital, bringing to 10 the number of death row inmates that have been transferred to the facility since mid-September. President Donald Trump walks with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi during a visit to the Justice Department Mar. More are expected soon, as all 37 death row inmates commuted by Biden are expected to be moved to the facility by "early next year," the Justice Department told Fox News Digital. The effort comes as Bondi and the Trump administration have sought to reverse some of the Biden administration's efforts on criminal justice reform, with an emphasis on cracking down on violent crime. Though sentence commutations cannot be fully reversed, Justice Department officials told Fox News Digital, Bondi has prioritized ways to penalize these individuals, in coordination with directives from Trump, and to ensure that the "conditions of confinement" are "consistent with the security risks those inmates present because of their egregious crimes, criminal histories, and all other relevant considerations," according to an earlier DOJ memo. "Two more monsters who plotted and violently murdered innocent people will spend the rest of their lives in our country's most severe federal prison," Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News Digital in a statement. "This Department of Justice will continue to seek accountability for the families blindsided by President Biden's reckless commutations of 37 vicious predators," she added. Like the eight former death row inmates that were sent to Colorado's supermax prison, the two criminals processed in ADX on Thursday have been convicted of particularly heinous crimes. One individual chased down his ex-girlfriend from Roanoke, Virginia, to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he cut the phone lines to the apartment she was living in before using cans of gasoline to set the building on fire. The ADX Supermax Prison is seen in Florence, Colorado. Another inmate, a former New Orleans police officer dubbed "Robocop" for his large physical demeanor and aggressive law enforcement style, was caught on tape by the FBI as he ordered and orchestrated the killing of a mother of three who had come to the precinct hours earlier to submit a supposedly confidential brutality complaint about his behavior that she witnessed on her way home the night before. The FBI had stumbled upon the conversation as part of a broader probe they had started to investigate a so-called "protection racket" between cocaine dealers in New Orleans and the city's police force, which had been guarding a warehouse stocked with the drug. Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared before a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday. He was also found to have falsely testified in two murder cases, including one murder he has since been linked to. The statements were used to exonerate four men from prison, including three teenagers who had been wrongfully convicted of a murder 28 years prior. Among them are Ramzi Yousef, convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers; former Sinola Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán, or "El Chapo"; and Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the co-founder of al-Qaeda. Shortly after her confirmation as attorney general, Bondi issued a memo aimed at "restoring a measure of justice" to the victims' families. The measures granted by Biden earned more criticism than former President Barack Obama: As Fox News reported at the time, the vast majority of Obama's clemency actions focused on commuting the sentences of federal inmates who met certain criteria outlined under his administration's Clemency Initiative. Bondi hosted victims' families earlier this year to hear their concerns about the commutations, DOJ said. Some said they had been stunned by the eleventh-hour commutations, and that they not been given a heads-up by the Biden administration. In February, Bondi issued a memo to the Bureau of Prisons ordering an evaluation of where these prisoners should be detained.

Danielle Bensky talks to reporters as a World Without Exploitation projection is seen on the wall of the National Gallery of Art calling on Congress to vote yes on the Epstein files transparency act in Washington, Monday, Nov. 17, 2025. This photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein, March 28, 2017. (New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File) Britain's Prince Andrew speaks during a television interview at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge in Windsor, April 11, 2021. The fallout from Jeffrey Epstein's transgressions spans oceans and continents, from the vulnerable girls he exploited to the privileged people and institutions that chose to associate with him, cover up his activities — or look away. President Donald Trump, friends with Epstein for years before he says they had a falling out in the early to mid-2000s, signed a bill late Wednesday forcing the Justice Department to make public many of its files on Epstein. It's worth noting that elected representatives of a nation bitterly divided on so much else at least could agree that the web of Epstein's sex trafficking must be exposed. But even in death, Epstein bedevils not only the president but academics, government leaders, royalty, journalists and banks, across borders and parties. Economist Lawrence Summers has bounced back before after falling from the pinnacles of academia, government and punditry. That's not likely for now, in the face of newly released emails showing that Summers stayed in touch with Epstein years after the disgraced financier pled guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor. The letters reveal that Summers appeared to ask Epstein for advice about women — and Epstein dubbed himself Summers' “wing man” — as late as 2019. At first, Summers pledged to keep teaching classes at Harvard, captured in an eyebrow-raising video Wednesday in which he opened a class by noting his shame about the relationship with Epstein. Then he stepped away from that job, too, the university said. The 70-year-old Summers, a former treasury secretary and onetime contender to lead the Federal Reserve, has had to give up responsibilities at Harvard before. This week, Harvard said it was conducting its own review. In 2020, the elite school reported that Epstein visited its Cambridge, Mass., campus more than 40 times after his 2008 plea deal. It also found that Harvard accepted more than $9 million from Epstein during the decade leading up to his conviction but barred him from making further donations after that point. A well-documented connection with Epstein has cost Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor his home on castle grounds and his title as prince of the realm. Revelations about the king's brother trickled forth for years and left little doubt that Mountbatten-Windsor, as Prince Andrew is now known, not only was involved in Epstein's sex crimes against minors but stayed in touch with the disgraced financier after his conviction. The evidence against Andrew grew increasingly hard to ignore even by his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who was said to consider Mountbatten-Windsor her favorite child and may have shielded him from the full consequences of his scandals. That became impossible after Andrew gave a disastrous interview to the BBC in 2019. In her posthumous memoir, Virginia Giuffre said she was only 17 when she was trafficked to Andrew and that Epstein took a now-famous photograph that showed the then-prince with his hand around her waist. Andrew denied ever meeting Giuffre, did not recall the photo being taken and committed no crimes. The flood of tawdry stories threatened to undermine support for the British monarchy at a time when Charles, 77 and in cancer treatment, is seeking ways to buttress the institution for his son, Prince William, to inherit. Charles stripped Andrew of his title and forced him to move out of Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle where Mountbatten-Windsor has lived for more than 20 years. This time, the president failed to control a crisis of his own making — then claimed credit for resolving it. In fact, Trump signed the bill to release files only after he'd lost a highly visible political fight, including with some of his fiercest MAGA defenders. But six years after Epstein's death, his friendship with Trump continues to chip away at the president's time, attention and support. Trump increasingly began paying those costs in July, when the Justice Department abruptly reversed course and announced that no “further disclosure” of the Epstein files would be forthcoming. Trump claimed he no longer wanted the support of such “stupid people” and “weaklings” — but that didn't quiet them. He tried lashing out at reporters who asked about Epstein, but they kept doing so. A White House effort to lean on key Republicans supporting the files' release didn't work. Major developments that Trump has trumpeted as achievements didn't quiet the Epstein issue for long. Democrats made sure of that, releasing their choice Epstein emails on Nov. 12, the same day Congress and Trump ended a record 43-day government shutdown. The president thundered on social media that Epstein's email claiming that Trump “knew about the girls” was a “hoax.” At another point, the president was forced to respond to a Wall Street Journal report that he'd written and signed a bawdy birthday note to Epstein that referred to secrets. Then, faced with the fact that all but one Republican in Congress would vote to release the FBI files, Trump abruptly backtracked. “I DON'T CARE!” Trump wrote in a social media post. “All I do care about is that Republicans get BACK ON POINT.”</p>

JB Pritzker speaks during a taping of FOX News Channel's Special Report with Bret Baier at the Washington bureau of FOX News, Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington. NEW YORK (AP) — There was a time when presidential hopefuls played coy about their ambitions, crisscrossing the country under the guise of helping other candidates and deflecting when pushed on their obvious plans. Not so for some Democrats considering running in 2028. With no clear party leader and Democratic voters raring for a fight, some could-be candidates are being far more transparent about their intentions, doing away with pretensions as they try to gain maximum visibility at a time when authenticity is in high demand. I haven't ruled it out,” New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker recently told Fox News during a trip to early-voting New Hampshire, even as he stressed that his focus is on 2026, when he will be up for reelection. Gavin Newsom told CBS when pressed on whether he will consider a run after the midterms next year. Some Democrats deflect questions and say their attention is elsewhere even as they campaign for others in early-voting states. Potential candidates are keeping low profiles amid expectations that President Donald Trump will play kingmaker in choosing his would-be successor. Presidential campaign strategists say the Democrats' less guarded approach makes sense given the wide-open 2028 field and sheer number of candidates competing for attention. Among the others who have said they are considering a run: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who also was a White House chief of staff, and Hawaii Gov. “Old rules just don't apply to anything anymore,” said Jess O'Connell, a Democratic strategist who advised Pete Buttigieg's 2020 presidential campaign. “You've got to be out there every single day fighting and sharing your vision,” she said. Alex Conant, a veteran of the presidential campaigns of Republicans Marco Rubio, a former Florida senator who is now Trump's secretary of state, and Tim Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor, said the dynamics of the emerging Democratic primary, with no clear front-runner, have changed the calculus for candidates. It's hard to recall a field that is this wide open. And the Democratic base is so hungry for someone to take on Trump and win back the White House,” he said. “One of the takeaways from Trump is that people want authenticity,” Conant said. “Voters are rejecting candidates who sound like politicians, so the rhetorical tricks that politicians have used for decades to avoid answering questions now just irritates voters.” JB Pritzker played coy on stage during a recent interview with journalist Kara Swisher, repeatedly dodging her questions about his expected timeline. “Blah, blah,” she responded as he tried to pivot to talking about the strength of the Democratic bench. Josh Shapiro has been equally circumspect, refusing to acknowledge any White House ambitions or even commit to running again for governor, even as the shadow of 2028 follows him everywhere he goes. But during an appearance on “The Breakfast Club” podcast last month, as he reflected on the arson attack on his official residence, he sounded like someone who is eager to remain in the arena. “You can't walk away now, with everything that's on the line. His perceived national ambitions have become a frequent attack line for his potential GOP rival for governor, state Treasurer Stacy Garrity. “We need somebody that is more interested in Pennsylvania and not on Pennsylvania Avenue,” Garrity said recently on a conservative radio show in Philadelphia. That is one of the risks for candidates, said Mike DuHaime, a longtime GOP strategist who advised the presidential campaigns of Chris Christie, John McCain, Rudy Giuliani and George W. Bush. In 2013, he noted, Christie's opponent in the New Jersey governor's race often tried to use his national buzz as a campaign issue against him. Candidates, DuHaime said, also need to strike a balance and make that they are not distracting from midterm races by funneling money or attention away from candidates who need them. “I think it makes sense not to be so coy because people kind of get it, but they still should be careful about putting themselves in front of the country cause it could backfire,” he said. In other cases, candidates have genuinely not made up their minds, and may be lured by party leaders in early-voting states eager to draw rising stars to their events, DuHaime said. “It's very intriguing and exciting for candidates and would-be candidates to be asked,” he said, with some deciding, “Let's go experience it, the national circus. Along with potential legal considerations, O'Connell, the Democratic strategist, also noted that many of those expected to run have day jobs they need to balance. While picking fights with Trump certainly puts them in the spotlight, it could have ramifications for constituents if the Republican president retaliates, meaning that candidates will need to choose their moments wisely. “I think we're going to see people struggling with that,” she added. She also urged candidates to embrace what she called a “Beyonce-Taylor Swift strategy,” referring to the pop stars' boosting the economies of the cities where they performed on tour. “What I would advise anyone who wants to be president in 2028,” she said, “is to roll up your sleeves and help.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lecho Lopez shoes comic books at his store JLA Comics on Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025 in Sacramento, Calif. (AP Photo/Sophie Austin) Lecho Lopez shoes comic books at his store JLA Comics on Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025 in Sacramento, Calif. (AP Photo/Sophie Austin) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — On a recent day at Sacramento native Lecho Lopez's comic shop in the city, his 5-year-old nephew read his first word aloud: “bad.” It was from a graphic novel. There was irony in that being his first word, because Lopez credits comic books with many positive things in his life. That's why he supports repealing a city ordinance dating back to 1949 that bars the distribution of many comic books to kids and teens. “It's a silly law,” said Lopez, who has a red-and-black tattoo of the Superman logo on his forearm, in an interview at his store, JLA Comics. The ban applies to comic books prominently featuring an account of crime that show images of illegal acts such as arson, murder or rape. In the mid-20th century, as comic books were on the rise, fears spread over their impact on children, with some arguing they could lead to illiteracy or inspire violent crime. While some cities like Sacramento still have those laws on the books, they are rarely if ever enforced. “These antiquated laws kind of set up this jeopardy where bad actors could work hard to make this medium imperiled,” he said at a hearing Tuesday held by the city council's Law and Legislation Committee. Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, said “there is no good reason” to have a ban such as Sacramento's on the books, saying it “flies in the face of modern First Amendment norms.” The movement to censor comics decades ago was not an aberration in U.S. history, said Jeff Trexler, interim director of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, which fights to protect the free-speech rights of people who read or make comics. New York, for example, created a commission in the 1920s dedicated to reviewing films to determine whether they should be licensed for public viewing, based on whether they were “obscene” or “sacrilegious” and could “corrupt morals” or “incite crime,” according to the state archives. The California Supreme Court ruled in 1959 that a Los Angeles County policy banning the sale of so-called “crime” comic books to minors was unconstitutional because it was too broad. Sacramento's ban probably doesn't pass muster for the same reason, Trexler said. But, he said, similar research into television and video games has not shown a link to “clinically relevant changes in youth aggression or violent behavior.” Leafing through comics like EC Comics' “Epitaphs from the Abyss” and DC's and Marvel's collaboration “Batman/Deadpool,” Lopez showed an Associated Press reporter images of characters smashing the windshield of a car, smacking someone across the face and attacking Batman using bows and arrows — the kinds of scenes that might be regulated if Sacramento's ban were enforced. But comics with plot lines that include violence can contain positive messages, said Benjamin Morse, a media studies lecturer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Spider-Man is a very mature concept,” said Morse, who became an “X-Men” fan as a kid and later worked at Marvel for 10 years. But it was “Kingdom Come,” a comic featuring DC's Justice League, that changed his life at a young age, with its “hyper-realistic” art that looked like nothing he'd ever seen before, he said. He said his interest in comic books helped him avoid getting involved with gangs growing up. They also improved his reading skills as someone with dyslexia. “The only thing that I was really able to read that helped me absorb the information was comic books because you had a visual aid to help you explain what was going on in the book,” Lopez said. And a comic book can offer so much more, Burgoon said at this week's hearing.</p>

María Salazar, R-Fla., join ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's increased military pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and an upcoming Capitol Hill vote to condemn socialism. The Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines about flying over Venezuela as it issued a notice urging them to "exercise caution" due to the "potentially hazardous situation" in the region. The advisory comes as the U.S. has significantly increased its military presence across the Caribbean under U.S. Southern Command, deploying bombers, warships and Marines as part of an expanded campaign targeting drug-trafficking and so-called "narco-terrorist" networks operating near Venezuela. "Operators are advised to exercise caution when operating in the Maiquetia flight information region at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela," the FAA advisory said. "Threats could pose a potential risk to aircraft at all altitudes, including during overflight, the arrival and departure phases of flight, and/or airports and aircraft on the ground," it added, requesting airlines to provide at least 72-hour advance notice to the FAA if they plan to fly through the area. Members of Venezuela's Bolivarian National Guard stand in formation as they carry out an increased security patrol along Lake Maracaibo amid rising tensions between Venezuela and the U.S., in Maracaibo, Venezuela, on Oct. 26, 2025. Direct flights from U.S. passenger and cargo carriers to Venezuela have been suspended since 2019, but some airlines still fly over the country on their South American routes, according to Reuters. "Since September 2025, there has been an increase in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interference in the Maiquetia Flight Information Region (SVZM FIR), as well as activity associated with increasing Venezuela military readiness," the FAA also said. "Some civil aircraft recently reported GNSS interference while transiting the SVZM FIR, which, in some cases, caused lingering effects throughout the flight. GNSS jammers and spoofers can affect aircraft out to 250 nautical miles and can impact a wide variety of critical communication, navigation, surveillance, and safety equipment on aircraft," the FAA continued. The USS Gravely, a U.S. Navy warship, departs Port of Spain on Oct. 30, 2025. The warship arrived in Trinidad and Tobago on Oct. 26, 2025, for joint exercises near the coast of Venezuela, as Washington ratcheted up pressure on drug traffickers and Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. "Additionally, since early September, Venezuela has conducted multiple military exercises and directed the mass mobilization of thousands of military and reserve forces. While Venezuela has at no point expressed an intent to target civil aviation, the Venezuelan military possesses advanced fighter aircraft and multiple weapons systems capable of reaching or exceeding civil aircraft operating altitudes, as well as potential low-altitude risk from man-portable air defense systems and anti-aircraft artillery," it also warned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here. Seinfeld, the greatest TV comedy of all time, is famously known as a show about nothing. Still successful in syndication almost 30 years since going off the air, the plot focuses on the lives of four single New Yorkers navigating their way through various dating, career, and cultural oddities. The spectacle underscores and crystallizes everything we know about Washington, especially when it comes to the modern-day Democratic Party. This, of course, is all about damaging President Donald Trump, and legacy media is more than happy to make this Epstein show about nothing into the sequel of the Trump-Russia collusion scandal that ate up most of Trump's first term despite there being no there there. Let's be clear: If Democrats had anything on Trump while they were in power, they would have absolutely leaked that to the press or held hearings when he ran for president in 2016, or when he ran again in 2020, or when he ran a third time in 2024. This is a party that has weaponized the justice system against him in his last run for president through laughable cases attempted to be carried out by partisans such as Jack Smith, Fani Willis, Alvin Bragg, Leticia James, and others, so why would they hold back their biggest winning hand with Epstein? Crockett, who is seemingly on CNN and MSNBC more than most of its paid anchors and analysts these days, railed during a speech in Congress about Epstein once donating money to current Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Lee Zeldin. One problem: The Epstein whom Crockett was referring to was Dr. Jeffrey Epstein, a New York physician who died in 2018. One would think that Crockett, who is eyeing a run against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) next year, would apologize for making such an egregious error. “Listen, I never said that it was that Jeffrey Epstein,” Crockett told CNN “anchor” Kaitlan Collins, later adding, “So my team, what they did is they Googled, and that is specifically why I said a Jeffrey Epstein. Unlike Republicans, I at least don't go out and just tell lies. That's fine,” she continued as Collins listened intently. “But when Lee Zeldin had something to say, all he had to say was, it was a different Jeffrey Epstein. As for Kaitlan Collins, this was a textbook example of how not to interview someone. She allowed Crockett to ramble on and end her statement by hilariously claiming she hadn't meant to mislead people. She absolutely did — guilt by association, just as Democrats are doing with Trump. The whole thing is reminiscent of a Seinfeld episode involving the main female character, Elaine, who begins dating a guy named “Joel Rifkin.” Rikfin, of course, was a serial killer who carried out nine murders in New York in the late 80s and early 90s. Ironically enough, Elaine suggests “O.J.” as a benign possible replacement. The host, Trump Derangement Syndrome sufferer Tim Miller, predictably didn't bother to ask Harris why she and former President Joe Biden didn't release the files during their years in office, nor did he ask why she never mentioned Epstein once on the campaign trail when she ran for president in 2019 or 2024. Instead, Miller just chuckled along and followed up with zero questions. Things got even better when it was revealed that Rep. Stacey Plaskett, a non-voting delegate of the U.S. Virgin Islands, was texting with Epstein on the House floor during a hearing with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen in 2019, after Epstein had been convicted as a sex offender. But much like Crockett, Plaskett was unrepentant when politely asked about it on CNN. “I believe that Jeffrey Epstein had information, and I was gonna get information to get at the truth,” she explained. “Having a friendship with him is not something that I would deem to have. Yes, because there's no more reliable source of credible information than a convicted sex offender whom Plaskett once took donations from. But Plaskett says we should just ignore what she did and “move forward.” Overall, Trump will be unfairly and dishonestly associated with Epstein the same way he is with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. The Mueller report cleared Trump, and even in 2025, the president is still accused of being a Russian pawn six years after it was released. There also isn't a shred of evidence of Trump doing anything nefarious via Epstein, and Democrats and the media don't care because of the main goal: Hurt Trump by attempting to split the Make America Great Again base courtesy of attention-seeking Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA)… the media's next Liz Cheney. Instead, it's become yet another political football, the Seinfeld of Capitol Hill, and therefore a show about sound and fury… signifying nothing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Piles of sample materials that have been brought for Trump's perusal sit in the Oval Office or the adjacent dining room, according to people who have seen them. Visiting foreign leaders and members of Congress are sometimes asked to weigh in on materials or designs. Those who have worked with Trump to transform his private properties in New York and Florida told CNN that the president would take a notable personal interest in their renovation work. “My expectation was there might be three or four levels between me and him, and I would rarely see him,” said Wes Blackman, a project manager who worked with Trump at Mar-a-Lago for a decade in the 1990s and 2000s. “That couldn't have been further from the truth. When architect Tamara Peacock was helping turn Mar-a-Lago into a private club in the 1990s, she remembered frequently meeting with Trump on Saturdays at the property while others had to wait. “They'd be lined up in the foyer while we're spending hours going over every light fixture and every paint color,” Peacock told CNN. White House officials describe Trump as a “builder at heart,” and say his focus on renovation projects serves as a creative outlet of sorts. Even as the president seems to revel in his adopted role of builder-in-chief, the demolition of the East Wing and plans for a $300 million new ballroom have sparked criticism over cost, transparency and propriety. Those who have worked with Trump in the past paint a picture of a developer who is demanding, but skilled at solving problems and finding his way through red tape. Builders, architects and artisans who worked for Trump on his past construction and renovation endeavors praised his ability in the field. Trump had a “good eye,” Peacock said, for “taking areas that were kind of ‘dungeoness' — that was the word he used — and then he would come up with a way to kind of brighten it up and push life into it.” During the 1990s Mar-a-Lago renovation, Trump would spend the weekdays at Trump Tower in New York and then fly down to Florida to have weekend meetings. He pushed hard for progress on his projects, said Peacock, who now runs an architecture firm in south Florida and North Carolina. “It's not just a casual meeting where you're sitting around with a friend — you have to be on your toes,” she said. Trump always wanted the pace of projects to move quicker, said Blackman. When Trump would “ask me to do the impossible, I'd pull out a rabbit,” he said, likening his work that of a magician. “He loves design, and on any project we've done for him, he always marks up the drawings,” said Rick Gonzalez, an architect who's worked with Trump at Mar-a-Lago for three decades and helped build its ballroom in 2005. He insisted officials go through video surveillance to identify the culprit. John Icart, a Florida cabinetmaker, has worked with Trump on numerous personal projects over three decades and is responsible for one of the finishes perhaps most synonymous with Trump's name and aesthetic: gold. He's long worked at Mar-a-Lago and also helped with Trump's golden additions to the White House during his first year in office, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reached last month by CNN, Icart did not deny his involvement with the East Wing project, but said that he is working on some things now he's not able to discuss yet. Icart told CNN that over the 34 years he has worked with Trump, the president has “always been very loyal to me. Icart's business in West Palm Beach, Florida, is temporarily closed, according to the listing online. Besides gold, Trump has also been known for an affinity for marble (which is what he used to renovate the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom earlier this year). For the Palm Room at the White House, he selected the type of highly polished marble and insisted it be “book-matched,” meaning slabs are lined up to resemble one continuous piece of stone. Besides his involvement in the physical renovations of his properties, Trump was diligent in navigating the legal and regulatory hurdles required to convert and expand his properties, those who worked with him said. By comparison, the speed in which Trump bypassed any red tape and demolished the White House's East Wing delivered a jolt to Washington. Even the president himself expressed surprise at how easy it was. In the 1990s, Trump faced a more difficult road as he battled opposition from the town of Palm Beach and his neighbors over his plans first to subdivide Mar-a-Lago and then to turn the property into a private club. “We had to do a whole lot of presentations to Palm Beach, and every time I'd go and do a presentation to talk about the conversion and the rezoning into a private club, all the neighbors would show up and speak against the project,” Peacock said. Choosing where to build a ballroom on the property took several years, as Trump needed approval from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded nonprofit based in Washington. The estate was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1972, and Trump's agreement with Palm Beach included a conservation easement requiring sign-off from the Trust. “He took them seriously, and we used it strategically,” Blackman said. With the East Wing, however, Trump has so far brushed off any preservation concerns. Of course, Trump will have a built-in advantage to fend off any concerns that might arise from the commission: He's appointed Will Scharf, the White House staff secretary, as its chair. Last month, Trump also fired six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency that's previously reviewed proposed additions to the White House. While that's likely to aid Trump with any construction and logistical problems with the ballroom project, he still faces a new sort of challenge while he builds: the political fight. Democrats slammed Trump for focusing on his ballroom during the government shutdown, at a time when his administration was trying to stop the distribution of food stamps. Many of the donors, in response to requests from congressional Democrats, have defended their involvement, according to more than two-dozen letters reviewed by CNN. “This would be a perfect night to have that ballroom open,” he added.</p>

Fox News Digital pressed Democratic lawmakers on whether the shutdown was worth it and if Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer did enough to hold the line. On the heels of a historic 43-day government shutdown, Democrats are facing tough questions about whether the record-breaking standoff was worth it, and whether Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave up too soon. After failing to secure the healthcare subsidies they demanded, and with several senators breaking ranks to join Republicans in reopening the government — a move widely seen as a black eye on Schumer's leadership — Senate Democrats continued to blame President Donald Trump and the GOP for the shutdown when pressed by Fox News Digital. "They promised that there will be a vote on extending the healthcare subsidies. If they fail to provide that vote, or if the vote fails, they should be held accountable. The U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., is seen on Nov. 5, 2025. Blumenthal charged that it was Republicans who "forced the false choice between reopening the government and affordable health insurance," which he said has been "viewed reprehensibly by the American people, and rightly so." Like many of his Democratic colleagues, the Connecticut senator sidestepped a question about whether Schumer could have done more to hold the line on negotiations. Seven Democratic senators, including one independent who caucuses with them, and six House Democrats voted to reopen the government last week, without extending the pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that Democrats had pushed for since the shutdown began on Oct. 1. The intraparty revolt has exposed a widening rift between Democratic leadership and its left flank, as progressive candidates accused Schumer of surrendering leverage to Republicans in exchange for a funding deal that left key healthcare priorities unresolved. We have SNAP recipients, millions of SNAP recipients across the country whose access to food stability was imperiled, and we have to figure out what that was for," Ocasio-Cortez said last week, before adding, "We cannot enable this kind of cruelty with our cowardice." Back on Capitol Hill this week, Democrats were less willing to blame Schumer for the Democrats who broke ranks, instead blaming Republicans for the ultimatum. When asked if the shutdown was worth it, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, told Fox News Digital that Democrats "should absolutely continue fighting for healthcare." And Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., said, "I don't think you can look at a shutdown from that kind of perspective" of whether it was worth it. "I think what's absolutely clear is that Republicans now own this healthcare crisis," McBride added. "Americans very clearly understand that it was Republicans who are stopping at nothing to prevent a vote on the Affordable Care Act tax credit, including having been willing to shut down the government." Senator Alex Padilla, D-Calif., speaks during a news conference in Washington, D.C., on June 11, 2025. Democrats who spoke to Fox News Digital said they hoped the government isn't headed for another shutdown but maintained that the party should continue to fight for healthcare guarantees. While the government reopened last week, the stopgap funding bill only keeps federal spending at current fiscal-year-2025 levels through Jan. 30 to give Congress more time to negotiate a longer-term appropriations package for fiscal year 2026. If Congress can't reach a consensus, the government could be headed toward another shutdown. As part of a backroom deal to reopen the government, Senate Democrats were promised a separate vote on extending healthcare subsidies. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., attends day 2 of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, on Aug. 20, 2024. "I certainly hope we'll avoid another government shutdown, but, again, Republicans promised a vote on extending the healthcare tax credit subsidies. If they fail to provide that vote, or if the vote fails, they'll be to blame. Elizabeth Warren, Kristen Gillibrand and Elissa Slotkin did not respond to Fox News Digital's question about whether the shutdown was worth it, and their offices did not immediately respond to further inquiries. "Democrats shut down the government and inflicted great pain on the American people because they wanted to use struggling families as ‘leverage' for their far left agenda," Jackson told Fox News Digital. "President Trump defeated their absurd gambit and delivered yet another win to the American people, but it's alarming that even after their ploy failed, Democrats still can't admit their shutdown hurt the American people," she added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spanish singer-songwriter Rosalía appears at the Christian Dior Spring/Summer 2025 collection presented in Paris on Sept. 24, 2024. Rosalía appears at the 24th annual Latin Grammy Awards in Seville, Spain, on Nov. 16, 2023. Rosalía appears at The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute benefit gala in New York on May 5, 2025. BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — And Rosalía said, “Let there be Lux.” Rosalía, the global Spanish pop star loved by millions for fusing flamenco with Latin hip-hop and reggaeton, has amazed her fans with a radical shift. The singer and songwriter's new album, “Lux” (“Light” in Latin), is unabashedly spiritual. Xabier Gómez García, bishop of Sant Feliu de Llobregat which includes Rosalía's hometown of Sant Esteve Sesrovires near Barcelona, was one of the first church leaders to laud her work in an open letter to his flock. Rosalía's grandmother regularly attends mass in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, according to the diocese. In an interview with The Associated Press, Gómez said that while some of her songs were “provocative,” Rosalía “speaks with absolute freedom and without hang-ups about what she feels God to be, and the desire, the thirst (to know God).” From her opening lyrics sung over piano and mournful cello, “Who could live between the two/ First love the world and later love God,” Rosalía announces that this album is a rupture from its Grammy-winning predecessors. “El mal querer (¨The Bad Loving” in Spanish) and “ Motomami " had established Rosalía as one of the leading artists in the Spanish music world with her experimental urban beats. It has four songs in Spotify's Top 50 global chart for this week, more than any artist, including Taylor Swift. She said that she was guided by the concept that “an artist doubts less of his vocation when he works in the service of God than when he works in the service of him or herself.” Rosalía apparently has not had a revelatory “come-to-Jesus” moment common among evangelical believers in America. Like many Spaniards, she grew up in a once staunchly Catholic Spain that has quickly secularized in recent decades, especially among the younger generations, leaving churches mostly to elderly parishioners. Even her early music flirted with medieval religious poetry, including one video clip from 2017 when she set a poem by 16th-century Spanish poet Saint John of the Cross to music. While embracing Catholic symbols and expressing a fascination with female saints, Rosalía seems to eschew strictly organized practice and draws inspiration from other religions, as well. “Lux” responds to that diversity of interest, at one point quoting a Sufi poetess. Gone are the hip-hop fashion and long fake nails Rosalía sported only a few years ago when she took the Latin Grammys by storm. Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça, prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Culture and Education, told Spanish news agency EFE this month that Rosalía has detected a wider dissatisfaction with the secular world. “When a creator like Rosalía speaks of spirituality,” he said, “it means that she captures a profound need in contemporary culture to approach spirituality, to cultivate an inner life.” “She has succeeded in making popular music with very deep cultural roots,” Oton told the AP. “Lux” can be intimidating for listeners, both due to its elaborate orchestration and smattering of esoteric lyrics that Rosalía was inspired to write after reading medieval mystical poets and their accounts of undergoing a transformative union with God through deep prayer and meditation. In “Divinize,” Rosalía sings of the “divina buidor” (“divine emptiness” in Catalan), a central concept of medieval mysticism which focused on how the soul must experience abandonment to open a space where God can enter. Victoria Cirlot, professor of humanities at Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University and expert in medieval feminine mystical tradition, liked “Lux” for its ability to introduce complex religious concepts to the general public, while noting it is “a minimalist” sample of the mystical tradition. But, for Cirlot, it's the entire package that makes “Lux” so impactful. “Rosalía is not just a great singer; she is a great actress, and her body language is full of these mystical gestures like contorting her face in an expression of ecstasy, of staring into nothing,” Cirlot said. “And then we have her amazing voice, which creates a sense of flight.”</p>

Minnesota Timberwolves forward Julius Randle reacts after scoring against the Phoenix Suns during the first half of an NBA Cup basketball game, Friday, Nov. 21, 2025, in Phoenix. PHOENIX (AP) — The Minnesota Timberwolves had an eight-point lead with less than minute to go Friday night, talking a little smack to their opponents as a hard-fought, chippy game between Western Conference rivals came to a close. There was one problem: The Phoenix Suns weren't done. “They were talking too early and I love that, when guys get too confident,” Suns forward Dillon Brooks said. Here's how the unexpected happened: Minnesota pushed ahead 113-105 with after Donte DiVincenzo hit his second free throw with 1:09 left. A few seconds later, Gillespie stole the in-bounds pass and Brooks found Jordan Goodwin for a 3-pointer, slicing the lead to 113-110. “We're just super competitive, winners and want to play winning basketball,” Gillespie said. Brooks stole Julius Randle's pass on the next possession, Goodwin followed with a quick layup and it was suddenly 113-112 with 21.4 seconds. Edwards missed two free throws with 12.7 seconds, setting up a final shot for the Suns. “We lost our minds, poor execution, turnovers, obviously, and just didn't stay locked-in during the last 90 seconds,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. Randle's 3-pointer at the buzzer was off the mark, setting off a wild celebration as teammates mobbed Gillespie. “The person (Randle) who was talking too much had two turnovers — and missed a shot,” Brooks said. Picked by many pundits to be one of the worst teams in the NBA, the Suns have a 10-6 record and are earning a reputation as a hard-nosed team that might be quite a bit better than expected. Phoenix was able to win despite a tough game for Booker, who finished with 16 points on 4-of-18 shooting and a season-high nine turnovers. “Just tough, gritty, competitive, together and selfless, that's what we've seen from this group from day one,” first-year coach Jordan Ott said. “Whatever it takes, whenever takes, whoever is out there, just find a way to outscore the opponent. “These wins are big for our group and what we're doing, but it doesn't stop.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has terminated temporary protected status for all Somalis in Minnesota, he announced on Friday evening. The Truth Social announcement followed a City Journal report alleging millions of Minnesota taxpayer dollars were stolen in a fraud scheme and fell into the pockets of the Somali-based al Shabaab terrorist group. “Minnesota, under Governor Waltz (sic), is a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity. I am, as President of the United States, hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota. The City Journal investigation found what authors Ryan Thorpe and Christopher F. Rufo called a “Minnesota drowning in fraud.” “Federal counterterrorism sources confirm that millions of dollars in stolen funds have been sent back to Somalia, where they ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,” the report reads. Trump did not provide any details on how his announced plan would unfold, or explicitly connect his Truth Social post to the report. As of March 31, 705 Somalis were covered by temporary protected status in the U.S., according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data reported to the Congressional Research Service. Tim Walz (D-MN) did not respond to the Washington Examiner‘s request for comment, which was after regular business hours.</p>

Criminal defense attorney Josh Ritter joins 'Fox & Friends' reacting to an 18-year-old convicted of raping two girls sentenced to a year of rehab instead of prison, sparking outrage and questions about the DA and judge's decision. Friday – A convicted sex offender freed from prison two weeks ago allegedly posed as a doctor and sexually assaulted a student inside an Arizona elementary school, sparking outrage and calls for answers from parents, according to reports. Abel Kai Gblah, 25, is accused of sexual assault and kidnapping after he accessed school grounds and posed as a doctor to lure a student into a classroom and assaulted her at Orangewood Elementary School on Nov. 19, according to the Phoenix Police Department (PPD). PPD officials said in a statement to Fox News Digital that officers were called to the school after administrators reported that an incident had occurred on campus. "When officers arrived, they learned an unauthorized man had made it onto school grounds and lured a grade-school-aged girl into a classroom where he sexually assaulted her," police said. He then ran from the scene before officers arrived." Abel Kai Gblah was accused of sexually assaulting and kidnapping a student at a Phoenix elementary school on Nov. 19. FOX 10 Phoenix reported that court documents show Gblah allegedly drew the attention of a student by impersonating a doctor and expressing that he had to examine her. After fleeing the school, police located Gblah, who was booked into jail on multiple charges. Gblah was released from prison two weeks ago on similar charges, according to the outlet, and was also allegedly involved in human smuggling across the U.S. border. Abel Kai Gblah was arrested this week after allegedly sexually assaulting a student at a Phoenix elementary school. The news station reported that the Washington Elementary School District said in a statement that school administration immediately called 911 and placed the school on lockdown for over an hour. "He was on campus for approximately 10 minutes and during that time, he made inappropriate contact with a student," the district wrote. The district shared a separate statement with Fox News Digital that it released to parents on Friday, which revealed the results of its internal investigation, including that Gblah was a former student of the school who attended from 2012 to 2015. Abel Kai Gblah allegedly assaulted a student at Orangewood Elementary School in Phoenix on Nov. 19. While initial reports indicated that the Gblah gained access to the campus behind a student who had buzzed in, further investigation revealed that he entered through an unlocked lobby door, and walked in with a tardy student, the district stated. "We understand how alarming this situation has been and want you to know that we are reviewing every aspect of our safety procedures and communication to ensure that an event like this does not happen again, wrote Orangewood Elementary Principal Emily Paterson. According to FOX 10, Gblah is being held on a cash-only bond of $500,000, with a preliminary hearing scheduled for Dec. 1. Michael Sinkewicz is a writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO) shared an audio recording of several graphic, violent threats he has received in the wake of President Donald Trump suggesting Crow's actions of urging U.S. military members to “refuse illegal orders” were punishable by death. Crow was among six Democratic lawmakers who recorded a video calling for service members to disobey illegal orders. Trump responded on Truth Social, suggesting the death penalty should be used against them, writing, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” On Friday evening, Crow posted a compiled audio recording of violent threats, among which people have called for his death and the death of his family, that he has received this week. The callers called Crow a “worthless f***ing traitor” and “scum,” but reached far more graphic extents. I pray they die a painful death,” one of the threats against Crow said. “Trump called for my arrest, prosecution, and execution. All Americans must condemn this political violence,” Crow said. In response to the Washington Examiner‘s request for comment, the White House pointed the publication to Trump and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's comments from today. Today's a different world,” Trump said on Fox News's Brian Kilmeade Show. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ), and Reps. Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Chris Deluzio (D-PA), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), and Crow — urged military personnel to “refuse illegal orders.” They said “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home.” “These are people that, in my opinion, broke the law,” Trump said. “Now what happens to them, I can't tell you.”</p>

More than 500 Chinese drones confiscated by Florida officials will be used for military target practice for evaluation and training. Instead of torching the machines, the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) will shoot them down with shotguns, according to Bloomberg News. The quadcopter drones will be used over the course of three days next month to train elite U.S. troops on how to take out enemy drones. More than 500 Chinese drones confiscated by Florida officials will be used for military target practice for evaluation and training. The Military Drone Crucible training event is scheduled for Dec. 4-6 at Camp Blanding, according to the U.S. National Drone Association's (USNDA) website. The event will feature training sessions focused on clearing a room with opposing troops present and striking an enemy convoy. The Military Drone Crucible training event will take place Dec. 4-6 at Camp Blanding. "It will be the largest counter-drone destruction event ever held in the United States," USNDA President Nate Ecelbarger told Bloomberg News. To date, the largest drone destruction event was held in September, when an electromagnetic weapon was used to take down 49 drones at Camp Atterbury in Indiana, according to Axios. Navy SEALs, Marines and Army Rangers participated in the Indiana event for training purposes. Earlier this year, the Trump administration cut red tape to allow mass drone production to compete with Russian and Chinese drone programs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Homeland Security has been awarding a number of federal contracts for just under $100,000, after Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to review contracts of six figures and more personally. On June 11, Noem vowed to review and consider department proposals upwards of $100,000. Since then, DHS has authorized 11 federal contracts for between $99,999.00 and $99,999.99, starting on Aug. 14. “All proposals for my consideration must include all relevant details, including any mission impact, dollar values, description of the supplies or services any timeline issues, and a description of the proposed action,” Noem wrote in the June memo. Prior to Aug. 14, no other DHS contracts were awarded for between $99,999.00 and $99,999.99 in 2025. The POGO analysis pointed to an August New York Times report that showed Noem's sign-off rule caused a delay in “mission critical” contracts. Under Secretary Noem's leadership, DHS is rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and is reprioritizing appropriated dollars — saving taxpayers more than $13.2 billion in her first 7 months,” McLaughlin said. According to available online federal spending data going back to 2007, no administration's DHS has ever awarded 11 or more federal contracts within the one-dollar range in question. Former President Barack Obama's administration came the closest with nine awarded in 2013. President Donald Trump's first-term DHS only awarded two contracts within the $99,999.00 and $99,999.99 price range.</p>
