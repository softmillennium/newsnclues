                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While its mouth is closed, this artifact speaks volumes about the medieval past. Many ancient wooden structures have been lost to time, as wood unfortunately decomposes quickly. And recently, archaeologists from Nicolaus Copernicus University (NCU) discovered a striking example of that preservation—a 1,000-year-old wooden face during an underwater research expedition. The team recently presented its findings at a press conference. This isn't the first face of its kind to be discovered. Similar depictions have been found in other Slavic cities including Wolin, Novgorod the Great, and Staraya Ladoga. According to experts, consistencies between these finds suggest that the beam found at Lednica reflects a local artistic and spiritual tradition, rather than Scandinavian or Rus influence. “This discovery not only evokes admiration for the craftsmanship from over a thousand years ago but also opens a fascinating discussion about the spiritual life of early medieval Slavs,” Andrzej Pydyn, director of the Centre for Underwater Archaeology at NCU, said in the press release. The researchers also discovered horse jaws and bones around ramparts, which may have come from ritual offerings or protective sacrifices, Mateusz Popek from NCU said. The team also found similar bones underneath houses. “The [wood] face is a priceless monument and a rare example of an item combining utility and symbolic functions,” a post from the Museum of the First Piasts in Lednica reads.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google Translate isn't going to help here. Archaeologists discovered a basalt tablet about the size of a piece of paper bearing 60 unknown script characters expertly etched onto its surface in the Bashplemi Lake region of Georgia—the same site where some scientists believe the first European, a 1.8-million-year-old hominin, was discovered. According to a study published in the Journal of Ancient History and Archaeology, the tablet—which measured 9.4 inches by 7.9 inches—was made from local vesicular basalt and featured seven rows of writing. “While the basalt on which it is based is known to be of local origin, its meaning is unknown, and there remains a long way to go to decipher it.” Some symbols may have taken inspiration from early Caucasian scripts—whether that be Georgian Mrglovani or Albanian alphabets—but there also seem to be ties to Proto-Kartvelian, Near East Phoenician, Proto-Sinaitic scripts. But without a direct link to any other known pattern of writing, this new find could be a completely unknown language. But there are also likenesses to Bronze Age Georgian symbols, including “some similarities with Phoenician, Aramaic, and Greek alphabets [that] are not surprising as their role in the region and their relations to local scripts are well-known.” Speculation on what it all means—the authors hypothesize that the writing could explain “military spoils, an important construction project, or an offering to a deity”—is all anyone has to go on for now.

Those leaps are daunting, given that President Donald Trump is once again pulling the U.S. out of the accord and that countries such as China and Saudi Arabia are also still trying to keep fossil fuels in the energy mix. China, however, is rapidly overtaking the U.S. as a renewable energy powerhouse, and solar and wind have seen exponential gains globally in recent years.

Amanda Montañez; Source: Copernicus Climate Change Service (1900–2024 data); World Meteorological Organization (2025 projection) Every year since 1970—more than half a century—temperatures have been above this average and soaring upward. Today it is around 1.3 degrees C. (In 2024—the hottest year on record—the planet was more than 1.5 degrees C, but the Paris agreement looks at the average over many years. It's still a steep challenge to follow through even on the Paris road map, however—and its goals permit some spewing of carbon pollution into the atmosphere. “Until global emissions are at net zero,” Samaras says, “the climate outcomes of tomorrow are going to be worse than today.” Amanda Montañez; Source: “Ten Years of the Paris Agreement: The Present and Future of Extreme Heat,” Climate Central and World Weather Attribution (data) Those climate outcomes could be dire, though not as dire as those that would occur on our pre-Paris track. New research shows that with around four degrees C of warming, U.S. residents would see some 118 more extremely hot days than would occur under a preindustrial climate by the end of the century. If we can limit global warming to 1.3 degrees C, the U.S. will see just 58 such days per year on average. Of course, even if we follow through on current commitments, there will be climate consequences regardless. Other climate-fueled disasters, including droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones, are also increasing in frequency. A particular win has been that solar power facilities are coming online much faster than anyone expected in 2015. Better yet, energy from these facilities is being stored for nighttime use thanks to battery technology that was nonexistent when the Paris Agreement was signed. “Batteries is really the miracle story here,” Samaras says. Now we need a similar miracle story for sectors such as transportation, agriculture, industry and land use. “I hope that we can revisit this in 10 years and be able to say that the Paris Agreement started a rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,” Samaras says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Around 115 million years ago, the waters north of Australia supported a massive shark that can be viewed as an early relative of the creatures made famous by "Jaws." Newly examined fossils show that modern sharks began developing extremely large body sizes far earlier in their evolutionary timeline than scientists once thought. The research introduces a broad, interdisciplinary effort to track how shark size changed through deep time. Modern sharks trace their roots back more than 400 million years, yet the branches that eventually produced today's species originated during the Age of Dinosaurs. The oldest fossils representing these modern lineages date to about 135 million years ago. These early sharks, known as lamniforms, were small and may have measured only around 1 m (~3 feet) in length. Over millions of years they evolved into much larger forms, including the enormous 'Megalodon', which may have exceeded 17 m (56 feet), and the modern Great White shark, an apex-predator that reaches about 6 m (20 feet). Because sharks possess skeletons made of cartilage, their bodies rarely fossilize. These teeth commonly appear in sedimentary rocks alongside the bones and teeth of fishes and the giant marine reptiles that dominated many prehistoric ocean ecosystems. Numerous remains of ancient marine life have been uncovered here, including plesiosaurs (long-necked marine reptile resembling the popular image of the Loch Ness monster), ichthyosaurs ('fish-lizards'), and large bony fish. Five vertebrae have been recovered, each partly mineralized, which helped preserve them. Their structure is almost identical to that of today's Great White shark. To determine the body size of this early modern shark mega-predator, a team of researchers from multiple fields collaborated on a detailed analysis. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team at Mass General Brigham has released new evidence directly comparing how well tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound) and semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) protect the heart. Earlier studies had already shown that semaglutide lowers the likelihood of major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. What had remained uncertain was whether tirzepatide, another widely used treatment for type 2 diabetes, offers similar protection. To investigate this, researchers examined national health insurance claims and compared cardiovascular outcomes among nearly one million adults using tirzepatide, semaglutide, or other type 2 diabetes therapies. However, not all questions can be answered using this time- and resource-intensive method," said first author Nils Krüger, MD, a research fellow in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine. "Data generated in clinical practice and used secondarily for research allow us to address a wide range of clinically relevant questions time- and resource-effectively -- when applied correctly. Moreover, we can study patients who reflect the reality of everyday clinical care, in contrast to the highly selected participants of randomized experiments." The results showed measurable cardiovascular benefits among people with type 2 diabetes who were at higher risk for heart-related complications. When compared with sitagliptin, a diabetes medication known to have a neutral effect on cardiovascular outcomes, semaglutide lowered the combined risk of heart attack and stroke by 18 percent. Tirzepatide produced a 13 percent reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death when compared with dulaglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been on the market for many years. Since these medications are relatively new, scientists continue to investigate how they protect the heart, especially in studies that directly compare tirzepatide and semaglutide. Krüger noted that "According to recently presented database analyses by the respective manufacturers, each company's own drug appears to reduce cardiovascular risk much more effectively than the competitor's." He added, "However, our study found only small differences between tirzepatide and semaglutide in cardiovascular protection among populations at risk of adverse events, underscoring that both agents provide protective benefit and could be integrated into clinical cardiovascular practice." "We hope that our study will help clinicians better understand how these new medications work in clinical practice. Our transparent and open science practices, including pre-registration of a public protocol and shared analytic code, are designed to support scientific discussion," said last author Shirley Wang, PhD, an associate epidemiologist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine.
