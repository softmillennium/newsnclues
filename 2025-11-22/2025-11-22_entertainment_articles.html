As bad as a scene can get in a movie that would work way better if the conflict was worse, the Underground Yellow Brick Road still seems like some ham-fisted symbolism, don't you think? From Universal's “Wicked: For Good,” that ridiculous moment comes midway through the second half of director Jon M. Chu's epic musical blockbuster. It features a crowd of subjugated animals, so oppressed by their human overlords that they have been magically stripped of the ability to speak and forced to flee Oz on foot (or hoof). That adapted American history lesson plays clumsily on the big screen, and even still, “For Good” doesn't feel dramatic or important enough. Related Stories Some of the Trickiest Effects in ‘Predator: Badlands' Have Nothing to Do with Beast Hunts Don't Be Fooled — ‘Wicked: For Good' Starts and Ends in an Ariana Grande-Obsessed Dystopia In theaters now, Chu's highly anticipated follow-up to last year's “Wicked” meets and at times even exceeds expectations when it comes to providing sparkly spectacle. Chu's two “Wicked” movies are based on Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman's long-running Broadway musical from 2003, which in turn loosely adapts author Gregory Maguire's bleak 1995 novel, “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.” Across page, stage, and screen, each version feels different from the rest. “For Good” loses the taut playfulness that made the earlier “Wicked” snap by attempting to pit Elphaba and Glinda against an enemy that's often unseen and perpetually nondescript. Frequently compared to dystopian touchstones like Margaret Atwood's “The Handmaid's Tale,” Maguire's painstaking literary text was right there for Chu's inspiration. It's got creepy dolls hiding deep-state surveillance tech; Holocaust-like experiments performed on fluffy victims; the pervasive sense that anything and everything in Oz could be waiting to ensnare Elphaba like its Big Brother in “1984.” And yet, “For Good” doggedly shies away from the darkness — something these witches needed if Chu wanted their tortured connection to really sing a second time. In her review, IndieWire's Kate Erbland explained how the year-long intermission between “Wicked” and “For Good” made the second movie not only more disorienting but harder to connect with emotionally. That disconnect might have been alleviated with a stronger first scene. This alternate beginning doesn't have to be seriously “scary” but it should at least show who in Oz is being hurt by the ruling class and why. Opening on a forgettable brick-laying sequence — in which some horned cow-things, who could talk probably at one point but can't now and are having a bad time working their jobs in construction… or something? — “For Good” needed a harder rock bottom to successfully set up peril and unrest in Emerald City as tangible threats suggesting a hidden dystopia. Instead, “For Good” feels like it comes out of nowhere. Chu fails to explain the magic lurking behind those cow-things' eyes, and Elphaba makes an outsized display of riding in on her broom to save them from what looks like basically a crappy workday sans context. The central conflict is illuminated only marginally better when Elphaba's sister Nessa (Marissa Bode), now a corrupt governor, passes a law forbidding her Munchkin prisoner, Boq (Ethan Slater), from traveling later in the movie. and exercising more restraint than they need when Boq becomes the Tin Man. That scaredy-cat ethos carries through a number of other scenes: some that do show animals locked in cages but remain ambiguous and inoffensive enough for the idea to miss most children. In the first half of “Wicked,” the former Shiz University professor lost his ability to speak during a horrifying classroom scene that recalls all those nightmarish Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons we saw go wrong in Harry Potter. Dr. Dillamond is even more important in Maguire's book, and his political assassination (yes, that goat gets straight-up murdered, bro!) serves as an important political symbol and driving force behind Elphaba's radicalization. But if you're going to bother not keeping a recognizable victim around, and routinely use him as a visual reference to explain what Elphaba and Glinda do and don't know about the plot that's unfolding, then he deserves his due. But Chu needed to put a finer point on the societal transformation the Wicked Witch and her best friend gave up their friendship to create. Most painfully, Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) has his tragic Scarecrow evolution stretched over several scenes, before it concludes  in a romantic beat where body horror doesn't fit. But Dr. Dillamond doesn't even get to finish his arc between “Wicked” and “For Good,” as the duology, seemingly desperate to fill time at every other turn, makes the baffling choice to cast out the academic quadruped-like Animal. Despite Dinklage warmly promoting his small voice part in Chu's films, the “Wicked” movies ultimately decide Dr. Dillamond works better as a subplot that's seen but not heard in the back half. Amid all  the poppies and propaganda, you get a glimpse of his weary enlightened face. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Outside of her recent pivotal role in the final season of You, plus an upcoming appearance in Scream 7, Anna Camp is taking her onscreen career into her own hands. “We're actually now deciding to go the independent route and just make eight episodes ourselves, which is really exciting,” she said at Friday's OUT100 celebration. “And we have a whole story and the whole bible all drawn out, and it just got so much buzz because I think the short itself is just so good. Camp added, “You have to create your own work, especially in this climate. There's less jobs and there's more actors fighting for those jobs, so it's hard and it's scary. So, that's what we're doing right now. The short centers on an ensemble of characters venturing towards a distant utopian dome in quest of a new beginning. “We were friends with Anna and she said she wanted to get more into producing,” Pfeffer told Deadline following its SXSW debut. “She loved the script and wanted to play the lead in it, Monica, but also said that we should build this out into something bigger, as a series, so it shifted gears towards more of an episodic piece and we created the pilot.” Matt and editor brother Mark Pfeffer were previously seeking a studio deal for the pilot, expressing doubt that the season could be completed independently.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Universal's Thanksgiving tentpole Wicked: For Good is now on course to open to a record-smashing $151 million-plus in North America and $228 million worldwide after topping Friday's North American chart with a massive $68.7 million from 4,115 theaters (that number includes $30.8 million in previews). A Comprehensive List of 'Wicked' and 'Wicked: For Good' Brand Collaborations 'Wicked: For Good' Zooms to Huge $30.8 Million in Box Office Previews If it hits its target, the female-fueled movie will shatter numerous opening records. Globally, Chu's film will likewise pass up Wicked to rank as the top launch ever for a Broadway adaptation. Lastly, it would pass up Superman to become the fourth-biggest opening of the year to date behind Jurassic World Rebirth, Minecraft and Lilo & Stitch. Wicked: For Good is a needed jolt for the struggling North American box office, which has suffered the worst fall in decades due to a glut of male-skewing pics and a lack of product for females and families. The movie's better-than-expected performance more than proves the buying power of girls and women; nearly 70 percent of Friday's audience were females. On the same weekend a year ago, the first Wicked likewise made history in its debut on its way to grossing nearly $750 million globally, a record showing for a Broadway musical adaptation. Such adaptations have been a tough genre for Hollywood to crack, but NBCUniversal entertainment chief and longtime movie studio head Donna Langley has remained intent on doing just that, even after Cats bombed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeremy Renner is brushing off his recent harassment scandal with a smile. The Marvel star was spotted flashing a big grin while attending amfAR's second annual Las Vegas gala on Friday. The “Hurt Locker” actor, 54, was joined by his sister, Kym Renner — who serves as president and CEO of their RennerVation foundation, per Forbes — as they walked the red carpet together. The event, which was held at the Wynn hotel, marks the actor's first public appearance since Renner hit back at his former business partner Yi Zhou's harassment claims, calling them “inaccurate and untrue” in a statement given exclusively to Page Six. His lawyer Marty Singer went on to claim that Zhou was retaliating against his client after he “rejected her romantic advances” and did not promote her projects on social media. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Earlier this month, Zhou came forward with claims that the “Hawkeye” star started sending her “personal and intimate photographs of himself” after the two began messaging each other in June. “When I called him out privately about his past misconduct and asked him to behave properly, to respect me as a woman and as a filmmaker, he threatened to call immigration/ICE on me, an act that deeply shocked and frightened me,” Zhou claimed. The filmmaker also claimed to have “a collection” of explicit images and “porn gifs” that Renner allegedly sent her via WhatsApp. She told the outlet that Renner “found new love” with her after his near-fatal snow plow accident in 2023.</p>

He was best known for being a founding member of The Time, a band closely associated with Prince. Following his sudden passing, tributes are pouring in. Johnson's family confirmed the sad news that he had passed away on the night of November 21 to TMZ. Johnson has a strong legacy with The Time. One account on X wrote, “We are shocked & saddened to hear of Jellybean Johnson's sudden passing. To know that this amazing personality will no longer randomly show up (like here on @recordstoreday 2023) to light up the store & talk music and life and Minneapolis Sound Museum with us is heartbreaking.💔” Jellybean Johnson, drummer for The Time and The Family, who also appeared on and produced tracks by Alexander O'Neal, Cherelle, Janet Jackson, Nona Hendryx, Mint Condition, New Edition, and Karyn White.” Another fan reminisced on his legacy, saying, “Man, I was just revisiting some of my Morris Day and The Time favorites last weekend. Another person stated, “Wow, this really hurts to post this about my big brother Jellybean from Morris Day and The Time…Rest In Peace Garry “Jellybean” Johnson.” The tributes continued as someone else posted on X with photos of Johnson.

On November 20, the country music icon revealed that her miniature horses, Sugar Pie and Adrianna, had passed away on the same day. “My sweet little nuggets Sugar Pie and Adrianna crossed over the rainbow bridge today,” she wrote. “I've had 18 years with these littles and I can't tell you how much joy they brought me.” She and her husband, Brendan McLoughlin, live on a 400-acre farm with many other animals. In her closing message, she addressed Sugar Pie and Adrianna directly. One fan wrote, “All horses go to heaven. May they run fast and free up there.” Another follower commented, “I am sure you gave them the best life ever.” Lambert did not share further details about their passing, but her emotional tribute showed how deeply she is grieving.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: BBC director general Tim Davie has been quietly drawing up plans to save up to £100M ($131M) a year by radically reimaging the UK national broadcaster's operations, Deadline can reveal. Davie and a small team of executives have been working on Project Ada, a transformation plan that will shrink the BBC's workforce so that the corporation can invest in digital resources and content. 'Strictly Come Dancing' Star Arrested On Suspicion Of Rape Named after Ada Lovelace, the pioneering 19th-century British mathematician, the project could result in thousands of non-content jobs — including HR, finance, legal, and operations — being outsourced to private sector companies. Although Project Ada is well advanced and has board support, no final decisions have been made on redundancies. Details are sketchy, but the unit is being referred to internally as BBC Media Tech, with sources suggesting that investment could be unlocked if it were unleashed on the private sector. News of the transformation strategy will likely heighten unease among BBC staff at a turbulent time following the shock resignation of Davie earlier this month. Detractors have described Project Ada as “privatization by stealth” and complained that the work has soaked up so much of Davie's time that he has taken his eye off editorial crises, including the Donald Trump Panorama edit, which led to his resignation. There is also a feeling that the BBC should be focused on charter renewal talks with the government instead of contemplating a radical reorganization. “We can't ask for more public money if we are not getting our own house in order,” said a source. Davie has already gone further than many of his predecessors in reducing the BBC's public service workforce. He has cut 2,000 employees (roughly 10% of the workforce) over the past five years, with savings worth hundreds of millions being reinvested into higher-paid jobs with a digital focus. Davie's allies said this was a notable part of his legacy, and Project Ada is another step in the same direction. The BBC has not outlined the transformation proposals to employees in any meaningful way, but work has been ongoing for many months. Alongside Davie, chief operating officer Leigh Tavaziva is driving the change. The Guardian said offshoring jobs was being considered, but BBC chiefs have been rowing back from this notion in talks with unions, saying jobs will be kept in the UK. In April, the BBC board considered an agenda item titled “Consolidated Group Business Services,” which was pitched as a “significant opportunity” to “transform” the broadcaster's “operating model and cost base” and allow it to deliver “future strategic goals.” Board members approved the plans in principle, per published minutes. Then in September, the BBC published a “market engagement notice,” through which it sought input from potential suppliers who have helped companies “modernise core business services at pace” using “cloud, automation, data, and AI.” The notice, a step towards a formal procurement process, added: “We want to learn from those who've navigated digital disruption, built smarter operations, and reimagined services to meet changing audience and workforce needs using new technology, streamlining processes, and forming new partnerships.” Davie himself also gestured at the plans in a speech in May, saying the BBC is looking to partner with tech players to improve the “media supply chain” that gets content from camera to screen. Sources said Davie's vision has faced opposition internally amid fears that the changes are high risk and low reward. One person told Deadline that O'Kane had concerns about the proposals, though a second person said there can be multiple reasons why people leave a job.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Olivia Dean has criticized major ticketing companies after fans flagged steep resale prices for seats on her newly announced Art of Loving Live tour. In her first post, she told fans her team was “looking into” unexpected resale activity and warned followers to be cautious of comment-section sellers, calling many of them potential scams. Which New Music Release Is Your Favorite This Week? Taylor Swift on Ice: Olympic Figure Skaters Share Mesmerizing Routine Set to 'Fate of Ophelia' “I'm sorry that there seems to be an issue with ticket re-selling and pricing,” she wrote. Please be wary of buying tickets in the comment sections as it is most likely a scam.” She continued, “@ticketmaster @livenation @aegpresents you are providing a disgusting service. The prices at which you're allowing tickets to be re-sold is vile and completely against our wishes. Fans on social media reported long virtual queues and verified tickets appearing at significantly higher prices on secondary-market sites shortly after on-sale. Listings varied by city, with some resale amounts reaching several hundred dollars above face value. Ticketmaster acknowledged Dean's comments by reposting her Instagram story and stating it would cap resale on its platform at face value. “We support artists' ability to set the terms of how their tickets are sold and resold. Her sophomore album The Art of Loving debuted at No. Dean announced her 2026 tour last week, celebrating a major career milestone that includes her first headlining date at Madison Square Garden, as well as performing at Australia's 2025 ARIA Awards.

On Friday nights, IndieWire After Dark honors fringe cinema in the streaming age with midnight movies from any moment in film history. First, the BAIT: a weird genre pick, and why we're exploring its specific niche right now. The actor parodies himself twice in this baffling 32-minute mockumentary, born from a Twitter conversation with writer John Levenstein, about a tortured man (Harbour), his late father (Harbour), and a made-for-TV play that holds the key to their relationship. Related Stories How the ‘Andor' Team Essentially Made Four Movies at Once for Season 2 ‘Hazbin Hotel' Is Thinking About the Future “I don't know if it's risen to cult status yet, but I think it has minor cult status because the people who are fans of it are so passionate,” Levenstein told IndieWire in a recent interview. “Stranger Things” Season 3 arrived on the platform two weeks before “Frankenstein‘s Monster's Monster, Frankenstein,” and the sci-fi series' return immediately broke records at Netflix. Harbour wasn't quite the nuclear box-office engine we know today. “There was something about doing something purely for the joy of it, for no money, exactly the way I wanted to,” Levenstein said. Directed by Daniel Gray Longino, “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein” is the sort of passion project you'd associate with the pandemic today. It's low-budget, uses only a few locations, and despite the involvement of Alfred Molina (whom Harbour just… asked to be there? ), boasts a lesser-known cast that's wonderfully committed to the bit. The story he's putting on — for a network sponsored by Beef Wellington and a Russian lit joke you'll repeat for the rest of your life — contorts Mary Shelley's classic horror novel about a mad scientist and his creation into a wildly contrived academic research scam. She'll come across Molina, who plays sea captain and faux British acting legend Aubrey Fields; or David Harbour Jr.'s ailing mother (O-Lan Jones), who loves morphine and might actually be dying; a useless, nameless doctor (Heather Lawless) with one of the funniest lines in the special; and a young girl (Marion Van Cuyck) you'll only know as “THE NIECE.” A traumatized boy masquerading as a curious man, the second character played by the real Harbour needs a hug more than the services provided to him by the private investigator (Lidia Porto), forensic accountant (Randolph Thompson), and personal assistant/dramaturge (Graham Wagner) he hired to interrogate his father's legacy. But interviewing a couple of Hollywood folks on camera — the play's producer (Mary Woronov) and David Harbour Jr.'s old agent (the late Michael Lerner in his last role) — David Harbour III can't find the facts he needs to feel relief. With Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein” streaming on Netflix now, and “Stranger Things” Season 5 bringing the sci-fi series to a close next week, there's never been a better time to meet or reheat “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein.” It's only been six years since this delightful oddity was unleashed on the world — but so much has changed since 2019 that it already feels like a rare piece of pop culture history. So, he didn't go to Juilliard, huh? A quick search will tell you the real David Harbour is an Ivy League man. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1997 with a double major in drama and Italian, which explains not only the actor's palpable smarts on screen but his unending appreciation for autumnal wear in life. (Please note, however, that it does not account for the allegations made by Harbour's ex-wife Lily Allen in her new album, “West End Girl,” which I'd be remiss not to mention in fall 2025.) John Levenstein — the 66-year-old veteran comedy writer known for “Arrested Development,” “Silicon Valley,” and more — considers himself retired. You can't wrangle jokes this deranged without your brilliance showing. “I always try to make it not reliant on knowing what's being parodied, but I'm still a little afraid people won't get it,” Levenstein said. He considers “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein” personally important to his development as an artist, but he hasn't revisited it in a few years. “There's always a little bit of a fear with comedy that you might realize, ‘Oh, it wasn't really as funny as I thought. In my experience, talking to profoundly funny people can sometimes feel like contending with the lion and the den — all at once. Truly skilled comedians lure you into their gaping maw with a great premise, chew you up joke after joke, and spit back whatever's left as a puddle of giggles they'll forget. There's never been a midnight screening of “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein,” despite the project continuing to thrive almost exclusively on word of mouth. “I'm always a little bit afraid that if I remind Netflix it exists, they'll be like, ‘Oh yeah, that was a mistake. But asked if he would still like to explore the concept of a “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein” anthology — an idea he detailed for Mashable in 2019 — Levenstein said yes. “Comedy's a young man's game, and I'm pretty much just doing my own thing right now,” he said. “But I would still love to do the anthology. I would come out of retirement for it.” In “Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein,” Harbour delivers grief and fury with a subtle casualness that makes the whole affair feel strangely comfortable. His semi-surreal comedy stylings — again, he just fucking kills it here — might seem more like a Tim Robinson or Nathan Fielder sketch if it weren't for the writer's megawatt self-awareness. “I don't know why Netflix has never taken that step,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're starting to suspect that Netflix star Noah Centineo might be the adult acting equivalent of that one kid who was always a little bit of a problem when you were just trying to hang out and play with action figures. You know the one: He could never just be He-Man, or Donatello, or the one Thundercat whose head got chewed on by the dog too much to be any kind of recognizable: He also had to be whichever new action figure or toy had most recently hoved into view. How else to explain news that Centineo—whose previous castings in the IP space have included (a since discarded) leading role in Masters Of The Universe, and a Rambo prequel that's currently in the works, and that bizarre Street Fighter movie that's coming out in less than a year—is now circling a role in a live-action Gundam movie? How much poseable plastic does one guy need? This is per Deadline, which reports that Centineo (who made the transition from Nickelodeon actor to teen heartthrob with his work in Netflix's To All The Boys franchise) is being eyed to star in Legendary's live-action version of the long-running, ridiculously prolific Japanese mecha series. Said casting would put him hypothetically opposite Sydney Sweeney, whose name has been listed as being linked to the project for a few months now, and was supposedly in final negotiations at the time. No word on what specific plot points the film would take from the wider Gundam canon, which typically focuses on giant space-set robot fights that blend animated action with a healthy dose of melodrama, but god knows there's plenty to choose from. This film, specifically, has been in loose development since the early 2020s, originally with Centineo's old bosses at Netflix attached, but is currently being worked on solely at Legendary. No director or writer has been announced, but the studio is supposedly hoping to get production off the ground some time early in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a basic fact of TV production that it usually takes a lot longer to film events than it does for the time being depicted in your show to pass—something that's usually neither here nor there when working with adults, whose appearances tend to stay pretty static. (Give or take some catastrophic baldness as your cast members cruise toward 40.) But the existence of both time and puberty can be a lot trickier when you're working with kids, and especially kids like the cast of Stranger Things, who are supposed to be rooted at very particular points of the coming-of-age spectrum. At least, that's our assumption as outsiders; series showrunners Matt and Ross Duffer swear that managing their cast members' rapidly evolving appearances hasn't been nearly as fraught as you might think. The Duffers were talking to Variety about the show as it heads toward the premiere of the first part of its final season, a conversation that's largely about how the pair have gone from being two total introverts who frequently needed executive producer Shawn Levy (who they apparently refer to in their groupchat as “Warlock”) to solve problems for them, to experienced TV vets. But that does include figuring out, some time around the show's third season, that time was slipping away from them. “Coming to shoot Season 3 was shocking to me and Ross,” Matt Duffer notes, “And we had to quickly adjust the writing, because we had been writing them too young.” That's a full year.” (The fact that these 22 year-olds are still in high school, even after the 18-month timeskip that opens season 5, is obviously a little weirder, but that's working with child stars for you.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matthew McConaughey revealed that an erotic dream ultimately led him to the love of a lifetime in wife Camila Alves. “In my mid-30s, I was looking for a lifetime lover, a best friend, and a mother-to-be,” the “Dallas Buyers Club” star wrote in his newsletter “Lyrics of Living” on Friday, per Us Weekly. The “Magic Mike” actor, 56, divulged that in the dream, he saw an aged version of himself in a rocking chair on the porch of his home, where there were 22 women, 22 vehicles and 88 children. McConaughey recalled that he had fathered the 88 children, each representing a year of his life, as they gathered to celebrate his 88th birthday — though he hadn't married any of the 22 women. “Each woman was serene and satisfied,” he wrote, per the outlet. The Oscar winner said the “beautiful dream” reminded him that his goal in life was to become a father — but also helped him see he'd be fine without taking the plunge. “The red light vision of being a lifelong bachelor had come to me in a greenlight wet dream,” he wrote. He added, “So I quit looking for her.” It was after he gave up the dedicated search that wife Camila Alves, 42, came into his life, he wrote. “Three months later, I met Camila,” he divulged. “Twenty years later she's still the only woman I've ever wanted to take on a date, sleep with, or wake up next to.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. The longtime couple were first linked in 2006 after meeting at West Hollywood nightclub Hyde. In September, McConaughey revealed that it was actually his eldest son — then four — who helped convince the “How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days” star to marry Alves. McConaughey shared during an episode of Chris Williamson's “Modern Wisdom” podcast that Levi questioned why his mom and dad didn't share a last name. “I'm going through my head, ‘You're f–king 4, dude,'” the actor recalled. McConaughey said his son asked if he was “scared” to make the commitment, and admitted to himself that he was. McConaughey ultimately married Alves after seeking advice from a pastor and other “elder men” who were “married for decades,” he shared.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Charli, who once said she wants to make a “Lou Reed record,” might put it, that's art, baby. In her new Substack published Friday, Charli begins with a few clarifications. While she writes “being a pop star has its pros and cons like most jobs in this world,” she says, “I don't view what I do as a ‘job' and I secondly don't really view myself as purely a pop star, I'm just using that terminology specifically for this piece of writing.” Instead, she opts to describe herself “more as a ‘creative' (gross) or plain and simply put: an artist.” However, for the purposes of her essay, she focuses “purely on the the realities of being a pop star because it was my original dream, because it's the role in my life I have the most experience navigating and because it's also the most ridiculous one.” First, she addresses the obvious: being a pop star is “really fucking fun.” Charli proceeds to list off the benefits of the gig: parties in a black SUV and “all that cliche shit”; meeting interesting people and “those interesting people often actually want to meet you”; getting “free shit” such as phones, trips, clothes, and shroom gummies; entering restaurants through the back entrance with your best friends and smiling at the staff (who probably “hate you”); and hearing Addison Rae's “Diet Pepsi” before it's released. The Brat singer then moves on to the time spent “in transit,” likening a pop star's time spent traveling from one matter of business to another as feeling like a commodity inhabiting “strange and soulless liminal spaces.” She offers an example of when Rachel Sennott arrived to shoot a scene in Charli's upcoming mockumentary The Moment “bundled up with blankets and pillows and shipped directly to us like a package.” The public's perception of her a pop star has also caused Charli to “think about the person I used to be compared to the person I am now.” Old friends and family members have a way of humbling you, she points out; after asking Yung Lean whether he thought she had changed, he replied via text that while she's still the person he knew when they were younger, the “yes people” around her “blow smoke” up her ass. In ending her thoughts on the pop star life, she muses that while there is a “level of expectation for you to be entirely truthful all the time,” all her favorite artists are “absolutely not role models nor would I want them to be, but maybe that's just me.” She offers a link to Reeds' interview from the Seventies, before asking and answering: “Is it performance?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actor, who is already shooting Street Fighter for Legendary, is in talks to reteam with the company for its live-action, big budget adaptation of Gundam, the anime centered on giant robots known as mechas. Sydney Sweeney "Proud" of 'Christy' Biopic Despite Low Box Office Debut: "We Don't Always Just Make Art for Numbers" Sydney Sweeney Breaks Silence on American Eagle Jeans Uproar Gundam was originally an anime that began airing in 1979. The story is set in the Universal Century, an era in which people have emigrated to space colonies because of a growing population on Earth. Battles are fought by piloting robots known as mechas. The company was previously in talks with Outer Banks star Drew Starkey for the male lead but those talks never closed. In Gundam, her character and the male lead are, in the vein of Romeo & Juliet, on opposite sides of a war between planets who find a connection. Centineo made hearts all a flutter with To All the Boys I've Loved Before, Netlfix's romantic drama that launched a franchise for the streamer. He also played the superhero Atom Smasher in New Line's Black Adam and earlier this year was part of the ensemble for A24's war movie Warfare.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GloRilla has defeated a lawsuit that accused her of stealing a social media personality's viral catchphrase “all natural, no BBL” for her 2024 song “Never Find.” The federal copyright case was filed this summer by Natalie Henderson, aka @slimdabodylast on Instagram, who claims she coined the catchphrase referencing “Brazilian butt lift” surgery. Henderson says GloRilla (Gloria Woods) stole the phrase for her lyric “All natural, no BBL/ Mad hoes go to hell” on “Never Find,” a bonus track off her debut album Glorious. GloRilla's lawyers denied any infringement and argued that nobody can copyright a “cliched” expression like “all natural, no BBL.” But it doesn't look like a court will have to decide these substantive questions; Judge Lance M. Africk dismissed Henderson's lawsuit on Friday (Nov. 21) based on geographical technicalities. Henderson tried to argue that jurisdiction was established by GloRilla doing business in New Orleans, including by attending the 2025 Super Bowl and performing at the city's Smoothie King Center when she opened for Lil Baby's It's Only Us tour in 2023 and Megan Thee Stallion's Hot Girl Summer tour in 2024. “Plaintiff's claims do not arise out of or result from defendant Woods's concerts or personal appearances in Louisiana, particularly when plaintiff has not made any allegations that ‘Never Find' was ever performed in Louisiana,” wrote the judge. He noted that the song was available worldwide — and also pointed out a major hole in Henderson's argument. “Plaintiff relies on her counsel's purchase of a copy of defendant Woods's album Glorious on vinyl at a New Orleans record store as evidence that defendants ‘specifically targeted consumers in Louisiana,'” wrote the judge. “However, ‘Never Find' was not included on the vinyl that plaintiff's counsel purchased, as it was only released as a bonus track on an exclusive digital version of the album Glorious.” This isn't GloRilla's first time defeating a copyright infringement lawsuit. Another case, which alleged her hit songs “Tomorrow” and “Tomorrow 2” sampled a decades-old hip-hop track without permission, was also dismissed out of New Orleans federal court last year for jurisdictional reasons. GloRilla was sued again a year ago alongside Megan Thee Stallion, Cardi B and Soulja Boy for supposedly sampling the 2008 Plies song “Me & My Goons” without clearance on their collaboration “Wanna Be.” That case was voluntarily dropped in March.
