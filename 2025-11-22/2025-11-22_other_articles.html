                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Have you ever thought about the science and history of… wind? In this episode, Simon Winchester explains why eastbound flights are usually faster than flying west, and how the discovery of the jet stream was almost missed because the original research was published in Esperanto. He also talks about the debate over the Great Terrestrial Stilling—the idea that global wind speeds may be decreasing—and why newer measurements suggest the trend may be reversing. Winchester describes how and where the highest wind speed ever recorded was measured, the increasing frequency of clear-air turbulence (the kind that causes sudden drops during flights), why only one flag placed on the Moon fell, the techniques used by Polynesian navigators to cross vast stretches of ocean without instruments, and the challenges faced by early wartime pilots who unintentionally flew into the jet stream. His books have been New York Times bestsellers and have appeared on numerous best-of-the-year lists. Show your support with a tax-deductible donation and share the show with your friends and family.

Today marks the release of The Bookkeeper's Curse, a heartfelt paranormal romantic novella written for women who crave character-driven stories where love and personal transformation intertwine. Warm, atmospheric, and deeply human, this new release invites readers into a small town where time refuses to move—and two strangers must discover why.

The story follows Susan Mitchell, a devoted librarian whose life begins looping through the same Monday over and over. When Derek Stone arrives—haunted by a family history steeped in old magic—the two realize they are bound by a generations-old curse. Together, they dig into spellwork, long-buried journals, and painful family truths to uncover what real, non-possessive love truly requires.

Far from a typical paranormal tale, The Bookkeeper's Curse focuses on emotional honesty, healthy connection, and the courage it takes to rewrite the patterns that hold us back. Readers who enjoy genre-blended fiction—combining romance, mystery, witchcraft, and psychological depth—will find this novella especially resonant.

The Bookkeeper's Curse is available now on Amazon Select in EPUB for Kindle and library distribution.

For readers looking for a romantic story with heart, hope, and just the right touch of the supernatural, this novella offers an experience that lingers long after the final page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Kardashian is slamming psychics for reportedly incorrectly predicting her performance on the bar exam. Jenn Nizza, an ex-psychic who is now a Christian, told CBN News Kardashian is off-base and failing to understand the true issues unfolding in the psychic world. “She sees them as a pathological liar because the prediction didn't come true,” Nizza said. “But they're also lying when they're pretending to be her deceased father, and that's what I don't think that she understands.” Nizza said Kardashian and others don't realize that psychics get their information from demons. Nizza also addressed the fact that psychics are many times wrong, despite some predictions coming to fruition. “The predictions will not always be correct,” she said. Yes, just from the planting of seeds and self-fulfilling counterfeit prophecy, but demons are not God. Nizza continued, “So what happens is these demons will lie … they're lying spirits, and they'll pretend to be Robert Kardashian to hook Kim.” “You and I can make predictions, and I talk about this all the time with a high rate of accuracy, but we're not God,” Nizza said. The former medium warned that those who seek psychics so diligently end up finding themselves kept away from “the only way, truth and life, and his name is Jesus Christ.” Rather than walking in truth, she said these people end up “walking in the false light.” “You're trying to hold to the standards of the world, which is run by the devil, which is subjective, and you start overlapping sin after sin after sin, more New Age practices,” she said, warning that these practices can lead people to spiritual oppression or even possession.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a child of the 80s and 90s, pop culture was awash with extra-terrestrial sightings. “How can you be a kid watching movies like ET and Close Encounters, TV shows like The X Files, and not end up curious about whether or not we're alone in the universe?” he said in an interview with the Guardian. Farah's exposure to otherworldly beings in fiction kickstarted an interest that's now morphed into a professional quest, and the subject of his documentary debut The Age of Disclosure. It would be easy to assume this is the stuff of tin-foil hats and Reddit forums, and in some ways the documentary's pseudo-narrator, Luis Elizondo, could come across as a type of conspiracy theorist at first glance. But there's a reason why Farah gravitated towards Elizondo (who also serves as an executive producer on the film). He also claims there was a “powerful disinformation campaign” from the Department of Defense to discredit his work. Making a point to “only interview people who have direct knowledge” of these programs from working within the US government was a north star for Farah – who has served as a producer on several films, including Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One. “Everyone's names would be kept silent until it was done,” he said, noting that he only told documentary subjects about who had agreed to take part in order to make them comfortable. “We would make the movie in secrecy, so this information of who's in it would not get out there until we were done with this film, and these people I was approaching would have safety in numbers.” Farah also opted to make the film independently, unattached from a studio or streamer. “None of them would ever want to participate in a big commercial documentary,” Farah explained. His first big commitment came from Jay Stratton, one of the defense officials who started AATIP. After Stratton agreed to “break his silence” it had tremendous “ripple effects” on the rest of the film, and convinced others to come forward. When the current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, agreed to take part, that escalated things. “Then next thing you know, general Jim Clapper was participating,” Farah said of the former director of national intelligence under Barack Obama, who sat for an interview. They all offer brief summaries of their CVs, spell out that we are not alone, and why the American public ought to know more about it. “This [UAP] technology does stuff that we can't do, and if we can't figure out what it is or what it wants, or what it's being used for,” says a former director of aviation security at the National Security Council. The former chief scientist for AATIP claims that those who are tasked with ensuring information about UAPs doesn't leak “will use whatever tool they can find to try to convince people they shouldn't come forward”. Meanwhile a former defense official notes that if we're able to understand the technology that we're observing, it opens the door to so many “potentially beneficial impacts, including clean energy”. In many ways, Rubio offers one of the more convincing arguments. “But that begins to ramp out of control,” he notes, leading to a lack of transparency that might give US adversaries a head start by analyzing UAP technology. “Put yourself in the shoes of US government and military officials in the 40s,” Farah said, explaining that, fresh off a second world war victory, the Truman administration couldn't tell the American people that “we're in another conflict that we can't protect anyone from, because we don't even know anything about it”. He says this race escalated when the US found out that other countries, like Russia, were capturing and retrieving UAP technology. “Those people are supposed to be aware of significant information like this that has high stakes for us. In The Age of Disclosure, it's clear that there is little room for pushback or skepticism, particularly since there's not a single detractor in the film to serve as a foil to the plethora of resolute interviewees. “I think when people watch this movie, one of the realizations will be that the stigma around this topic is completely illogical and makes no sense and is not good for humanity,” he said. “We need the scientific community, not only in the United States, but in every nation, accepting the fact that this is a real situation, this is a valid area of inquiry, and that they should put their brain power towards learning about this and answering a lot of the big questions that remain.” He believes that “the strongest evidence” is “credible people putting their name and reputation on the line to tell you what they know at great risk”. “You could put a picture or a video of the most extraordinary thing on the cover of a major news publication or on major plants on TV, and half the human population would tell you they think it's AI or they think it's visual effects,” he said. As more people, like Elizondo and Stratton, speak out about their experiences, Farah hopes it will encourage more people who have been silenced in the past to attempt to reveal the truth. “For way too long, the public has been lied to, kept in the dark, completely misled by a heavily financed and very sophisticated disinformation campaign,” Farah said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"LOVE IS STRONGER THAN DEATH — AND JUST AS TERRIFYING!," The official synopsis from Dynamite Comics reads, "Sam and Dean Winchester know a thing or two about love and loss. The rampage that ensues embodies the true power of love — and only Sam and Dean can stop it!" From Sam and Dean Winchester's hilarious quips to Castiel's iconic lines, Supernatural is full of great dialogue. The solicit continues: "acclaimed comics and prose author Preeti Chhibber (Marvel's Avengers Assembly, Spider-Man's Social Dilemma) joins forces with hopelessly romantic artist Pasquale Qualano for this special 40-page love letter from the Winchester Brothers' early years - featuring unrequited cover art from Qualano, Cat Staggs, Reese Hannigan, and Meghan Hetrick, as well as a special PREMIUM MYSTERY OF LOVE BLIND BAG!" Dynamite Comics specifies that the "Blind Bag contains three limited editions of the issue selected randomly from a range of covers exclusive to this offering - including virgin variants, colored blanks, and more!" Dynamite Comics' Supernatural #1 first released in October 2025, and has since retold the adventures of the Winchester brothers as they take on small-town America in search of the most unsettling creatures. Supernatural takes place between the television series' first and second seasons, offering fans a bit more insight on Sam and Dean's whereabouts during the show's early years. Could Supernatural's Sam and Dean Winchester start a trend of iconic duos leading their own comic books? Upon its initial debut, Supernatural took The CW by storm and became a phenomenon in pop culture. The 2005 "monster-of-the-week" series quickly amassed a fandom of overwhelming scale, and Supernatural became more than just the five-season series it was intended to be. Helmed by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, Supernatural's prominence thrived across social media, especially on social media blogging platform Tumblr. In addition to Supernatural earning a comic book spin-off from Dynamite Comics, The CW previously did try to introduce a Supernatural spin-off television series that ran for a single season. Dynamite Comics' Supernatural can be purchased online or at comic book stores; Supernatural Valentine's Day Special 2026 #1 Blind Bag goes on sale on Feb. 4., 2026.
