ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Las Vegas Grand Prix

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams on race day in Nevada.

On a wild night in Las Vegas, with rain lashing down, it was Lando Norris who played the best hand, taking his seventh pole of the season, ahead of Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz. So what's on the cards for race day, strategy-wise? Let's take a look at the options…

The pre-race sims suggested a medium>hard one-stop was the fastest way to the chequered flag – but very few attempted it. All 20 drivers had saved two sets of hard tyres for the race, and were determined to use them.

The first nine over the line all ran a medium>hard>hard race, with Sergio Pérez in P10 mixing things up with a hard>medium>hard, in a bid to offset his strategy, and make gains from P15 on the grid.

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Las Vegas Grand Prix

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

Lando Norris mastered the wet conditions in Las Vegas to put his McLaren on pole position.

Lando Norris continued his hot streak of form to take pole position for the Las Vegas Grand Prix with a stunning effort.

The McLaren driver consistently pushed the envelope in Qualifying, lowering the benchmark each time it looked like he could be in trouble.

Norris' 1m 47.934s effort saw him register session-best times through sectors one and two, which gave him enough margin to go fastest despite a significant moment of oversteer at Turn 14.

Carlos Sainz believes Williams are "becoming stronger every race" after taking an impressive third-place in a wet Qualifying for the Las Vegas Grand Prix. It marks Sainz's second best Qualifying performance of the season after he started P2 in Azerbaijan – also on a high-speed, low-downforce circuit – before taking a podium in the race. "I'm always optimistic – dreaming is for free and I always try and think about myself doing well," said Sainz when asked if he expected such pace in the wet, having also avoided a penalty after being investigated for a potential unsafe rejoin in Q1. "On extreme wets I was really quick, on inters I knew maybe the others would catch up a bit, but happy with P3. Williams has proved to be best of the rest this season behind McLaren, Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes, with Sainz admitting that although they remain underdogs the team has become stronger across the campaign. I would have loved to give them pole today because that would have been a massive cheer then, but we were just not quite there." I'm surprised we were driving in that weather, to be honest. I think my lap was going to be good. I've been quick all weekend, and that's just how it is sometimes."</p>

ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Las Vegas Grand Prix

'I got away with it' - Norris on final sector error that almost cost him pole in Las Vegas

George Russell topped final practice at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with Max Verstappen second while his McLaren title rivals sat at the foot of the time sheet.

George Russell led the way in Free Practice 3 at the Las Vegas Grand Prix as McLaren hit technical trouble in the final running before Qualifying.

The session got under way on a drying track with drivers all utilizing the intermediate tyres in the early stages. As slick tyres became the order of the day, the times tumbled at a rate of knots, the fastest times coming as the chequered flag was taken.

Max Verstappen looked set to go to the top of the timesheets, but traffic forced him onto the wet surface with a trip into the run off the result, moments after Russell had set his session-best 1m 34.054s.

Alex Albon and Isack Hadjar continued to show pace in the top four, with Lewis Hamilton fifth.

Telemetry issues for Oscar Piastri and a separate problem for Lando Norris left the title-chasing McLaren pair 19th and 20th.

A wet track made for a difficult Qualifying at the Las Vegas Strip Circuit and Leclerc was amongst those to face struggles during the session, leaving him to reflect on how his car appears to find such conditions particularly tricky. “It's been like that since I… since I joined the team we've been struggling massively at finding the grip in those kinds of conditions. “It's hugely frustrating because it's probably been my biggest strength in the junior categories, and then… We are doing something wrong – I have no idea what that is because we've turned the car upside down. “We've had Lewis [Hamilton] and obviously Carlos [Sainz] before that also join from other teams that will tell us the feelings they had with the other cars. It's just extremely difficult to find the grip with our car, and very, very unpredictable as well which causes us to do a lot of mistakes. Asked if this means that he always expects a difficult time when faced with conditions like those seen in Las Vegas on Friday night, Leclerc responded: “You always go in the car with the most neutral mind as possible, without thinking too much about what could go. “I don't think about it, but as a matter of fact when you finish the sessions and do a step back on the overall picture in those conditions, it's not a bright one.”</p>
